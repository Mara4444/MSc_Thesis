Explanation:
Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%, or $60,000 (150% x $40,000). So, the new value of the house is $140,000 ($80,000 + $60,000). Since Josh bought the house for $80,000, his profit is $270,000 ($140,000 - $80,000)."

"Response: 30 cups
Explanation: To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can use the information provided in the question. We know that Wendi feeds her chickens 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per bird every day, so for a flock of 20 chickens, she would need to provide 60 cups of feed (3 x 20 = 60). Since Wendi already gave her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, she only needs to provide an additional 45 cups of feed in the final meal of the day (60 - 15 - 25 = 45). Therefore, the answer is 30 cups of feed."
"Response: 
Kylar needs to pay $84 for 16 glasses.
Explanation:
To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we can use the formula: Price = (Price of one glass x Number of glasses) / (1 + Discount percentage)^Number of glasses.
In this case, the price of one glass is $5, and the discount percentage is 60%. So, the formula becomes:
Price = ($5 x 16) / (1 + 0.6)^16
= $84
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $84 for 16 glasses."
"Response: 15 + 8 + 20 = 43
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which means that Toulouse has 2 x 8 = 16 sheep. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means that Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 16 + 80 + 20 = 43."
"Response: 168 minutes (or 2 hours and 48 minutes)
Explanation: To calculate the time it will take to download the file, we need to know how much of the file remains after the forced restart. Since 40% of the way through the download means that 40% of the remaining file size needs to be downloaded, we can use this information to estimate the time required for the download.
After the forced restart, Carla needs to start the download again from the beginning. So, the total time taken to download the file = Time taken before the force restart + Time taken after the force restart.
Before the force restart, Carla was able to download 2 GB per minute, so the time taken before the force restart = Total file size / Download rate = 200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes).
After the force restart, Carla needs to download the remaining portion of the file, which is equal to 200 GB - 40% of 200 GB = 130 GB. At her normal download rate of 2 GB/minute, the time taken after the force restart = Total file size / Download rate = 130 GB / 2 GB/min = 65 minutes (or 1 hour and 9 minutes).
Therefore, the total time taken to download the file = Time taken before the force restart + Time taken after the force restart = 100 minutes + 65 minutes = 168 minutes or 2 hours and 48 minutes."

"Response:  $630
Explanation: To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, you need to multiply her regular hourly rate by the number of hours she worked (up to 40 hours). So, in this case, that would be $10 x 40 = $400. Then, you need to add the amount she earned from working more than 40 hours at her overtime rate. In this case, if she worked 5 extra hours at $10/hour, that would be $50 ($10 x 5) + $400 = $630. Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $630."
Response: 210 downloads. Explanation: In the first month, there were 60 downloads. Since the number of downloads in the second month is three times that amount (60 x 3 = 180), and it reduces to 90 in the third month (60 + 30 = 90). Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three-month period is 60 + 180 + 90 = 210.

"Response: 40%. 
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
* 20% of the total students (20/100) enrolled in contemporary dance. This means that 80% of the total students did not enroll in contemporary dance (80/100).
* Of the remaining 80%, 25% enrolled in jazz dance (20/80 x 25%). So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is 20 x 25 = 500.
* Therefore, the total number of students who did not enrol in either contemporary or jazz dance is 80 - 50 = 30.
* The remaining students enrolled in hip-hop dance, which accounts for 100% of the total students - 30 = 70.
So, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 70 / 100 = 40%."

"Response: 12 dozen eggs (or 96 eggs)
Explanation: To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she makes each day by the number of days in 4 weeks. Since Claire makes 3 egg omelets per day, and there are 7 days in a week, she will make 21 egg omelets per week (3 x 7 = 21). Therefore, if it takes her 4 weeks to consume all those omelets, she will have consumed 84 egg omelets in total (21 x 4 = 84). Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Claire will have eaten 72 dozen eggs (or 96 eggs) in 4 weeks."

"Response: 23 liters
Explanation: To find out how much water is left after adding the orange drink to the pineapple drink, we need to subtract the amount of water that was spilled (one liter) from the total volume of the orange drink (ten liters). This gives us five liters of water from the orange drink that were not spilled. Since the pineapple drink is three- fifths water, this means that there are 5/3 = 16/5 = 3.2 liters of water in the pineapple drink. Therefore, the total volume of water in the remaining 24 liters is 5 + 3.2 = 8.2 liters."

"Response: 50
Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:
Gloria can either buy the boots or two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. This means the total cost of the high heels is $125 - 5 = $120.
Now, let's find out the cost of each pair of heels:
One pair costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, which is $66 ($33 x 2). So, the total cost of both pairs of heels is $120 + $66 = $186.
Since Gloria has to choose between the boots and the high heels, we can set up an equation based on this:
$120 (cost of high heels) > $50 (cost of boots)
Solving for $50, we get:
$120 / 2 = $50
Therefore, the boots cost $50."
Response: 18 years
"Response: 137
Explanation: Let's break down each friend's guess and calculate their average:
Friend 1 (80): This is an easy one - just multiply 80 by 4 to get 320. So, Friend 1's guess is 320 jelly beans.
Friend 2 (20 more than half of 80): Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more is 60. Therefore, Friend 2's guess is 92 jelly beans.
Friend 3 (25% more than the first one): To find 25% more than 320, we can multiply 320 by 1.25, which gives us 400. So, Friend 3's guess is 400 jelly beans.
Now, let's add up all these guesses: 320 + 92 + 400 = 812. Since this total is higher than the actual number of jelly beans in the jar (which is 137), we know that our friends have overestimated the number. Therefore, the average of their guesses is also greater than 137: (320 + 92 + 400) / 3 = 137.5. Round this value to the nearest whole number, and you get 137 as the average guess of Gunter's friends."

* Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so if Raymond has y jewels, Aaron has y + 5 jewels.
* The total number of jewels that Raymond and Aaron have is equal to 40 (given).

Using these statements, we can set up the following equation:
x - 2 = y + 5
Solving for x, we get:

So, after buying the video games, John had $35 left ($195 - $160 = $35). Therefore, John still has 4 Lego sets because $35 is not enough to buy 8 video games."

So the answer is 90(pieces)."
"Response: 476 g
Explanation: To determine how much you can eat from the bag of chips based on your remaining daily calorie target, we need to calculate how many calories are left in your target. Your daily calorie target is 2000, and you have already consumed 1800 calories (from other foods or activities). Therefore, there are 200 calories left in your target. Since each serving size of chips contains 250 calories, you can consume 200/250 = 0.8 servings worth of chips from the bag. Converting this amount to grams gives us 0.8 x 300 g = 240 g. So, you can eat up to 240 grams of chips from the bag based on your remaining daily calorie target."

Explanation: Based on the information provided, we can calculate the total time Meredith spent writing articles for each day as follows:
Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Tuesday: 3x (2/5) = 6 articles x 4 hours per article = 24 hours
Wednesday: 2x = 4 articles x 4 hours per article = 16 hours
Therefore, the total time Meredith spent writing articles in the three days was 20 + 24 + 16 = 60 hours."

Then, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes, which brought her total number of Post-it notes up to 16 + 80 = 96. This means that the package she purchased contained 16 Post-it notes (since 96 - 80 = 16)."
"Response:  $360
Explanation: Let's start by using the information given in the problem to find out how many red ties John bought. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, and he bought $200 worth of blue ties, we can conclude that he also bought $200 / 2 = $100 worth of red ties.
Now, let's use the fact that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties to find out how much one red tie costs. If a blue tie costs $40, then one red tie costs $40 x 1.5 = $60.
So, John spent $100 on red ties, and each red tie costs $60. Therefore, John spent a total of $100 + ($60 x number of red ties) = $100 + ($60 x 100) = $360 on ties."
"Response: 72 (or 6 x 12)
Explanation: To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained from the 4-foot length of wire, we need to divide the total length by the length of each piece. In this case, the length of each piece is 6 inches or 0.5 feet (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot). Therefore, we can calculate the number of pieces as follows:
Number of pieces = Total length / Length of each piece
= 4 ft / 0.5 ft
= 8 pieces
So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire with each piece being 6 inches long."

"Response: 3 hours
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (in this case, the speed), and t is the time. We know that Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour, so his rate is 10 miles/hour. We also know that he sails from 1 to 4 PM, which means he covers a distance of 5 hours (from 1 to 4 PM). Therefore, the total distance traveled by Tom's ship is:
d = rt = 10 miles/hour x 5 hours = 50 miles
Now, we are asked how long it takes Tom's ship to get back. Since Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, it will take him 6 / 6 = 1 hour to cover half of the distance back. Therefore, the total time it takes for Tom's ship to get back is:
time = distance / rate = 50 miles / 6 miles/hour = 8.33 hours
So, it will take Tom's ship approximately 8.33 hours to get back."

Explanation: To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it. We are given that Sophia needs to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank again, so if she had X gallons of gas left in her tank before driving 100 miles, then after driving 100 miles, she will have X - 4 gallons of gas left. Since the owner's manual says that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can set up the equation: X = 12 - (X - 4) where X is the initial amount of gas left in Sophia's tank. Solving for X, we get X = 8 gallons, or 80 miles. Therefore, Sophia can drive 80 miles on a single tank of gas."

"Response: 
Shiela will pay $45 per month for three months to own the five cellphones.
Explanation: To calculate how much Sheila will pay each month, we need to consider both the cost of the cellphone and the interest charge. The total cost of buying five cellphones is $750 (5 x $150). Since an interest rate of 2% has been specified, we can use the formula Interest = Principal x Rate x Time to determine the amount of interest she will have to pay over the 3-month period. In this case, the time is 3 months, so the interest would be: Interest = $750 x 2% x 3/12 = $45. Therefore, Sheila's total payment for owning these cellphones over 3 months would be $750 + $45 = $895."

Therefore, if the top level has a square footage of 16, then the second level (which is half the size of the top level) would have a square footage of 8. Similarly, the third level (which is half the size of the second level) would have a square footage of 4, and the fourth level (which is half the size of the third level) would have a square footage of 2. So, the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle is 8."
"Response: 36 bags (of dog food)  
Explanation: To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need during the first year, we must calculate the total number of cups of dog food that she needs and divide it by the number of cups per bag. The calculation is as follows: Total cups needed = 1 cup/day x 180 days + 2 cups/day x remaining days = 180 + 730 = 910 cups. Since there are 110 cups per bag, we can now divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per bag to get our answer: 910 / 110 = 8 bags. However, since Cecilia needs to feed the puppy for the entire first year, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 36 bags of dog food."

This gives us the number of stickers Charlie has left: 10 - 9 = 1 sticker. Next, we add the number of new stickers Charlie received as gifts (23) to the original number of stickers he had: 1 + 23 = 24 stickers. Finally, we subtract the number of stickers Charlie used to decorate a greeting card (28) from the total number of stickers he has: 24 - 28 = -4 stickers. Since negative numbers are not possible here, we know that Charlie must have 19 stickers left."

Since each hour-long episode is equivalent to 60 minutes, Frankie watched 420 minutes (7 hours x 60 minutes/hour) of TV in total. On Wednesday, since he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show, he must have watched at least 2 x 30 = 60 minutes of that show. Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is 60 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 2 episodes."

Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:
* ""Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition."" means that he is trying to find out how many cookies he made last year.
* ""He wants to make twice as many as he did last year"" means that he wants to double the number of cookies he made last year. So if he made x cookies last year, he will make 2x cookies this year.
* ""When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to."" means that instead of doubling the number of cookies from last year, he accidentally ended up with 15 more cookies than he intended. So now he has 2x + 15 = 3x cookies.
* ""He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool,"" means that he lost 5 cookies during the process of putting them out to cool. Now he has 3x - 5 = 2x - 5 = 180 cookies.
* ""Now has a total of 110 cookies"" means that after losing some cookies while putting them out to cool, he has 110 cookies left.
So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is 180 / 2 = 90 cookies."

Explanation: To calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice, we need to multiply the width and length of each roll-up. For Beatrice, her roll-ups were 24 wide and 2 times wider than that, or 48 wide. Her total number of roll-ups is then 48 x 24 = 1152. Similarly, for Marcell, his roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 times wider than that, or 42 wide. His total number of roll-ups is then 42 x 14 = 596. Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice is (1152 + 596) / 2 = 17.5."

"Response: 32
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, if Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, then Brittany's phone can hold 6/6 = 1 times as many photographs as Jamal's phone. Therefore, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is equal to 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs. Since the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 50 times less than the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold, there are 300 x 50 = 15000 birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. However, since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, there must be 1800 - 15000 = -14984 birds in his photograph of ducks at the zoo. This is impossible, so we conclude that there must be exactly 32 birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo."

Response: 30 elves remain. Explanation: Let X be the number of elves who remained after 10 elves quit. Since 10 elves quit after kids kicked their shins, we can write an equation: X = 60 - (10 x 2/3). Substituting this equation into the original problem statement, we get: Number of elves left = 60 - (10 x 2/3) = 60 - 4 = 56 elves remain.

* ""If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made..."" This means that after losing 5 video games, Brian now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
* So, Bobby has 15 - 5 = 10 video games.
Therefore, the answer is 10."

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* 27 unicorns are left in the world (total)
* 1/3 of these unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands (i.e., 9 unicorns)
* 2/3 of the Scottish unicorns are female (i.e., 6 out of 9 unicorns)

Now, we can use the above information to calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns:
Female Scottish unicorns = Number of Scottish unicorns x Percentage of females among Scottish unicorns
= 9 x 0.66
= 6

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."

Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how much time it takes for Mark to complete each test. We know that Mark completes 5 questions per hour, so if he has x hours to complete the test, he will complete 5x questions.
For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete it, so he will complete 5(8) = 40 questions. Since there were 75 questions in total, Mark left 35 questions incomplete (75 - 40).
For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete it, so he will complete 5(6) = 30 questions. Since there were 100 questions in total, Mark left 70 questions incomplete (100 - 30)."

"Response: 57.60
Explanation: To calculate the total cost of each item with a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to multiply the original price by 1.10 (10% of $10). Then, add the result to the original price to get the final cost. Here are the calculations for each item:

* Milk: $2 x 1.10 = $2.20 + $2 = $4.20
* Eggs: $3 x 1.10 = $3.30 + $3 = $6.30
* Light Bulbs: $3 x 1.10 = $3.30 + $3 = $6.60
* Cups: $3 x 1.10 = $3.30 + $3 = $6.60
* Roach Traps: $4 x 1.10 = $4.40 + $4 = $8.40

Adding up these amounts gives us a total cost of $57.60 ($4.20 + $6.30 + $6.60 + $8.40) including the 10% tax on non-food items."

Explanation: The total number of bees that left the hive during the entire day can be calculated by adding up the number of bees that left in each of the six-hour periods:

* In the first 6 hours, 30 bees left the hive.
* In the second 6 hours, half of the original number (i.e., 15 bees) returned to the hive.
* Therefore, the total number of bees that left the hive during the day = 30 + (15 x 2) = 45 bees.
So, Debra saw 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."

"Response: 15 minutes
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question about the distance between Steve's house and the school (3 miles) and Tim's house and the school (2 miles). We also know that Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute and Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute.
To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. For Steve, the time it takes to cover 3 miles is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 440 ft/minute = 7 minutes
For Tim, the time it takes to cover 2 miles is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 264 ft/minute = 8 minutes
Since Steve lives farther away than Tim, he will take longer to complete the race. Therefore, the winner will arrive at their house after the loser has finished the race. In this case, the winner will arrive at their house 7 + 8 = 15 minutes after the start of the race."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Finn initially watched 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, he saw 6 of them come out of hiding from under a lily pad, which means they are no longer hidden and are now visible to Finn. Therefore, the number of tadpoles that Finn can see in the pond is 11 - 6 = 5. Next, he sees 2 of them hide under a rock, which means there are only 5 tadpoles left in plain sight for Finn to observe. So, the final answer is 5 + 2 (the two tadpoles that hid under the rock) = 3."

Explanation: Let's break down what we know about each of their catches:
Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. So, his total catch is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. And finally, he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. Therefore, Locsin's total catch is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.
So, in total, Anakin caught 19 fish, and Locsin caught 13 fish."
Response:  After 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost approximately $48.50. This is calculated by using the formula: New Price = Original Price x (1 + Percentage Increase)^Number of Months. In this case, the original price was $20, the percentage increase is 20%, and the number of months is 36. Therefore, the new price is $20 x (1 + 0.20)^36 = $48.50.

Explanation: The original number of pink flamingos was 18. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one-third of them (which is equal to 6) and repainted them white. So, at that point, there were 18 - 6 = 12 white flamingos left. Then, on Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos, bringing the total number of pink flamingos to 36. Therefore, the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday is 36 - 6 = 30."

Carl ate a sandwich with 2 slices of cheese every day for lunch, so he used 2 x 5 = 10 slices of cheese from Monday to Friday.
He had cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used an additional 3 x 1 = 3 slices of cheese from Monday to Wednesday.
He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that required 8 slices of cheese.
Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used throughout the week was 10 + 3 + 8 = 16 slices."

Explanation: To calculate Brinley's average for all six tests, we subtract her lowest score (71) from each of the other scores, then add up those results:

89 - 71 = 18
92 - 71 = 21
100 - 71 = 29
86 - 71 = 15

Adding these amounts together gives us Brinley's total score for all six tests: 18 + 21 + 29 + 15 = 93. Therefore, if Brinley gets a score of 85 on the sixth test, her new average will be 93."
"Response: 1875 km
Explanation: To calculate the total distance traveled by Michael, we need to find the average distance traveled per day during each of the periods given in the question.

During the first period (4 weeks), Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week, which means he covered a total distance of:
5 x 25 km/day = 125 km/week
Since there are 4 weeks in this period, the total distance traveled is:
125 km/week x 4 weeks = 500 km

During the second period (3 weeks), Michael rode his bike 2 times a week, and he covered a total distance of:
2 x 60 km/day = 120 km/week
Again, since there are 3 weeks in this period, the total distance traveled is:
120 km/week x 3 weeks = 360 km

Adding up the distances traveled during both periods gives us the total distance traveled by Michael:
500 km + 360 km = 860 km
Therefore, the answer is 860 km."

"Response: 10
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so they lay 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week.
White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so they lay 5 x 7 = 35 eggs per week.
Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, which means he collects 42 x 7 = 294 eggs per week.
Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is greater than the number of red chickens by 2 (the difference between 35 and 21). Therefore, there are 35 - 2 = 33 red chickens."

"Response: 8 gallons
Explanation: Let's start by using the information given in the question to set up an equation. Let x be the amount of water in the small pool initially (in gallons). Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool initially, the amount of water in the big pool was 2x gallons. After 4 minutes, the big pool lost 4 gallons of water due to leaks, so its new amount of water is 2x - 4 gallons. The question states that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so the amount of water in the small pool after 4 minutes is (2x - 4) / 4 = 8 gallons."

Explanation: To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we need to calculate the total cost of the items divided by her hourly wage. The total cost of the shoes and belt is $352 ($320 + $32). Dividing this amount by her hourly wage of $8 gives us the number of hours she needs to work: $352 / $8 = 44 hours. Since there are 40 hours in a week, we round up to 40 hours."
"Response: 
Janeth's remaining balance after making 12 monthly payments of $165 each would be $1378. To calculate this, you can use the formula:
Remaining Balance = Initial Amount x (1 - (Monthly Payment / Total Amount))^Number of Months
In this case, the initial amount was $2000, the monthly payment was $165, and the total number of months was 12. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:
Remaining Balance = $2000 x (1 - ($165/$2000)^12) = $1378
Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after making 12 monthly payments of $165 each would be $1378."

"Response: 60
Explanation: To determine the number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the amount of ink available after mixing all the empty pens. Since each pen has 1/5th of an ink, mixing 5 pens will give us 5 x 1/5 = 2 ounces of ink. This is enough to fill one full pen. Therefore, if Ram mixes all 25 pens, he will get 25 x 1/5 = 5 complete pens. So, Ram gets to have 5 + 5 = 10 pens in total."

* After the meeting, 30% of the students (300) went out through exit A.
* Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 (420) went out through exit B.
* So, the total number of students who went out through exits A and B is 300 + 420 = 720.
* Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 720 - 420 = 300.

So, the final answer is 267 students went out through exit C."

If John has 54 candies, then we can set up an equation based on the above information:
7x = 54 (James' candies)
2x = 54 (John's candies)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 38 (Robert's candies)
Now, we know that James has 7x = 49 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the difference between their number of candies is:
Number of candies held by James - Number of candies held by Robert = 49
So, John has 2x = 78 more candies than James."

Explanation:
Mike is a penpal with 5 people and sends out 2 letters per week to each person. Since there are 5 people, he has to write a total of 10 letters (2 x 5 = 10). Let's assume it takes him an hour to write one letter. Therefore, he spends 10 hours per week writing letters. However, since he stopped being pen pals with two people, he now only needs to write 3 letters per week for those remaining three people. So, he spends another 3 hours per week writing to those three people, making his total weekly time spent writing 13 hours (10 + 3 = 13)."
"Response: 700 minutes (or 11 hours and 20 minutes)
Explanation: Let's break down how much time Jason has used so far based on the information provided in the question:

* Daily calls with his boss = 15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes
* Extra minutes called to other people = 300 minutes

Total minutes used so far = 450 + 300 = 750 minutes
Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason has 750 / 30 = 25 minutes left for the rest of the month.
Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us an answer of 30 minutes or 1 hour and 20 minutes."

Explanation: Let's break down what we know about each character based on the information provided in the question:
Griffin started with 24 French fries.
Kyle took 5 of Griffin's fries, leaving him with 19 (24 - 5 = 19).
Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so he took 18 fries (twice 5 = 18).
Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which means she gave him at least 5 fries (a handful is typically considered to be around 5-6 items). So now Griffin has 19 + 5 = 24 fries.
Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle took, so he took 12 fries (3 < 5 = 12).
Now let's add up all these amounts:
19 + 18 + 5 + 12 = 54
So Ginger gave Griffin 54 fries in total. Therefore, the answer is 54."

Explanation:  First calculate how many hours of makeup application are needed during the 5-week duration of the movie.  6 hours/day x 4 days/week = 24 hours/week.  Multiply this by 5 weeks = 120 hours of makeup application.  Next, multiply the total number of hours by the hourly rate charged by the makeup artist: $250/hour x 120 hours = $30,000.  Finally, subtract the 10% discount given by the makeup artist: $30,000 - ($30,000 x 10%) = $27,000."
