"Response:  To calculate how much money Janet earns from selling eggs at the farmer's market, we need to know how many eggs she sells and at what price. Let's assume that she sells all 16 eggs every day. If she sells each egg for $2, then her daily income would be:  

16 x $2 = $32 per day  
Since she sells 3 eggs for breakfast and nongs 4 eggs as muffins, she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left to sell at the market. Therefore, her daily income from selling eggs at the market is:  

$32 - $6 (breakfast and muffins) = $26 per day  
So, Janet earns $26 per day from selling eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  To make one piece of cheongsam requires 3.5 meters of fabric in total (2 meters for the skirt and 1.5 meters for the sleeves). Therefore, to make two pieces of cheongsam, we need 7 meters of fabric in total (2 x 3.5 meters). Since the fabric is divided into two parts - blue and white, we can calculate as follows: Blue part: 2 meters x 2 = 4 meters White part: 1.5 meters x 2 = 3 meters Total length of fabric required: 4 + 3 = 7 meters
Response:  If Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 to renovate it, then he increased its value by 150%. To find out how much profit he made, we can use the formula: Profit = (Selling Price - Cost) x 100 / Cost. In this case, the selling price of the house is $150,000 (150% increase from $80,000), so the profit would be: Profit = ($150,000 - $80,000) x 100 / $80,000 = 87.5%. Therefore, Josh made an 87.5% profit on his investment.

"Response:  To determine how much feed Wendi needs to give her 20 chickens in the last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed required for each meal and then multiply it by the number of meals she gives to her chickens per day. Let's break down the information given in the question:  
* Each chicken eats 3 bowls of food per meal (ba chén).  
* The first meal has 15 bowls of food (15 x 3 = 45 bowls).  
* The second meal has 25 bowls of food (25 x 3 = 75 bowls).  
Total amount of feed required for both meals = 45 + 75 = 120 bowls. Since Wendi gives two meals per day, she needs to provide 120 bowls / 2 meals = 60 bowls per meal. Therefore, Wendi needs to give her 20 chickens 60 bowls of feed in the last meal of the day."
Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for the 16 bottles of wine, we need to calculate the total cost of the first 16 bottles and then subtract the discounted price of the second 16 bottles.

Response:  To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from his lychee trees, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the trees, as well as the annual revenue they will generate. Total Cost = Planting Cost x Number of Years = 90 dollars x (Number of Years + 3) = 90 dollars x (x + 3) Where x is the number of years it takes for Carlos to start making a profit. We know that each year, the trees will produce 7 lychees, and each lychee can be sold for 1.5 dollars. Therefore, the annual revenue generated by the trees is: Annual Revenue = Number of Lychees x Price per Lychee = 7 x 1.5 dollars = 10.5 dollars per year Now we can set up an equation to solve for x: Equation: 90 dollars x (x + 3) = 10.5 dollars x (1 + 3) Solving for x, we get: x = 6 years It will take Carlos 6 years to start making a profit from his lychee trees.

"Response:  To determine how far away from the dragon's flame Polly can stand and still hit it with her golden spear when holding the precious stone, we need to calculate the distance at which the dragon's flame will reach based on its height (1000 feet) and the range of Polly's spear (400 feet). Let X be the distance at which the dragon's flame will reach. We know that:

X = 1000 - 400 = 600 feet

Now, if Polly is standing at a distance of X + 3\*400 = 600 + 3\*400 = 2400 feet from the dragon's flame, she can still hit it with her golden spear. Therefore, the answer is 2400 feet."
Response:  There were 14 pieces of bread left over after all the guests had finished eating. To find out how many pieces each guest took, we can divide the number of leftover pieces by the number of guests: 14 / 5 = 2.8 (since there were 5 guests). Since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of bread, we round down to 2 pieces per guest. Therefore, each guest took 2 pieces of bread.
"Response:  To calculate how many grams of potato chips (in this case, 300g) you can eat while still staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories if you have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to use the following formula: Total Daily Caloric Intake - Previous Caloric Consumption = Remaining Caloric Allowance.  So, in this case:  

Total Daily Caloric Intake = 2000 calories  
Previous Caloric Consumption = 1800 calories  
Remaining Caloric Allowance = Total Daily Caloric Intake - Previous Caloric Consumption  
= 2000 - 1800  
= 200 calories  
Now, let's convert the remaining caloric allowance from calories to grams of potato chips:  
1 gram of potato chips contains approximately 4 calories  
Therefore,  
200 calories / 4 calories per gram = 50 grams of potato chips  
So, based on the information provided, you can eat up to 50 grams of potato chips while still staying within your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories if you have already consumed 1800 calories."
"Response:  To find the profit of making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate the total cost of materials and labor first. The cost of one pound of wax is $10.00, and with 10 wicks per pound, the cost of each wick is $1.00 (10/1). Therefore, the total cost of materials for 20 candles is:  
Total Cost = 20 x ($10.00 + $1.00) = $200.00  
Since each candle can be sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:  
Total Revenue = 20 x $2.00 = $40.00  
Now, let's subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit:  
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $40.00 - $200.00 = -$160.00  
So, if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles, he will incur a loss of $160.00."
Response:  To calculate the total number of hours that Meredith spent writing her blog posts over three days, we need to first determine how many hours she spent writing each day. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  Day 1 (Monday): 5 blog posts x 4 hours per post = 20 hours  Day 2 (Tuesday): 2/5 more blog posts than Monday x 4 hours per post = 8 hours (since there were 2/5 more posts, we multiply by 2/5) + 5 blog posts x 4 hours per post = 16 hours Total for Day 2 = 8 + 16 = 24 hours Day 3 (Wednesday): 2 times as many blog posts as Tuesday x 4 hours per post = 8 hours (since there were twice as many posts, we multiply by 2) + 5 blog posts x 4 hours per post = 20 hours Total for Day 3 = 8 + 20 = 28 hours Therefore, Meredith spent a total of: 20 hours + 24 hours + 28 hours = 72 hours over the three days.
"Response:  If Candice has 23 remaining sticky notes and she used 80 to label each of the 220 cups of coffee differently, then the number of sticky notes in the package that Candice bought is:  
23 (remaining) = 80 (used) x 220 (cups of coffee) / 23 (number of sticky notes per cup)  
Simplifying, we get:  
23 = 16000 / 23  
Solving for the numerator, we get:  
16000 = 23 x 700  
Therefore, there are 700 sticky notes in the package that Candice bought."
Response:  To find out how much money John spent on red candles, we need to know that he spent 50% more on red candles than on blue ones. So if he spent $40 per blue candle, he spent $60 per red candle (50% more). Since he bought 200 blue candles, he also bought 200/2 = 100 red candles. Therefore, John spent $40 x 200 = $8,000 on blue candles and $60 x 100 = $6,000 on red candles, for a total of $8,000 + $6,000 = $14,000.

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces  
Therefore, Tracy has 8 pieces of string."
Response:  To find out how many empty apartments there are in the building, we need to calculate the total number of apartments and then subtract the number that is currently occupied. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:  There are 15 floors in the building. Each floor has 8 apartments. 3/4 of the building is occupied (this means that 3/4 of the floors are occupied). Now let's do some calculations: Total number of floors = 15 Number of apartments per floor = 8 Total number of apartments = 15 x 8 = 120 Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied apartments can be calculated as follows: Number of occupied apartments = 3/4 x 120 = 90 So, the number of empty apartments in the building is: Number of empty apartments = 120 - 90 = 30 Therefore, there are 30 empty apartments in the building.

Let's start with the weight of his comics: 30 cuốn x 1/4 pound/cuốn = 7 1/2 pounds Now let's calculate the weight of his toys: 7 1/2 pounds / 1/2 pound/cuốn = 15 cuốn So, Uriah needs 15 cuốn (or 15 x 1/2 pound = 7 1/2 pounds) of toys to bring down the overall weight of his belongings to 5 kg.
"Response:  To find out how much money the workshop earned on Thursday when they repaired more cars and did not repair any truck tires, we need to calculate the total amount of money earned from repairing cars and then subtract the amount of money spent on repairing truck tires. Let's start by calculating the total amount of money earned from repairing cars:  

Total amount of money earned from repairing cars = Number of cars repaired x Price per car  
= 12 x $40  
= $480  
Now let's calculate the total amount of money spent on repairing truck tires:  
Total amount of money spent on repairing truck tires = Number of truck tires repaired x Price per truck tire  
= 6 x $60  
= $360  
Now let's subtract the amount of money spent on repairing truck tires from the total amount of money earned from repairing cars:

"Response:  The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is calculated as follows:

Maximum weight of the truck = 3755 pounds (including the driver and the empty truck)
Weight of one box = 15 pounds
Total weight of all boxes = Number of boxes x Weight of one box

To avoid exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we need to ensure that the total weight of all boxes does not exceed 5000 pounds. Therefore, we set up the following equation:

Number of boxes x 15 pounds = 5000 pounds

Solving for the number of boxes, we get:

Number of boxes = 5000 / 15 pounds = 333 boxes

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 333 boxes."

"Response:  To calculate the total amount of money that Aleena has paid for her online streaming service at the end of the year, we need to first determine the amount she paid in the first half of the year and then calculate the discount she received in the second half of the year. Let's assume that the monthly subscription fee is $140.

For the first six months (January to June), Aleena paid $140 x 6 = $840.

For the next six months (July to December), she paid $140 x 6 = $840 x 0.9 = $752, since she received a 10% discount.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for her online streaming service at the end of the year is:
$840 + $752 = $1,592."
Response:  To determine how many miles Sophia can drive with one tank of gas, we need to know her car's fuel efficiency and the amount of gas she has left in her tank. Let's assume that Sophia's car gets an average fuel economy of 25 miles per gallon (mpg). If she has 4 gallons of gas left in her tank, she can drive:  4 gallons / 25 mpg = 160 miles   Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 160 miles with one tank of gas.
Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends watching TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to first calculate how much time he spends on these activities each week. We know that he watches TV for 2 hours every day, so he spends 2 x 7 = 14 hours per week watching TV. He also reads for half of his free time, which is 12 hours per week (since he has 16 hours of free time). Therefore, Jim spends a total of 14 + 12 = 26 hours per week on these activities. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Jim spends a total of 26 x 4 = 104 hours watching TV and reading in a month.

"Response:  To calculate how much money Judy earns in one week, we need to know how many classes she teaches each day and how many students are in each class. Let's assume that she teaches 5 classes per day, with 15 students in each class, for a total of 75 students per day (5 x 15 = 75). If she teaches 8 classes on Saturdays, with the same number of students, she earns an additional $120 per Saturday ($15 x 8 = $120). Therefore, her weekly income is:  
Weekly Income = Daily Income x Number of Days per Week + Saturday Income  
= 75 x 5 x $15 + $120  
= $7,500 + $120  
= $7,620 per week."

Response:  To calculate how much Sheila will pay each month for 3 months, we need to first find out the total amount she needs to pay for all 3 months. Total Amount = Number of units x Price per unit x Time period (in this case, 3 months) Total Amount = 3 x $150 x 3 = $9,000 Since the interest rate is 2%, we can calculate the monthly interest as follows: Monthly Interest = Total Amount x Rate (interest rate/100) Monthly Interest = $9,000 x 2/100 = $180 Now that we have the total amount and the monthly interest, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows: Monthly Payment = Total Amount + Monthly Interest Monthly Payment = $9,000 + $180 = $9,180 So, Sheila will pay $9,180 over 3 months, or $3,060 per month.

"Response:  To calculate how much money Christina will spend on party favors, we need to first determine how many guests she expects to have at her party. Since 1/4 of the guests may not show up, we can assume that 80% (16 / 0.8) of the invited guests will attend the party. Therefore, the number of attending guests is: 

80% x 16 = 12.8 (round down to 12)

Since each party favor costs $2, the total amount Christina needs to spend on party favors is:

12 x $2 = $24

"Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds before changing his diet and exercise routine, and after making those changes, he can now run the same distance in 35 seconds (a 10% improvement), then we can calculate how long it would take Gerald to run 400 meters based on his improved performance. Let's assume that Gerald's new time is x seconds. We know that Lee's old time was 38 seconds, so we can set up the equation:

x = 38 + (10/100) \* 38 = 38 + 3.8 = 41.8

Therefore, if Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds before improving his diet and exercise routine, and after making those changes, he can now run the same distance in 35 seconds, then Gerald can run 400 meters in approximately 41.8 seconds with his improved performance."
"Response:  Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of rabbits and ""y"" to represent the number of cats and dogs. According to the problem, we know that x is less than 12 and y = 2(60) = 120. So we can write an equation based on this information: x + y = 120 + x. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 120 = 120. Subtracting 120 from both sides gives us: 2x = 0. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 0. Therefore, there are no rabbits in the neighborhood."
"Response:  Let's use ""x"" to represent the number of girls who do not participate in the survey team. We know that 2/3 of the students are female, so the number of females is 2/3 x 200 = 133. Since 2/5 of the students are male, the number of males is 2/5 x 200 = 40. Therefore, the total number of students in the survey team is 133 + 40 = 173. So, there are 27 (173 - 200) girls who do not participate in the survey team."

Response:  To calculate how long it would take for fog to cover the entire city, we need to know the speed of the fog and the distance of the city from the coast. Let's assume that the fog moves at a constant speed of 3 miles per hour (mph). The city is located 42 miles inland from the coast, so it will take the fog approximately 14 hours to reach the city (42 miles / 3 mph = 14 hours). Once the fog reaches the city, it will take an additional 10 minutes to cover the entire city, since it covers 3 miles every hour. Therefore, the total time it takes for the fog to cover the entire city is 14 hours + 10 minutes = 14 hours and 40 minutes.

* The distance from the shore to the boat is 64 seconds (or 64 seconds). 
* The boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it travels (or 2/10 = 0.2 liters/foot). 

Now we can calculate how much water the boat has taken in: 

* Distance traveled by the boat = Total time taken x Speed of the boat 
= 64 seconds x 1.25 feet/second 
= 80 feet (rounded to the nearest foot) 

Therefore, the boat has taken in 80 x 0.2 = 16 liters of water."

"Response:  The number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photo of the zoo is 360. Explanation:  To find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photo, we need to know how many photos Jamal has and how many ducks are in each photo. According to the problem, Jamal has 1800 photos, and each photo contains 6 times as many ducks as Brittany's phone can hold. Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times as many ducks as there are in Jamal's photo, we can set up the following equation:  
Let x be the number of ducks in Jamal's photo. Then, the number of ducks in Brittany's photo would be 50x.  We know that Brittany's phone can hold 1800 photos, so the total number of ducks in all of Brittany's photos would be 1800 x 50 = 90,000 ducks.  Now, we can use the fact that Jamal's photo contains 6 times as many ducks as Brittany's photo to find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photo:  
6 x 90,000 = 540,000 ducks.  However, this is not the correct answer because it exceeds the maximum number of ducks that can be seen in any one photo (which is 360). Therefore, the correct answer is:  
360 ducks."

Let's assume that there were 20 vehicles present at the port on Day 1 (as mentioned in the problem statement). On Day 2, if 30 vehicles are added, then the total number of vehicles at the port on Day 2 would be:  
Total Vehicles on Day 2 = 20 + 30 = 50 vehicles. Since each container can hold 5 vehicles, we can calculate the number of containers needed as follows: Number of Containers = Total Vehicles / Capacity per Container Number of Containers = 50 / 5 = 10 containers. Therefore, 10 containers were imported on Day 2."
Response:  To find out how much money Adrien and Lylah will receive four years later, we need to calculate their salaries for each year separately.  Year 1: Adrien earns $40,000 more than Lylah, so Lylah's salary is $60,000 (30% higher than $48,000). Therefore, Adrien's salary is $40,000 + $60,000 = $100,000.  Year 2: Both Adrien and Lylah get a 10% raise, so their new salaries are:  Adrien: $100,000 x 1.10 = $110,000  Lylah: $60,000 x 1.10 = $66,000  Year 3: Again, both Adrien and Lylah get a 10% raise, so their new salaries are:  Adrien: $110,000 x 1.10 = $121,000  Lylah: $66,000 x 1.10 = $72,600  Year 4: Adrien gets a 40% raise, while Lylah only gets a 10% raise, so their new salaries are:  Adrien: $121,000 x 1.40 = $169,200  Lylah: $72,600 x 1.10 = $80,520  Total amount earned by Adrien over four years: $100,000 + $110,000 + $121,000 + $169,200 = $490,200  Total amount earned by Lylah over four years: $60,000 + $66,000 + $72,600 + $80,520 = $389,120

"Response:  If there is a 10% tax for all non-food items, then the cost of each item would be: 

* Sữa: $2 x 1.10 = $2.20
* Trứng: $3 x 1.10 = $3.30
* Bóng đèn: $3 x 1.10 = $3.30
* Ly: $3 x 1.10 = $3.30
* Bẫy gián: $4 x 1.10 = $4.40

So, the total cost with the 10% tax would be: $2.20 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $16.50."
Response:  To calculate the profit of Lucas per week, we need to subtract the total cost from the total revenue. Total revenue = 3 x $2 (for each customer) + 5 x $5 (for each package) = $6 + $25 = $31 Total cost = 3 x $2 (for each customer) + 5 x $5 (for each package) = $6 + $25 = $31 Therefore, the profit of Lucas per week is: Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $31 - $31 = $0 So, Lucas will not make any profit per week.
"Response:  To find out how many coconuts John can harvest in one year, we need to multiply the number of coconuts per hectare by the number of hectares he has and then divide that result by the time it takes him to harvest each batch. So, if John has 10 hectares of land with 100 coconuts per hectare, and he can harvest every 3 months (or 3 x 4 = 12 times a year), then he can harvest:  
10 hectares x 100 coconuts/hectare = 1,000 coconuts/hectare x 10 hectares = 10,000 coconuts/year  
10,000 coconuts/year / 12 harvests/year = 833 coconuts/harvest"

"Response:  To find out how long it will take for Tim to reach home if he skates with a speed of 264 feet per minute, we need to first convert his speed from feet per minute to hours. We can do this by dividing his speed in feet per minute by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 

Tim's speed in hours = 264 feet/minute / 60 = 4.4 hours

Now, we know that Steve is traveling at a speed of 440 feet per minute, so we can use the same method to calculate how long it will take him to reach home.

Steve's speed in hours = 440 feet/minute / 60 = 7.33 hours

Since Steve lives three miles away and Tim lives two miles away, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (in this case, the speed), and t is the time, to calculate the time it will take each of them to reach home.

For Steve:
d = 3 miles x 7.33 hours / 60 = 2.15 hours

For Tim:
d = 2 miles x 4.4 hours / 60 = 1.7 hours

Therefore, based on the information given, Steve will arrive home before Tim. Specifically, Steve will arrive home in approximately 2.15 hours, while Tim will arrive home in approximately 1.7 hours."

Response:  To determine how many kilograms of bananas are needed for two months, we need to calculate the total weight of bananas required based on the number of bananas each species needs per month and then multiply it by two. Let's break down the information given in the problem:  * The number of bananas needed per month for each species is as follows: o Khỉ: 200 quả (200 x 0.5 kg/quả = 100 kg) o Khỉ đột: 400 quả (400 x 0.5 kg/quả = 200 kg) o Khỉ trâu: 100 quả (100 x 0.5 kg/quả = 50 kg) Total weight of bananas needed per month: 350 kg (100 + 200 + 50) To get the total weight of bananas needed for two months, we simply multiply the total weight per month by two: 350 kg x 2 = 700 kg Therefore, the total amount of bananas needed for two months is 700 kilograms.
"Response:  To determine who wins this race, we need to calculate how far each person has run based on their number of laps and the distance of each lap. Let's start with Blake's runs:  Since Blake ran 15 times around the track (15 x 100 meters = 1500 meters), she covered a total distance of 1500 meters. Now let's look at Kelly's runs:  Kelly ran once around the track (1 x 100 meters = 100 meters) and then did 34 ""laps"" of 40 yards each (34 x 40 meters = 1360 meters). So in total, Kelly ran 100 + 1360 = 1460 meters. Therefore, Kelly ran farther than Blake by 1460 - 1500 = 40 meters."

Response:  If Jackie chooses to outsource her tax preparation, she will need to pay $90 for the service. However, if she decides to prepare her own taxes, she will save $35 per hour of work (3 hours x $35 per hour = $105). Therefore, the difference between the two options is $90 - $105 = $15. So, Jackie should choose to outsource her tax preparation if she values her time at less than $15 per hour.
"Response:  To find out how much money Elvira will have left over for clothes after buying the computer and its accessories, we need to subtract the total cost of the items she purchased from her budget of 1500 euros. Let's do this calculation step by step:

Total cost of the items purchased = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 euros

Subtracting the total cost from the budget:

1500 - 1423 = 77 euros

Therefore, Elvira will have 77 euros left over for clothes."

Response:  To find out how many miles Pancho runs in one week, we need to know how far he runs each day and how many days are in a week. Let's start by converting kilometers to miles: 1 kilometer = 0.6214 miles. Since Pancho runs 30 kilometers per day, that's equivalent to: 30 km x 0.6214 mi/km = 18.64 miles per day Now, let's calculate the total distance Pancho runs in one week: 18.64 miles/day x 7 days = 129.58 miles per week But wait! We said that Pancho only runs 10 miles on the weekends. So, we need to subtract that from our total: 129.58 - 10 = 119.58 miles per week Therefore, Pancho runs approximately 119.58 miles in one week.
Response:  To find out how much each set of uniforms costs in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up. Let's start by calculating the cost of each item:  Chiếc mũ = $25  Chiếc áo khoác = $75 (3 x $25) Quần = $18.75 (average of $25 and $75) Total cost per set = $25 + $75 + $18.75 = $198.75 Therefore, each set of uniforms costs $198.75.
Response:  To find the total number of legs, we need to add up the number of legs for each group of animals. For the spiders, there are 80 con nhện with 8 chân mỗi con, so the total number of legs is 80 x 8 = 640 legs. For the beetles, there are 90 con côn trùng with 6 chân mỗi con, so the total number of legs is 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, for the rare insects, there are 3 loài động vật không xương sống with 10 chân mỗi con, so the total number of legs is 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.
Response:  The total age of the four birds is 8 + 32 + (3 x 2) = 8 + 32 + 6 = 56 years old.
"Response:  To calculate how much Jessica will pay in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, we need to first calculate the total amount of money she owes for each type of debt.  For the student loan, the minimum monthly payment is $300, so the annual payment would be:  
$300 x 12 = $3600 per year  For the credit card, the minimum monthly payment is $200, so the annual payment would be:  
$200 x 12 = $2400 per year  For the mortgage, the minimum monthly payment is $500, so the annual payment would be:  
$500 x 12 = $6000 per year  If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, she will pay:  
For the student loan: $3600 x 1.5 = $5400 per year  For the credit card: $2400 x 1.5 = $3600 per year  For the mortgage: $6000 x 1.5 = $9000 per year  Therefore, Jessica's total annual payment if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment for all three debts would be:  
$5400 + $3600 + $9000 = $18000 per year"
Response:  To prepare 60 carrots for his family's big party, Billy will spend 30 minutes (1 minute x 60 carrots) lumberjacking and 10 seconds (5 seconds x 60 carrots) cutting each carrot. Therefore, he will spend a total of 30 minutes + 10 seconds = 40 minutes preparing all the carrots.
Response:  To find out how much money Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to subtract their profit from their total revenue. Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) COGS = Price of Lemon Juice x Quantity of Lemon Juice sold + Price of Water x Quantity of Water sold Since they sell each liter of lemon juice for $0.50 and each gallon contains 8 liters, they sell 8 liters x $0.50 = $4 per gallon of lemon juice. They also sell water at $2 per gallon. Therefore, COGS = $4 + $2 = $6 per gallon. If they make a profit of $25, then their total revenue must be at least $25 + $6 = $31 per gallon. So, they spend $31 - $6 = $25 on lemons.
"Response:  Let's use ""C"" to represent the number of girls in the Chinese team. Since there are 60 boys in the Chinese team, we know that C + 60 = 240 (total number of people in the Asian team). Moreover, we know that 80 of the people in the Asian team are Japanese, so the number of Japanese people is 80. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: C + 60 = 240 - 80. Solving for C, we get C = 120. So, there are 120 girls in the Chinese team."
"Response:  If Zaid earns $6000 per month and spends $1500 on rent, $500 on gas for his car, and donates $1000 to charity, he will have $3000 left after all of these expenses. This can be calculated as follows:

Income: $6000

Expenses:

* Rent: $1500
* Gas: $500
* Charity: $1000

Total Expenses: $3000

Remaining Income: $6000 - $3000 = $3000"
"Response:  If Bo has 40 con cua and each of her friends (Rani and Monic) have different numbers of con cua, then the total number of con cua that they all have together is:

Total = Bo's con cua + Rani's con cua + Monic's con cua
= 40 + x + y
where x is the number of con cua that Rani has and y is the number of con cua that Monic has.
We know that Rani has more than Monic, so we can write:
x > y
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
Total = 40 + x + y
= 40 + x + (less than x)
= 40 + x - x
= 3x
Therefore, the total number of con cua that Bo and her two friends have together is 3 times the number of con cua that Rani has."
Response:  To find out how much Lloyd earned in two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them up.  Week 1: Lloyd worked for 5 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned $50.

= 60 - (3/4) x 80
= 60 - 60
= 0

Therefore, the loser received no votes."
Response:  To determine how many red roses Fred needs to deliver before 5 pm to keep Sandra satisfied, we need to calculate the total number of flowers she ordered and compare it with the number of white flowers she received. Let's break down the information given in the problem: 1. Total number of red roses ordered = 4 times the number of white flowers (since each white flower is replaced by 4 red roses) = 4 x 200 = 800 red roses 2. Total number of calla lilies ordered = 5 times the number of white flowers = 5 x 200 = 1000 calla lilies 3. Threat made by Sandra: if all the red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, she will change her supplier. Now, let's find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver before 5 pm to avoid any trouble: Number of red roses needed = Total number of red roses ordered - Number of red roses already delivered (assuming none have been delivered so far) Number of red roses needed = 800 - 0 = 800 red roses Therefore, Fred needs to deliver at least 800 red roses before 5 pm to satisfy Sandra's order and avoid any consequences.
Response:  If Jan is 30 years old and two years ago, Mark was younger than Jan by half a year, then we can let M be Mark's age two years ago. Since Mark is now older than Jan by one year, we know that Mark's current age is M + 1. We also know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is M + 2. Finally, since Jean is two years older than Mark and Mark is currently 30 - 1 = 29 years old, we have: Jean's age = M + 2 = 29 + 2 = 31 years old.
"Response:  The fastest team will finish in 278 seconds (or approximately 4 minutes and 38 seconds). Here's how we can calculate this:

1. First, let's calculate the time it takes for each member of the faster team to run their respective legs:

400 meters = 4 laps around the track
55 seconds per lap = 220 seconds (or 3 minutes and 40 seconds)

Since there are four members in the team, they will complete one lap each:

Time taken by each member of the faster team = 220 seconds

2. Now, let's calculate the total time taken by the slower team:

The first runner completes her leg in 60 seconds (since she runs 400 meters in 60 seconds), and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds slower than the previous one:

Second runner: 60 + 3 = 63 seconds
Third runner: 63 + 3 = 66 seconds
Fourth runner: 66 + 3 = 69 seconds

Total time taken by the slower team = 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds (or approximately 4 minutes and 18 seconds)

3. Finally, we compare the times taken by both teams:

Faster team: 220 seconds
Slower team: 258 seconds

Difference between the two times = 258 - 220 = 38 seconds

Therefore, the faster team will finish in 278 seconds (220 + 38), which is approximately 4 minutes and 38 seconds."
"Response:  There are several possible outcomes for Jerry's toss of the six-sided die, and we can calculate the probability of each outcome as follows:

1. Jerry gets three consecutive even numbers: This is the most likely outcome, since there are four even numbers on the die (2, 4, 6, and 8). The probability of getting three consecutive even numbers is therefore 4/6 = 2/3.
2. Jerry gets two consecutive odd numbers and one even number: There are three ways to get two consecutive odd numbers (1 and 3, 1 and 5, or 1 and 7), and each of these combinations has a probability of 1/6. Therefore, the probability of getting two consecutive odd numbers and one even number is 3/6 = 1/2.
3. Jerry gets two even numbers and one odd number: There are three ways to get two even numbers (2 and 4, 2 and 6, or 4 and 6), and each of these combinations has a probability of 1/6. Therefore, the probability of getting two even numbers and one odd number is also 3/6 = 1/2.
4. Jerry gets all odd numbers: This is the least likely outcome, since there are only three odd numbers on the die (1, 3, and 5). The probability of getting all odd numbers is therefore 3/6 = 1/2.

Therefore, the total probability of Jerry getting a large number (greater than 3) is:

2/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 5/6 = 0.833...

So the probability that Jerry will roll a large number (greater than 3) is approximately 0.833, or 83.3%."

"Response:  To find out how many hamsters can be kept in each cage if 160 pieces of food are distributed among all the small animals, we need to divide 160 by the number of pieces of food given to each group of animals. Let's analyze the information provided:

* For the hamsters: Each hamster gets 5 pieces of food, and there are 10 hamsters in total. So, the total number of pieces of food given to the hamsters is 5 x 10 = 50.
* For the chuột: Each chuột gets 6 pieces of food, and there are 30 chuột in total. So, the total number of pieces of food given to the chuột is 6 x 30 = 180.
* For the thỏ: There are 20 miếng rơm for the thỏ, but we don't know how many thỏ there are.

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces of food given to all the animals:

50 (hamsters) + 180 (chuột) + 20 (thỏ) = 250

Since there are 160 pieces of food in total, we can divide 250 by 160 to get the number of groups of animals:

250 / 160 = 1

So, one group of animals can be kept in each cage if 160 pieces of food are distributed among all the small animals. Therefore, the answer is:

1"
"Response:  To find out how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Mandy owes Benedict, including the interest for 3 months. Let's break down the calculation step by step:  
1. Calculate the total amount of money that Mandy owes Benedict: 100 x 3 = 300 (since Mandy owes Benedict 100 dollars and she has to pay it back in 3 installments)  
2. Calculate the interest for each month: 300 x 2% x 3/12 = 60 (since the interest rate is 2% per month, and there are 3 months)  
3. Add the interest to the principal amount: 300 + 60 = 360 (the total amount that Mandy needs to pay Benedict)  
Therefore, Mandy should pay Benedict 360 dollars after 3 months."
Response:  To find out how many bags of rice the merchant sold, we need to divide the total profit (400 dollars) by the profit per bag (30 dollars). Therefore, the number of bags sold is: 400 / 30 = 13.
"Response:  To find out how much each person must pay if they split the cost evenly among themselves, we need to first calculate the total cost of all three activities: 

$20.25 (tickets) + $4.50 (food) = $24.75

Since there are three people going on these activities, each person's share would be:

$24.75 / 3 = $8.25 per person

So each person must pay $8.25 to participate in all three activities."

Response:  To calculate the total cost of 8 pencils and 1 eraser, we need to add the cost of each item. The cost of 8 pencils is 8 x 1.20 = 9.60 dollars. The cost of 1 eraser is 0.30 dollar. Therefore, the total cost is 9.60 + 0.30 = 9.90 dollars.
Response:  The total weight of cauliflower to be distributed is 200 pounds x 40 = 8,000 pounds. Since each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of cauliflower, the amount of cauliflower that will not be used is:  8,000 - (40 x 2) = 8,000 - 80 = 7,920 pounds.
Response:  To find out how many children there are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of adults (8417 + 9092 = 17419) from the total population (23786). Therefore, there are 23786 - 17419 = 6367 children in Soda.
Response:  Elaine has 60 Pokémon cards after three months.  Explanation:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards and collected triple the amount, so she had 20 x 3 = 60 cards.  In the second month, Elaine collected fewer than 20 cards, as stated in the problem. Let's assume she collected x cards. Since she collected less than 20 cards, we know that x < 20.  In the third month, Elaine collected double the number of cards she collected in the first month, which is 2x. Therefore, Elaine had 2x + x = 3x cards at the end of the third month.  So, Elaine had 60 cards after three months.
"Response:  To find out how much money Mark earns in one week, we need to multiply the number of câu he edits by the price per câu paid by each publisher. Let's use ""C"" for the number of câu edited for Nhà xuất bản A and ""D"" for the number of câu edited for Nhà xuất bản B. We know that C + D = 1000 (since Mark edits 1000 câu per week). We also know that C \* 5 = 2CD (since Nhà xuất bản A pays Mark 5 xu per câu). Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 2CD =?  Solution: Substituting C + D = 1000 into the first equation, we get: 2CD = 2(1000) = 2000. So Mark earns 2000 xu per week."

(50 tons/year) x (2 barrels/ton) = 100 barrels of wine per year"
"Response:  To determine how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the total number of slices he consumed during the week and then divide that number by the number of slices he used per sandwich. Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. Carl eats one sandwich every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so he consumes three sandwiches per day x 7 days = 21 sandwiches per week.
2. Each sandwich requires two slices of cheese, so Carl uses 21 sandwiches x 2 slices/sandwich = 42 slices of cheese per week.
3. Carl also eats three eggs per day for breakfast, and each egg requires one slice of cheese, so he uses 3 eggs x 1 slice/egg = 3 slices of cheese per day x 7 days = 21 slices of cheese per week (since he eats eggs for breakfast only).
4. Finally, Carl makes a large macaroni and cheese dish for dinner several times during the week, using eight slices of cheese per dish. Since he makes this dish multiple times, let's assume he makes it twice, so he uses 8 slices of cheese x 2 dishes = 16 slices of cheese per week.

Adding up all these numbers gives us a total of:

42 slices of cheese (from sandwiches) + 21 slices of cheese (from eggs) + 16 slices of cheese (from macaroni and cheese dishes) = 79 slices of cheese per week.

Therefore, Carl uses 79 slices of cheese per week."

Response:  To get a total of 93 for the six tests, Brinley needs to score at least 84 on the sixth test. This is calculated by subtracting the lowest score (71) from the desired average (93), then dividing that result by the number of tests (6): 93 - 71 = 22 / 6 = 84.
"Response:  To find out how many kilometers Michael has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during each week and then add them up.  During the first four weeks, Michael went cycling for 5 days a week, with each day's distance being 25 km, so the total distance he traveled during those weeks is:  
Week 1: 5 days x 25 km/day = 125 km  
Week 2: 5 days x 25 km/day = 125 km  
Week 3: 5 days x 25 km/day = 125 km  
Week 4: 5 days x 25 km/day = 125 km  
Total distance traveled during the first four weeks = 125 km x 4 weeks = 500 km  During the next three weeks, Michael reduced his cycling frequency to twice a week, but increased the distance of each ride to 60 km. So, the total distance he traveled during those weeks is:  
Week 5: 2 days x 60 km/day = 120 km  
Week 6: 2 days x 60 km/day = 120 km  
Week 7: 2 days x 60 km/day = 120 km  
Total distance traveled during the last three weeks = 120 km x 3 weeks = 360 km  Therefore, the total distance Michael traveled over the entire seven-week period is:  
Total distance = 500 km + 360 km = 860 km"
Response:  To find out how much the bag of candies weighs in grams, we need to first calculate the weight of one thanh sô cô la and then multiply it by the number of thanh sô cô la in the bag. Let's assume that each thanh sô cô la weighs 40g, as mentioned in the problem. Therefore, the weight of one thanh sô cô la is 40g. Now, let's calculate the total weight of all the thanh sô cô la in the bag: Total weight = Number of thanh sô cô la x Weight of one thanh sô cô la Total weight = 25 x 40g Total weight = 1000g (or 1kg) So, the bag of candies weighs 1kg or 1000g.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 pieces of bread. On Wednesday, she bought three times as many pieces of bread as she did on Monday (3 x 4 = 12). On Thursday, she bought five times as many pieces of bread as she did on Wednesday (5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, after three days, Rose had bought a total of 60 + 4 = 64 loaves of bread.
Response:  To calculate the total cost per unit of each type of product, we need to divide the total cost by the number of units sold. For the first type of product (50 boxes x $1200), the calculation is: Total Cost = $1200 x 50 = $60,000 Divide by the number of units: $60,000 / 50 = $1200 per box For the second type of product (half a dozen plates x $6000), the calculation is: Total Cost = $6000 x 3/2 = $9000 Divide by the number of units: $9000 / 3 = $3000 per plate Therefore, the total cost per unit for the first type of product is $1200 and the total cost per unit for the second type of product is $3000.
Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to cut grass before she can buy the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate how much money she will have after each time she cuts grass. Let's assume that Sara earns $5 per time she cuts grass. After cutting grass 10 times, she will have $50 ($5 x 10). Since the jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, she will not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, Sara needs to cut grass at least 11 times (10 times for $50 + 1 time for $20) before she can afford to buy the jacket and shoes.
"Response:  Let's say there are x number of chickens that lay white eggs and y number of chickens that lay red eggs. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the following equation:  
x(5) + y(3) = 42... (1)  We know that there are more white chickens than red chickens, so let's say there are x/2 more white chickens than red chickens. This means that the number of white chickens is 2x. Substituting this into equation (1), we get:  
2x(5) + y(3) = 42... (2)  Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving for x and y, we get:  
x = 8 and y = 6... (3)  So there are 8 white chickens and 6 red chickens."
Response:  To find out how many hours Gary will spend walking around the park, we need to divide the distance he walks (1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles) by his speed (3 miles per hour). So, it would take him 9 miles / 3 miles per hour = 3 hours to walk around the park.
Response:  To find out how many customers came to the store on Wednesday, we need to add the number of customers on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, there were 100 customers, and on Tuesday, there were 50 more than on Monday, so there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers on Tuesday. In total, there were 100 + 150 = 250 customers over the two days. If the total number of customers on Wednesday was 500, then 500 - 250 = 250 customers came to the store on Wednesday.
Response:  The small pool has 4 times as much water as it had 4 hours ago, since the large pool lost 4 gallons per minute and the small pool gained 4 times that amount (16 gallons). So, after 4 hours, the small pool has 4 x 4 = 16 more gallons of water than it did 4 hours ago. Therefore, the small pool now contains 16 + 4 = 20 gallons of water.
Response:  To find out how many hours Lori needs to work before she can buy her shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage. Let's do that: Total Cost = $320 (shoes) + $32,00 (belt) = $352. Divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $352 / $8.00/hour = 44 hours. So, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy both the shoes and the belt.
"Response:  To find out how much money Janeth will have after paying back $165 per month for 12 months, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will pay back and then subtract that from the original amount she borrowed. Let's break it down step by step:  
1. Calculate the total amount of money Janeth will pay back: 165 x 12 = 1980  
2. Subtract the total amount paid back from the original amount borrowed: 2000 - 1980 = 20  
So, after paying back $165 per month for 12 months, Janeth will have $20 left over."
Response:  There are 4 red roses in the bouquet and 7 dahlias that are more than the number of red roses. Therefore, there are a total of 4 + 7 = 11 flowers in the vase.
Response:  To find the average age of the three people in three years, we need to calculate their ages now and then add them up. Let's start by calculating Harriet's current age: 21 x 2 = 42 Now, let's calculate Adrian's current age: 3x = 90 (since Adrian is 3 times as old as Harriet) 90 + 42 = 132 Finally, let's calculate Zack's current age: Half of Harriet's age is 42 / 2 = 21 So, Zack's current age is 21. Now, let's add up all their ages: 42 + 132 + 21 = 195 In three years, they will be: 42 + 132 + 21 + 3 = 208 Therefore, the average age of the three people in three years will be: 208 / 3 = 69
Response:  Let's denote the number of points scored by each student as follows: N = Naomi's score, Y = Yuri's score, B = Brianna's score, and J = Jojo's score. We know that the total score is 251, so we can write the equation: N + Y + B + J = 251. Since Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, we can write: Y = (1/2)N + 10. Substituting this into the first equation, we get: N + (1/2)N + 10 + J = 251. Combining like terms, we have: 3N/2 + 10 + J = 251. Now we need to find J. We know that Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so we can write: B = N + 17. Substituting this into the third equation, we get: N + (1/2)N + 10 + J = 251. Combining like terms, we have: 3N/2 + 10 + J = 251. Solving for J, we have: J = 251 - 3N/2 - 10. Therefore, Jojo scored 251 - 3(68)/2 - 10 = 251 - 144 - 10 = 97 points.
Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing the games, we need to calculate the total time she spent on both types of puzzles. Let's start with the crosswords:  For each crossword, Carmen took 10 minutes to complete, so for 3 crosswords, she spent 3 x 10 = 30 minutes on crosswords. Now, let's move on to the Sudokus: For each Sudoku, Carmen took 5 minutes to complete, so for 8 Sudokus, she spent 8 x 5 = 40 minutes on Sudokus. Therefore, in total, Carmen spent 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these two types of puzzles.
Response:  There are 30 liters of water left in the tank after Celine uses 90 liters for her garden.
Response:  Andy planted 90 geraniums and fewer than 40 petunias, so he planted a total of 90 + (fewer than 40) = 90 + (40 - x) flowers, where x is the number of petunias he planted. Since there are more geraniums than petunias, we know that x < 40, so the total number of flowers is 90 + (40 - x).
Response:  The total amount of money that the company has spent on advertising over two years is $15,000 x 2 = $30,000.
Response:  To find out how much Carlos and Benji will have to pay for renting the boats, we need to calculate the total cost of their boat rental. For Carlos, the cost is $30 x 3 = $90 per hour, so the total cost for 3 hours is $90 x 3 = $270. For Benji, the cost is $18 x 5 = $90 per hour, so the total cost for 5 hours is $90 x 5 = $450. Therefore, the total amount they will have to pay is $270 + $450 = $720.
Response:  If Andrew takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half as much time (3 days) to return by car, then he will spend a total of 6 + 3 = 9 days on his trip.

* Thịt ($2) + Phô mai ($1) + Bơ ($1) + Nước sốt (2 x $0.25) = $4.25

Since Chad used a gift card worth $5, he only needs to pay the remaining balance of $4.25 - $5 = $0.75. Therefore, Chad owes $0.75."
Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can add half of what Kalinda adds, then together they will be able to add 9 pieces per minute (4 + 5 = 9). To complete the puzzle in 360 minutes, they will need 360/9 = 40 minutes.
Response:  To find out how many watermelons are not yet ripe for harvest, we need to calculate the percentage of watermelons that have already been harvested and subtract it from 100%. Let's use the information given in the problem: 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest after two months, so 30% of 120 = 36 watermelons were harvested. After two weeks, an additional 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest, so 3/4 of (120 - 36) = 90 watermelons were harvested. Therefore, there are 90 + 36 = 126 watermelons left that have not yet been harvested.
Response:  To find out how much Mark paid for each car, we need to calculate the total cost of all 12 cars and then divide that by 12. First, let's calculate the total cost of all 12 cars: Total Cost = (12 x $20,000) + ($10,000 x 12) = $240,000 + $120,000 = $360,000 Now, let's divide the total cost by 12 to get the cost per car: Cost Per Car = $360,000 / 12 = $30,000 per car So, Mark paid $30,000 for each car.
"Response:  Let's use ""K"" to represent the number of shells Kylie collects on Monday and ""R"" to represent the number of shells Robert collects on Monday. We know that Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so we can write an equation based on that information:  K = R + 5  Now, let's say Robert collected x shells on Monday. Then, we can write the equation for Kylie's collection as:  K = R + 5  Substituting R = x, we get:  K = x + 5  On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday. So, if she collected k shells on Monday, she will collect 2k shells on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is:  Total = 2(k) = 2(x + 5) = 2x + 10  To find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to solve for x in the above equation. Substituting x = 20 (since Robert collected 20 shells on Monday), we get:  Total = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50  Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."

"Response:  To determine how many cherry tomato plants Steve needs to produce 6 cherry tomatoes per day, we need to calculate the total number of cherry tomatoes he consumes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:  

Total number of cherry tomatoes consumed per week = 6 cherry tomatoes/day x 7 days/week = 42 cherry tomatoes/week

Since each cherry tomato plant produces 3 cherry tomatoes per week, Steve will need:  

Number of cherry tomato plants needed = Total number of cherry tomatoes consumed per week / Number of cherry tomatoes produced per plant
= 42 cherry tomatoes/week / 3 cherry tomatoes/plant
= 14 cherry tomato plants

Therefore, Steve needs 14 cherry tomato plants to meet his daily demand of 6 cherry tomatoes."

"Response:  To find out how many students exit through door C, we need to first determine how many students remain in the building after 30% of them have exited through door A and 3/5 of the remaining students have exited through door B. Let's use variables to represent these numbers: 
Let x be the number of students who exit through door A (x = 30% of 1000 = 300) 
Let y be the number of students who exit through door B (y = 3/5 of 700 = 210) 
Let z be the number of students who exit through door C (z = 1000 - x - y) 
Now we can calculate each variable: 
x = 300 
y = 210 
z = 1000 - 300 - 210 = 490 
So there are 490 students who exit through door C."

"Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing each week, we need to divide the number of pages he writes by his writing speed. Let's assume that each page takes him 6 minutes to write (since he can write one page in 6 minutes). Therefore, the number of hours he spends writing each week is:  

Number of pages written per week = Number of friends x Number of letters per friend x Number of pages per letter = 5 x 2 x 5 = 50 pages/week 

Time spent writing per week = Total number of pages / Writing speed = 50 pages/week / 6 minutes/page = 8.33 hours/week 

Therefore, Mike spends approximately 8.33 hours per week writing letters to his remaining 5 friends."
Response:  To find out how many minutes Jason has for the month, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends talking on the phone each day and then multiply it by the number of days in the month. Let's break down the information given:  Daily calls with the supervisor: 15 minutes x 30 days = 450 minutes Total additional calls: 300 minutes x 30 days = 9,000 minutes So, in total, Jason talks on the phone for 450 + 9,000 = 9,450 minutes per month.
Response:  If Ginger gave Griffin some potato chips and Colby took fewer than 3 of them from Griffin, then Ginger must have given Griffin at least 3 more potato chips than what Kyle took (since Kyle took 5). Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin at least 8 more potato chips (3 + 5 = 8). So, Ginger gave Griffin 8 additional potato chips.
Response:  If each tank has an equal number of fish and there are 4 times as many snails in one tank as in the other, then the number of fish in both tanks is in the ratio of 4:1. So if the number of fish in one tank is x, then the number of fish in the other tank is 4x.
"Response:  To calculate how much Jean will pay for makeup services, we need to first determine the total cost of makeup services for each day of filming. We know that the makeup artist charges $250 per hour and Jean needs makeup services for 6 hours per day (assuming she works 8 hours per day). Therefore, the daily cost of makeup services is:  
$250/hour x 6 hours/day = $1,500/day  Since Jean works for 4 days per week (assuming she works 5 days per week), her weekly cost of makeup services is:  
$1,500/day x 4 days/week = $6,000/week  Since the filming takes 5 weeks, Jean's total cost of makeup services is:  
$6,000/week x 5 weeks = $30,000  After discounting 10%, Jean's final cost of makeup services would be:  
$30,000 x 90% = $27,000"
