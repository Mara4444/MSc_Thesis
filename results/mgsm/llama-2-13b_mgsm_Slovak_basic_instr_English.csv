"Response:  To determine how many shovels of feed Wendine needs to give her chickens at the last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total number of shovels of feed she gives to her chickens daily. We know that in the morning, she gives each chicken 15 shovels of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives them another 25 shovels of feed. Therefore, the total number of shovels of feed Wendine gives to her chickens daily is:  
15 + 25 = 40  
Since there are 20 chickens in Wendine's flock, she needs to give each chicken:  
40 / 20 = 2 shovels of feed at the last meal of the day."
"Response:  To calculate how much Kylar needs to pay for the 16 cups, we need to first find out how many cups he can buy with 5 dollars (the price of one cup). We know that each subsequent cup costs 60% of the previous cup's price, so we can use this information to work backwards.  
Let X be the number of cups Kylar can buy with 5 dollars. Since each cup costs 5 dollars, we have:  
X = 5 dollars / 5 dollars per cup = 1 cup  
Now, let Y be the number of cups Kylar can buy with 60% of 5 dollars (i.e., 3 dollars). We have:  
Y = 3 dollars / 5 dollars per cup = 2/3 of a cup  
Since Kylar wants to buy 16 cups in total, we can write an equation based on these two relationships:  
16 cups = 1 cup + (2/3) cup = 1 + 2/3 cup  
To find out how much Kylar needs to pay, we multiply the number of cups he buys by the price of each cup:  
Total cost = 1 cup x 5 dollars/cup + (2/3) cup x 5 dollars/cup = 5 dollars + 2/3 x 5 dollars = 5 dollars + 3.33 dollars = 8.33 dollars  
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay 8.33 dollars for the 16 cups."
Response:  Let's use algebraic expression to represent the number of sheep each city has: T = 2C + S, where T is the total number of sheep Toulouse has, C is the number of sheep Charleston has, and S is the number of sheep Seattle has. We know that T = 2(4) + S = 8 + S. Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we can set up the equation: 8 + S = 20. Solving for S, we get: S = 12. So, Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, which means Toulouse has 2(4) = 8 sheep. Charleston has 4 sheep, and Seattle has 12 sheep. Therefore, together they have 8 + 4 + 12 = 24 sheep.
Response:  To calculate the time it takes to download a file of 200 GB with a downloading speed of 2 GB per minute and an interruption due to installation of updates that lasts for 20 minutes, we can use the formula: Time = (Size / Speed) + InterruptionTime Total time = (200 GB / 2 GB/min) + (20 min) Total time = 100 min + 20 min Total time = 120 min Therefore, it would take approximately 120 minutes or 2 hours and 20 minutes to download a 200 GB file with a downloading speed of 2 GB per minute, assuming there is no other interruptions during the process.

Total amount paid = $50  
Cost of food items:  
* 1 loaf of bread x $3 = $3  
* 4 apples x $1.50 = $6  
* 1 box of muffins x $12 = $12  
Total cost of food items = $3 + $6 + $12 = $21

Response:  To find the average of the numbers given by the three friends, we need to first convert each number into a common unit (e.g., percentages). Let's assume that the first friend said there were 80 jelly beans in the jar, which is 80%. The second friend said there were more than half of the first amount, so they said 20 more than 80, which is 100 - 80 = 20. The third friend said there were 25% more than the first amount, so they said 80 + (25/100) \* 80 = 80 + 20 = 100. Therefore, the average of the three amounts is (80 + 20 + 100)/3 = 200/3 = 66.7.

"Response:  Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say she has x silver coins. Then, she has 30 + x gold coins. The total number of coins is 110. So we can set up the equation:  
x + (30 + x) = 110  
Simplifying the equation:  
2x + 30 = 110  
Subtracting 30 from both sides:  
2x = 80  
Dividing by 2:  
x = 40  
So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 30 + 40 = 70 gold coins."

Day 1: 3 hours x 100 km/h = 300 km/day  
Day 2: 50% of 3 hours = 1.5 hours x 100 km/h = 150 km/day  
Day 3: 3 hours x 100 km/h = 300 km/day  
Total distance traveled in 3 days = 300 + 150 + 300 = 750 km  
Average speed over 3 days = Total distance / Number of days = 750 km / 3 days = 250 km/day  
Therefore, John skis at an average speed of 250 km per day."
"Response:  To find out how many miles Dana can cover in 6 hours if she spends one-third of her time walking and two-thirds of her time running at a speed of 3 miles per hour, we need to first calculate her total distance covered during the 6 hours. Let's assume that she walks for x miles during the one-third of the time she spends walking, and runs for 3x miles during the two-thirds of the time she spends running. Therefore, the total distance she covers is:

x + 3x = 6x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = 6x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2

So, Dana walks for 2 miles during the one-third of the time she spends walking, and runs for 6 miles (3x) during the two-thirds of the time she spends running. Therefore, the total distance she covers in 6 hours is:

2 + 6 = 8 miles

Therefore, Dana can cover 8 miles in 6 hours if she spends one-third of her time walking and two-thirds of her time running at a speed of 3 miles per hour."

"Response:  To find out how much John spent on kravats, we need to calculate the cost of each type of kravat and then add them up. The cost of red kravats is 50% more than the cost of blue kravats, so we can start by finding the cost of blue kravats first. We know that John paid $40 for each pair of blue kravats, so the total cost of blue kravats is:

$40 x 2 = $80

Now, let's find the cost of red kravats. Since they are 50% more expensive than blue kravats, we can multiply the cost of blue kravats by 1.5:

$80 x 1.5 = $120

So, the total cost of all kravats is:

$80 + $120 = $200

Therefore, John spent $200 on kravats."

"Response:  To calculate how much Sheila will pay each month for 3 months, we need to first find out how much she paid for each mobile phone. We know that she paid $150 for each phone and there were 5 phones in total. So, the total amount she paid is:  
$150 x 5 = $750  
Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment for each phone. We can use the formula for simple interest to do this:  
Monthly Payment = Principal x Rate x Time / 100  
where Principal is the initial amount borrowed (which is $750), Rate is the annual interest rate divided by 12 (since we are calculating monthly payments), and Time is the number of months (in this case, 3 months).  
Plugging in these values, we get:  
Monthly Payment = $750 x 2/100 x 3/12 = $45 per month  
So, Sheila will pay $45 per month for each of the 5 mobile phones for a total of $225 per month ($45 x 5) for 3 months."

"Response:  To determine how much coleslaw Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of food needed for all attendees. Let's assume that each adult will eat half as much as an adult dinosaur (5/2 = 2.5) and each child will eat one quarter as much as an adult dinosaur (1/2). Therefore, the total amount of coleslaw needed is:

Total amount of coleslaw = Number of adults x amount per adult + Number of children x amount per child
= 20 x 2.5 + 5 x 1
= 50 + 5
= 55

So, Ted should bring 55 portions of coleslaw to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat."

Response:  To find out how old Jackson is, we need to use the information that Amy is 5 years older than him and that Corey is 2 years younger than him. So, if Amy is x years old, then Jackson is (x + 5) years old. We also know that James is 10 years old and that he is one year younger than Corey, so Corey is (x + 2) years old. Therefore, Jackson's age can be calculated as follows: Jackson = (Amy - 5) + 2 = (x + 5) - 5 + 2 = x + 7.
"Response:  To determine how fast Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles if he has improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet, we need to know Lee's time for running 400 meters without obstacles and then calculate Gerald's time based on the improvement in his speed. Let's assume that Lee runs 400 meters without obstacles in 38 seconds, as stated in the problem. If Gerald has improved his speed by 10%, he will now run the same distance in:  
Time = (Distance / Speed) x (1 + Improvement percentage)  
Time = (400 meters / Lee's speed) x (1 + 0.10)  
Time = (400 meters / 38 seconds/400 meters) x (1 + 0.10)  
Time = 38 seconds x 1.10 = 41.8 seconds  
Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 41.8 seconds if he has improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet."

Response:  To determine how many pages Solo needs to read each day to finish the book in 4 days, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days he has left. Let's break it down as follows: Total pages = 4 (from his učebnica vedy) + 20 (from his učebnica sociálnych štúdií) + 7 (from his učebnica historia) + 8 (from his učebnica zemepisnej vedy) = 39 pages. Number of days left = 4 days. Therefore, to finish the book in 4 days, Solo needs to read: 39 pages / 4 days = 9.75 pages per day. Since you can't read a fraction of a page, Solo will need to read 10 pages per day to finish the book in 4 days.

Response:  To find the total internal volume of all three boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then add them up. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. Since the dimensions of each box are given in centimeters, we can use these values directly.  Volume of first box = length (50) x width (60) x height (40) = 12000 cubic centimeters (or 12 liters)  Volume of second box = length (50) x width (60) x height (80) = 19200 cubic centimeters (or 19.2 liters)  Volume of third box = length (50) x width (60) x height (40) = 12000 cubic centimeters (or 12 liters) Total internal volume of all three boxes = 12000 + 19200 + 12000 = 53200 cubic centimeters (or 53.2 liters)

"Response:  To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to know her speed in kilometers per hour and the time she will spend running. Let's start by converting her speeds from miles per hour to kilometers per hour:  
Rosie runs at 10 mph for 3 hours, so she covers:  
10 mph x 3 h = 30 miles  
She then runs at 8 km/h for 4 hours, so she covers:  
8 km/h x 4 h = 32 kilometers (since there are 1.60934 kilometers per mile) Therefore, Rosie can cover:  
Total distance = 30 + 32 = 62 miles or 100 kilometers in 7 hours."

Eggs (3 x $3) = $9  
Bread rolls (3 x $3) = $9  
Cups (3 x $3) = $9  
Pasta ($4) = $4  
Total = $4 + $9 + $9 + $9 + $4 = $35  
So, everything together would cost $35 with a 10% tax on all non-food items."
"Response:  To calculate how much profit Lucas will make each week, we need to subtract his total expenses from his total revenue. Total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of clients he has by the price of one fledge and bag of cleaning supplies. Total expenses are $2 x 3 (the number of flages) + $5 x 1 (the number of bags). Therefore, Lucas's total revenue per week is:  
Revenue = 3 x $2 = $6  
Total Expenses = $2 x 3 + $5 x 1 = $6 + $5 = $11  
Profit = Revenue - Total Expenses = $6 - $11 = $-5  
Therefore, Lucas will lose $5 per week."
Response:  To calculate how many ananas John can harvest in one year, we need to multiply the number of ananas per hectare by the number of hectares and then multiply that result by the number of times he can harvest per year.  So, if there are 100 ananas per hectare and John has 10 hectares, he can harvest 10 x 100 = 1,000 ananas per hectare. Since he can harvest three times per year, he can harvest 1,000 x 3 = 3,000 ananas per year.

Response:  To find out how long Tim will wait for Steve at home, we need to calculate the time it takes Steve to get home from school and compare it with the time it takes Tim to get home on his skateboard. Let's start by calculating the time it takes Steve to get home: Distance = 3 miles Speed = 440 feet per minute Time = distance / speed Time = 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 7.5 minutes Now let's calculate the time it takes Tim to get home on his skateboard: Distance = 3 kilometers Speed = 264 feet per minute Time = distance / speed Time = 3 km / 264 ft/min = 11.4 minutes Since Steve gets home faster than Tim, Steve will not have to wait for Tim at home. The difference in their travel times is: Difference = 7.5 minutes - 11.4 minutes = 3.9 minutes So, Tim will wait for Steve for approximately 3.9 minutes before he finishes his own journey.

Therefore, Billy will take approximately 2/3 minutes, or 40 seconds, to prepare all 60 potatoes."
"Response:  To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to divide their revenue by the price per cup. We know that they sold 20 cups for $10 and have 25 dollars left. So, we can calculate as follows:  
$10 / $0.50 = 20 cups  
$25 - $10 = $15 (left)  
Now, let's calculate the cost of lemons:  
$15 / ($3 x gallons + $2 x cups) =?  
We know that they produced one gallon for every two cups, so we can write:  
($15 / $0.50) / (2 cups/gallon) =?  
Simplifying:  
$15 / $0.50 x 2 =?  
$30 / $0.50 =?  
$60 / $0.50 =?  
Answer: $60  
Therefore, they spent $60 on lemons."

"Response:  To calculate how much money will be left after all expenses and donations, we need to subtract all the expenses from Zaid's monthly salary of $6000. First, let's list out all the expenses:  

1/4 of his salary for rent ($6000 x 1/4) = $1500  
1/3 of his salary for gasoline ($6000 x 1/3) = $2000  
Half of the remaining amount donated to his favorite charity ($6000 - $3500) = $2500  
Total expenses = $1500 + $2000 + $2500 = $6000  
Now, let's subtract total expenses from Zaid's monthly salary:  
$6000 - $6000 = $0  
Therefore, Zaid will have no money left after all expenses and donations."

"Response:  To calculate the number of votes that the losing candidate received, we need to subtract the number of votes received by the winning candidate from the total number of students who voted in the election. In this case, if the winning candidate received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in the election, then the number of votes received by the losing candidate can be calculated as follows:  
Number of votes received by the losing candidate = Total number of voters - (3/4) x Total number of voters  
= 80 - (3/4) x 80  
= 80 - 60  
= 20  
Therefore, the losing candidate received 20 votes."
Response:  To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver to satisfy Sandra's order, we need to calculate the total number of items ordered and compare it with the number of items already delivered. Let's break down the information given in the question: 1. Red roses: Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white carnations (4 x 3 = 12). 2. White carnations: Sandra ordered 5 times fewer white carnations than red roses (5 x 3 = 15). 3. Lilies: Sandra ordered 200 lilies, which were 5 times more than the number of white carnations (200 / 5 = 40).  Now, let's add up all the items ordered by Sandra: 12 + 15 + 40 = 67.

"Response:  The merchant bought x wheat bundles from the farmer for $20 per bundle. The cost of transporting each bundle from the farm to the warehouse is $2, so the total cost of transportation is 2x dollars. If the merchant sold all the bundles for $30 per unit and made a profit of $400, then we can set up the following equation:  

2x + 2x = 400

Solving for x, we get:

4x = 400

x = 100

Therefore, the merchant bought 100 wheat bundles from the farmer."

"Response:  To find out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has now, we need to calculate the total number of cards she collected in all three months. In the first month, she collected 20 cards more than in the second month, and in the third month, she collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined. Let's break it down:  
Month 1: Elaine collected 20 cards more than in Month 2, so if she collected x cards in Month 2, she collected x + 20 cards in Month 1.  
Month 2: Elaine collected 20% fewer cards than in Month 1, so if she collected x + 20 cards in Month 1, she collected (x + 20) / 2 cards in Month 2.  
Month 3: Elaine collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined, so if she collected (x + 20) / 2 cards in Month 2, she collected 2(x + 20) / 2 cards in Month 3. Now let's substitute the values we know into the equation for Month 3:  
2(x + 20) / 2 = 2(x + 20) / 2 \* 2 = 4x + 40  
Now solve for x:  
4x + 40 = 4(x + 20)  
4x + 40 = 4x + 80  
x = 40  
So Elaine collected 40 cards in each of the first two months and 80 cards in the third month, for a total of 40 + 40 + 80 = 160 cards."
Response:  To calculate how much Mark earns in one week (7 days), we need to multiply the number of veties he edits per day by the price per vety and then multiply that result by the number of days in a week.  So, for 7 days, Mark would edit 7 x 1000 = 7000 veties. For vydavateľ A, Mark would receive 7000 x 5 = 35,000 cents. For vydavateľ B, Mark would receive 7000 x 2 = 14,000 cents. Therefore, Mark's total earnings for one week are 35,000 + 14,000 = 49,000 cents or $490.

Response:  To calculate how many barrels of wine are produced by Josie's farm each year, we need to know that her farm produces 5 tons of grapes per hectare and each ton of grapes produces 2 sudes (barrels) of wine. Therefore, if we multiply 5 tons/hectare x 100 hectares (the size of Josie's farm), we get 500 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes produces 2 sudes of wine, Josie's farm produces 500 x 2 = 1000 barrels of wine per year.

85 - 71 = 14 / 5 = 2.8. Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 2.8 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
Response:  To calculate how many kilometers Michael rode each week during the four weeks he rode five times a week, we can use the formula: Total distance = Number of rides x Distance per ride. Since Michael rode five times a week for four weeks, the total distance he rode is: Total distance = 4 x 5 x 25 km/ride = 500 km.  For the three weeks that Michael rode twice a week and rode 60 km each time, we can use the same formula: Total distance = Number of rides x Distance per ride. The total distance Michael rode during these three weeks is: Total distance = 3 x 2 x 60 km/ride = 360 km. Therefore, in total, Michael rode 500 + 360 = 860 km.
"Response:  To calculate the total weight of Joe's sweet treats, we need to multiply the number of chocolate sprinkles by their weight and add the weight of the candied apples.

"Response:  To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn in order to afford the new dress and two pairs of socks, we need to calculate her earnings from each activity. Let's break down the costs:

* New dress: $30
* Two pairs of socks: $20 (total: $40)
* Total amount needed: $40

Now let's calculate Sara's earnings from each activity:

* Babysitting four times: 4 x $5 = $20
* Mowing the lawn four times: 4 x $4 = $16

Total earnings: $20 + $16 = $36

Since Sara already has $10 saved up before she started babysitting and mowing the lawn, she only needs to earn an additional $36 - $10 = $26 to buy the new dress and two pairs of socks. Therefore, she needs to mow the lawn 26 / $4 = 6 times to afford everything."
"Response:  Let's denote the number of red chickens as x and the number of white chickens as y. We know that the total number of chickens is 42, so we can write the equation:  
x + y = 42... 3x + 5y =?... Since each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day and each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by all chickens is:  
3x + 5y = 3x(3) + 5y(5) = 9x + 25y... Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving the system of equations, we get:  
x = 16 and y = 10... So Jerry has 16 red chickens and 10 white chickens."

"Response:  To calculate how many hours Lori needs to work to afford her purchases, we need to divide the total cost of her purchases by her hourly wage. Let's do this:  
Total Cost = $320 (topanky) + $32 (opasky) = $352  
Hourly Wage = $8/hour  
Number of Hours Worked = Total Cost / Hourly Wage  
Number of Hours Worked = $352 / $8/hour = 44 hours  
Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours to earn enough money to buy both pairs of shoes and the matching accessories."
Response:  To calculate the remaining amount that Janeth will have after paying off her debt of $2000 with a monthly payment of $165 for 12 months at an interest rate of 10%, we can use the formula for present value of a single amount: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where: PV = present value (the amount left over after paying off the debt) FV = future value (the original amount borrowed) r = interest rate n = number of periods In this case, the present value is what Janeth will have left over after paying off her debt, so we set up the equation as follows: PV = $2000 / (1 + 0.10)^(12) We solve for PV by plugging in the values and calculating: PV = $2000 / (1 + 0.10)^(12) = $2000 / 1.10^12 = $2000 / 1.10 \* 12 = $2000 / 120 = $16.67 So, after paying off her debt of $2000 with a monthly payment of $165 for 12 months at an interest rate of 10%, Janeth will have $16.67 left over.

"Response:  To calculate the probability that a randomly selected card will be of the water type after James adds 14 grass cards and loses 8 water cards, we need to first determine the number of water cards he has after losing 8.  We can do this by subtracting 8 from his original number of water cards:  
Number of water cards before losing any = 40  
Number of water cards after losing 8 = 40 - 8 = 32  
Now, we need to divide the number of water cards he has left by the total number of cards he has:  
Number of water cards left / Total number of cards = 32 / (30 + 20 + 32) = 32 / 62 = approximately 0.516 or 51.6%  
So, there is about a 51.6% chance that a randomly selected card will be of the water type."

Response:  To calculate the total amount that Mark will pay for the fleet of 12 cars, we need to consider two costs: the purchase price of each car and the taxes and registration fees. First, let's calculate the purchase price of each car: 12 x $20,000 = $240,000 Next, we need to subtract the taxes and registration fees: Taxes: 12 x $2,000 (10% of $20,000) = $24,000 Registration fees: 12 x $1,000 = $12,000 Total cost without taxes and registration fees: $240,000 - $24,000 - $12,000 = $204,000 So, Mark will pay a total of $204,000 for the fleet of 12 cars.

"Response:  To calculate how much Jean paid for the make-up services, we need to first determine the total amount of time that the make-up artist worked on the film. Since she works 6 hours per day and needs to redo the make-up 4 times per week, the total number of working hours is:  

6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 800 hours

Next, we multiply the total number of hours by the hourly rate:  

800 hours x $250/hour = $200,000

Finally, we subtract the 10% discount given by the make-up artist:  

$200,000 - $20,000 (10% of $200,000) = $180,000

Therefore, Jean paid $180,000 for the make-up services."
