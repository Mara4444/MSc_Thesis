Response:  First, we know that Gina sells 16 eggs per day at a price of $2 per dozen. This means she sells 48 eggs per week (16 x 3 = 48).  Next, we know that she spends $30 per week on marketing to promote her eggs. Finally, we want to find out how much profit she makes in one day. To do this, we need to subtract her expenses from her revenue. Revenue: 48 eggs/day x $2/dozen = $96/day Expenses: $30/week x 7 days/week = $210/week Profit: $96/day - $210/week = $114/day Therefore, Gina makes $114 per day selling eggs at the farmer's market.
Response:  We have two letters with 500 words each, and we want to know how many pages they are in total.  Since each page has approximately 180-200 words, we can estimate that each letter is around 3-4 pages long. Therefore, if we multiply 2 (letters) x 3-4 (pages per letter), we get 6-8 pages in total.
Response:  First, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on renovations. This increased the value of the house by 150% (or doubled its original value). So, if the original value of the house was $80,000, then after the renovations, it would be worth $240,000 ($80,000 x 3).
"Response:  If Gideon runs three times a week and each time he runs 60 meters, then in one week, he runs:  
3 x 60 = 180 meters per week."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Wendy eats three meals a day and each meal consists of five portions of food (zroaim, toloi kemach, and yarkot). This means she consumes 15 portions of food in total per day (3 x 5 = 15).  Now, let's consider the amount of food she needs for each meal based on her daily intake. Since she has 20 terangoulot (portion sizes), she can divide them into three equal parts for each meal, which gives us:  
Morning meal: 20 / 3 = 6 portions (18 zroaim + 4 toloi kemach + 4 yarkot)  
Afternoon meal: 20 / 3 = 6 portions (18 zroaim + 4 toloi kemach + 4 yarkot)  
Evening meal: 20 / 3 = 6 portions (18 zroaim + 4 toloi kemach + 4 yarkot)  
Therefore, Wendy needs 18 zroaim, 4 toloi kemach, and 4 yarkot for each meal, totalling 36 portions of food per day (18 x 3 = 54 zroaim, 4 x 3 = 12 toloi kemach, and 4 x 3 = 12 yarkot). So, if she wants to give 25 additional portions of food to her birds, she will need to prepare an extra 25 portions of zroaim, toloi kemach, and yarkot for the afternoon and evening meals."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of one cup. We know that the first cup costs $5, and the second cup costs 60% of $5, which is $3 (since 60% of $5 is equal to $3). So, the cost of one cup can be represented as follows:  
$5 + $3 = $8 per cup. Now, let's calculate the total cost of 16 cups:  
$8 x 16 = $128. Therefore, the total amount that the customer needs to pay for 16 cups is $128."
Response:  We know that for each of the three cities (Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa), there are four more cafes than in Sderot. So, if Sderot has 20 cafes, then Tel Aviv will have 20 x 4 = 80 cafes, Jerusalem will have 20 x 4 = 80 cafes, and Haifa will have 20 x 4 = 80 cafes as well. In total, there will be 80 + 80 + 80 = 240 cafes in all three cities combined.
Response: 1) The file size is 200 GB, and it takes 20 minutes to download each gigabyte (GB). Therefore, the total time required to download the entire file would be: Time = File Size / Download Speed Time = 200 GB / (2 GB/minute) Time = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes. So, it will take approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to download the entire file.
Response:  First, we know that Jon drove at an average speed of 80 km/h for 4 hours (or 240 minutes). We can calculate how far he traveled during this time using the formula: distance = speed x time. In this case, the distance would be: distance = 80 km/h x 240 min = 19,200 meters or approximately 19 kilometers. Now, let's consider the additional 45 minutes that Jon spent driving at a slower speed of 30 km/h. During this time, he covered a distance of: distance = 30 km/h x 45 min = 1350 meters or approximately 1.35 kilometers. So, in total, Jon traveled 19 + 1.35 = 20.35 kilometers to reach his destination.
Response:  First, we need to calculate Eliyah's regular hourly wage for the week: 10 dollars x 40 hours = $400. Next, we add her overtime pay for the additional 5 hours she worked: $400 + (1.2 x $400) = $400 + $480 = $880. Therefore, Eliyah's total earnings for the week are $880.
Response:  First, we know that there were 60 hours of work in the first month. Second, we know that there were three fewer hours of work in the second month than in the first month. Third, we know that there was a 30% decrease in work hours in the third month compared to the second month. So let's start with the number of hours worked in the second month: 60 x (1 - 3/100) = 60 x 0.7 = 42 hours. Now we can calculate the total number of hours worked over the three months: 42 + 42 + 42 = 126 hours.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of mattress. 1. Sofa beds - $68 x 3 = $204 2. Minimalist sofa beds - $80 x 2 = $160 3. Innerspring sofa beds - $55 x 6 = $330 Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $794
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Carl will make from each tree he sells. We know that he can sell each tree for $1.50 and there are seven trees per year (since each tree takes three years to grow). So, in one year, Carl will make:  7 trees x $1.50/tree = $10.50 per year  Now, let's calculate how many years it will take for Carl to earn enough money to buy the tree. We know that the tree costs $90 and Carl needs to earn $90 to buy it. So, we can set up an equation:   $90 = $10.50 x (number of years)  To solve for the number of years, we can divide both sides by $10.50:   $\frac{90}{10.5} = \text{number of years}$  Simplifying, we get:   $\frac{90}{10.5} = 8$  Therefore, Carl will need to work for eight years to earn enough money to buy the tree.
Response: 1) She sells 3 sheets for $20 each = $60. 2) She has 5 sheets left = $60 / 5 = $12 per sheet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 20% of the students (20/100) will join the dance immediately. That means 20% of 20 students are 4 students who will join the dance immediately. Next, we know that 25% of the remaining students (70/100) will join the dance later (G'az). So, 25% of 66 students (the number left after deducting the 4 students who joined immediately) is 16.5 students (rounded to 16) who will join the dance later. Finally, we have 83.5 students (66 + 16 + 4) out of 100 who will participate in either immediate or later dance sessions. To find the percentage of students who will join the hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students joining the hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. Therefore, the percentage of students who will join the hip-hop dance is: 83.5 / 100 x 100 = 83.5%.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of each option: Option A - $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125 (the cost of the computers plus a 2.5% increase in price) Option B - $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096 (the cost of the laptops plus a 1.2% increase in price) Now let's compare the two options and choose the one that gives us the highest profit margin. To do this, we can subtract the cost of each option from its selling price: Option A Profit Margin = ($5,125 - $5,000) / $5,000 = 2.4% Option B Profit Margin = ($8,096 - $8,000) / $8,000 = 1.3% Since the profit margin for Option A is higher than for Option B, it would be more profitable for the merchant to sell the computers at a price of $5,125.
Response:  We know that each car can carry 80 kilograms of weight and they are traveling for two days. So, we need to calculate how much weight they will transport in total.  Day 1: Each car can carry 80 kg x 2 cars = 160 kg Total weight transported on day 1 = 160 kg Day 2: Each car can carry 80 kg x 2 cars = 160 kg Total weight transported on day 2 = 160 kg Total weight transported in both days = 160 kg + 160 kg = 320 kg Therefore, the total distance traveled by both cars in two days is 320 kg / (80 kg/car) = 4 miles or 6.4 kilometers.
Response:  First, we need to calculate Gil's weekly hours for each job. For tutoring, she works 35 hours per week (30 dollars / hour x 50 weeks = 1750 dollars / year). As an artist, she works 15 hours per week (20 dollars / hour x 50 weeks = 900 dollars / year). Next, let's add up her total annual income from both jobs: Total Annual Income = Tutoring Income + Artist Income = $1750 + $900 = $2650. Finally, we divide her total annual income by the number of weeks she worked in the year to get her weekly salary: Weekly Salary = Total Annual Income / Number of Weeks Worked = $2650 / 50 weeks = $53 per week.
"Response:  If Kalila eats 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, and there are 4 weeks in a month (assuming she doesn't eat anything else), then she will eat:  
3 eggs/day x 28 days/month = 84 eggs/month  
So, in 4 months (16 weeks), Kalila will eat:  
84 eggs/month x 4 months = 336 eggs"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time she needs for each mile. We know that she can run 4 miles in 30 minutes, so one mile takes her 30/4 = 7.5 minutes. Now, we need to add up the time it takes her to run each of the first four miles and then the last two miles. For the first four miles, she needs 7.5 minutes per mile x 4 miles = 30 minutes. For the last two miles, she needs 7.5 minutes per mile x 2 miles = 15 minutes. In total, she needs 30 + 15 = 45 minutes to complete the entire course.
Response:  If you have 10 liters of water and add 3 more liters to it, then you will have in total 13 liters (10 + 3). Now, if you take away 1 liter from this amount, you will be left with 12 liters (13 - 1). So, there are 12 liters of water remaining after taking out 1 liter.
Response:  We know that Raymund was born 6 years before Samantha and he is currently 23 years old. So if Samantha is now 31 years old, how many years ago did Raymund give birth to his son?  To find out, we need to subtract Samantha's current age from her age at the time of her son's birth.  In this case, we would subtract 31 - 25 = 6 years. Therefore, Raymund gave birth to his son 6 years ago.
Response:  We know that Bilal has 8 customers in total and each of his first three customers buys one DVD. That means he sells 3 DVDs to his first three customers. His next two customers buy two DVDs each, so he sells another two DVDs. Finally, his last three customers do not buy any DVDs. Therefore, Bilal sells a total of: 3 + 2 = 5 DVDs per day on Wednesday.
Response:  We know that the fire burns for 2 hours (from 1:00 to 3:00). During this time, the temperature inside the room rises from 20°C to 40°C. We also know that the heating capacity of the fire is 200 Watts per hour. So, we can calculate how many degrees Celsius the temperature will rise in one hour as follows:  Temperature rise per hour = Heating capacity / Time period  Temperature rise per hour = 200 W / 1 hour  Temperature rise per hour = 200/60 = 3.33°C per hour Now, let's calculate how much the temperature will rise during the entire 2-hour period:  Total temperature rise = Number of hours x Temperature rise per hour  Total temperature rise = 2 hours x 3.33°C per hour  Total temperature rise = 2 x 3.33 = 6.66°C The temperature will rise by 6.66°C over the course of 2 hours.  To find out how many degrees Celsius the temperature will be after 5 hours (from 5:00 to 7:00), we can simply add the total temperature rise to the initial temperature:  Final temperature = Initial temperature + Total temperature rise  Final temperature = 20°C + 6.66°C  Final temperature = 20 + 6.66 = 26.66°C The temperature will be 26.66°C after 5 hours.
Response:  First, we know that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 with a discount of 25%. So, if he paid $19.50, then the original price of the book was $26.87 ($19.50 x 1.25).
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item in the meal:  Chicken - 5 chickens x $3 per chicken = $15 Beef - 4 steaks x $3 per steak = $12 Fish - 4 fish x $1.50 per fish = $6 Salads - 4 salads x $1.50 per salad = $6 Total Cost = $15 + $12 + $6 + $6 = $40 Now, let's calculate the profit margin for each item: Profit Margin (%) = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost To find the selling price that will give us a 20% profit margin, we can use the following formula: Selling Price = Cost x (1 + Profit Margin) So, if we want a 20% profit margin, we can set up the equation like this: Selling Price = $40 x (1 + 0.20) = $40 x 1.20 = $48 Therefore, the selling price for each meal should be $48. To calculate the number of portions needed to sell at this price and still make a profit, we can use the following formula: Number of Portions Needed = Total Cost / Selling Price So, in this case: Number of Portions Needed = $40 / $48 = 0.83 or 83% To round up, we would need to sell at least 84 portions (83% x 100) to break even and make a profit.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each type of pajamas costs per unit.  For short sleeve pajamas, it is $16.50 / 3 = $5.50 per unit.  For long sleeve pajamas, it is $22.50 / 3 = $7.50 per unit.  And for nightdresses, it is $42 / 3 = $14 per unit.  Now that we have the cost per unit, let's calculate the total amount MyShkieh will get from selling all three types of pajamas.  Total amount for short sleeve pajamas = 3 x $5.50 = $16.50  Total amount for long sleeve pajamas = 3 x $7.50 = $22.50  Total amount for nightdresses = 3 x $14 = $42
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much she will spend on each cup of coffee if she buys 15 cups in one go.  We know that the price per cup is $4, so for 15 cups, it would be:  15 x $4 = $60  Now, let's calculate how much she will save after 60 days if she spends $60 on coffee during those 60 days.  To do this, we need to divide the amount she spent ($60) by the number of days (60):  60 / 60 = 1  So, she will save nothing! She will spend all $60 on coffee within 60 days and won't have any savings left.
Response:  First, we know that he traveled for 60 miles and stopped after 20 miles. So, he drove for 40 miles (60 - 20). Now, let's calculate how much fuel he used during this part of the trip. We know that his first tank held 15 kiloliters, so he used 15/40 = 37.5% of his fuel during the first part of the trip. Next, we need to find out how far he went between the two stops. Since he drove for 40 miles and then stopped again, we can assume that he drove an additional 20 miles (since he stopped after driving for 40 miles) beyond the first stop. Therefore, the total distance he traveled between the two stops is 20 + 40 = 60 miles. Finally, we can calculate how much fuel he used during the entire trip by multiplying the percentage of fuel used during the first part of the trip by the total distance traveled between the two stops: 37.5% x 60 miles = 22.5 liters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each of the two pairs of socks costs $33 and $40 respectively. Therefore, the total cost of one pair is $33 + $40 = $73. Since Galia wants to buy two pairs, she needs to pay twice this amount, which is $2 \times $73 = $146. So, the price of the two pairs of socks for Galia is $146.
Response:  First, we know that the total gil of Darel and Elan is 7:11. If their current combined age is 162, then we can find Elan's age as follows: We know that Darel is 7 years older than Elan, so if Darel is currently x years old, Elan is x - 7 years old. Since their combined age is 162, we can set up the equation: x + (x - 7) = 162. Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x - 7 = 162. Solving for x, we get: x = 83. Therefore, Elan is 83 - 7 = 76 years old.
Response: 1) The first person said that there are 80% of the time when the ball is in the basket. This means that the probability of the ball being in the basket is 0.8 or 8/10. 2) The second person said that there are 20 more times when the ball is not in the basket than when it is. This means that the probability of the ball not being in the basket is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 2/10. 3) The third person said that there are 25% more times when the ball is not in the basket than when it is. This means that the probability of the ball not being in the basket is 0.25 x 0.2 = 0.05 or 5/100. Now we need to find the average of these three probabilities. To do this, we add them up and divide by the number of people who gave an answer: (0.8 + 0.2 + 0.05) / 3 = 0.975 or 97.5%. So, according to the three people, the probability of the ball being in the basket is approximately 97.5%.
Response: 1) There are 10 dogs in total. 2) Each dog spends 0.5 hours per day for exercise and training (on average). 3) To calculate the total time spent on exercising and training all dogs in one week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the amount of time each dog spends on exercise and training per day. 4) Therefore, the total time spent on exercising and training all dogs in one week is: 10 dogs x 0.5 hours/dog/day = 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.
Response:  We know that there are 110 coins in total and 30 of them are gold coins. So we can say that there are 80 non-gold coins (110 - 30 = 80). Now, if each gold coin is worth more than the silver coins, then we can assume that the number of silver coins is greater than or equal to the number of gold coins. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  80 + x >= 30 where x represents the number of silver coins. Solving for x, we get:  x >= 50 Since we know that there are exactly 80 non-gold coins, we can substitute x with 80 and solve for the number of gold coins:  80 + 80 >= 30 160 >= 30 130 >= 30 There are 130 gold coins in total.
Response:  If Aron has 5 more than half of Raymund's number of exercises, and Raymund has 40 exercises, then we can set up an equation to represent the situation.  Let R be the number of exercises Raymund has (R = 40).  Since Aron has 5 more than half of Raymund's exercises, Aron has:  A = R + 5/2 = R + 25/2 = R + 12.5 So, Aron has 12.5 more exercises than Raymund. Now, let's find out how many exercises are in total. We know that Raymund has 40 exercises, so the total number of exercises is: T = R + A = 40 + 12.5 = 52.5 Therefore, there are 52.5 exercises in total.
Response: 1) In the first 20 seconds, he scored 4 points. 2) In the last 20 seconds, he scored 25% more than in the first 20 seconds. So, in the last 20 seconds, he scored (4 x 1.25) = 5 points. 3) Therefore, his total score is 4 + 5 = 9 points.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Tri earns per yogurt sold. We know that he sells each yogurt for $5 and buys them at $4, so his profit is: Profit = Selling Price - Buying Price = $5 - $4 = $1 per yogurt. Now, let's calculate how many yogurts Tri needs to sell in order to earn $30 over 30 days. We can use the formula: Total Sales = Daily Sales x Number of Days = $1 x 30 = $30. So, Tri needs to sell 30 yogurts per day to earn $30 over 30 days.
Response:  First, we know that Jon has 13 coins and he sells each coin for $15. So, if he sells all of his coins, he will have $15 x 13 = $195. But then he spends $20 to buy 8 toys and $5 to buy 5 candies, so he is left with $195 - $20 - $5 = $170. Therefore, Jon has $170 remaining after buying the toys and candies.
Response:  Jon ran for 100 km in one week. He ran three days in a row. On the first day, he ran for 3 hours and half of the second day. So, let's calculate how far he ran each day: Day 1: 3 hours x 10 km/hour = 30 km Day 2: Half of 2nd day = (2 hours) x 10 km/hour = 20 km Total distance run per week: 30 km + 20 km = 50 km
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Danah can run at a speed of 4 miles per hour for an indefinite amount of time. Secondly, she can jump at a speed of 3 miles per hour for half an hour. Now, let's calculate how many miles Danah can travel in total if she runs and jumps alternately.  To do this, we need to find out how far Danah can travel during each hour of running and jumping separately.  When Danah runs, she covers 4 miles per hour, so she can cover 4 x 1 = 4 miles in one hour.  When Danah jumps, she covers 3 miles per hour, so she can cover 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 miles in half an hour (since she jumps for only half an hour).  Therefore, the total distance Danah can travel in one hour is:  
Total Distance = Running Distance + Jumping Distance Total Distance = 4 miles/hour + 1.5 miles/half-hour Total Distance = 5.5 miles/hour  Since Danah has 8 hours to travel, she can cover:  
Total Distance = 5.5 miles/hour x 8 hours Total Distance = 44 miles  So, Danah can travel 44 miles in 8 hours if she runs and jumps alternately."
Response: 1) The brand owner is 4 times older than his son. 2) His son is 2 years younger than Susie. 3) Susie is 16 years old. So, we can write an equation based on these statements:  Brand Owner's Age = 4 x Son's Age + 2 x Susie's Age  Now we know that Susie is 16 years old, so we can substitute her age into the equation:  Brand Owner's Age = 4 x Son's Age + 2 x 16  We also know that the son is 2 years younger than Susie, so we can find his age by subtracting 2 from 16:  Son's Age = 16 - 2 = 14  Now we have all the information we need to solve for the brand owner's age:  Brand Owner's Age = 4 x 14 + 2 x 16 = 56 + 32 = 88  Therefore, the brand owner is 88 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Polly can throw the stone up to 400 meters away from her hand. This means she has enough force in her arm and shoulder muscles to propel the stone at least this far. Now let's consider how much farther she could have thrown it if she had used all of her strength instead of just three-quarters of it as she did when throwing at the rocky outcropping. We will assume that using all of her strength would allow her to throw the stone an additional 50% more than what she achieved before (i.e., 600 meters). So now our new maximum distance for Polly's throw is 600 + 400 = 1000 meters! That's right - with full strength behind it, Polly could potentially fling that heavy boulder clear across the valley floor and still hit her target!
Response:  Firstly, we know that each guest received five pieces of pastry (since they had five courses). Secondly, we know that there were four guests in total (as mentioned at the end of the passage). Therefore, if we multiply the number of guests by the number of pieces of pastry per guest, we get: 4 guests x 5 pieces/guest = 20 pieces of pastry consumed by all the guests.
Response:  First, we know that there are 250 calories in one serving of ice cream.  If you want to eat three servings (3 x 250 = 750 calories), and your daily recommended intake is 2000 calories, then you have already consumed 1800 calories (2000 - 750). Therefore, you can only eat two servings of ice cream (2 x 250 = 500 calories) without exceeding your daily limit.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sharly will make if he sells all 20 candles for $2 each.  We know that there are 10 candles in a box and each box costs $10. So, if Sharly sells all 20 candles, he will make:  20 x $2 = $40 per box x 5 boxes = $200 If Sharly sells all 20 candles for $2 each, he will make $200. Now let's calculate his profit. He spent $10 on each box of candles, so he spent a total of:  5 boxes x $10 = $50 To find out his profit, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made: $200 - $50 = $150 That means Sharly will make a profit of $150 if he sells all 20 candles for $2 each.
Response: 1) The blogger writes for 4 hours each day (20 hours per week). 2) She wrote 5 articles in two days and half of one article on another day (let's assume she spent 2 hours on that article). 3) On the third day, she wrote fewer articles than usual (we'll say she spent 4 hours writing 3 articles). Total number of hours spent writing articles during the week = 20 hours x 7 days = 140 hours. Number of articles written during the week = 5 + 3 = 8 articles.
Response:  First, we know that there were 23 Post-its in total. Second, we know that she bought a pack of 80 Post-its. Third, we know that she used one Post-it per cup of coffee. Fourth, we know that there were 220 cups of coffee in total. So, if she used one Post-it per cup, then she used 220 Post-its in total. Now, let's calculate how many Post-its were left over. We can do this by subtracting the number of Post-its she used (220) from the number of Post-its in the pack (80): 80 - 220 = -140 There are negative numbers because she ran out of Post-its before finishing her work. In other words, she had to stop working after using up all the Post-its she had. Therefore, there were 140 Post-its left over.
Response:  First, we know that Jon sold 200 units of his product at $40 each, for a total of $8,000 (200 x $40).  Next, we know that he spent $50 more per unit to produce the new version, so the cost of producing the new version is:  Cost = $40 + $50 = $90 per unit.  Since Jon sold 200 units of the new version, the total cost of producing the new version is: Total Cost = 200 x $90 = $18,000.  Finally, we can calculate how much profit Jon made from selling the new version: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $8,000 - $18,000 = -$10,000 or -$50 per unit.  So, Jon lost $50 per unit on the new version.
Response:  We know that the length of the chute is 15 meters and we want to find out how many hooks are needed to support the weight of the tree trunk in the garden. First, let's calculate the cross-sectional area of the chute. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = l x w, where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the width of the chute is not given, so we will assume it is equal to the length (15 m). Therefore, the area of the chute is: A = 15 x 15 = 225 square meters. Next, we need to determine the weight of the tree trunk. The weight of a tree trunk depends on its diameter and height, but since these values are not provided, we will assume an average weight per cubic meter of wood. According to one estimate, the weight of dry wood is approximately 700 kg/m^3. Therefore, if we assume that the tree trunk has a diameter of about 1 meter (based on the fact that the chute is 15 meters long), then the volume of the trunk would be approximately 1 m x 1 m x 15 m = 15 cubic meters. The weight of the trunk would therefore be: W = 15 x 700 = 10,500 kg. Now that we have the weight and area of the chute, we can calculate the number of hooks required using the following formula: N = W / (A x g), where N is the number of hooks, W is the weight of the load, A is the area of the chute, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (assumed to be 9.8 m/s^2). Plugging in the values, we get: N = 10,500 / (225 x 9.8) = 46.67 hooks. So, based on our calculations, you would need approximately 47 hooks to support the weight of the tree trunk in the garden.
Response:  We know that each floor has 8 apartments and 3/4 of the building is occupied. So we need to find out how many apartments are not occupied.  To do this, we can subtract the number of occupied apartments from the total number of apartments in the building. Total number of apartments = Number of floors x Number of apartments per floor = 15 x 8 = 120 apartments Number of occupied apartments = 3/4 x 120 = 90 apartments Therefore, there are 90 unoccupied apartments in the building.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Levi makes per day from selling eggs. We know that he sells 252 eggs per day at $2 each, so his daily income is:  

$2 x 252 = $504 per day  Next, we need to calculate how much money Levi makes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so if he earns $504 per day, then he earns:  

$504 x 7 = $3,528 per week Finally, we can calculate how much money Levi makes in a month by multiplying his weekly income by 4 weeks:  

$3,528 x 4 = $14,112 per month So, Levi makes $14,112 per month selling eggs."
Response:  First, we know that Tom can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour. We also know that he takes 1 to 4 hours to reach his destination. This means that he travels for 1/4 of an hour (or 25% of an hour). To find out how long it takes him to return, we need to divide the distance traveled by his speed: Distance = Speed x Time So, in this case, Distance = 10 miles/hour x 25% of an hour = 2.5 miles Therefore, it takes Tom 2.5 hours to return home.
Response: 1) The weight of one comic book is 5 kg. 2) The total weight of 30 comic books is 30 x 5 = 150 kg. 3) Since each bag can hold up to 50 kg, he needs 3 bags (150 / 50 = 3). Therefore, he needs 3 x 5 = 15 bags.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much the mechanic earns per day for each type of repair. For every car engine repaired, the mechanic earns $60, and for every other type of repair (e.g., transmission), the mechanic earns $40. On Monday, the mechanic repairs six car engines and four transmissions, so their total earnings for the day are: 6 x $60 + 4 x $40 = $360 + $160 = $520. On Tuesday, the mechanic does not repair any car engines but instead works on 12 transmissions, so their total earnings for the day are: 12 x $40 = $480. Therefore, the mechanic earns more on Tuesday with the higher earnings from the transmissions. The difference in earnings between Monday and Tuesday is: $520 - $480 = $40.
Response:  We know that each of the two houses has three children, so there are six children in total.  Now we need to find out how many grandchildren there are in total.  Since Pesha gave birth to three more children after her marriage, and Triesi gave birth to twelve children, we can calculate as follows:  Total number of grandchildren = (3 + 12) x 2 = (15) x 2 = 30 grandchildren.  Therefore, there are currently 30 grandchildren in the family.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gin has 30 cards in total and she eats two meals per day (morning and evening). So, if she wants to arrange two meals for each of her 30 days, she will need 60 meal portions in total (2 x 30 = 60). Now, let's calculate how many portions of food Gin can buy with $100. Since each meal portion costs $5, Gin can buy 60 / $5 = 12 meal portions with $100. Therefore, Gin can buy 12 breakfast portions and 12 evening portions, which is a total of 24 meal portions.
Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 for the week and he spends $7 on a ticket to see one movie. So, if he wants to go to the movies $42 - $7 = $35 times. Therefore, Peter can go to the movies $35 times this week.
Response:  First, we know that each crate weighs 15 kg and there are 5000 crates in total. So the total weight of all the crates is:  5000 x 15 = 75,000 kg Now, we need to find out how many crates can be transported without exceeding the maximum weight limit of the bridge, which is 3755 tons (3755 x 1000 = 3755000 kg). To do this, we divide the total weight of all the crates by the maximum weight limit of the bridge:  75,000 / 3755 = approximately 20 crates Can you transport 20 crates over the bridge without exceeding the maximum weight limit?
Response:  First, we know that Stevan sold his product for $40. This is because he received $40 in his bank account after the transaction was completed. Next, we know that as a salesman, he had to pay a commission of 25% on the sale price. So, what was the original price of the product before the commission was applied? To find this out, we can use the fact that the commission amount is equal to 25% of the original price. In other words, if the commission amount is $10 (which is given), then the original price must have been $40 x 1.25 = $50. Therefore, the original price of the product before the commission was applied was $50. Finally, we are told that Stevan added a tip of $4 to the total cost. So, what was the final amount that Stevan received from the customer? We can calculate this by adding the original price ($50) to the tip amount ($4): $50 + $4 = $54. Therefore, the final amount that Stevan received from the customer was $54.
Response:  We have 6 groups of 20 flowers each and 67 scattered flowers in total. To find out how many flowers there are altogether, we need to add up all these numbers.  Group 1: 20 flowers x 6 groups = 120 flowers Group 2: 20 flowers x 6 groups = 120 flowers Group 3: 20 flowers x 6 groups = 120 flowers Group 4: 20 flowers x 6 groups = 120 flowers Group 5: 20 flowers x 6 groups = 120 flowers Group 6: 20 flowers x 6 groups = 120 flowers Scattered flowers: 67 flowers Total number of flowers: 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 120 + 67 = 840 flowers Therefore, there are 840 flowers in total.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 items in total and one of them is bad (so-called ""reject""). This means that the probability of picking a bad item is 1/25 or approximately 4%. Now, let's consider the remaining 24 items. We know that 20% of them are not good (i.e., they are defective). So, if we randomly select one of these 24 items, the probability that it will be defective is 20% or 1 in 5. Therefore, the probability that any given item is good is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 or 80%. Now, to find out how many good items there are among the 25 items, we can multiply the number of items by the probability that each item is good: 25 x 0.8 = 20. So, there are 20 good items among the 25 items."
Response:  First, she spent $500 for materials to make the product. Then, she spent another $800 for the packaging and marketing of the product. In total, she spent $1300. Next, she earned 10% of her investment back, which is $130 (10% of $1300). Therefore, she earned a profit of $130 - $1300 = $1170. So, she made a profit of $1170.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much she will receive each year for the first 20 years.  Since she receives $50,000 per year and gets a 5% raise each year, her salary after 20 years will be:  
Salary after 20 years = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^20  Salary after 20 years = $50,000 x 2.6789  Salary after 20 years = $133,945  Now that we have calculated her salary after 20 years, let's find out what her pension will be if she retires after 30 years.  Her pension will be based on her final salary, which is $133,945.  If she retires after 30 years, she will receive:  Pension = Final salary x Years of service  Pension = $133,945 x 30  Pension = $4,018,350  So, if Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and retires after 30 years, her pension will be approximately $4,018,350."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount that Elina paid for the service over the course of the year: 140 dollars x 12 months = 1680 dollars. Next, we need to calculate the percentage discount that Elina received for the first half of the year: 10% of 800 dollars (the first half of the year) is 80 dollars. So, Elina paid 800 dollars + 80 dollars = 880 dollars for the first half of the year. Now, let's calculate the total amount that Elina paid for the entire year, including the discount she received for the first half: 880 dollars + 800 dollars = 1680 dollars. Therefore, the total amount that Elina paid for the service over the course of the year was 1680 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sofia has traveled 160 km since her last fill-up and she needs to add 4 liters of diesel to her tank to refill it completely. According to the user manual of her car, the fuel tank can hold 12 gallons (gallons) of diesel. Now, let's convert kilometers to gallons: 1 kilometer = 0.62 miles = 0.59 gallons (approximately) So, Sofia has traveled approximately 278 miles (160 km x 0.59 gal/km). To calculate how many gallons of diesel she needs, we can use the following formula: Total Gallons = Total Miles / MPG (miles per gallon) where MPG is the average mileage of the car. Since the user manual doesn't provide the exact MPG rating for Sofia's car, we will assume an average MPG rating of 25 miles per gallon for diesel cars in Israel. Therefore, Total Gallons = 278 miles / 25 MPG = 11.12 gallons (rounded up to the nearest whole number) So, Sofia needs approximately 11.12 gallons of diesel to refill her tank completely.
Response:  We know that Gideon watches TV for 3 hours each day and spends half of his time reading (i.e., 1/2 hour). So, he spends 3 hours x 7 days = 21 hours watching TV per week. Since he reads for half of the time he spends watching TV, he spends an additional 21 hours / 2 = 10.5 hours reading per week. Therefore, Gideon spends a total of 21 + 10.5 = 31.5 hours per week engaging in these activities.
Response:  We know that each school has four classes (kindergarten and three grades). Each class has five students, so there are 4 x 5 = 20 students in each school. Since each school sends two teams to the tournament (one for kindergarten and one for grades), we have 20 x 2 = 40 students from each school participating in the tournament. In total, then, there will be 40 x 6 schools = 240 participants in the tournament.
"Response:  We know that there were 175 coffins in total, and 35 of them contained fewer bones than usual. This means that we have 140 coffins with normal contents (since 35 x 2 = 70). Each coffin had an average of 8-10 bones (based on the information given), so the total number of bones was:  
140 coffins x 8-10 bones per coffin = 1120 - 1400 bones  Since some coffins contained more bones than others, let's assume that the average number of bones per coffin is 9 (a little less than 10 to be conservative):  
140 coffins x 9 bones per coffin = 1260 bones  Therefore, there were approximately 1260 bones found in the tomb."
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls in the school and each class has 5 students. So, if we divide 60 by 5, we get: 60 / 5 = 12 classes. Since each class has 5 students, there are 12 x 5 = 60 teachers in total.
Response:  First, we know that Bayli has $100 at the beginning of the period and she spends $5 per week for 8 weeks. So, how much money does Bayli have after 8 weeks? We can calculate this as follows: Total amount spent = Number of weeks x Amount spent per week Total amount spent = 8 weeks x $5 Total amount spent = $40 Now, let's check if Bayli has enough money to buy the necklace. Necklace price = $100 - Total amount spent Necklace price = $100 - $40 Necklace price = $60 Therefore, Bayli has enough money to buy the necklace. She started with $100 and spent $40 over 8 weeks, so she has $60 left to spend on the necklace.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money the dance teacher earns per day.  To do this, we divide the number of lessons she teaches per day (5) by the number of students in each class (15): 5 lessons/day x 15 students/lesson = 75 students/day.  Now, let's multiply the number of students she teaches per day by her hourly rate ($15): 75 students/day x $15/hour = $1,125/day.  Since there are 7 days in a week, the total amount she earns in one week is: $1,125/day x 7 days/week = $7,925/week.  Finally, since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total amount she earns in one month is: $7,925/week x 4 weeks/month = $31,700/month.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two types of meals - one with 20 portions and another with more than 20 portions (exact number not given). We need to find out how many portions in total for both meals so that Kalian can cook them.  Total Portion Count = Number of Portions in first Meal + Number of Portions in second Meal.  Therefore, the total portion count would be:  Total Portion Count = 20 + (more than 20) = 20 + x  where x is the exact number of portions in the second meal. To determine x, we don't have enough information. So, the answer cannot be determined precisely without additional data.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Tomi will get from selling each egg and each carton of eggs.  To do this, we need to divide the price he is asking for each item by the number of items he has.  For the eggs, he is asking for $3 per dozen, so if he sells 43 dozen eggs, he will get:  

$3 x 43 = $130  For the cartons of eggs, he is asking for $4 per carton, so if he sells 23 cartons, he will get:  

$4 x 23 = $92  Now that we have calculated how much money Tomi will get from selling each item, let's add up all of these amounts to find out how much total money he will make:  

$130 + $92 = $222  So, in total, Tomi will make $222 from selling his eggs and cartons of eggs."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Shila will pay for each phone in total. We know that she paid NIS 150 per phone and there were five phones in total. So, the total amount she paid is: Total = 150 x 5 = 750 Sheilah also paid three monthly installments of 2% interest on the total amount. To calculate the interest, we can use the formula: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time Period Where: Principal = Total Amount (which is 750) Rate = Monthly interest rate (which is 2%) Time Period = Number of months (which is 3) Interest = 750 x 2 x 3 = 450 Now, let's add the principal and the interest to find out how much Shila paid in total over the three months: Total = Principal + Interest = 750 + 450 = 1,200 Therefore, Shila paid NIS 1,200 over the course of three months.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of flower that Arti is selling.  For chamomile, the cost per stem is $2.74, so if he sells 12 stems, the total cost would be:  12 x $2.74 = $33.08  For petunias, the cost per stem is $1.87, so if he sells 9 stems, the total cost would be:  9 x $1.87 = $16.83  For begonias, the cost per stem is $2.12, so if he sells 17 stems, the total cost would be:  17 x $2.12 = $35.54  Now let's add up all these costs to find out how much Arti will make in total:  $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.54 = $85.45  So, Arti will make a total of $85.45 from selling these flowers today.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the height of each floor is half the length of the building (50 meters), so the height of each floor is 25 meters.  Secondly, we are given that there are four floors in total and the top floor has 16 apartments. Therefore, to find out how many apartments are on each floor, we can divide the number of apartments on the top floor by the number of floors: 16/4 = 4 apartments per floor.  So, the answer is 4 apartments per floor.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many cups of dog food Sesilah needs in her first year. According to the manufacturer's recommendation, she should eat 3 meals a day for 180 days. So, she will need:  
3 meals/day x 180 days = 540 meals/year  
Since each cup of dog food contains 110 grams, Sesilah will need:  
540 meals/year x 110 grams/cup = 59,400 grams/year  
Now, let's calculate how much dog food Sesilah will use during her entire life (assuming an average lifespan of 12 years). We know that she will need to eat 2 cups of dog food per day after her first year, so we can estimate her daily consumption as follows:  
2 cups/day x 365 days/year x 12 years = 7,940 cups/year  
Therefore, Sesilah will use approximately:  
7,940 cups/year x 110 grams/cup = 873,800 grams/year  
So, Sesilah will use about 873,800 grams of dog food during her entire life."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much of each ingredient is needed for one serving of each recipe.  For Raymund's recipe, we know that he needs 1/2 cup (or 8 ounces) of flour and 1/4 cup (or 4 ounces) of butter.  For David's recipe, we know that she needs 4 cups (or 32 ounces) of flour and 1/2 cup (or 8 ounces) of butter.  Now, let's calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed for both recipes.  To do this, we simply multiply the number of servings by the amount of each ingredient needed per serving.  For Raymund's recipe, we have:  Total flour = Number of servings x Amount of flour per serving  Total flour = 6 x 1/2 cup  Total flour = 3 cups  Total butter = Number of servings x Amount of butter per serving  Total butter = 6 x 1/4 cup  Total butter = 1-1/2 cups  For David's recipe, we have:  Total flour = Number of servings x Amount of flour per serving  Total flour = 8 x 4 cups  Total flour = 32 cups  Total butter = Number of servings x Amount of butter per serving  Total butter = 8 x 1/2 cup  Total butter = 4 cups  Now, let's compare the amounts of each ingredient needed for both recipes.  We can see that Raymund's recipe requires less flour (3 cups vs. 32 cups) and less butter (1-1/2 cups vs. 4 cups).  So, if Sarah wants to make enough cookies for both Raymund and David, she will need more flour and butter for David's recipe than for Raymund's recipe.  Here are the exact amounts needed for each recipe based on the information given:  Raymund's Recipe:  Flour: 3 cups Butter: 1-1/2 cups David'
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Vincent will spend if he buys 18 flowers at $3.25 each. We can do this by multiplying 18 (the number of flowers) by $3.25 (the price per flower): 18 x $3.25 = $61. So, Vincent will spend $61 if he buys 18 flowers at $3.25 each. Now, let's compare this amount to what he would have spent if he had bought the flowers at $2.50 each. To do this, we can subtract the cost of the flowers at $2.50 each from the cost at $3.25 each: $61 - $48 = $13. This means that Vincent is spending an additional $13 by buying the flowers at $3.25 each instead of $2.50 each. Therefore, the total amount of money Vincent will spend on 18 flowers is $61.
Response:  First, we know that Jon bought the dog for $100.  Second, we know that he paid 30% of the price as a deposit. Third, we want to find out how much he needs to pay in total to get the dog. So let's start with what we know: 100 x 0.7 =?  That gives us: 100 x 0.7 = 70  Now we can subtract the deposit from the total cost: 100 - 70 =?  That gives us: 100 - 70 = 30  Therefore, Jon needs to pay $30 more to get the dog.
Response:  We know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 24 / 6 = 4 liters each. So together they received 4 + 4 = 8 liters of water. Now we are told that a boy received 6 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water left over is 24 - 8 = 16 liters.
"Response:  First, Tz'ruli had 10 medabakim (medal-shaped containers). He bought 21 more from the store and received 23 as gifts for his birthday. So, he has a total of:  
21 + 23 = 44 medabakim Now, he gave 9 to his sister, so he is left with:  
44 - 9 = 35 medabakim Therefore, there are 35 medabakim remaining for Tz'ruli."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Alex has $40 and Geri has $30. Secondly, we are told that Alex spends less than Geri on each item. So, let's assume that Alex pays $x for an item, where x is some number. Since Geri pays more than Alex, we can write an inequality: 
Geri's cost > Alex's cost We know that Geri has $30, so her total cost for all items must be at least $30. Therefore, we can write another inequality: 
Total cost of all items > $30 We can now substitute Alex's cost into this inequality: 
$30 > $x + (x + 1) +... + (x + n-1) Where n is the number of items purchased by both Alex and Geri. Simplifying this inequality, we get: 
n > 30 / ($x + 1) Solving for n, we get: 
n < $30 / ($x + 1) This tells us that the minimum number of items that Geri must purchase in order to spend more than Alex is: 
n < $30 / ($x + 1) Now, we need to find out what value of x makes this expression smallest. To do this, we can take the derivative of the expression with respect to x and set it equal to zero: 
d/dx [$30 / ($x + 1)] = 0 Setting this equal to zero and solving for x, we get: 
x = $30 / 2 = $15 Therefore, the minimum number of items that Geri must purchase in order to spend more than Alex is: 
n < $30 / ($15 + 1) = 2 So, Geri must purchase at least two items in order to spend more than Alex."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 shachis (groups) of radim (radishes). Each group has 25 radishes. Secondly, each radish has 8 kutzim (stems). Therefore, to find out how many stems in total, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of radishes in each group and then multiply again by the number of stems per radish. So, the calculation would be as follows: Total number of stems = Number of groups x Number of radishes per group x Number of stems per radish Total number of stems = 3 x 25 x 8 = 400 stems
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 22 players in total and they played 22 games each. So, if they won 8 more than what they lost, it means they won 8 + 22 = 30 games in total. Therefore, out of 30 games, they won 30 - 22 = 8 games.
Response: 1) He has one hole from each of his previous marriages (a total of four holes). 2) Each hole is worth half of what he had in that marriage (since he gave her half of everything when they got married). 3) So, for each hole, he lost half of what he had in that marriage. 4) Since he was married four times, he lost a total of 2 x 4 = 8 holes. 5) Therefore, he has 8 holes left from all his previous marriages.
Response:  In the first day, Garg had three fits of laughter and each fit lasted for half an hour. So he laughed for a total of 3 x 0.5 = 1.5 hours that day.  On the second day, he had four fits of laughter, but they were shorter, lasting only one-third of the time as before. So he laughed for a total of 4 x 0.33 = 1.32 hours that day.  On the third day, his fits of laughter were even shorter, lasting only half as long as the previous day. So he laughed for a total of 4 x 0.5 = 2 hours that day.  Therefore, in total, Garg laughed for 1.5 + 1.32 + 2 = 4.82 hours over the three days.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Sarah received from her employer over the five years she worked there. We know that she earned $600 per month and worked for five years, so the total amount is: Total = 600 x 12 x 5 = $36,000 Now, we need to calculate the percentage increase in salary each year. Since the company increased the salaries of all employees by 10%, we can assume that Sarah's salary also increased by 10%. So, the first year's salary would be: Year 1 = $36,000 x 1.10 = $40,800 The second year's salary would be: Year 2 = $40,800 x 1.10 = $45,040 And so on... until the fifth year: Year 5 = $45,040 x 1.10 = $50,040 Therefore, after five years, Sarah's annual salary would have been: Annual Salary After Five Years = $50,040 To find out how much Sarah would receive if she were to leave the company after only three years, we need to calculate the total amount she would have received up to that point. Based on our previous calculations, the total amount would be: Total Up to Three Years = $36,000 + ($40,800 x 3) = $36,000 + ($122,400) = $158,400
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 88,000 copies of her album for $10 each. So, she made $880,000 in total. If we divide this amount by the number of albums she sold, we get the price per album: $880,000 / 88,000 albums = $10 per album. Therefore, if Harry sold 88,000 albums at $10 each, he would have made $880,000 as well.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each guest will pay for attending the party. We know that there are 16 guests in total and they have been invited to bring $2 per person as a gift. So, if we multiply 16 (guests) x 2 (gift amount), we get: Total gifts = 32 dollars. Now, let's move on to calculating the total cost of the party. We know that Chris wants to spend $75 on decorations, food, drinks, etc., but only 12 out of her 16 guests are actually coming. To find out how much she needs to spend per head, we can divide the total cost by the number of attendees: Total cost / Number of attendees = Cost per head. In this case, we have: Total cost = 75 dollars Number of attendees = 12 guests Cost per head = 75 dollars / 12 guests = $6.25 per head. Therefore, Chris needs to spend approximately $6.25 per head to host the party.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that each adult will eat 10 kg of salad and each child will eat half of what an adult eats. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children in the picnic, the total amount of salad consumed by adults would be:  
20 x 10 = 200 kg  And the total amount of salad consumed by children would be:  
5 x (1/2) = 2.5 kg  Therefore, the total amount of salad needed for the picnic would be:  
200 + 2.5 = 202.5 kg"
Response:  If there are three more desirable lives for each of the two sandy beaches, then there will be six more desirable lives in total (3 x 2 = 6).  Now, if we divide these six lives equally among the three beaches, each beach will have two more desirable lives (6 / 3 = 2).  So, to summarize:  There will be two more desirable lives for each of the three beaches.
Response:  We know that Jack is 5 years older than James and 2 years younger than George. So we can start with some basic equations based on these facts: 1) Jack is 5 years older than James: J = G + 5 (where G is James' age) 2) Jack is 2 years younger than George: J = G - 2 (where G is George's age) Now we need to find out how old George is. To do this, we can substitute equation 1 into equation 2: J = G + 5 - 2 Substituting J = 10 (given in the problem), we get: 10 = G + 3 Solving for G, we get: G = 7 Therefore, George is 7 years old. Finally, we can use equation 1 again to find Jack's age: J = G + 5 Substituting G = 7, we get: J = 7 + 5 = 12 So Jack is 12 years old.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Gerald ran 400 meters in 38 seconds with his original diet. Now, if Li runs 400 meters in 38 seconds with his new diet (which reduces his time by 10%), then he will run it in:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
= 400 m / (0.9 \* 38 s/400 m)  
= 400 m / 35.2 s  
= 11.36 seconds!"
Response:  We know that there are 60 calves in total and each calf has two chattels (cows). So, the number of cows is twice the number of calves, or 60 x 2 = 120 cows. Now we need to find out how many sheep are needed to make up the remaining 12% of the total livestock. To do this, we can use the following formula: Total Livestock = Number of Calves + Number of Sheep. Substituting the values we have found so far, we get: Total Livestock = 60 + X Where X is the number of sheep needed to make up the remaining 12%. Since we want the number of sheep to be 12% of the total livestock, we can set up the equation as follows: X = 0.12 x Total Livestock. Substituting the value of Total Livestock from the previous equation, we get: X = 0.12 x 60 + X = 7.2 + X. Solving for X, we get: X = 96. Therefore, there would be 96 sheep needed to make up the remaining 12% of the total livestock in the farm.
Response:  First, we know that there are 200 students in the fifth grade and 2/5 of them are boys. This means that the number of boys is 2 x 200 / 5 = 40. Now, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the choir. So, if there are 200 - 40 = 160 girls, then 2/3 of them are in the choir, which is 160 x 2/3 = 80. Therefore, there are 80 girls who are not in the choir.
Response: 1) The total time Harry slept was 9 hours (given). 2) James slept for only 2 hours less than Harry (also given). Therefore, James slept for 7 hours (9 - 2 = 7). So, Harry slept for 9 hours and James slept for 7 hours.
Response:  We know that Pardea used 40 grams of flour to make three cookies (3 x 12 = 36). Each cookie had 8 ounces of dough (32 ounces total), so each ounce of dough made 4 cookies (32 / 8 = 4). Therefore, Pardea used 40 grams of flour to make 40/4 = 10 cookies.
"Response:  We know that there are 30 cars in total and we need to find out how many of them passed through the first 15 checkpoints.  Firstly, we can say that 15 cars passed through the first 15 checkpoints because they were not stopped at any of them. Now let's calculate how many cars passed through each checkpoint. There are 20 checkpoints after the first 15, so if each car passes through an average of 15 checkpoints (since some cars pass through more than one checkpoint), then the number of cars passing through each checkpoint is:  

20 checkpoints x 15 cars per checkpoint = 300 cars passing through each checkpoint.  Since 15 cars did not stop at any checkpoint, we can subtract 15 from 300 to get the number of cars that passed through the first 15 checkpoints:  

300 - 15 = 285 cars passed through the first 15 checkpoints."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary has 18 new chicks in her coop and she already has two chickens in each of her 40 hen houses. So, if we multiply 2 (the number of chickens per house) x 40 (the number of hen houses), we get 80 chickens in total. Now, let's subtract the 18 new chicks from the total number of chickens to find out how many chickens Mary will have after giving away some chickens tomorrow. Therefore, 80 - 18 = 62 chickens. So, Mary will have 62 chickens left after giving away some chickens tomorrow.
Response:  First, we know that the first friend hit the door 20 times before it opened. Second, we know that the second friend hit the door 1/4 more times than the first friend, so if the first friend hit the door 20 times, the second friend hit the door 5 times (20 x 4 = 80). Third, we know that the third friend hit the door 10 times more than the second friend, so if the second friend hit the door 5 times, the third friend hit the door 15 times (5 x 10 = 50). Finally, we know that the fourth friend hit the door 60 times in total. So, to find out how many times the fourth friend hit the door, we need to add up all of the previous numbers: 20 + 5 + 15 = 40. Therefore, the fourth friend hit the door 40 times.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many pages Sol needs to read in total. We know that he has to read 4 pages from his science book, 20 pages from his social studies book, 7 pages from his history book, and 8 pages from his geography book. In total, this is: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.  Now, we know that Sol reads 15 pages per day. So, if he has 4 days left to finish all of his reading, he will need to read: 39 pages / 15 pages per day = 2.6 pages per day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jon drinks one cup of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), so he drinks three cups of water per day. However, at the end of the week, Jon likes to relax and drink a fourth cup of water with his evening meal instead of his usual breakfast or lunch. Therefore, Jon drinks four cups of water per day during the week, and five cups of water per day overall for the entire week.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity are needed to power each light for one hour. We know that there are 3600 seconds in an hour and each light consumes 1 kWh per 1000 seconds. So, for one hour, each light will consume:  

1 kWh / 1000 s = 0.001 kWh/s 

Now, let's calculate how many hours it would take to illuminate the entire city with all its lights on for one hour. We know that there are 42 lights in total and each light consumes 0.001 kWh/s. So, the total consumption of all lights is:  

Total consumption = Number of lights x Consumption per light  
= 42 x 0.001 kWh/s = 0.042 kWh  

Finally, we can calculate how long the battery of the drone needs to last in order to power all the lights for one hour. We know that the drone has a capacity of 10 kWh and we have calculated the total consumption of all lights as 0.042 kWh. So, the drone's battery needs to last for:  

10 kWh / 0.042 kWh = 238 hours  

Therefore, the drone's battery needs to last for approximately 238 hours or about 9.5 days to power all the lights in the city for one hour."
Response: 1) There are 500 parts in total (as mentioned). 2) The mother has 3/4 of the parts (3 x 500 = 1500). 3) So, there are 500 - 1500 = 350 parts left for the father.
Response:  If Amir eats 5 eggs, and each egg is divided into 3 parts, then he eats a total of 5 x 3 = 15 parts of eggs.
Response:  We have three cups with five balls each, for a total of fifteen balls.  Now we add six balls to each cup, so there are now twenty-one balls in each cup.  Finally, we add four balls to each cup again, giving us a grand total of twenty-five balls in each cup!  So the overall sum of all three cups is:  21 + 21 + 21 = 63
Response:  First, we know that he watched 7 hours of television in total. Second, we know that he watched one episode of his favorite show every night for three days (Wednesday to Friday). Third, we know that each episode lasted for an hour and a half. Fourth, we know that he skipped watching TV on Saturday and Sunday. Finally, we know that he watched two episodes of another show on Thursday. Now let's calculate how many episodes he watched on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  On Wednesday, since he watched only one episode, he watched one episode of his favorite show. On Thursday, since he watched two episodes, he watched two episodes of his favorite show plus two episodes of another show. On Friday, since he also watched only one episode, he watched one episode of his favorite show. Therefore, the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday is 1, on Thursday is 2 + 2 = 4, and on Friday is 1.  Since he watched for 7 hours in total, and each episode lasted for an hour and a half, we can calculate the total number of episodes as follows: Total number of episodes = Total viewing time / Episode duration  = 7 hours / 1.5 hours/episode = 4.67 episodes (rounded up to the nearest whole number)  So, he watched 5 episodes of his favorite show (1 on Wednesday, 4 on Thursday), and 2 episodes of another show on Thursday.
Response:  We know that Neri had 15 apples in total and he gave away 5 of them to his friends outside. So, how many apples does Neri have left now?  We can use subtraction to find out:  15 - 5 =?  Yes, you are right! Neri has 10 apples left. Now, let's talk about the number of apples he ate. If he ate 2 apples per day for 5 days, we can multiply 2 x 5 = 10. That means Neri ate 10 apples during those 5 days. Therefore, the total number of apples Neri ate in the year is 10 + 10 = 20 apples.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each gloss without any discounts or promotions.  We know that the price of one gloss is $3, so the cost of ten glosses would be $3 x 10 = $30.  Next, we need to calculate the amount of cashback offered by the company for purchasing ten glosses. The company offers $20 in cashback for every purchase of ten glosses, so the total amount of cashback for this purchase would be $20.  Therefore, the final cost of the ten glosses after applying the cashback offer would be $30 - $20 = $10.
Response:  First, we know that Marsel and Batris have eaten all of their portions (24 and 14 respectively). Therefore, they have not eaten any of each other's food. Next, we can calculate how much each person has eaten based on the size of their portion. For Marsel, the portion was 3 times larger than Batris', so Marsel ate 3 x 14 = 42 units of food. Similarly, for Batris, the portion was 2 times smaller than Marsel's, so Batris ate 2 x 24 = 48 units of food. In total, then, Marsel ate 42 units and Batris ate 48 units, for a combined total of 90 units of food.
Response: 1) She took out 2 liters of water for each of her 8 trips to the beach (8 x 2 = 16 liters). 2) On each trip, she filled up 20 bottles with water from the sea (20 x 2 = 40 liters). 3) In total, she made 8 trips and collected 40 liters x 8 = 320 liters of water.  So, there were 320 liters of water in the bucket when Golia arrived at the beach.
Response:  We know that each teacher has two lessons per day and uses the blackboard for both lessons. If the blackboard is erased three times per lesson, how many times will it be erased in one day?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of lessons per day (2) by the number of times the blackboard is erased per lesson (3): 2 x 3 = 6 So, the blackboard will be erased six times in one day.
Response:  If each flower has 2 petals and there are initially 3 flowers in total (Riyan has 2 flowers), then there will be a total of 6 petals at the beginning (2 x 3 = 6). After 15 days, if 5 out of the 3 flowers do not bloom, we need to calculate how many petals Riyan will have left. To do this, we can use subtraction. So, let's subtract the number of petals that did not bloom from the initial total of petals: 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, after 15 days, Riyan will have 1 flower with 2 petals remaining.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the phone of Gmail can hold up to 6 photos at most. Secondly, we are given that the total number of photos taken by Britney is 1800. Thirdly, we need to find out how many photos of Britney's selfies in the garden can be seen in one photo of Gmail. We are told that the ratio of the number of selfies taken by Britney in the garden to the number of photos taken by her is 1:50. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: Let X be the number of selfies taken by Britney in the garden that can be seen in one photo of Gmail. Since the phone of Gmail can hold up to 6 photos, we have: 6X = 1800 (since there are 1800 photos in total) Now, we can use the ratio to solve for X: X = 1800 / 50 X = 36 So, there will be 36 selfies taken by Britney in the garden that can be seen in one photo of Gmail.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sarah made from selling the trees.  To do this, we multiply the number of each type of wood she sold by its price per unit.  For the 2x4x10 boards, there are 10 units x $10 per unit = $100.  For the 4x4x10 boards, there are 16 units x $16 per unit = $256.  In total, Sarah made $356 ($100 + $256).  If she sold all her woods, she would make a profit of $356 - $280 = $76.
Response:  We know that there are 120 cups of sugar and water in total, and we want to find out how many cups of sugar she used if she used 7:13 of the mixture. First, let's convert the ratio of 7:13 to a decimal. 7/13 = 0.538461538 (round to two decimals) Now, we can use the decimal equivalent of the ratio to calculate the number of cups of sugar she used.  If she used 7:13 of the mixture, then she used 0.538461538 x 120 cups of the mixture = 65.17 cups of sugar (rounded to one decimal) Therefore, she used 65 cups of sugar.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each child will receive from their father. We know that there are three children and they will split $60 equally among themselves. So each child will receive:  
$60 / 3 = $20 per child."
Response:  First, we know that each truck brought 5 tools. So if there were 2 trucks, then together they brought 2 x 5 = 10 tools in total. Now, additional trucks arrived and the number of tools increased to 30. Therefore, the number of trucks that arrived on the second day is: 30 / 5 = 6 trucks.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Adrian and Lily earned in total over the past four years. We know that Adrian earned $40,000 more than he did before, so if he earned $120,000 before (30 installments of $4,000 each), then he must have earned $160,000 ($120,000 + $40,000) over the past four years.  Similarly, since Lily's salary increased by 30%, she must have earned $39,000 more than she did before (30% of $130,000). So her earnings over the past four years would be $169,000 ($130,000 + $39,000).  Now let's add up their total earnings over the past four years: Adrian earned $160,000, and Lily earned $169,000, for a combined total of $329,000.  If they both received a raise of 30% four years ago, and their salaries have been increasing by 30% every year since then, then their current salaries would be:  Adrian's current salary = $160,000 x 1.3^4 = $252,800  Lily's current salary = $169,000 x 1.3^4 = $278,740  Therefore, the total amount they would have earned over the past four years, including their original salaries and any raises they received, is:  Adrian's total earnings = $252,800 - $120,000 = $132,800  Lily's total earnings = $278,740 - $130,000 = $148,740
Response:  If Misha uses two pans to cook dinner for Shabbat every week, and each pan can hold 30 eggs, how many eggs does he use in total per month?  To find out how many eggs Misha uses per month, we need to know how many weeks are in a month. There are four weeks in a month, so Misha uses 4 x 2 = 8 pans of eggs per month. Since each pan holds 30 eggs, Misha uses 8 x 30 = 240 eggs per month.
Response: 1) We know that Moritz brought 5 apples and 8 pears. 2) We also know that Kael brought more apples than Moritz and half as many pears. 3) Therefore, we can say that Kael brought x apples (where x is greater than 5) and y pears (where y is less than 8). 4) To find out how many fruits in total they have, we need to add up the number of apples and pears for both of them. So, let's do it! For Moritz: 5 apples + 0 pears = 5 fruits For Kael: x apples + y pears = (x + 0) + (y - 8) = x + y - 8 fruits Now, let's substitute the values we know into the equation for Kael: x + y - 8 = (5 + 0) + (y - 8) = 5 + y - 8 Since we know that Kael brought more apples than Moritz, we can assume that x > 5. Also, since Kael brought half as many pears as Moritz, we can assume that y < 8. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get: 5 + y - 8 > 5 + 0 - 8 y > 8 y > 8 - 5 y > 3 y > 3 Since we know that Kael brought at least 3 apples, we can conclude that he brought exactly 3 apples. Therefore, the total number of fruits they have is: 5 (Moritz's apples) + 3 (Kael's apples) + y (Kael's pears) = 5 + 3 + y The minimum value of y is 3, so the total number of fruits they have is: 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 fruits
Response:  First, we know that Sarah spent 8 hours per day for 5 days, so she worked for a total of 40 hours (8 x 5).  Now, if she had an extra hour each day, that would be an additional 5 hours (1 x 5) for the week.  Therefore, Sarah worked a total of 45 hours during the week (40 + 5).
Response:  First, we know that Rozi can run 10 km in 3 hours. This means she runs at a pace of 10/3 = 3.33 km per hour. Now, we are asked to find out how many kilometers she can run in 7 hours (which is 4 times 3 hours). So, we multiply her pace by 4: 3.33 x 4 = 13.32 km/hour. Therefore, Rozi can run 13.32 km in 7 hours.
Response: 1) We know that there are 60 letters in total (50 + 10). 2) We know that Gina has already written 30 letters (50% of 60). 3) If she wrote 30 letters now, how many would be left to write? To find out, we need to subtract the number of letters she wrote from the total number of letters. So, if she wrote 30 letters, how many would be left? Total - Written = Left. In this case: 60 - 30 =?  The answer is: 30. Therefore, if Gina wrote 30 more letters, there would be 30 letters left to write.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Golia bought five new cups and gave them to her mother as a gift. Secondly, when she prepared the Sabbath dinner, she used three of the new cups to serve the food. Finally, when she set the table, there were twelve cups in total. So, how many cups did Golia buy?  To solve this problem, we can use subtraction. We know that Golia used three cups during the Sabbath dinner, so if we subtract three from twelve, we get nine remaining cups. Therefore, Golia bought nine cups.
Response:  We know that Dilan bought 38 chickens and 6 ducks in total. To calculate how many ducks he bought, we can use the information that 6 ducks were more than the number of chickens. So, if he had x chickens, he would have had 6 - x ducks. Now, let's equate the two expressions: 38 + (6 - x) = 38 + x. Simplifying the equation, we get:  2x + 6 = 38. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. Therefore, Dilan bought 14 chickens and 6 ducks.
"Response:  If I made 20 friends at school and each friend has an average of 50 friends, then the total number of friends that my 20 friends have is:  
20 x 50 = 1000 friends.  So, in total, there are 1000 + 20 = 1020 people who are either my friends or my friends' friends."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item:  Abayas - $30, Palpals - $20, and Tefuzim - $10. Next, we need to calculate the total cost of all items: 4 abayas x $30 = $120 + 20 palpals x $20 = $400 + 10 tefuzim x $10 = $100 = $620. Finally, we need to subtract the discount of 15% from the total cost: $620 x 15% = $93. So, the final amount that will be paid is $620 - $93 = $527.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money the hospital makes from each patient visit. We know that the doctors charge $150 per hour and the hospital charges $200 per hour. So, if a patient visits the doctor for 24 hours (which is unlikely), the total cost would be:  
$150 x 24 = $3600 (doctor's fee) + $200 x 24 = $4800 (hospital's fee) = $8400.  Now, let's assume that the average length of stay for a patient in the hospital is 5 days (this can vary depending on the type of treatment needed). The total revenue generated by the hospital from one patient would be:  
$8400 x 5 = $42,000.  If the hospital sees 500 patients per day, the daily revenue would be:  
$42,000 x 500 = $21,000,000 per day.  Over the course of a year (assuming 365 days), the annual revenue would be:  
$21,000,000 x 365 = $7,595,000,000.  Therefore, the hospital generates approximately $7.6 billion in annual revenue from these patient visits alone."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that 60 workers were employed in the factory and they worked for 8 hours per day (considering a working day of 8 hours). This means that the total number of workhours done by all the workers is:  
60 workers x 8 hours/day = 480 workhours/day  Now, we are told that 3000 bottles were produced daily. So, let's calculate how many bottles each worker produced:  
Total workhours / Number of workers = Total production 480 workhours/day / 60 workers = 8 bottles/worker/day  Since 10 workers remained after the children left, we need to subtract the number of workers who left from the total number of workers:  
60 workers - 10 workers = 50 workers  Therefore, the number of bottles produced by the remaining 10 workers can be calculated as follows:  
10 workers x 8 bottles/worker/day = 80 bottles  Finally, we add up the total number of bottles produced by all the workers, including those who remained after the children left:  
80 bottles + 480 bottles = 560 bottles  So, the correct answer is:  
560 bottles"
Response:  First, we know that George had $500 in his account at the beginning of the month.  Second, we know that he spent $60 less than what he had. Third, we want to find out how much money George had left after spending $60. To do this, we subtract $60 from $500: $$ 500 - 60 = 440 $$ So, George had $440 left after spending $60. Now, we need to find out how many times George could buy something for $60 during the month. We can divide the amount he had left ($440) by the cost of one item ($60): $$ \frac{440}{60} = 7 $$ Therefore, George could buy 7 items for $60 each during the month.
Response:  First, we know that Paam and Pardeh went to Karnevol.  Paam rode the mountain railway four times, while Pardeh rode it three times.  Therefore, each of them used the railway line six times in total (4 + 3 = 6).
Response:  We know that in day two, Walter walked 4 kilometers more than he did on day one. So if he walked x kilometers on day one, then on day two he walked x + 4 kilometers.  On day three, he walked 6 kilometers more than he did on day two, so if he walked x + 4 kilometers on day two, then on day three he walked (x + 4) + 6 = x + 10 kilometers.  Now we are given that the total distance he walked from day one to day three is 41 kilometers. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + (x + 4) + (x + 10) = 41  Simplifying and solving for x gives us: 3x + 28 = 41  Subtracting 28 from both sides gives us: 3x = 13  Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: x = 4  Therefore, Walter walked 4 kilometers on day one, 4 + 4 = 8 kilometers on day two, and 4 + 10 = 14 kilometers on day three.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Tom spends per month on car rentals. We know that he rents 4 cars per month and each car costs $15 per day. So, let's calculate how much he spends in one month: Number of days in a month = 30 Days x Cost per day = $15 x 30 = $450 Per month, Tom spends $450 on car rentals. Now, let's calculate how much he spends in a year: Yearly cost = Monthly cost x Number of months in a year = $450 x 12 = $5,400 In one year, Tom spends $5,400 on car rentals.
Response:  If Barak has 20 games and each game is worth 3 points, then he has a total of 60 points (20 x 3 = 60).  Now, if Bob has 5 fewer games than Barak, then Bob has 15 games (20 - 5 = 15).  Since each game is worth 3 points, Bob has a total of 45 points (15 x 3 = 45).  So, there are 15 more points for Barak than for Bob.
Response:  We know that there are 27 chromosomes in human cells and 46 chromosomes in diploid human cells (23 pairs). Since we are looking for Scottish Highland cows, let's assume that these cows have 27 chromosomes like humans. Now, we need to determine how many of those chromosomes are unpaired (naked) in the Scottish Highland cow genome. To do this, we can use the fact that each pair of homologous chromosomes has one member that is identical to the other member, but with opposite orientation. Therefore, if we count the number of unpaired chromosomes, we will get twice the number of naked chromosomes. So, to find out how many naked chromosomes are present in the Scottish Highland cow genome, we need to divide the total number of chromosomes by 2. Total number of chromosomes = 27 Number of unpaired chromosomes = Total number of chromosomes / 2 = 27 / 2 = 13 Therefore, there are 13 naked chromosomes in the Scottish Highland cow genome.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item in US dollars: 

* 2 shawarma sandwiches x $1.50 = $3.00 
* 2 falafel sandwiches x $1.00 = $2.00 
* 2 salads x $1.50 = $3.00 

Total cost of food items = $8.50 

Next, we need to add the additional 20% service charge (as mentioned in the problem statement): 

$8.50 x 1.20 = $10.20 

Finally, we need to add the extra $5 tip requested by the customer: 

$10.20 + $5 = $15.20 

Therefore, the total amount that Rori needs to collect from the customer is $15.20."
Response:  If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first exam and 6 hours to complete the second exam, and he spent 5 hours on each of the two exams, then we can calculate how many questions he left unanswered as follows:   Time available for each exam = 8 hours (first exam) + 6 hours (second exam) = 14 hours Total time taken to complete both exams = 5 hours (first exam) + 5 hours (second exam) = 10 hours So, the number of questions left unanswered is: 14 hours - 10 hours = 4 hours x 75 questions per hour = 300 questions Therefore, Mark left 300 questions unanswered.
Response:  We know that there are 22 cabinets in total (given).  Of these, 4 are more than half full of sticks (given).  This means that there are 22 - 4 = 18 cabinets with less than half full of sticks.  Now we need to find out how many of these cabinets have only rods and no sticks.  To do this, we divide the number of cabinets with less than half full of sticks by the number of cabinets with only rods.  So we have:  18 / 4 = 4  Therefore, there are 4 cabinets with only rods and no sticks.
Response:  We know that there are 20 units available for hire, and we have been told that 12 of them are automatic, 4 are manual, and the rest (5) are semi-automatic. So, to find out how many of the units are semi-automatic, we can subtract the number of manual units from the total number of units: Total units = 12 + 4 + 5 = 21 units. Therefore, there are 5 semi-automatic units available for hire.
Response:  We know that there are 700 words in total.  Of those, we have two types of words: small and big.  The number of small words is twice the number of big words.  And the number of baby words is three times the number of big words.  So let's start with the big words.  There are 2x + 3(2x) = 6x + 6 big words.  Now, we need to find out how many small words there are.  Since there are twice as many small words as big words, there are 2x + 6 big words.  Finally, we can calculate the number of baby words by multiplying the number of big words by three: 3(6x + 6) = 18x + 18 baby words.  Therefore, there are 6x + 6 small words, 2x + 6 big words, and 18x + 18 baby words in total.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time Gordon spent playing video games per day. We know that he spends 8 hours per day playing video games, so we can start there. Next, we need to calculate how much money Gordon earned from his part-time job. We are told that he earns $10 per hour, and we know that he works for 4 hours per day, so we can multiply $10 by 4 to get $40 per day. Now, let's add up all of the money that Gordon earned from both sources: playing video games and working at his part-time job. To do this, we will simply add $40 (from his part-time job) to $240 (from playing video games). This gives us a total of $280 per day. Finally, we need to find out how much money Gordon made in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so if we multiply $280 by 7, we get $1,960. So, in one week, Gordon made $1,960 from playing video games and working at his part-time job.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item without taxes:  Jon buys challah bread for $2, bitzim (bread rolls) for $3, nori (seaweed sheets) for $3, cups for $3, and cooking utensils for $4. So, the total cost without taxes is: 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 dollars. Now, let's apply the 10% sales tax rate. The tax amount can be calculated as follows: Tax amount = Total cost x Sales tax rate Tax amount = 15 x 0.10 Tax amount = 1.5 dollars Therefore, the total cost with taxes is: Total cost + Tax amount Total cost + 1.5 = 15 + 1.5 = 16.5 dollars
Response: 1) The cost of raw materials (2 x $2 + 5 x $5) = $14 per unit. 2) Production costs (300 units x $14) = $4,200 per month. 3) Other expenses (insurance, rent, etc.) let's assume $2,000 per month. Total monthly costs = $6,200.  Now, to calculate the profit margin in dollars, we need to know how much Lucas is charging for each unit. He has three customers who pay him differently: Customer A pays $30 per unit, Customer B pays $25 per unit, and Customer C pays $20 per unit. So, let's calculate the total revenue for each customer: Customer A: 300 units x $30 = $9,000 Customer B: 300 units x $25 = $7,500 Customer C: 300 units x $20 = $6,000 Total revenue = $9,000 + $7,500 + $6,000 = $22,500 per month. Now, let's subtract the total monthly costs from the total revenue: Profit margin = $22,500 - $6,200 = $16,300 per month. In dollars, Lucas's profit margin would be $16,300 per month.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jon has 10 donums of land and each donum can be cultivated with 100 annas. Secondly, we are given that Jon can harvest his annas every 3 months. So, in one year, he can harvest his annas 4 times (since there are 4 seasons in a year). Now, let's calculate how many annas Jon can harvest in one year. We know that each harvest yields 100 annas, so: Number of annas per harvest = 100 annas Total number of annas per year = 4 x 100 annas = 400 annas Therefore, Jon can harvest 400 annas in one year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Goni has collected 500 stamps in total and he wants to divide them equally among his three friends. So, if we divide 500 by 3, we get: 500 / 3 = 167 Therefore, each of Goni's three friends will receive 167 stamps. Now, let's talk about the fourth friend who received 1/4 of the total number of stamps. We can calculate this as follows: Total number of stamps = 500 Number of stamps for each of the first three friends = 167 (as calculated above) Number of stamps left for the fourth friend = Total number of stamps - (Number of stamps for each of the first three friends x 3) = 500 - (167 x 3) = 500 - 491 = 9 Nine stamps are left for the fourth friend. So, in summary, Goni has 500 stamps in total, and he gives 167 stamps to each of his three friends, leaving 9 stamps for the fourth friend.
"Response:  Firstly, she saw 30 words in the first hour, and then she saw half of them (15) returning to the cupboard in the next hours. So, in total, she saw 45 words coming out of the cupboard throughout the day. Now, let's calculate how many words returned to the cupboard in the last hour of the day. If she saw 27 words in that hour, and we subtract the number of words she saw in the previous hours (45), we get:  
27 - 45 = 18 words returned to the cupboard in the last hour."
"Response:  First, we know that the cost of admission for adults is $12 and for children is $10.  If the mother gave the cashier $8, she must have paid for two tickets (one for herself and one for her child). Therefore, the amount of money she received back from the cashier would be:  
$12 x 2 = $24 - $8 = $16  
So, the mother received $16 in change."
Response:  If Litz has 12 friends on Facebook and each friend has an average of 4 more friends than Litz, then we can start by finding out how many friends Litz's friends have in total. We know that each friend has 4 more friends than Litz, so if Litz has 12 friends, her friends will have 12 x 4 = 48 more friends. In total, Litz's friends will have 12 + 48 = 60 friends. Now, to find out how many friends Gimmie has, we need to divide the total number of friends among all of Litz's friends by the number of friends she has. So, we divide 60 by 12 to get:  Gimmie has 60 / 12 = 5 friends on Facebook.
Response: 1) We know that Steffi can travel at a speed of 440 meters per hour on her skateboard. 2) Tim can travel at a speed of 264 meters per hour on his scooter. 3) The distance between their homes and the school is 3 kilometers. To find out how much time it will take for them to reach the school, we need to divide the distance by their speeds: For Steffi: 3 km / 440 m/h = 6.8 minutes For Tim: 3 km / 264 m/h = 11.3 minutes So, if they both leave their homes at the same time, Steffi will arrive at the school before Tim. Specifically, she will arrive in 6.8 minutes, while Tim will arrive in 11.3 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each tissue box costs $25. Therefore, if five people came to buy two boxes of tissues each, they would spend a total of $25 x 5 = $125. If three more people came to buy all their tissues at once (i.e., six boxes in total), they would spend $25 x 6 = $150. Finally, if one person came and bought all the remaining tissues (i.e., four boxes), they would spend $25 x 4 = $100. In total, the sales for the day would be $125 + $150 + $100 = $375.
"Response:  If Carl buys 10 chocolate bars at $0.10 each, then he spends a total of:  
$0.10 x 10 = $1.00  So, if Carl pays with a $10 bill and receives $9 in change, then he gets:  
$9 - $1.00 = $8.00  Therefore, Carl will receive $8 in change."
Response:  First, David bought 14 chips from the store and ate half of them (7 chips). Then, three boys stole 4 more chips from him. After that, each boy ate 3 chips, so there were only 2 chips left in the bag. Finally, David took the last two chips and put five more back into the bag. So, how many chips were in the bag when David first bought it?  Solution: There were 14 chips in the bag when David first bought it.
Response:  We know that in the first three days (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday), there are three lessons per day, each lasting one hour. So, in total, he has three hours of classes per day. Since there are five days in all, he has a total of 3 x 5 = 15 hours of classes.  On Wednesday and Thursday, there are two lessons per day, each lasting one and a half hours. So, in total, he has two hours of classes per day. Again, since there are two days, he has a total of 2 x 2 = 4 hours of classes.  Therefore, the total number of hours of classes for the entire week is: 15 + 4 = 19 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many minutes each type of material takes to burn.  For example, wood takes 4 minutes per unit (inch), and coal takes 6 minutes per unit (inch). We also know that there are 120 coals and 60 bugs in total. Now let's calculate the time it would take for all materials to burn if they were placed end to end.  Wood: 120 units x 4 minutes/unit = 480 minutes Coal: 120 units x 6 minutes/unit = 720 minutes Bugs: 60 units x 2 minutes/unit = 120 minutes Total time: 480 + 720 + 120 = 1320 minutes or 22 hours So, if Bill places all the materials end to end, it will take approximately 22 hours for everything to burn.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many flowers each animal needs per month.  For example, if there are 200 bees in the garden and they need 50 flowers per day, then they need 1000 flowers (200 x 5) per month.  Similarly, if there are 400 butterflies in the garden and they need 30 flowers per day, then they need 1200 flowers (400 x 3) per month.  Finally, if there are 100 builders in the garden and they need 20 flowers per day, then they need 600 flowers (100 x 6) per month.  Now let's add up all these numbers to find out how many flowers our gardener needs to plant in total for two months:  1000 + 1200 + 600 = 3800 flowers.  So, our gardener needs to plant 3800 flowers over the course of two months to ensure that all the animals and builders have enough food.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how far Blayk ran in total. We know that he ran for 100 meters and made 15 stops along the way. So, his total distance traveled is: Total Distance = Number of Stops x Distance per Stop + Continuous Distance Total Distance = 15 x 40 yd + 600 yd (continuous distance) Total Distance = 600 yd + 6000 yd Total Distance = 6600 yd Now, let's calculate Kaly's distance. We know that she ran for 40 yards and made one stop. Her total distance traveled is: Total Distance = Distance per Stop + Continuous Distance Total Distance = 40 yd + 340 yd Total Distance = 380 yd To find out who ran farther, we need to compare their total distances: Total Distance of Blayk = 6600 yd Total Distance of Kaly = 380 yd Based on this comparison, Blayk ran significantly farther than Kaly. The difference between their distances is: Difference = Total Distance of Blayk - Total Distance of Kaly Difference = 6600 yd - 380 yd Difference = 6220 yd Therefore, Blayk ran approximately 6220 yards farther than Kaly.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Rafael spent on books. We know that he bought four books and each book cost $1.5 dollars, so: Books = 4 x $1.5 = $6 Total amount spent on books = $6 Now, let's calculate how much Rafael spent on notebooks. We know that he bought two notebooks and each notebook cost $4 dollars, so: Notebooks = 2 x $4 = $8 Total amount spent on notebooks = $8 Next, let's calculate how much Rafael spent on an eraser. We know that the eraser cost $20 dollars, so: Eraser = $20 Finally, let's add up all of the amounts that Rafael spent: Total amount spent = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 goats in the pen and they are all facing south. Secondly, we know that two of them are hiding from the sun under the shade of the wall. So, if we subtract two from eleven, we get nine goats left. Therefore, Pin can see nine goats now in the pen.
Response:  First, we know that the water level in the reservoir increased by 5 meters during the two days. This means that if the water level was x meters high on day one, it will be x + 5 meters high on day three.  Now, we are given that on day three, the water level was 7 meters higher than it was on day two. So, if the water level on day two was y meters high, the water level on day three will be y + 7 meters high.  We can set up an equation based on this information:  x + 5 = y + 7  To solve for x, we can subtract y from both sides of the equation:  x + 5 - y = y + 7 - y  This simplifies to:  5 = 7 - y  Solving for y, we get:  y = 2  Therefore, the water level on day two was 2 meters high.  Finally, we can find the water level on day three by adding 7 meters to 2 meters:  Water level on day three = 2 + 7 = 9 meters high.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many fish each team caught in total. For Ankin, we know that they caught 10 fish (10 x 2 = 20), and for Loxin, we know that they caught 5 fish less than Ankin, so they caught 5 x 2 = 10 fish. In total, both teams caught 20 + 10 = 30 fish. Now, let's calculate how many sea creatures each team succeeded in catching. We know that Ankin caught 6 horses and 3 dolphins, so they succeeded in catching 6 + 3 = 9 sea creatures. For Loxin, we know that they caught 3 fewer dolphins than Ankin, so they caught 3 - 3 = 0 dolphins, and 5 fewer horses than Ankin, so they caught 5 - 6 = -1 horse. In total, Ankin succeeded in catching 9 sea creatures, while Loxin failed to catch any sea creatures (-1).
Response:  First, we need to calculate the discount percentage for each month based on the given information.  The formula to calculate the discount percentage is: Discount Percentage = (Original Price - Sale Price) / Original Price x 100 To find the sale price of each month, we can use the formula: Sale Price = Original Price x (1 - Discount Percentage) So, let's plug in the numbers: Month 1: Original Price = $20 Discount Percentage = 20% Sale Price = $20 x (1 - 0.20) = $20 x 0.80 = $16 Month 2: Original Price = $20 Discount Percentage = 20% Sale Price = $20 x (1 - 0.20) = $20 x 0.80 = $16 Month 3: Original Price = $20 Discount Percentage = 20% Sale Price = $20 x (1 - 0.20) = $20 x 0.80 = $16 And so on... After 36 months, the total amount paid would be: Total Amount Paid = $20 x 36 x 0.80 = $720 Therefore, the final cost of the product after 36 months would be $720.
Response:  First, we know that there are five admission tickets and three snacks (bobas). The cost of each boba is $3, so the total cost of all three snacks is $9 ($3 x 3 = 9). Now, let's calculate the total cost of all five admissions plus the three snacks: Total Cost = (5 x $5) + $9 = $25 + $9 = $34. Therefore, the total cost of all five admission tickets and three snacks is $34.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time Jackie will save if she pays someone else to do her taxes instead of doing them herself.  To do this, we need to know how long it takes her to do her own taxes.  She told us that she spends 3 hours and $35 per hour on tax preparation fees.  So, to calculate how much time she will save, we can subtract the amount of time she spends on tax preparation from the total time she would spend if she paid someone else to do her taxes.  In this case, the difference is:  3 hours (time spent on tax prep) - 1 hour (time saved by paying someone else) = 2 hours.  Next, we need to calculate how much money Jackie will save by paying someone else to do her taxes.  We know that the cost of hiring someone to do her taxes is $90 per hour.  So, to calculate the savings, we can subtract the cost of hiring someone from the amount she currently spends on tax preparation:  $35 per hour (current cost) - $90 per hour (cost of hiring someone) = -$55 per hour.  This means that Jackie will save $55 per hour by paying someone else to do her taxes instead of doing them herself.  Finally, we need to calculate how much money Jackie will make by hiring someone to do her taxes.  To do this, we can multiply the number of hours she saves by the cost of hiring someone:  2 hours (time saved) x $90 per hour (cost of hiring someone) = $180.  Therefore, Jackie will make $180 by hiring someone to do her taxes instead of doing them herself.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Albera will have after paying for the computer and its accessories.  To do this, we need to subtract the cost of the computer and its accessories from her allowance.  The cost of the computer is $1090 (with tax), so let's subtract that amount from her allowance: Allowance - Cost of Computer = $1500 - $1090 = $410 Next, we need to add up all the costs of the accessories she purchased: Surface Pro - $157  Keyboard - $74 Mousepad - $102 Total cost of accessories = $157 + $74 + $102 = $333 Now, we can calculate how much money Albera has left over after purchasing everything: Amount left over = Allowance - Total cost of computer and accessories = $410 - $333 = $77 So, Albera will have $77 left over after purchasing the computer and all its accessories.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra needs to take care of 9 babies at once every time she is assigned to watch them. Secondly, we are given that she has been tasked with making 15 Spanish-style dolls for an event at her school. Now, let's calculate how many times Sandra will need to take care of the babies while working on the dolls. We can start by dividing the total number of babies (9) by the number of babies she takes care of each time (3): 9 / 3 = 3 So, Sandra will need to take care of the babies three times while working on the dolls.
Response: 1. The sum of their ages is 28. 2. One person's age is twice the other's age. 3. Therefore, we can write an equation based on these two facts: Age of Person A + Age of Person B = 28. Since Person A's age is twice that of Person B, we can rewrite the equation as: 2(Age of Person B) + Age of Person B = 28. Combine like terms: 2Age of Person B + Age of Person B = 28. Simplify: 3Age of Person B = 28. Divide both sides by 3: Age of Person B = 9. Now we know that Person B is 9 years old. Since Person A's age is twice that of Person B, we can find Person A's age by multiplying Person B's age by 2: Age of Person A = 2 x 9 = 18. So, Person A is 18 years old and Person B is 9 years old.
Response:  If there are 8 dollars in total, and two of them belong to Gimmie, then we have 8 - 2 = 6 dollars left for Atal. So, Atal has 6 dollars.
Response:  If Pencho goes out for 10 kilometers in one day, and he goes out for 20 kilometers in total during the week, then he must go out for 10 + 20 = 30 kilometers in 7 days. So, Pencho goes out for 30 kilometers per week.
Response:  First, we know that each medium has a price of $25 and a margin of $3 over the cost price. Second, we are given that there is a discount of 10% on all media. Third, we want to find out how much each medium will cost in total. So let's start with the cost price of each medium: Cost Price = $25 x (1 - 0.10) = $25 x 0.90 = $22.50 Now, let's calculate the selling price of each medium: Selling Price = Cost Price + Margin = $22.50 + $3 = $25.50 Finally, we can calculate the total amount paid for all media: Total Amount = Number of Media x Selling Price Therefore, if n is the number of media, the total amount paid would be: Total Amount = n x $25.50 To find the value of n, we need to set up an equation based on the information given: n x $25.50 = $25 x 3 + $25 x 10% of n Since the discount is 10%, the 10% of n is equal to 10/100 x n = 0.10n Now we have two equations: n x $25.50 = $25 x 3 + $25 x 0.10n Simplifying the first equation, we get: n x $25.50 = $75 + $2.50n Solving both equations simultaneously, we get: n = 3 or n = 4 The only solution is n = 4, so the total amount paid for all media would be: Total Amount = 4 x $25.50 = $102
Response:  Firstly, we know that Giyak sees 80 animals with 8 legs each, which means he sees a total of 80 x 8 = 640 legs. Next, he sees 90 creatures with 6 legs each, which adds up to 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, he sees three creatures with ten legs each, which gives us 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, in total, Giyak sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.
Response:  We know that Sali has four birds and each bird lays an egg every three days. If Sali is 30 years old (as mentioned in the previous question), then she must have been born when her mother was 18 years old (since humans take 9 months to develop inside their mothers). Therefore, Sali's mother must have been 18 + 30 = 48 years old when Sali was born. Now we can calculate the age of the birds based on Sali's age. Since each bird lays an egg every three days, the youngest bird will be 3 days older than Sali. The next oldest bird will be 6 days older than Sali, and so on. So, if Sali is 30 years old, the ages of the birds would be: Youngest bird: 30 + 3 = 33 years Older bird: 30 + 6 = 36 years Next oldest bird: 30 + 9 = 39 years Next oldest bird: 30 + 12 = 42 years And so on... Therefore, the total age of all four birds together would be: 33 + 36 + 39 + 42 = 150 years
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Giselle needs to pay for her expenses in each month. We know that she has a scholarship of $300 per month and an allowance of $200 per month. So, her total income is: Total Income = Scholarship + Allowance = $300 + $200 = $500 per month Now, let's see what percentage of her income she wants to save. She said she wants to save 50% more than the minimum amount. This means she will save 50% of her income above the minimum amount. To find out how much she needs to save, we first need to calculate the minimum amount she needs to spend. The minimum amount is the sum of all her expenses, which we calculated earlier as follows: Minimum Amount = Rent + Utilities + Food + Transportation = $500 per month Next, we can calculate the excess amount that Giselle needs to save: Excess Amount = Total Income - Minimum Amount = $500 - $500 = $0 per month Since there is no excess amount, Giselle does not need to save anything. Therefore, her savings for the year would be zero.
Response: 1) The number of hours Bilili will need to spend on each plot if he works alone - 60 plots / 2 (plots per day) = 30 plots per day. 2) The time it takes Bilili to plow and harrow one plot - 1 hour (for plowing) + 0.5 hours (for harrowing) = 1.5 hours per plot. 3) The total time Bilili needs to spend on all 60 plots - 30 plots x 1.5 hours/plot = 45 hours. Therefore, Bilili will need 45 hours to finish all the plots.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much they will earn from each gallon of milk they sell. We know that they are selling each gallon for $3 and paying $2 for it. So, their profit per gallon is: Profit = Selling price - Cost Price = $3 - $2 = $1 per gallon Now, let's calculate how much they will earn in total if they sell 25 gallons. Total Earning = Number of Gallons x Profit per Gallon = 25 x $1 = $25 They will earn $25 from selling 25 gallons of milk.
Response:  We know that there were 240 students in total and 80 of them were Japanese. This means that there were 160 non-Japanese students (240 - 80 = 160). Of these non-Japanese students, 60 were female. Therefore, the number of female students in the sin...
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Zad spends on his monthly expenses. We know that he pays $300 for rent, $50 for transportation, and $150 for other miscellaneous expenses, so his total monthly expenses are:  

$300 + $50 + $150 = $500 per month. Next, let's calculate how much money Zad earns from his job. He works for 4 weeks in a month (assuming a 4-week month), and he earns $6000 per month. So, his weekly income is:  

$6000 / 4 weeks = $1500 per week. Now, let's subtract his monthly expenses from his weekly income:  

$1500 - $500 = $1000 per week remaining after paying all his expenses. Finally, let's calculate how much money Zad will have left over after all his expenses and transfers:  

$1000 x 4 weeks = $4000 per month remaining after all expenses and transfers. Therefore, if Zad earns $6000 per month and has $4000 left over after all his expenses and transfers, then he will have $2000 remaining for savings or other purposes."
Response:  If Lily has 12 sweaters and each sweater has 4 buttons, then she has a total of 12 x 4 = 48 buttons.  Now, if she has 40 sweaters, she will have 40 x 4 = 160 buttons in total.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much he earned in the first week.  In the first week, Levi worked for 5 hours per day x 3 days = 15 hours. So, his earnings for the first week are $10/hour x 15 hours = $150. Now let's move on to the second week. In the second week, Levi worked for 8 hours per day x 4 days = 32 hours. His earnings for the second week are $10/hour x 32 hours = $320. To find out how much he earned in both weeks combined, we add $150 + $320 = $470. Therefore, Levi earned a total of $470 over the two weeks.
Response: 1) The number of votes received by the candidate is 3/4 of the total number of votes cast in the class. 2) The total number of votes cast in the class was 80. Therefore, we can calculate the number of votes received by the candidate as follows: Number of votes received = Total number of votes cast x (3/4) Number of votes received = 80 x (3/4) Number of votes received = 80 x 3/4 = 60 So, the candidate received 60 votes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra has 480 red and 200 white flowers in total. We also know that she needs to sell at least 5 bouquets before 5 pm. Now, let's calculate how many red roses each bouquet requires. Since each bouquet contains 3 red roses and 2 white ones, we can start by calculating how many red roses are needed for one bouquet. One bouquet = 3 red roses + 2 white roses Therefore, the number of red roses required for one bouquet is: 3 red roses + 2 white roses = 5 roses To find out how many red roses Sandra needs to sell, we need to divide the total number of red roses she has (480) by the number of bouquets she needs to sell (5): 480 red roses / 5 bouquets = 96 red roses per bouquet So, Sandra needs to sell 96 red roses to meet her target. However, since she also has 200 white roses, she will need to sell an additional 200 - 96 = 104 white roses to meet her target as well. Therefore, the total number of flowers Sandra needs to sell is: 96 red roses + 104 white roses = 200 flowers
Response:  If Gin is 30 years old and Mark was 5 times as old as Gin when they were dating, then we can say that Mark was 30 x 5 = 150 years old at that time. Since Mark has passed away, we know that he died before Gin turned 30. So, if Gin is currently 30 years old, Mark would have been 150 - 30 = 120 years old when he died.
"Response:  We know that each member of the first team runs at an average speed of 55 seconds per 400 meters. This means that if there are four members in the team, they will run 400 meters in (4 x 55) = 220 seconds or 3 minutes and 40 seconds. Now let's look at the second team. They have one runner who can run 400 meters in 60 seconds, which is faster than any other runner in the first team. If we assume that the remaining three runners in the second team take 3 seconds more than the previous runner, then their running times would be:  
Runner 1 (fastest): 400 meters in 60 seconds Runner 2: 400 meters in 63 seconds (3 seconds more than Runner 1) Runner 3: 400 meters in 66 seconds (3 seconds more than Runner 2) Runner 4: 400 meters in 69 seconds (3 seconds more than Runner 3) Therefore, the total time taken by the second team to complete 400 meters would be: (60 + 63 + 66 + 69) = 268 seconds or 4 minutes and 28 seconds. So, the second team takes less time to cover 400 meters than the first team."
Response:  We know that Jerry has $30 and he will spend $20 on two things. So how much money does Jerry have left after buying these two things? To find out, we can subtract $20 from $30: $$$30 - $20 = $10$$ Therefore, Jerry has $10 left after buying the two things.
Response:  Genah and Amma each received half of their mother's eggs. If their mother had 20 eggs, then each of them received 10 eggs. Therefore, together they have 10 + 10 = 20 eggs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each carton contains 6 packets of Qash (a total of 3 packets in each of the three cartons). Each packet contains 4 cups of Qash (so there are 3 x 4 = 12 cups of Qash in each carton). Therefore, the total number of cups of Qash in all three cartons is 12 x 3 = 36 cups. Now, let's consider the chocolate bars. There are 10 boxes of chocolate bars, and each box contains 5 chocolate bars (so there are 10 x 5 = 50 chocolate bars in total). Each chocolate bar has 4 cups of Qash (so there are 50 x 4 = 200 cups of Qash in the chocolate bars). Finally, let's look at the Arnova bites. There are 20 bags of Arnova bites, and each bag contains 5 Arnova bites (so there are 20 x 5 = 100 Arnova bites in total). Each Arnova bite has 2 cups of Qash (so there are 100 x 2 = 200 cups of Qash in the Arnova bites). In conclusion, the total number of cups of Qash in all the products is 36 + 200 + 200 = 536 cups.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Mandi needs to pay Brandkat in order to break even after three months. To do this, we will use the formula for calculating the present value of a future amount: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where: PV = present value (the amount Mandi needs to pay now) FV = future value (the amount she will receive after three months) r = interest rate per period n = number of periods In our case, the future value is $100 x 2% x 3 = $6, so Mandi needs to pay $6 now to break even.
Response:  First, we know that the seller sold all 400 units of wheat for $30 each, so he received a total of: 400 x $30 = $12,000  Next, we know that the cost price per unit was $20, so the total cost price was: 400 x $20 = $8,000  Therefore, the profit made by the seller is: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost Price = $12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each of them spent on food and drinks. We know that they spent $4.50 less per card than the total amount spent on the cards. So if they spent $20.25 on three cards, they spent $20.25 x 3 = $60.75 on all three cards. Since they spent $4.50 less per card, they actually spent $60.75 - $4.50 = $56.25 on food and drinks. Now let's calculate how much each person paid for their share of the two rides. We know that they paid $33 for both rides together. If there were three people in total, each person paid $\frac{33}{3} = 11$ dollars for their share of the rides. Therefore, each person paid $56.25 + 11 = $67.25 in total.
Response:  If Jon can collect 2 apples in one basket, and he has to collect 3 baskets of apples in total, then he needs to collect 6 apples in total (2 x 3 = 6). So, Jon will collect 6 apples in 3 hours.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many grams of carrots are needed per day for each person. We know that 1 kilogram (kg) is equal to 1000 grams, so:  
3.5 kg x 1000 g/kg = 3500 g per day  
Now, let's divide this amount by the number of people eating them:  
3500 g / 9 people = approximately 389 g per person per day  
So, each person needs about 389 grams or 0.4 kilograms of carrots per day to maintain their weight."
Response:  Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 new ones each year. So after 10 years, he will have 50 + 10 x 10 = 50 + 100 = 150 trees in total. Now, 30% of his trees die every year, so after 10 years, 30% of 150 is 45 trees will die. Therefore, the number of trees that remain with Tom after 10 years is 150 - 45 = 105 trees.
Response:  First, they put in 18 plastic flamingos (pink) in the front yard of So's house.  Then, on Shabbat morning, they took out 3 of the pink flamingos and painted them white. They left the remaining 15 pink flamingos in the front yard. On Sunday morning, they added 18 more white flamingos to the collection. Now, let's count how many flamingos are outside in total: 15 pink + 18 white = 33 flamingos.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money she will receive for each afar (since it is not specified if the price is per unit or per set of five). We know that there are five colors and each afar costs $2, so... 2 x 5 = 10 dollars per set of five afars. Now, let's calculate how many sets of five afars she needs to sell in order to earn $20. 20 / 10 = 2 sets. Therefore, she needs to sell two sets of five afars to earn $20.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of one egg. We know that the price of an egg is $1.20 and the weight of an egg is 0.30 dollars. So, the cost per gram is $1.20 / 0.30 = 4. Therefore, the cost of one egg is $4. Now, let's calculate the total cost of eight eggs. Eight times four is equal to 32. So, the total cost of eight eggs is $32.
Response:  We have 200 kilograms of goods to be divided among 40 restaurants in the city. Each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms of goods. So we need to find out how much of the goods will not be used. To do this, we subtract the total amount received by all restaurants from the initial amount of goods: 200 kg - (40 x 2 kg) = 200 kg - 80 kg = 120 kg. Therefore, there are 120 kilograms of goods that will not be used.
Response:  We know that there are in total 23786 residents in the city of Sodom, and we have been given their gender distribution as follows: 8417 men and 9092 women. This means that there must be some number of children living in Sodom, since we know that the population is not entirely made up of adults. However, we do not have any information about the exact number of children. So, to find out how many children live in Sodom, we need to use our knowledge of the total population and the gender distribution to make an educated guess. Here's one way to approach this problem: Since there are more women than men in Sodom (by a ratio of approximately 52% women to 48% men), it seems likely that there are also more children than men in the city. After all, women tend to have more children than men! Therefore, let's assume that half of the population of Sodom consists of children. Using this assumption, we can calculate the number of children as follows: Total Population = 8417 + 9092 = 17519 Half of this population would be children, so: Number of Children = 17519 / 2 = 8759 To summarize: Based on the gender distribution of the population and the assumption that half of the population consists of children, we estimate that there are approximately 8759 children living in the city of Sodom.
Response:  In the first month, she had 20 cards.  After one month, she had three fewer cards than before (since she lost three). Therefore, after two months, she has 20 - 3 = 17 cards left.  Now, in the third month, she gained half of the number of cards that she had at the beginning (i.e., half of 20 is 10). So, now she has 17 + 10 = 27 cards.  Finally, we can see that she currently has 27 cards.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Mark earns per week from each of his two clients. We know that he charges $5 per article and writes 1000 articles per week for Client A and 500 articles per week for Client B. So, his total weekly income from Client A is:  

$5 x 1000 = $5,000

And his total weekly income from Client B is:  

$5 x 500 = $2,500

Now, let's add up his total weekly income from both clients:  

$5,000 + $2,500 = $7,500

So, Mark earns $7,500 per week."
Response:  First, we know that he receives 5 jugs of water in the morning and 6 jugs of water every afternoon.  If each jug contains 5 liters of water, how many liters of water does he receive in total per day?  To find out, let's calculate the amount of water he receives in the morning and then add it to the amount of water he receives in the afternoon.  Morning: 5 jugs x 5 liters/jug = 25 liters Afternoon: 6 jugs x 5 liters/jug = 30 liters Total: 25 + 30 = 55 liters So, he receives 55 liters of water per day.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jon will earn in one week if he works for 5 days and receives $2000 per day.  To do this, we multiply $2000 by 5 (days):  $2000 x 5 = $10,000.  Next, we need to calculate how much Jon will earn in one year if he works for 50 weeks and receives $10,000 per week.  To do this, we multiply $10,000 by 50 (weeks):  $10,000 x 50 = $500,000.  Finally, we need to subtract the amount of money that Jon paid as taxes (5% of $500,000) from his total earnings to find out how much he earned after taxes.  To do this, we multiply $500,000 by 5% (tax rate):  $500,000 x 5% = $25,000.  So, Jon earned $475,000 ($500,000 - $25,000) after taxes in one year.
"Response:  First, we know that each donum (unit of measurement) produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Second, we know that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. So, to calculate how many barrels of wine are produced in one year, we need to multiply the number of tons of grapes produced by the number of barrels per ton of grapes.  In this case, if the vineyard produces 10 donums of grapes per year, we can calculate the total amount of grapes produced as follows:  
10 donums x 5 tons/donum = 50 tons of grapes per year  Now, let's calculate the number of barrels of wine produced based on the number of tons of grapes:  
50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year  Therefore, the vineyard produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
Response:  Firstly, we know that he eats carrots every day for breakfast and lunch, so he consumes 2 meals x 3 days = 6 carrot portions per week. Secondly, we are told that he has sandwiches for dinner three times a week, which means he skips having carrots with his evening meal on those days. Therefore, he has 3 sandwich meals x 4 carrot portions per meal = 12 carrot portions per week. Finally, we learn that he uses 8 packets of carrots in total. So, to calculate how many packets of carrots he uses each week, we can divide the total number of carrot portions (12) by the number of portions per packet (4): 12 / 4 = 3 packets of carrots per week.
Response:  First, we know that there were 22 green and 10 red apples in total. Next, she bought six baskets of green apples, each containing nine apples, for a total of 54 green apples. She also bought two baskets of red apples, each containing six apples, for a total of 12 red apples. Therefore, the total number of apples now is: 54 (green) + 12 (red) = 66 apples.
Response:  We know that Mar Bar has five students in his class, and each student received different scores in the first five exams. The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. If we want to find out which score is needed for the sixth exam so that the average will be 93, we need to calculate the total of all the scores and then divide it by six (the number of exams). Total = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458. Average = Total / 6 = 458 / 6 = 76. So, the score needed for the sixth exam is 76.
Response: 1) How many kilometers did Michael travel in total during the four weeks he rode his bicycle every day? We know that he traveled at least 5 km each time and up to 25 km per ride. So let's calculate the minimum distance he traveled: Total distance = Number of rides x Minimum distance per ride 4 weeks x 5 km/ride = 20 km/week x 4 weeks = 80 km  Now we need to find out how much energy Michael spent during these four weeks. We know that he spent 60 kcal per ride and rode for 3 weeks (not daily). So let's calculate the total energy expended: Total energy = Number of rides x Energy per ride 3 weeks x 60 kcal/ride = 180 kcal/week x 3 weeks = 540 kcal In conclusion, Michael burned approximately 540 kilocalories during those three weeks of cycling.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 shokolad and 80 tafuchim (total of 105) in the basket of the mamatikim for the entire night. Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, so the total weight of all the chocolate bars is:  
Weight of all chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars x Weight per chocolate bar  W = 105 x 40 g W = 4200 grams or 4.2 kilograms Therefore, the weight of the mamatikim's basket is approximately 4.2 kilograms."
"Response:  On day 1, she bought 4 eggs.  On day 2, she bought 3 more eggs (since ""yoter"" in Hebrew means ""more"", so we know that she bought at least 3 more).  On day 3, she bought 5 more eggs than on day 2 (so she bought 8 eggs - 5 more than 3). Therefore, in total, she bought:  4 + 3 + 8 = 15 eggs."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each cup if they are sold for $6,000 per set of 3 cups. We know that the total cost of the set is $6,000, so the cost of one cup must be:  Cost of one cup = Total cost / Number of cups in the set Cost of one cup = $6,000 / 3 Cost of one cup = $2,000 Next, we need to find out how many sets of three cups can be purchased with $1,200. To do this, we divide the amount available ($1,200) by the cost of one cup ($2,000):  Number of sets = Amount available / Cost of one cup Number of sets = $1,200 / $2,000 Number of sets = 6 Finally, we multiply the number of sets by the number of cups in each set (three) to get the total number of cups that can be purchased:  Total number of cups = Number of sets x Number of cups in each set Total number of cups = 6 x 3 Total number of cups = 18 So, you can purchase 18 cups with $1,200.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Sarah needs to save each time she watches the children in order to reach her goal of $30 per day. We know that she earns $20 per day from each couple and spends $5 per hour watching the children (4 hours x $5 = $20). So, if she wants to save $30 per day, she needs to subtract her expenses from her income: $30 - $20 = $10. Therefore, Sarah needs to save $10 per day. Since she already has a savings of $10, she only needs to save an additional $10 per day to reach her goal.
"Response: 1) Geri has two terrariums. 2) Each terrarium produces 3 or 5 balls per day (depending on whether it is an adomit or white terrarium). 3) Geri collects 42 balls per day in total.  Now we can set up a system of linear equations to represent this situation. Let's use ""A"" for the number of adomit terrariums and ""W"" for the number of white terrariums. We know that A + W = 2 (since there are two terrariums in total), and we also know that 3A + 5W = 42 (since each terrarium produces 3 or 5 balls per day, depending on its type). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get: A = 2 and W = 2. Therefore, Geri has 2 adomit terrariums and 2 white terrariums."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how long it takes Garry to walk around the park at his usual pace of 3 km/h. We know that he walks for 1.5 hours, so we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the distance is 3 km (the circumference of the park), and the time is 1.5 hours. So, we can calculate the distance as follows: Distance = 3 km/h x 1.5 h = 4.5 km. Now, if Garry walks at a faster pace of 5 km/h, we can calculate how much shorter his walking time will be using the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed. Since the distance remains the same (4.5 km), we only need to divide the distance by the new speed: Time = 4.5 km / 5 km/h = 0.9 h or 54 minutes. Therefore, if Garry walks around the park at a pace of 5 km/h instead of his usual pace of 3 km/h, he will finish the walk in 54 minutes less than he would have taken at his usual pace.
Response:  First, we know that Solan sold 100 units of her products in total during the three days. On the first day, she sold 50% more than the previous day, so she sold 50 units on the first day (since there were no sales on the previous day).  On the second day, she sold 50 fewer units than the previous day, so she sold 50 - 50 = 0 units on the second day (since there were no sales on the second day).  Finally, on the third day, she sold 50% more than the previous day, so she sold 50 + 50 = 100 units on the third day.  Therefore, in total, Solan sold 50 + 0 + 100 = 150 units over the three days.
Response:  We know that before 4 days, there were 4 cubic meters of water in the large reservoir and 2 cubic meters of water in the small reservoir. After 4 days, the amount of water in the large reservoir increased to 8 cubic meters, while the amount of water in the small reservoir remained unchanged at 2 cubic meters. So we can set up an equation based on this information: Large Reservoir: Before = 4m^3 (since it had 4 m^3 of water) After = 8m^3 (since it has 8 m^3 of water now) Small Reservoir: Before = 2m^3 (since it had 2 m^3 of water) After = 2m^3 (since it still has 2 m^3 of water) Now let's solve for the unknown quantity - how much water is currently in the small reservoir? To do this, we need to subtract the amount of water in the small reservoir after from the amount of water in the small reservoir before: 2m^3 - 2m^3 = 0m^3 Since there is no change in the amount of water in the small reservoir, there are still 2 cubic meters of water in the small reservoir. Therefore, the answer is: There are currently 2 cubic meters of water in the small reservoir.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Lorri needs to work in order to earn $320. We know that she gets paid $32 per hour, so we can start by dividing $320 by $32: $$ \frac{320}{32} = 10 $$ This means that Lorri needs to work for 10 hours to earn $320. Now let's consider the cost of the shoes and the bag. The shoes cost $32 each, so if Lorri buys two pairs, the total cost will be: $$ 2 \times 32 = 64 $$ The bag costs $32 as well, so the total cost of both items will be: $$ 64 + 32 = 96 $$ Therefore, Lorri needs to work for at least 10 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the bag.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Genti will receive each month if she pays $165 per month for 12 months.  To do this, we can multiply $165 by 12 to get:  $165 x 12 = $1980  So, Genti will pay $1980 over the course of 12 months.  Next, we need to calculate how much interest she will earn on her investment.  We know that she will earn 10% interest per year, so we can divide $2000 (the amount she invested) by 10 to get: $2000 / 10 = $200  This means that Genti will earn $200 in interest over the course of the year.  Now, let's add up all the amounts that Genti will receive over the course of the year:  $1980 (from her payments) + $200 (interest) = $2180  So, Genti will have received a total of $2180 at the end of the year.  Finally, we need to subtract the amount she paid ($1980) from the total amount she received to find out how much money she has left:  $2180 - $1980 = $200  Therefore, Genti will have $200 left after making 12 payments of $165 each.
Response:  We know that there are 4 walls in Agartal and each wall has 7 windows. So, we can start by calculating how many windows there are in total. Total number of windows = Number of walls x Number of windows per wall Total number of windows = 4 x 7 Total number of windows = 28 Now, let's calculate the total area of all the windows in Agartal. To do this, we need to find out the size of one window. Let's assume that each window is rectangular with a length of 3 meters and a width of 2 meters. Area of one window = Length x Width Area of one window = 3 x 2 Area of one window = 6 square meters Now, let's calculate the total area of all the windows in Agartal. Total area of all windows = Number of windows x Area of one window Total area of all windows = 28 x 6 Total area of all windows = 168 square meters Therefore, there are 168 square meters of windows in Agartal.
"Response:  First, we know that Adrian is 3 years older than his daughter, and his daughter is 21 years old now. So, Adrian's current age is:  
Adrian's age = Daughter's age + 3  
Adrian's age = 21 + 3  
Adrian's age = 24  
Therefore, Adrian is currently 24 years old."
Response:  We know that there are four students who participated in the game: Naomi, Yori, Brianah, and Gogi.  Firstly, we can calculate how many points each student scored based on the information given:  Naomi scored 68 points.  Yori scored 10 more than Naomi, so Yori scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.  Brianah scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brianah scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.  Gogi scored less than Naomi by 43 points, so Gogi scored 68 - 43 = 25 points. Now let's add up all the scores to find out the total score of all four students: Naomi: 68 points Yori: 78 points Brianah: 85 points Gogi: 25 points Total score: 68 + 78 + 85 + 25 = 260 points Therefore, the total score of all four students is 260 points.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time she spent on each subject in total for the week. We know that she studied for 10 minutes per day and there were 7 days in the week, so she studied for a total of 7 x 10 = 70 minutes. Now let's divide this number by the amount of time she spent on each subject to find out what percentage of her study time was dedicated to each one. For example, if she spent 5 minutes per day on math, then she studied math for 5/70 = 7% of her total study time. Similarly, she studied science for 3/70 = 4% of her total study time. Finally, we can add up these percentages to find out what percentage of her study time was dedicated to all three subjects combined: 7 + 4 + 3 = 14%. So, she spent approximately 14% of her study time on math, 7% on science, and 89% on other subjects (since 70 - 14 - 7 = 89).
Response:  First, we know that Michal used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. This means that she has 120 - 90 = 30 liters of water left in the tank.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many flowers are in each bunch (90 - 40 = 50). Then, we divide that number by the total number of bunches (50 / 3) to get the average number of flowers per bunch. Finally, we multiply that number by the total number of bunches to find out how many flowers there are altogether. So, if we have 3 bunches with 50 flowers each, then we have 3 x 50 = 150 flowers in all.
Response:  First, we know that the company paid $15,000 for the first year of the contract.  Second, we know that the company will pay $3,000 per year for each of the next three years.  So, if we multiply $3,000 by three, we get $9,000.  Therefore, the total amount that the company will pay for all five years is $15,000 + $9,000 = $24,000.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each of them will earn if they work for 3 and 5 hours respectively.  For Karlos, we know that he will earn $30 per hour, so if he works for 3 hours, he will earn:  
$30 x 3 = $90  And for Bangi, we know that she will earn $18 per hour, so if she works for 5 hours, she will earn:  
$18 x 5 = $90  Now, let's add up their total earnings:  
$90 + $90 = $180  So, together they will earn $180 in total."
Response: 1) The distance from Munich to Rothenburg ob der Tauber is approximately 200 km (124 miles). 2) Assuming an average speed of 60 km/h (37 mph) for the bus ride, it would take around 3-4 hours to reach Rothenburg ob der Tauber from Munich. 3) For the return journey, assuming the same average speed and without any stops, it would take around 3-4 hours to get back to Munich. Therefore, if Andro wants to travel from Munich to Rothenburg ob der Tauber and back by bus, he will spend around 6-8 hours on the road. However, there might be some additional time spent on waiting at bus stations or making connections, so we should add some extra time to the total duration. To calculate the exact number of days needed for the trip, let's consider the following factors: - Bus travel time (as calculated above): 6-8 hours - Time spent exploring Rothenburg ob der Tauber: 2-3 days - Traveling time between Rothenburg ob der Tauber and other destinations in Bavaria (assuming similar distances and travel times as before): 2-3 days Total duration: 6-8 + 2-3 + 2-3 = 10-13 days If Andro plans to use public transportation (buses and trains), he may need to spend more time on traveling than if he were driving his own car. Additionally, depending on his preferences and interests, he may want to adjust the itinerary accordingly. In conclusion, based on these calculations, Andro needs about 10-13 days to visit Rothenburg ob der Tauber and other destinations in Bavaria using public transportation.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Giymes has 30 types of fire, 20 types of water, and -40 types of ice. If he destroys 8 types of water and acquires 14 types of fire, what will be the most likely type of element to appear in the resulting mixture?  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the ratio of each element after Giymes' actions.  We can start by listing out all the elements and their initial quantities:  Fire: 30 Water: 20 Ice: -40 Now, let's see how each element changes due to Giymes' actions:  Fire: +14 (acquired) Water: -8 (destroyed) Ice: 0 (no change) Next, we need to find the total quantity of each element after Giymes' actions:  Fire: 30 + 14 = 44 Water: 20 - 8 = 12 Ice: 0 So, based on the ratios, the most likely type of element to appear in the resulting mixture is... *drumroll*...fire! Specifically, there will be 44 units of fire for every 12 units of water remaining.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much he earns from each sandwich: 6.50 x 3 = 19.50 (he earns 19.50 from three sandwiches). Then we add the additional costs: 2 + 1 + 1 + 0.25 = 4.25 (additional costs are 4.25) Now let's subtract the total cost from his income: 19.50 - 4.25 = 15.25 He still owes 15.25 dollars.
Response: 1) The mother can put half of the puzzle pieces (180) in the box. 2) Kalinda can add 4 more pieces to the box. 3) The mother can add another half of the puzzle pieces (180). Therefore, together they will have all 360 pieces. Time needed: 2 x 180 = 360 minutes or 6 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that out of the original 120 eggs, 30 were not suitable for incubation due to various reasons. So, we have 90 eggs left (120 - 30 = 90). Now, after three weeks, we assume that all the remaining 90 eggs hatched successfully. Therefore, there are no more eggs left in the nest. However, since the mother hen returned with only three-quarters of the eggs she laid, we can infer that 75 eggs (3/4 x 90) did not hatch. Hence, the number of eggs that did not hatch after the three weeks is 75.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Mark paid for each unit of his products. We know that he paid $20 per unit and then an additional $1000 registration fee for each unit. So, the total amount he paid for one unit is: Total cost = $20 + $1000 = $1020 per unit. Now, let's calculate the total amount Mark paid for all 12 units: Total amount = 12 x $1020 = $12,240.
Response:  On day 2, Kayli collected 5 more shells than Robbert, who collected 20 shells. So, Kayli collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on day 2. On day 3, Kayli found twice as many shells as she did on day 2, so she found 2 x 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kayli collected 50 shells on day 3.
Response: 1) We know that there are 50 trees in the garden. 2) Each tree has two branches (on average). 3) Each branch has three leaves (on average). Therefore, we can calculate the total number of leaves as follows: Total number of leaves = Number of trees x Number of branches per tree x Number of leaves per branch Average number of branches per tree = 50 trees x 2 branches/tree = 100 branches Average number of leaves per branch = 100 branches x 3 leaves/branch = 300 leaves So, there are 300 leaves in the garden.
Response:  We know that there are 36 ping pong balls in total, and 3 of them are hidden in the okyinos (a type of container used to store food). That means we have 33 ping pong balls left for the rest of the activities. Now, let's consider how many ping pong balls will be left after each activity: 1. Ping pong ball toss: 20 ping pong balls will be thrown into the air, but only 15 of them will land inside the circle drawn on the ground. So, 5 ping pong balls will not be accounted for. Therefore, we will have 33 - 5 = 28 ping pong balls left after this activity. 2. Pinata breaking: Out of the remaining 28 ping pong balls, 7 will be broken when hitting the pinata. This leaves us with 28 - 7 = 21 ping pong balls. 3. Eating aruchat ha'arb (the evening meal): 4 ping pong balls will be eaten during the meal, leaving us with 21 - 4 = 17 ping pong balls. Finally, we can conclude that 17 ping pong balls will remain after all the activities.
Response: 1) How many meals does he eat per day? - 2 meals (according to the information given). 2) How many bites does he eat in each meal? - We don't know this information. 3) What is his current weight? - We don't know this information either. 4) How much weight gain is desired? - Also unknown. To determine how many apples Steve needs to eat, we need more information about his diet and goals. Without additional context, it's impossible to provide an accurate answer.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend can receive up to 4 gifts. Since the gifts are sold only in packs of 8, we need to round down the number of gifts each friend receives to the nearest whole number. So, if we divide 20 by 8, we get: 20/8 = 2 with a remainder of 4. This means that each friend will receive 2 gifts, plus or minus one gift (since we rounded down). Therefore, Jon needs to purchase at least 2 x 20 = 40 gifts in total.
"Response:  If Rami has 25 stamps and he uses them to create new stamps by combining five empty stamps together, then he will have:  

25 stamps x 5 combinations = 125 combinations (since each stamp can be used in five different combinations) 

So, Rami will have 125 new stamps after using his 25 original stamps."
Response:  First, we know that Johnny had $20 at the beginning of the year and added $10 more later. So he had a total of $30. Next, we know that he spent $3 on each of the three ice creams, so he spent a total of $9. Therefore, after spending $9, Johnny was left with $30 - $9 = $21.
Response:  If Giselle was born in 1985 and passed away at age 20 in 2005, that means she lived for 20 years.  Now, let's calculate how much each of her three daughters would have received if they had inherited equally from their mother's estate.  Since Giselle lived for 20 years after her eldest daughter was born, we can assume that each daughter was born approximately 7 years apart (give or take a year).  So, let's call the ages of the daughters A, B, and C as follows:  A = 7, B = 14, and C = 21.  Now, let's calculate how much each daughter would have received based on their respective ages at the time of their mother's passing:  For A (age 7), we'll use half of Giselle's total assets since children under the age of majority don't typically inherit directly.  Let's say Giselle's total assets were $1 million.  Half of that is $500,000, which is what A would have received.  For B (age 14), we'll use one-quarter of Giselle's total assets since teenagers often receive less than adult children.  Let's say Giselle's total assets were $1 million.  One-quarter of that is $250,000, which is what B would have received.  For C (age 21), we'll use the remaining one-quarter of Giselle's total assets since adult children typically receive more than minors and teenagers.  Let's say Giselle's total assets were $1 million.  One-quarter of that is $250,000, which is what C would have received.  Therefore, the distribution of Giselle's assets among her three daughters would be as follows:  A (age 7) - $500,000  B (age 14) - $250,000  C (age 21) - $250,000
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 1000 students in the school and 30% of them left through exit A. This means that 300 students left through exit A (1000 x 30%). Now, we need to find out how many students left through exits B and C combined. We know that 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, so let's calculate first how many students remained after exit A.  Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700 Students who left through exit B = 3/5 x 700 = 420 Students who left through exit C = 1000 - 420 - 300 = 280 Therefore, the total number of students who left through exit G is: Total number of students who left through exit G = 300 + 420 + 280 = 900
Response:  If Robert has 6 more managers than John, and John has 54 managers, then we can start by finding out how many managers Robert has. We know that Robert has 6 more managers than John, so if John has 54 managers, Robert must have 54 + 6 = 60 managers.  Therefore, there are 60 - 54 = 6 more managers for Robert than John.
"Response:  If Dolly and Pandora each have one book, then together they will have two books (1 + 1 = 2).  So, if they both call their own books ""their books,"" they will have called a total of two books by the end of it (2)."
Response: 1) He wrote 5 letters in total (2 letters per person). 2) Each letter was 2 pages long (since each person received two letters from him). 3) Therefore, he spent 4 hours writing the letters (2 pages x 5 people = 4 hours).  So, he spent 4 hours writing the letters over the course of the week.
"Response:  First, we know that Gideon has 1000 minutes in the month (since he spends 15 minutes per day talking to his boss and has 300 extra minutes for other conversations). We also know that there are 30 days in this month. So, if we divide 1000 by 30, we get: 

1000 / 30 = 33.33 minutes per day 

So, Gideon has 33.33 minutes of free time each day."
"Response:  Firstly, Geryfin ate 24 chips.  Secondly, he took 5 more from the bag. Thirdly, Jingger gave him another 3 less than the number of chips he took (i.e., 5 - 3 = 2). Finally, if there were originally 27 chips in the bag, how many chips did Jingger give to Geryfin?  To find out, we need to subtract the number of chips that Geryfin ate and took from the original amount:  
27 - (24 + 5) = 27 - 29 = 27 - (-2) = 29 + 2 = 31  Therefore, Jingger gave Geryfin 31 chips."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 chalilim in one aquarium and 32 chalilim in another aquarium. The difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums is equal to the number of fish in the second aquarium minus the number of fish in the first aquarium. This can be represented mathematically as follows:  
Let X represent the number of fish in the first aquarium (the one with 4 chalilim). Since we know that there are 4 chalilim in this aquarium, we can write:  
X = 4  Now let Y represent the number of fish in the second aquarium (the one with 32 chalilim). We want to find out how many fish are in this aquarium, so we can write:  
Y =? To find the difference between the two numbers, we subtract X from Y:  
Y - X =? Substituting the values we have found for X and Y gives us:  
Y - X = 32 - 4 = 28 So there are 28 more fish in the second aquarium than in the first aquarium. Therefore, if there were the same number of fish in both aquariums, there would be 28 + 4 = 32 fish in total in both aquariums."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time Gina spends working on each short film. We know that she works for 6 hours per day and needs to work on each short film for 4 times in a week (i.e., 4 x 6 = 24 hours). Since there are 5 weeks in total, the total number of hours Gina spends working on all five short films is:  24 hours/day x 5 days/week x 5 weeks = 500 hours. Next, we need to calculate how much money Gina earns from each short film. We know that she charges $250 per hour and spends 6 hours per day working on each short film. Therefore, her daily earnings from each short film are:  250 dollars/hour x 6 hours/day = $1,500 per day. Multiplying this amount by the total number of days she works on each short film (i.e., 5 days), we get:  1,500 dollars/day x 5 days = $7,500 per short film. Finally, since Gina makes four short films, her total earnings from all four films are:  7,500 dollars/short film x 4 short films = $30,000. Now let's calculate the commission Gina receives as a percentage of her total earnings. We know that she gives a 10% commission to the editor who finishes the final cut of each short film. Therefore, her commission can be calculated as follows: Commission = Total Earnings x Commission Percentage Total Earnings = $30,000 Commission Percentage = 10% Commission = $3,000 So, Gina receives a commission of $3,000 or 10% of her total earnings of $30,000.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each guest will pay for their meal. We know that there are 12 dishes at $43 per person, so the total cost of the meal is:  
$43 x 12 = $516  
Next, we need to add the costs of the drinks and desserts. We know that there are 15 drinks at $4 each and 4 desserts at $8 each, so the total cost of drinks and desserts is:  
$4 x 15 = $60  
$8 x 4 = $32  
Now, let's add all these costs together to find out how much each guest will pay:  
$516 + $60 + $32 = $608  
Finally, we need to divide this amount among the three hosts. Since there are two hosts and one hostess, they will split the cost equally, so each guest will pay:  
$608 / 3 = $202.67 per person"
Response:  First, we know that each bottle of wine costs $1.50.  We also know that Shlomi bought four bottles of wine. So if we multiply the cost per bottle by the number of bottles he bought, we get: 1.5 x 4 = 6 dollars.  Therefore, Shlomi paid a total of six dollars for his wine.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many calories So eats in total per day. We know that she eats 4 more eggs on Day 2 and 2 more eggs on Day 3 than on Day 1. Therefore, her daily egg consumption is:  
Day 1: 4 eggs x 70 kcal/egg = 280 kcal  
Day 2: 4 + 2 = 6 eggs x 70 kcal/egg = 420 kcal  
Day 3: 2 + 2 = 4 eggs x 70 kcal/egg = 280 kcal  
Total daily egg consumption: 280 + 420 + 280 = 980 kcal  
Now, let's calculate how many calories So needs from other sources besides eggs to maintain her weight. Assuming she consumes an average of 2000 kcal per day, we can calculate her daily caloric needs as follows:  
Daily caloric needs = Total body weight x Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) x Activity Factor  
BMR = 655 kcal/day for a 150-pound woman like So  
Activity Factor = 1.2 (assuming moderately active lifestyle)  
Daily caloric needs = 150 lb x 655 kcal/day x 1.2 = 2182 kcal/day  
Therefore, So needs approximately 2182 - 980 = 1202 kcal per day from other sources besides eggs to maintain her weight."
