Explanation: To find the total amount of money that will be raised from selling the cars, we need to multiply the number of cars by their respective prices and then add them up. For Dzeni 1, there are 3 cars at $68 each, so the total price is $68 x 3 = $204. For Dzeni 2, there are 2 cars at $80 each, so the total price is $80 x 2 = $160. And for Dzeni 6, there is one car at $55 each, so the total price is $55 x 1 = $55. Therefore, the total amount of money that will be raised from selling the cars is $204 + $160 + $55 = $1749."

Step-by-step solution:

1. Calculate the total amount of money spent by Vincent for buying three items at $2.50 each:
Total cost = 3 x $2.50 = $7.50
2. Calculate the total amount of money spent by Vincent for buying two items at $1 each:
Total cost = 2 x $1 = $2
3. Add the total costs from steps 1 and 2 to get the overall total amount of money spent by Vincent:
Overall total cost = $7.50 + $2 = $9.50
4. Divide the overall total cost by the number of items bought (18 in this case):
Number of items = $9.50 / $2.50 = 18
Therefore, Vincent has bought 18 items."

Explanation: To calculate the amount of money that will be left after paying off the loan of $100 with an interest rate of 30%, we need to use the formula:

Amount = Principal + Interest

Principal = $100
Interest = $30 (since it's a 30% interest rate)
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $100 + ($100 x 30%)
= $100 + $30
= $130

So, the amount of money that will be left after paying off the loan is $130."

Explanation: To calculate the total number of bags of maize required to produce 300 bags of skonzi at a rate of 120 bags per 100 kg of maize, we need to first convert the weight from kg to bags. Since each bag of maize weighs 50 kg, we can calculate the number of bags as follows:

Number of bags = Weight in kg / Weight per bag
= 300 bags x 120 bags/100 kg
= 36000 bags

Now, since each bag of skonzi requires 4 bags of maize, we can calculate the total number of bags of maize required as follows:

Total number of bags = Number of bags of skonzi / Number of bags of maize per bag of skonzi
= 36000 bags / 4 bags/bag of skonzi
= 90000 bags

Therefore, the total number of bags of maize required to produce 300 bags of skonzi is 90,000 bags."

Explanation: To calculate the total amount of money that Sara will have after buying 2 sets of jackets and vests for $30 each set, we need to first calculate the cost of one set of jacket and vest. The cost of one set is $30 / 2 = $15 per set. Since Sara has bought 2 sets, she has spent $15 x 2 = $30. Now, let's assume that Sara has $100 before buying the jackets and vests. After buying them, she has $100 - $30 = $70 left. Finally, let's assume that she spends $5 on each of the four children every month. So, the total amount of money that Sara will have after buying the jackets and vests is $70 + ($5 x 4) = $67890."

Explanation: To calculate the total cost of the food items, we need to multiply each item's price by its quantity and then add them up. For example, the chicken costs $6.50 x 3 = $19.50, the beef costs $2 x 2 = $4, the goat meat costs $1 x 4 = $4, the fish costs $1 x 5 = $5, and the vegetables cost $1 x 2 = $2. Therefore, the total cost of all the food items is $19.50 + $4 + $4 + $5 + $2 = $4789."

Explanation: To calculate the number of slices of pizza that John can get for his friends, we need to divide the total number of slices (48) by the number of friends (20). This gives us 2.4 slices per friend. Since each slice is divided into 8 equal parts, John can give out 2.4 x 8 = 19.2 slices of pizza to his friends. However, since there are remainders left over after dividing the whole number of slices by the number of friends, John will have 16 remaining slices leftover."
