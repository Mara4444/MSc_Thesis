Josh invested $80,000 in a house and spent $50,000 on furniture and appliances. He sold the house for $250,000 after five years, making a profit of $170,000 ($250,000 - $80,000). So Josh made a profit of 170%.
Now let's calculate the percentage increase in value over time:
Value of House at Time t = Price at Time t + Profit at Time t
$150,000 (value at time 5) / $80,000 (price at time 0) x 100 = 187.5%
So the value of the house increased by 187.5% over the five-year period."

1. Every day, Wendy prepares three meals for Murthy and his friends.
2. Each meal contains 3 cups of rice, 1 cup of lentils, 1/4 cup of vegetables, and 1/4 cup of ghee (clarified butter).
3. In total, Murthy eats 3 times as much food as he did before, which is 9 cups of rice, 3 cups of lentils, 1 1/4 cups of vegetables, and 1 1/4 cups of ghee per day.
4. After dinner, Wendy gives Murthy an additional 25 cups of water to drink.
5. Therefore, in total, Murphy consumes 36 cups of food and drink every day (9 cups of rice + 3 cups of lentils + 1 1/4 cups of vegetables + 1 1/4 cups of ghee + 25 cups of water).
6. The volume of Murphy's stomach is 20 mugs.
7. To calculate how many full mugs of food Murphy can eat in one day, we need to divide the total amount of food consumed by the volume of his stomach. So, 36 cups of food / 20 mugs = 18 full mugs of food that Murphy can eat in one day.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 18 full mugs of food that Murphy can eat in one day."

"Response: 
Yearly income of Neem is $90 per tree.
Each tree produces 7 tons of neem every year.
So, total annual production of neem from all trees = Total number of trees x Yearly income per tree
= 1500 trees x $90/tree = $135,000
Now, let's calculate how much money can be made selling each ton of neem.
Cost price of neem = $1.50/kg (as given in the question)
Selling price of neem = $2.50/kg (assuming no profit margin)
Profit per kg of neem = Selling price - Cost price
= $2.50 - $1.50 = $1.00/kg
Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling one ton of neem.
Total revenue = Number of kgs sold x Profit per kg
= 7 tons x $1.00/kg = $7,000
Therefore, if all 1500 trees produce neem equally well and there is no wastage, then the total amount of money that can be made selling neem from these trees is $7,000 per ton."

1. Melanie wants to sell her five vacuum cleaners in different houses.
2. She has two orange houses and one green house where she can keep them.
3. Each vacuum cleaner costs $50.
4. To calculate the total cost of selling all five vacuum cleaners, we need to multiply the number of vacuum cleaners by their individual price. So, the total cost would be $50 x 5 = $250.
5. Now, let's find out how much profit Melanie will make from selling these vacuum cleaners. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the revenue. In this case, COGS is $250, and the revenue is $250 x 5 = $1,250. Therefore, Melanie will make a profit of $1,250 - $250 = $1,000."

From the given information, we know that out of 20 students, 8 are good at dance (20%), 5 are good at music (25%), and 7 are good at both dance and music (35%). So, the total number of students who are good at either dance or music is:

8 + 5 + 7 = 20

Now, let's find out how many students are good at hip hop among those who are good at either dance or music:

Out of 20 students who are good at either dance or music, 14 are good at dance (7 + 7) and 6 are good at music (5 + 1). Since hip hop is a subcategory of dance, all 14 students who are good at dance are also good at hip hop. Therefore, the number of students who are good at hip hop is:

14 x 1 = 14

So, there are 14 students who are good at hip hop among the 20 students who are good at either dance or music."
"Response: 
The cost of purchasing an electric vehicle (EV) is $50,000 and that of a gasoline-powered vehicle is $30,000. If the tax incentive for buying an EV is $2,500, then the effective price difference between the two vehicles would be:

Effective Price Difference = Cost of EV - Tax Incentive = $50,000 - $2,500 = $47,500

Now, let's assume that the market share of EVs increases from 2.5% to 8.5%. Based on the given information, we can calculate the additional revenue generated by selling more EVs as follows:

Additional Revenue = Total Market Size x Percentage Change in Market Share
= $1,250,000,000 x (8.5% - 2.5%)
= $106,250,000

So, if the entrepreneur chooses to sell more EVs, they could potentially generate an additional revenue of $106 million."

"Response: 
The number of teachers in a district is 200 and they work for 8 hours per day. Therefore, the total number of working hours per day is 200 x 8 = 1600 hours per day.
Now, let's calculate the total number of working days in a year. There are 30 days in each month, so there are 30 x 12 = 360 months in a year. Therefore, the total number of working days in a year is 1600 hours/day x 360 days/year = 576,000 hours/year.
Now, let's convert this to rupees. If the daily salary of a teacher is Rs. 500, then their annual salary would be Rs. 576,000 / 365 days (as there are 365 days in a non-leap year) = Rs. 1,59,440."

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take to eat 30 omlets during this period of 72 hours:
1. There are 7 days in a week.
2. If we eat 3 omlets per day, then the number of omlets eaten in one day = 3.
So, the total number of omlets eaten in 7 days = 3 x 7 = 21 omlets.
Therefore, it will take 30/21 = 1.43 days to eat all 30 omlets."

Mariam is walking at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4 hours. Then she takes a break for 1 hour and walks again for another 4 hours at a speed of 8 miles per hour. If Mariam has an average pace of 4 miles per hour, what is her total distance traveled?
Let's first calculate the distance covered during the first 4 hours of walking:
Distance = Speed x Time = 12 miles/hour x 4 hours = 48 miles
Now let's calculate the distance covered during the second 4 hours of walking:
Distance = Speed x Time = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours = 32 miles
Total distance traveled = Distance during first 4 hours + Distance during second 4 hours = 48 miles + 32 miles = 80 miles
Therefore, Mariam travels a total distance of 80 miles."
"Response:  We have to find out how much water is required to fill three tins of capacity 3 liters each and one tin of capacity 24 liters.

We know that we have 10 liters of orange juice and we want to fill 3 tins of capacity 3 liters each, so we need 3 x 3 = 9 liters of water for this purpose.

Now, we are left with 10 - 9 = 1 liter of orange juice.

To fill one tin of capacity 24 liters, we need 24 / 3 = 8 liters of water. So, we have 1 - 8 = -7 liters of water remaining after filling one tin.

Therefore, the final amount of water available is -7 liters."

"Response: 
Gloria bought a pair of shoes for $30 and then sold them at a profit of $15 per pair. If she had to sell each shoe separately, how much would she charge for one shoe?
Let's break down the calculation:
$30 (cost price) + ($15 x number of pairs sold) = total revenue
Total revenue = $30 + ($15 x number of pairs sold)
Now, we need to find out how many pairs Gloria sold. According to the question, if she sold 2 pairs, she made a profit of $30 - $45 = $-15. So, she must have sold 3 pairs in total.
Now, let's calculate the cost price of one shoe:
Cost price of one shoe = Total revenue / Number of pairs sold
Cost price of one shoe = $30 + ($15 x number of pairs sold) / 3
Cost price of one shoe = $30 + $5 / 3
Cost price of one shoe = $35
So, Gloria charges $35 for one shoe."

1. John has 10 cats and each cat spends 5 hours per day sleeping. So in total, John's cats spend 50 hours (10 x 5) sleeping per day.
2. In a week, there are 7 days, so the total time spent sleeping by John's cats is 7 x 50 = 350 hours.
Now let's calculate how much money John spends on his cats in a week:
1. Each cat eats 2 kg of food per day, which costs $20 per kg.
So John spends $40 ($20 x 2 kg) on food for each cat per day.
2. Since there are 10 cats, John spends $400 ($40 x 10 cats) on food per day.
3. In a week, there are 7 days, so John spends $2800 ($400 x 7 days) on food for his cats in a week.
Now let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on his cats in a month:
1. There are 4 weeks in a month, so John spends $11,200 ($2800 x 4 weeks) on food for his cats in a month.
And finally, let's calculate the total amount of money John spends on his cats in a year:
1. There are 12 months in a year, so John spends $134,400 ($11,200 x 12 months) on food for his cats in a year."
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice Grechen can make with 110 kg of rice and how much Sonak will get after selling 30 tonnes of rice. So, we need to convert 110 kg to tonnes first.

"Response: 

1. Denna has 3 miles to walk in 2 hours. So she will walk at a rate of 1.5 miles per hour (3 miles / 2 hours = 1.5 miles/hour).
2. If it takes her 10 minutes to walk one mile, then she will take 10 x 1.5 = 15 minutes to walk 1.5 miles.
3. Therefore, she will cover a distance of 1.5 miles in 15 minutes.
4. To find out how many miles she can cover in an hour, we need to divide the distance covered in one minute by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, Denna can cover 1.5 miles in 15 minutes, which means she can cover 1.5 x 60 = 90 miles in an hour.
5. Now, let's calculate how long it would take her to cover 80 miles. Since she can cover 90 miles in an hour, it would take her half an hour to cover 80 miles, i.e., 80 / 90 = 0.875 hours or 50 minutes."

"Response: 

Firstly, we know that 250 calories are present in one bag of chips. So, if he eats 3 bags of chips, then the total number of calories consumed will be 3 x 250 = 750 calories.

Now, let's consider the weight of the thali. If it contains 300 grams of rice and lentils together, then the weight of each item can be calculated as follows:

Weight of rice = Weight of thali / (Weight of rice + Weight of lentils)
= 300 g / (300 g + 150 g)
= 2/3

Similarly, the weight of lentils can be calculated as follows:

Weight of lentils = Weight of thali / (Weight of rice + Weight of lentils)
= 300 g / (300 g + 150 g)
= 1/3

Now, let's calculate the total weight of food consumed in the thali:

Total weight of food consumed = Weight of rice + Weight of lentils
= 2/3 x 300 g + 1/3 x 150 g
= 240 g + 50 g
= 290 g

Finally, to calculate the number of calories consumed from the thali, we need to multiply the total weight of food consumed with the daily calorie requirement of 2000 calories per day:

Number of calories consumed from thali = Total weight of food consumed x Daily calorie requirement
= 290 g x 2000 calories
= 580,000 calories

So, the person has consumed approximately 580,000 calories from the thali."

"Response: 
The number of apartments in Richard's building is 15.
Each apartment has an area of 80 square feet.
So, the total area of all apartments is 15 x 80 = 1200 square feet.
Now, we need to find out how much space each apartment takes up in the building.
Since there are 3/4th of the building's area occupied by the elevator shaft and staircase, the remaining space is 3/4 x 1200 = 900 square feet.
Therefore, each apartment takes up 900 / 15 = 60 square feet of space in the building."

"Response: 
Day 1 (Sunday): 6 truck tires and 4 car tires are sold at Rs. 20 per tire. So, total revenue = 6 x Rs. 20 = Rs. 120 + 4 x Rs. 20 = Rs. 80 = Rs. 200.
Day 2 (Monday): 12 truck tires and 3 car tires are sold at Rs. 25 per tire. So, total revenue = 12 x Rs. 25 = Rs. 300 + 3 x Rs. 25 = Rs. 75 = Rs. 375.
Day 3 (Tuesday): No tires were sold.
Day 4 (Wednesday): 8 truck tires and 2 car tires are sold at Rs. 30 per tire. So, total revenue = 8 x Rs. 30 = Rs. 240 + 2 x Rs. 30 = Rs. 60 = Rs. 300.
Day 5 (Thursday): 4 truck tires and 1 car tire are sold at Rs. 35 per tire. So, total revenue = 4 x Rs. 35 = Rs. 140 + 1 x Rs. 35 = Rs. 35 = Rs. 175.
Day 6 (Friday): 2 truck tires and 1 car tire are sold at Rs. 40 per tire. So, total revenue = 2 x Rs. 40 = Rs. 80 + 1 x Rs. 40 = Rs. 40 = Rs. 120.
Total revenue for all days = Rs. 200 + Rs. 375 + Rs. 300 + Rs. 175 + Rs. 80 + Rs. 40 = Rs. 1,580."

So, 1.5 bags of rice are needed to make 30 tonnes."
"Response: 

Peter has planned to watch 4 movies in 7 days. Each movie ticket costs $7 and he wants to buy popcorn worth $5 for each movie. So, his total expenses for watching movies will be $7 x 4 = $28. Now, if he wants to save some money, he can reduce the number of movies he watches per day. Let's assume he reduces it by 1 movie per day, so he will watch 3 movies in 7 days instead of 4. His daily expense for watching movies will now be $7 x 3 = $21. Therefore, Peter can afford to spend $21 on movies and still have $6 left over after buying tickets and popcorn for all 3 movies."
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total weight of all the boxes that can be loaded onto each truck. Since each box weighs 15 pounds and there are 375 boxes in total, the total weight of all the boxes is:

Total weight of boxes = Number of boxes x Weight per box = 375 x 15 = 5625 pounds

Now, let's find out how much load each truck can carry. As mentioned in the question, each truck has a capacity of 5000 pounds. So, the number of trucks required to transport the entire load of boxes is:

Number of trucks = Total weight of boxes / Load carrying capacity of each truck = 5625 / 5000 = 0.113 (or approximately 1.13 trucks)

Therefore, approximately 1.13 trucks would be needed to transport the entire load of boxes."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total amount paid for the delivery of goods (including taxes).
Total amount = $400 + ($25 x 3%) + ($25 x 25%) = $400 + $75 + $62.50 = $537.50
Step 2: Calculate the remaining balance after paying the final bill.
Remaining balance = Total amount - Final bill = $537.50 - $400 = $137.50
Therefore, the remaining balance is $137.50."
Response:  We have to find out how many apples are in each group of 6 and then sum them up. So, let's assume that there are x apples in each group of 6. Now, we know that there are total 20 groups of apples. Therefore, the total number of apples = 20 x x = 120 apples.
"Response: 

1. The tokri contains 25 taulas of wheat, and each taula weighs 8 kg. So, the total weight of wheat in the tokri is:

25 taulas x 8 kg/taula = 200 kg

2. Now, there are 20% excess grains, which means that for every 100 kg of wheat, there are 20 kg of extra grains. So, the total weight of grains in the tokri including the excess is:

200 kg x 1.2 (for 20% excess) = 240 kg

3. Out of these 240 kg, 20 kg are not good enough for sale, so the actual weight of good grains available for sale is:

240 kg - 20 kg = 220 kg

Now, let's find out how much narangi (a type of fruit) is required to make up for the loss in weight:

Since the weight of wheat lost is 20 kg, and narangi is worth Rs. 1 per kg, the amount of narangi needed to cover the loss is:

20 kg x Rs. 1/kg = Rs. 20

So, the final answer is:

Rs. 20"
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch and the bracelet. The cost of the brooch is $500, and the cost of the bracelet is $800. Therefore, the total cost of both items is:

$500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we need to calculate the profit that Jennet will make after selling both items. According to the question, she will sell them for $1500 each, so the total revenue from both sales is:

$1500 x 2 = $3000

Now, let's subtract the total cost of both items from the total revenue to find out the profit:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $3000 - $1300
= $1700

Therefore, Jennet will make a profit of $1700 after selling both items."

Yearly salary = $40,000 (given)
After 20 years of service, annual raise is 5%. So, new yearly salary will be:
New Yearly Salary = Old Yearly Salary x (1 + 0.05)^20
= $40,000 x (1 + 0.05)^20
= $87,692.50
So, after 20 years of service, the employee will get an annual salary of $87,692.50."
"Response: 

1. Firstly, we need to calculate the total revenue of the streaming service in one year. According to the question, if there are 140 members and each member pays $140 per month, then the total revenue in one year is:

Total Revenue = Number of Members x Monthly Subscription Fee x Number of Months in a Year
= 140 x $140 x 12
= $176,000

So, the total revenue of the streaming service in one year is $176,000.

2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of charging 50% commission on the total revenue. If the commission charged is 50%, then the commission amount is half of the total revenue, i.e.:

Commission Amount = Total Revenue x Commission Percentage
= $176,000 x 0.5
= $88,000

So, the cost of charging 50% commission on the total revenue is $88,000.

3. Finally, we need to calculate the net profit of the streaming service after charging the commission. Net Profit = Total Revenue - Commission Amount
= $176,000 - $88,000
= $98,000

Therefore, the net profit of the streaming service in one year is $98,000."
"Response:  Soffia has to travel 100 miles and she has a tank with her that can hold 12 gallons of gasoline. She starts from a point where the last mile is 40 miles away from the destination. How many stops will she make in between?

Let's assume she makes one stop for refueling every 4 miles (as per the given information). Therefore, she will make 4 stops in total.

So, after completing 40 miles, she will have consumed 4 x 4 = 16 gallons of gasoline. Now, she has 12 - 16 = 6 gallons of gasoline left in her tank.

To find out how many miles she can travel with this remaining fuel, we need to divide the distance left to cover (i.e., 94 miles) by the amount of fuel left in her tank (i.e., 6 gallons):

94 miles / 6 gallons = 15.67 miles per gallon

Therefore, Sofia can travel approximately 15.67 miles with each gallon of gasoline she has left in her tank. Since she has 6 gallons left, she can travel approximately 93 miles (15.67 miles/gallon x 6 gallons)."

"Response: 
The given information is:

* The weight of one khajana (khajane) = 175 tonnes
* The weight of one hera (heera) = 35 tonnes
* The total weight of the khajane and hera = 1000 tonnes

Now, we need to find out how much of each type of stone is present in the mixture.

So, let's convert the weight of khajane and hera into equivalent weights in terms of each other:

Weight of khajane = 175 tonnes x 4 (since there are 4 types of stones) = 600 tonnes
Weight of hera = 35 tonnes x 4 = 140 tonnes

Now, we can see that the total weight of both khajane and hera together is equal to 1000 tonnes, which means that the remaining weight is made up of the mixture of both. So, the proportion of khajane and hera in the mixture would be:

Khajane : Hera = 600 : 140 = 4 : 1

Therefore, if there are 175 tonnes of khajane and 35 tonnes of hera in the mixture, then the weight of each khajane would be:

Weight of khajane = 175 tonnes / 4 = 43.75 tonnes

Similarly, the weight of each hera would be:

Weight of hera = 35 tonnes / 1 = 35 tonnes

So, there are 43.75 tonnes of khajane and 35 tonnes of hera in the mixture."

2. After 8 months, there will be an additional amount of $4000 (based on the given percentage increase in salary every month). So, the total amount earned after 8 months will be approximately $7500.
Therefore, the total amount saved after 8 months will be $7500 - $3500 = $4000."
"Response: 
1. The school has 5 periods in a day and 8 classes in a week.
2. Each period lasts for 40 minutes, so there are 40 minutes per class.
3. There are 15 students in each class.
4. The school year consists of 8 months with 4 weeks in each month.
5. The total number of days in a year is 365 (including leap years).
Now let's calculate the total amount of money that can be earned by each student in a year:
Total number of classes in a year = Number of periods x Number of classes per week x Number of weeks in a year = 5 x 8 x 8 = 400 classes
Total time spent in classes per year = Total number of classes x Time per class = 400 classes x 40 minutes/class = 16,000 minutes
Average time spent in classes per day = Total time spent in classes per year / Number of days in a year = 16,000 minutes / 365 days = 44.7 minutes/day
Now, let's calculate the earning potential of each student in a year:
Each student spends an average of 44.7 minutes/day in classes, which means they have 44.7 minutes of free time per day.
Assuming each minute is worth Rs. 1, we can estimate the daily earning potential of each student as follows:
Daily earning potential = Free time per day x Minimum wage per hour = 44.7 minutes/day x Rs. 1/minute = Rs. 44.7/day
Since there are 30 days in March, the total earning potential of each student in March alone would be:
March earning potential = Daily earning potential x Number of days in March = Rs. 44.7/day x 30 days = Rs. 1,331
Similarly, the total earning potential of each student over the course of an entire year would be:
Yearly earning potential = March earning potential x Number of months in a year = Rs. 1,331 x 8 months = Rs."

* Keleyanak keena doota vyanjan taiyari karabak lele kateteka nirdesh paadh bak. (Keelianak has put the remaining food in a bag and wants to give it away.)

Now, let's calculate the number of portions of food that Keelianak has left after giving away one portion:

Portions of food left = Total portions of food - Portion given away
= 20 - 1
= 19

Therefore, Keelianak has 19 portions of food left after giving away one portion."

1. Shila purchases three mobile phones worth $150 each and pays for them in installments of $50 per month for 3 months.
2. The interest rate is 2%, so she will pay an additional amount as interest over the 3-month period.
3. To calculate the total cost of the mobile phones including interest, we can use the formula: Total Cost = Original Price + Interest.
4. So, the total cost of the three mobile phones for Shila would be: Total Cost = $150 x 3 + ($50 x 3 x 2%) = $510.
Therefore, Shila has to pay $510 for the three mobile phones."
Response:  The market price of Marigold is Rs 274 per kg, Petunia is Rs 187 per kg, and Begonia is Rs 212 per kg. If we sell these flowers in bulk at $2.74 per kg, $1.87 per kg, and $2.12 per kg respectively, how much will we earn? We won't have to worry about transportation costs as they are included in the prices given above. So, let's calculate our total earnings based on the number of kilograms sold. For Marigold, we can sell 12 tons, which is equal to 12 x 274 = Rs 32960 kg. At this rate, we will earn Rs 32960 x $2.74 = $85,772. Similarly, for Petunia, we can sell 9 tons, which is equal to 9 x 187 = Rs 16933 kg. At this rate, we will earn Rs 16933 x $1.87 = $14,600. And for Begonia, we can sell 17 tons, which is equal to 17 x 212 = Rs 35544 kg. At this rate, we will earn Rs 35544 x $2.12 = $73,308. Therefore, our total earnings from selling these three types of flowers in bulk would be $85,772 + $14,600 + $73,308 = $173,680.

Step 1: The depth of the sea at low tide is 4 feet (as given in the question).
Step 2: The height of each stage of the pier is half the width of the sea (i.e., 8 feet).
Step 3: Since there are 4 stages of the pier, the total height of the pier will be 4 x 8 = 32 feet.
So, the height of the highest stage of the pier above the sea level is 16 feet (which is the difference between the total height and the depth of the sea at low tide)."
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of food that Sesilia needs to eat in one year. According to the veterinarian, Sesilia needs to eat 1 kg of dog food per day, which means she needs to eat 365 kg (1 kg/day x 365 days) of dog food in a year.

Now, let's assume that each bag of dog food contains 11 kg of food. Therefore, Sesilia would need 365 bags of dog food (365 kg / 11 kg/bag) in a year.

However, as mentioned in the question, if Sesilia eats only half a bag of dog food every 180 days, then she will have eaten 365/2 = 182.5 bags of dog food in a year.

Therefore, the answer is 182.5 bags of dog food."

"Response: 

Vincent has $250 to spend and wants to buy either a $3 pack of cigarettes or a $1 pack of cigarettes. He is unsure which one to choose because he doesn't want to overspend.

Let X be the number of cigarettes Vincent buys.

If Vincent chooses the $3 pack, then he will spend $3X dollars.

If Vincent chooses the $1 pack, then he will spend $1(X-3) dollars (since he already spent $3 for the first pack).

We are given that Vincent has $250 to spend, so the total cost of the cigarettes he buys cannot exceed this amount. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

$3X + $1(X-3) <= $250

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

$3X + $1X - $3 <= $250

Comparing like terms, we have:

$4X <= $250

Dividing both sides by $4, we get:

X <= $62.5

Therefore, Vincent can buy at most 62 cigarettes with his $250."

1. The teacher has 10 pounds of aloo (potato) and wants to make 20 portions of salad for the students. So, each portion will have 20/10 = 2 pounds of potatoes.
2. Each student gets half of the portion, so they will get 2/2 = 1 pound of potatoes.
3. There are 20 students in total, so the total amount of potatoes consumed by them is 1 pound x 20 = 20 pounds.
4. Since there are 5 pounds of leftover potatoes after all the students have eaten their share, we can calculate the number of portions that were made as follows:

Number of portions = Leftover potatoes / Amount of potatoes per portion
= 5 pounds / 2 pounds
= 2.5 portions

So, approximately 2.5 portions of salad were left over after everyone had eaten their share."

"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Jerry in 38 seconds. As he runs at a speed of 40 meters per second, he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 40 m/s x 38 s = 1520 meters

Now, let's assume that after running for 38 seconds, Jerry takes a break of 10 minutes (600 seconds). During this break, his speed remains constant at 40 meters per second. So, the distance covered during the break is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 40 m/s x 600 s = 24,000 meters

Total distance traveled by Jerry = Distance covered during run + Distance covered during break = 1520 meters + 24,000 meters = 25,420 meters

Therefore, if Jerry continues to run at a speed of 40 meters per second and covers a distance of 25,420 meters in 38 seconds, he will cover a further distance of approximately 40,792 meters in the next 10 minutes (assuming no breaks or changes in speed)."

Firstly, we have to find out how many tomatoes Fred has in total. As per the question, he has 16 bunches of tomatoes and each bunch contains 32 tomatoes. Therefore, Fred has a total of 16 x 32 = 512 tomatoes.

Now, let's calculate how much time it will take for Fred to finish all the tomatoes. As per the question, he can eat one-fourth of a batch in one sitting, which means he can eat 32 tomatoes in one sitting. Since there are 16 batches of tomatoes, it will take him 4 sittings (16 / 4 = 4) to finish all the tomatoes.

Therefore, the answer is 4 sittings or 1008 minutes (4 x 270 = 1008)."

Step 1 (First 15 minutes):
In this time frame of 15 minutes, 10 cars can cross the road.
So, in total, 10 x 15 = 150 cars will have crossed the road.

Step 2 (Next 15 minutes):
In this time frame of 15 minutes, 20 cars can cross the road.
So, in total, 20 x 15 = 300 cars will have crossed the road.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cars that have crossed the road so far:
Total cars = 150 + 300 = 450 cars.

Since there are 5 seconds between each car, and we want to know how many cars will cross the road in the next 15 minutes, we need to divide the total number of cars by the time interval (in this case, 15 minutes). So, the answer is:
Number of cars crossing the road in the next 15 minutes = 450 / 15 = 30 cars per minute."

"Response: 

Firstly, we know that Edrian's total income for the last three years was $30,000 per year, which is equivalent to $90,000 over three years ($30,000 x 3).

Now, let's calculate the increase in his salary each year:

Year 1: $30,000 - $24,000 = $6,000 (increase of $6,000)
Year 2: $24,000 - $20,000 = $4,000 (increase of $4,000)
Year 3: $20,000 - $18,000 = $2,000 (increase of $2,000)

So, the total increase in Edrian's salary over the last three years is $6,000 + $4,000 + $2,000 = $12,000.

Next, we need to find out how much Edrian earned after working for four years. Since he worked for three years and then took a break for one year, his total earnings for the fourth year would be:

$90,000 (total income for last three years) x 4 = $360,000 (Edrian's total earnings for the last four years)

Finally, we can calculate the average annual salary for the last four years by dividing the total earnings by the number of years:

$360,000 / 4 = $90,000 (average annual salary for the last four years)

Therefore, the answer to the question is $90,000."

1. The party wants to buy 38 tons of chicken and sell it for Rs. 60 per kg.
2. They have 38 tons of fish to sell at Rs. 50 per kg.
3. To calculate the total profit, we need to subtract the cost of buying the chicken from the selling price. So, the cost of buying 38 tons of chicken is (38 x Rs. 60) = Rs. 2,340.
4. Now, let's find out how much money they will make after selling all the chicken. Total revenue = Number of tons sold x Selling price per ton = 38 x Rs. 60 = Rs. 2,340.
5. Subtracting the cost of buying the chicken from the revenue gives us the total profit = Profit = Revenue - Cost = Rs. 2,340 - Rs. 2,340 = 0.

So, the party will not make any profit if they buy 38 tons of chicken and sell it at Rs. 60 per kg."

Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of one tarboux (3 pieces):

3 Tarboux x Price per piece = $ 9

Now, let's calculate the total cost of three mirch (3 pieces):

3 Mirch x Price per piece = $ 27

Next, we need to subtract the cost of one tarboux from the cost of three mirch:

$ 27 - $ 9 = $ 18

So, if each mirch costs $ 6, then the total cost of buying four mirch would be:

4 Mirch x Price per piece = $ 24

Finally, we need to add the cost of ten santara (10 pieces) to the total cost of buying mirch:

Total Cost = Total Cost of Mirch + Total Cost of Santara
= $ 24 + $ 50
= $ 74

Therefore, if you buy four mirch and ten santara, the total cost would be approximately $ 74."

So, the total time taken for both is 9 hours.
Now, let's convert this time into miles per day:
Time taken in hours / 60 = Miles per day
9 hours / 60 = 0.15 miles/hour
Now, let's calculate the number of days Budhavar is ahead of Somavar:
Days ahead = Total distance walked by Budhavar / Distance walked by Somavar per day
= 10 miles / 0.15 miles/day
= 73 days
Therefore, Budhavar is 73 days ahead of Somavar."

However, he finds out that one basket is too heavy and weighs 500/2 = 250 kg, while the other two are lighter and weigh only 500/3 = 167 kg each. How will John arrange the boxes in the remaining two baskets so that they are balanced and have an equal weight?
Solution: To balance the weights of the baskets, John can place 167 kg of boxes in each of the remaining two baskets. This means he will need to put 334 kg (167 x 2) of boxes in total in these baskets."

1. The cost of one tyre is Rs 250.
2. There are 3 tires in total (for all 4 wheels). So, the total cost of tires = 3 x Rs 250 = Rs 750.
3. The first day, you filled up 5 liters of petrol for Rs 35 per liter. So, the total cost of petrol for the first day = 5 liters x Rs 35 per liter = Rs 175.
4. On the second day, you filled up 3 liters of petrol for Rs 35 per liter. So, the total cost of petrol for the second day = 3 liters x Rs 35 per liter = Rs 105.
5. On the third day, you filled up 2 liters of petrol for Rs 35 per liter. So, the total cost of petrol for the third day = 2 liters x Rs 35 per liter = Rs 70.
6. Finally, after 3 days, you have spent a total of Rs 750 on tires + Rs 175 on petrol for the first day + Rs 105 on petrol for the second day + Rs 70 on petrol for the third day = Rs 1095.
So, the answer to the question is Rs 1095."
"Response: 
Carl has 10 packets of chips and each packet contains 6 chips. The price of each chip is $0.10. Carl wants to know how much he will have to pay for 10 notes of $10 each.
So, we need to calculate the total number of chips Carl will get if he pays with 10 notes of $10 each.
Total number of chips = Number of packets x Number of chips in each packet
= 10 x 6
= 60 chips
Now, we need to convert the amount paid in notes to the actual cost of the chips.
Actual cost = Amount paid / Total number of chips
= $10 x 10
= $100
Therefore, Carl will have to pay $100 for 60 chips."

"Response: 

Black and White pieces are placed on the board as follows:

* Black: 15 pawns (10 on the first rank and 5 on the second rank)
* White: 10 pawns (all on the second rank)

Now, let's analyze the position:

* The black pawns are lined up in two rows of five each, with one pawn missing from the middle row. This means that there is only one possible move for the black pawns to make.
* The white pawns are also lined up in two rows of five each, but they have more mobility than the black pawns due to their placement on the second rank.
* There are 40 squares between the two ranks, which means that the black pawns can potentially reach any square on the board except for those occupied by other black pawns or the king.
* The white pawns can potentially reach any square on the board except for those occupied by other white pawns or the king.
* The black king is not in check, so it cannot be captured.
* The white king is not in check either, so it is safe.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the best move for both sides would be to advance their respective pawns one square forward. Therefore, the winner of this puzzle is... (drumroll please)... neither side! Both players will end up with the same position after advancing their pawns, and no piece will be captured. Well done!"

"Response: 

1. The total area of the rectangular garden is given as 80 square meters.
2. Each row has 8 plants, and each plant takes up 6 square feet (or 0.54 square meters) of space. Therefore, the number of plants in each row = Total area / Area per plant = 80 sqm / 0.54 sqm = 153 plants.
3. Since there are 3 rows, the total number of plants in the garden = Number of plants in each row x Number of rows = 153 plants x 3 rows = 459 plants.
4. Now, let's calculate the length of each row. If we divide the total area of the garden by the number of rows, we get the length of each row = Total area / Number of rows = 80 sqm / 3 rows = 26.67 meters (or approximately 27 meters).
5. Finally, to find out how many paces Jack can take in each row, we need to know his stride length. According to the question, he takes 80 steps in each row, which means he covers a distance of 80/step length = 80/x meters where x is the stride length. So, if Jack's stride length is 1 meter, for example, he can cover a distance of 80 meters in each row."
"Response: 

1. Kavita is 40 years old and has worked for 20 years. So her total work experience is 40 + 20 = 60 years.
2. Salary of Kavita's mother is Rs 30,000 per month.
3. Kavita's mother is 75 years old and has been working for 30 years. So her total work experience is 75 + 30 = 105 years.
4. If Kavita works for 3 more years, she will be 43 years old.
5. If Kavita works for 3 more years after that, she will be 46 years old.
6. Therefore, if Kavita works for 3 more years, her total work experience will be 43 + 3 = 46 years.
7. And if Kavita works for another 3 years after that, her total work experience will be 46 + 3 = 49 years.

So, Kavita's total work experience at the age of 49 years is 60 + 46 + 49 = 155 years."

1. Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jesica needs to pay for her loans in one year.

Loan Amount = Credit Card Loan + Student Loan = $300 x 12 = $3600

So, Jesica needs to pay $3600 per year towards her loans.

2. Now, let's assume that Jesica wants to pay off her loans as quickly as possible and decides to allocate 50% of her income towards loan repayment each month.

Monthly Income = $300 x 12 = $3600 (as calculated in Step 1)
Monthly Loan Repayment = Monthly Income x Percentage Allocated towards Loan Repayment = $3600 x 0.5 = $1800

So, Jesica will pay $1800 towards her loans every month."

2. Each person will have approximately 1/4th of an aloo (potato) as their share.
3. There are 6 people in total, so the total number of aloo required is 6 x 1/4 = 3.
4. Since each aloo takes around 5 seconds to cut, Bilie needs to cut 3 x 5 = 15 aloos in 30 minutes.

Therefore, Bilie needs to cut approximately 15 aloos in 30 minutes to make salads for his family of 6 people."
"Response: 

1. The cost of one gallon of gasoline is $3.
2. Each galloon of gasoline contains 3.78 liters (since 1 gallon = 3.78 liters).
3. Therefore, the cost of one liter of gasoline is $\$3 / 3.78 \approx \$0.81$.
4. Now, we have to calculate the profit per gallon. Since each gallon costs $\$0.81$, and you sell it for $\$2.50$, your profit per gallon is:

Profit per gallon = Selling price - Cost = $\$2.50 - \$0.81 = \$1.69$.
5. To find out how much money you will make in total, you need to multiply the profit per gallon by the number of gallons sold:

Total profit = Profit per gallon x Number of gallons sold = $\$1.69 x 20 = \$33.80$.

So, after selling 20 gallons of gasoline, you will make a total profit of $\$33.80$."

1. There are 240 Asian elephants in a jungle.
2. Out of these, 80 Japanese elephants have arrived.
3. Now, there are 160 Indian elephants left.
4. If we assume that each Chinese elephant can carry 6 passengers, then how many Chinese elephants will be able to carry passengers?

Solution:

Total number of elephants = 240 (Asian) + 80 (Japanese) = 320

Number of Indian elephants left = 160

Now, let's calculate the number of Chinese elephants that can carry passengers:

Number of Chinese elephants = Total number of elephants - Number of Indian elephants
= 320 - 160
= 160

Therefore, 160 Chinese elephants will be able to carry passengers."
"Response: 
Jayad earned $200 per week and spent $150 on his personal expenses. He also gave $50 to his wife as an allowance. So, his total income after spending is $200 - $150 = $50.
Now, let's calculate how much he saved each month. If he saves $50 every week, then he saves $50 x 4 = $200 per month.
So, if Jayad earned $600 in a month (which is higher than the amount he spent), then he would have saved $200 - $600 = $-400 that month."
"Response: 
Rani has 40 tonnes of wheat and she wants to sell it at Rs. 1800 per quintal. So, her total revenue will be:

40 tonnes x Rs. 1800/tonne = Rs. 72,000
Now, if Janki buys 30 tonnes of wheat from Rani at Rs. 1600 per quintal, then Janki's cost will be:

30 tonnes x Rs. 1600/tonne = Rs. 48,000
So, Janki's profit will be:

Rs. 48,000 - Rs. 72,000 = Rs. (-) 24,000
Therefore, Janki will lose Rs. 24,000 if he buys 30 tonnes of wheat from Rani at Rs. 1600 per quintal."

Sandhya has given an order to Freddy to deliver 200 red roses at Rs. 80 per rose. Sandhya is in a hurry and wants them delivered within 5 minutes. However, Freddy takes 10 minutes to reach the destination due to heavy traffic. So, he will reach after 15 minutes (10 + 5). Now, let's calculate how much time it will take for him to complete his work:
Time taken = Total distance / Speed of delivery vehicle
Distance = Distance between Sandhya and the destination = 5 km (as mentioned in the question)
Speed of delivery vehicle = 40 km/hr (assuming average speed of a two-wheeler)
Time taken = 5 km / 40 km/hr = 0.125 hours or 7.5 minutes
So, Freddy will take 7.5 minutes to deliver the roses after reaching the destination."

"Response: 

1. The farmer sells each barrel of oil at $20 per barrel.
2. Each barrel of oil contains 42 gallons (as mentioned in the question).
3. Therefore, the total revenue from one barrel of oil is: $20 x 42 = $840.
4. If the farmer sells 20 barrels of oil, the total revenue will be: $840 x 20 = $16,800.
5. Now, if the farmer spends $30 per barrel on cultivation and maintenance of the land, then the total cost will be: $16,800 x 30 = $504,000.
6. So, the profit earned by the farmer will be: $504,000 - $400,000 = $104,000.
7. Finally, since the farmer sold 20 barrels of oil, the profit per barrel will be: $104,000 / 20 barrels = $5,200 per barrel."

4. If they want to buy only one color, then the cost per color will be $2.
So, if they want to buy only one color, the cost will be $2."
Response:  The cost of one pen is $1.20 and that of an eraser is $0.30. So, if we want to find out how much it will cost for eight pens and two erasers, we can multiply the cost of each item by the number required. Therefore, the total cost of eight pens will be $8 x $1.20 = $9.60. Similarly, the total cost of two erasers will be $2 x $0.30 = $0.60. Hence, the total cost of eight pens and two erasers together will be $9.60 + $0.60 = $10.20.
"Response: 

1. The city has 40 restaurants and each restaurant serves 200 pounds of gas per month.
So, total amount of gas served in the city = 40 x 200 = 8,000 pounds (or 3,600 kg) per month.
2. If there are 200 people who eat at these restaurants every day, then the average consumption of gas per person per day is:
Gas consumed per person per day = Total gas consumed / Number of people eating = 8,000 lb / 200 = 40 lb (or 18 kg) per person per day.
Therefore, approximately 40 kilograms of gas are consumed by each person who eats at these restaurants daily."

The daily water requirement of Baldur Pokhari is 50 liters per day during the morning (5 AM to 12 PM) and 60 liters per day during the afternoon (1 PM to 6 PM). So, in total, it requires 110 liters of water per day.
Now, let's calculate how much water each balli (unit of measurement for volume) contains:
1 Balli = 5 Liters
So, the total amount of water required per day can be calculated as follows:
110 Liters / 5 Liters per Balli = 22 Balli

"Response:  John gets a bonus of $500 every month and his salary increases by 5% every year. If he works for 40 hours per week, then his total income in one year is:

Total Income = Bonus + Salary
= $500 x 12 months
+ ($Salary x (1 + 0.05) x Number of working days in a year)

Now, let's calculate the number of working days in a year:

Number of Working Days = Total Workdays in a Year / Number of Weekends in a Year
= 365 days / 104 weeks
= 3.5 days/week

So, John's total income in one year is:

Total Income = $500 x 12 months
+ ($Salary x (1 + 0.05) x 3.5 days/week)

Let's assume that John works for 48 weeks in a year (which is equivalent to 1.5 years). Then, his total income in 1.5 years is:

Total Income = $500 x 18 months
+ ($Salary x (1 + 0.05) x 3.5 days/week) x 1.5 years

Now, we need to find out how much money John makes in one day. To do this, we divide his total income by the number of working days in a year:

Money Made Per Day = Total Income / Number of Working Days
= $500 x 12 months
+ ($Salary x (1 + 0.05) x 3.5 days/week) x 1.5 years
÷ 365 days/year

So, John makes approximately $790 per day."
"Response: 

1. Josie has 10 acres of land and produces 5 tons of angora wool per year.
2. Each ton of angora wool is worth Rs. 2000 per barrel (bale).
3. Therefore, Josie earns Rs. 10,000 (5 tons x Rs. 2000/ton) per year from selling angora wool.
4. If Josie wants to calculate how many barrels she can produce in one acre of land per year, we need to divide the total amount earned from selling angora wool by the number of acres of land she owns.

So, the number of barrels produced per acre of land per year = Total income / Number of acres of land owned
= Rs. 10,000 / 10 acres
= 1000 barrels per acre per year

Therefore, if Josie has 10 acres of land, she can produce 1000 barrels of sharaba per year."
"Response: 

1. The number of days in a week is 7. So, for 3 weeks, there will be 21 days (7 x 3).
2. For each day, there are 4 meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks). Therefore, for 21 days, there will be 84 meals (4 x 21).
3. Now, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches required for 84 meals. As per the question, one sandwich makes 50 bread pieces, so for 84 meals, we need 84/50 = 1.68 sandwiches (round off to 1.7 sandwiches).
4. Since we have already calculated that there are 1.7 sandwiches required, now let's find out how many slices of bread are needed for those sandwiches. Each sandwich has 50 bread pieces, so for 1.7 sandwiches, we need 50 x 1.7 = 85 slices of bread (round off to 90 slices).
5. Finally, since we have calculated the total number of sandwiches and slices of bread required, now we can calculate the total weight of bread needed. There are 90 slices of bread in total, and each slice weighs approximately 30 grams (based on average bread weight), so the total weight of bread needed is 90 x 30 = 2700 grams (approximately)."

Cost = $60 x 50 = $३ thousand (approximately)
3. Now, let's find out how much it would cost for 80 liters of gasoline at $70 per liter.
Cost = $70 x 80 = $५ six hundred (approximately)
4. Finally, let's add up all these costs to get the total cost of buying 80 liters of gasoline.
Total Cost = $२४०० + $३ thousand + $५ six hundred = $७ thousand two hundred (approximately)
Therefore, the answer is $७ thousand two hundred approximately."
"Response: 

Firstly, let's calculate the total cost of the jacket and pants that the boy wants to buy. The cost of each jacket is $30, and the cost of each pair of pants is $20. Therefore, the total cost of buying one jacket and one pair of pants will be:

Jacket Cost = $30
Pants Cost = $20
Total Cost = Jacket Cost + Pants Cost = $50

Now, let's find out how many jerseys the boy can buy with the remaining amount after paying for the jacket and pants. If he pays $10 for each jersey, then the number of jerseys he can buy will be:

Remaining Amount = Total Cost - Payment for Jerseys = $50 - ($10 x Number of Jerseys)
Number of Jerseys = Remaining Amount / $10

So, if the boy pays $10 for each jersey, he can buy:

Number of Jerseys = $50 / $10 = 5 jerseys

Therefore, the boy can buy 5 jerseys with the remaining amount after paying for the jacket and pants."
"Response: 

1. Jerry has 30 eggs and gives 20 to Lal. So, Jerry now has 10 eggs left.
2. Lal gets 5 more eggs from someone else, making it 25 eggs in total.
3. Rohan buys 42 eggs from Jerry at ₹4 per egg, spending ₹176 altogether.
4. Now, Rohan has 42 eggs with him.
5. Lal asks Rohan for some eggs, and Rohan gives him 8 eggs (as he already has 25 eggs).
6. After giving 8 eggs to Lal, Rohan is left with 34 eggs.
7. Now, let's calculate how many eggs Jerry has after selling 42 eggs to Rohan. Since Jerry sold each egg for ₹4, he earned ₹176 (the amount spent by Rohan). Dividing this amount by the cost of one egg (₹4), we get the number of eggs Jerry has after selling them to Rohan: ₹176 / ₹4 = 44 eggs.
8. Finally, since Jerry had 10 eggs left before selling any eggs, and he sold 42 eggs, he now has 34 - 10 = 24 eggs left."

James has 30 cards of Agni card type, each containing 8 grams of pure gold. He also has 20 cards of Ganga card type, each containing 16 grams of pure silver. Additionally, he has 40 cards of Jamuna card type, each containing 10 grams of pure copper. If James buys 8 tonnes of water tip cards worth Rs 14 lakh, what is the approximate percentage of gold in his total holding?

Let's calculate the total weight of all the cards that James owns:
Agni cards x 8 grams/card = 240 grams
Ganga cards x 16 grams/card = 320 grams
Jamuna cards x 10 grams/card = 400 grams
Total weight = 960 grams

Now, let's convert the total weight to tonnes:
960 grams / 1000 = 0.96 tonnes

Next, we need to find out the percentage of gold in James's total holding:
Approximate percentage of gold = (Weight of gold / Total weight) x 100

The farmer has 120 bags of wheat and produces 30% of them as flour. So, he gets 36 bags of flour (30% of 120).
Now, let's calculate how much wheat is left after grinding 3/4th of it into flour.
He grinds 3/4th of 36 bags = 27 bags (since 3/4th of 36 is 27).
So, now he has 93 bags of wheat left (120 - 27 = 93).
After 7 days, he sells 3/4th of the remaining wheat, which is 93 / 4 = 23 bags.
Therefore, he has 70 bags of wheat left after selling 3/4th of it (93 - 23 = 70)."

Mark bought a company that had assets worth $12 million and liabilities of $8 million. He paid $20 million for it. Each car he sold was worth $20,000, and he sold 5 cars in total. How much money did Mark make from selling those cars?
Let's calculate the profit first:
Profit = Sale price of each car x Number of cars sold
= $20,000 x 5 cars
= $100,000
Now let's subtract the cost of goods sold (the value of the cars he sold):
Profit = Original purchase price - Cost of goods sold
= $20,000,000 - ($20,000 x 5 cars)
= $20,000,000 - $100,000
= $19,900,000
So Mark made $19,900,000 from selling those 5 cars."

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of students who are absent from each classroom.
Absent students = Total number of absences / Total number of students
For Classroom 1: Absences = 30 x 30% = 9 students
For Classroom 2: Absences = 40 x 30% = 12 students
For Classroom 3: Absences = 50 x 30% = 15 students
Step 4: Add up all the absences to get the total number of absent students across all classrooms.
Total number of absent students = 9 + 12 + 15 = 46 students
Step 5: Divide the total number of absent students by the total number of students in the school to find the overall percentage of absenteeism.
Overall percentage of absenteeism = 46 / 1000 = 0.046 or 4.6%."

James has 6 tonnes of rice and John has 3 times as much rice as James, i.e., 3 x 6 = 18 tonnes. So, John has 18 tonnes of rice.
Now, we are asked how many tonnes of rice Jamshed has. Since Jamshed has 54 tonnes more than John, Jamshed has 54 + 18 = 72 tonnes of rice.
Therefore, the answer is 72 tonnes."
"Response: 
1. Dolly picks up a book and gives it to Pandora.
2. Pandora reads the book alone or with someone else (let's say another person named Daisy).
3. If Pandora finishes reading the book, she will give it back to Dolly.
4. Now, if Dolly wants to read the same book again, she can take it from Pandora.
5. Therefore, the number of times Dolly can read the book is 2 (once when she picked it up initially and once when she took it back from Pandora after Pandora finished reading it).
So, the answer is 2."

"Response: 

1. The person makes 15 minutes of phone calls per day.
2. In one month, they make 300 additional minutes (30 days x 15 minutes/day).
3. Therefore, in three months, they will have made a total of 900 minutes (3 months x 300 additional minutes).
4. To find out how many hours this is, we divide the total number of minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 900 minutes / 60 = 15 hours.

So, the person spends approximately 15 hours per month making phone calls."
"Response: 
Given that Grifin has 24 tonnes of freight and needs to transport it in three trips with a maximum load capacity of 5 tonnes per trip.
So, we need to find out how many trips Grifin can make.
We know that Grifin can carry 3 times its own weight, so if Grifin carries 24 tonnes of freight, then it will be able to carry 6 times 24 = 144 tonnes of freight in total.
Now, since each trip has a maximum load capacity of 5 tonnes, we can divide the total amount of freight that Grifin can carry by the number of trips it can make to get the average load per trip:
Average load per trip = Total amount of freight / Number of trips
= 144 tonnes / 3 trips
= 48 tonnes per trip
Therefore, Grifin can make 48 tonnes per trip."

In one equation, there are 4 gots and in another equation, there are 32 gots. So, if we want to find out how many gots are there in total, we need to add both these numbers.
So, the total number of gots is 4 + 32 = 36 gots."
"Response: 

1. The maker of the film earns $250 per hour.
2. The film takes 6 hours to complete (including breaks).
3. Therefore, the total amount earned by the maker in one day is: $250 x 6 = $1,500.
4. In one week, there are 7 days, so the total amount earned in a week is: $1,500 x 7 = $10,500.
5. In one month, there are 4 weeks, so the total amount earned in a month is: $10,500 x 4 = $42,000.
6. In one year, there are 12 months, so the total amount earned in a year is: $42,000 x 12 = $504,000.
7. Therefore, the maker of the film earns $504,000 in a year."
"Response: 
1. The party is for 12 people and they will have to pay $12 each. So, the total amount paid by them would be $144 ($12 x 12).
2. Out of this, $43 is spent on gifts for the parents. So, the remaining amount that the guests have to pay is $101 ($144 - $43).
3. Each guest has to pay $8.37 ($.101 / 12) as their share of the expenses."
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of one bag of pyaaj (50 pounds x $1.50 per pound = $75).

Now, we have to find out how many bags of pyaaj the shepherd can buy with his entire salary. So, we divide his salary ($200) by the cost of one bag of pyaaj ($75):

$200 / $75 = 2.73 bags of pyaaj

Therefore, the shepherd can buy approximately 2.73 bags of pyaaj with his entire salary."
