"Response: 
Janet sells 20 mangoes per day at $2 each. So she makes $40 per day from selling mangoes. 
She eats 3 meals per day and spends $5 for each meal, so she spends $15 per day on food. 
She has $40 - $15 = $25 left after buying food. 
So, she earns $25 per day."
Response:  We need two black threads and half of white thread to make one purl. So if we have 20 black threads and 10 white threads, how many purls can we make?  Therefore, the answer is 4 (20/5).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh paid $80,000 for the house and spent $50,000 on repairs, so he invested a total of $130,000 ($80,000 + $50,000). Then, after making the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%, which means it is now worth $270,000 ($130,000 x 150%). So, Josh's profit from selling the house would be $140,000 ($270,000 - $130,000).
Response:  If James runs three sprints per week and each sprint is 60 meters long, then he runs a total distance of 60 x 3 = 180 meters per week.
"Response: 
Wendi gives each of her 20 canaries 3 cups of food daily, which contains seeds, grains, and vegetables to keep them healthy. She provides three separate meals for the canaries throughout the day. In the morning, she gives each canary 15 cups of food. In the evening, she gives each canary another 25 cups of food. So in total, Wendi needs to give each canary 15 + 25 = 40 cups of food per day. Therefore, she will need to give each canary 40/20 = 2 cups of food at the last meal of the day."
Response:  If one glass costs $5 and every second glass costs $3 (60% of the previous price), then we can find out how much each glass costs by using the following formula: Glass cost = ($5 + (($5 x 60%) / 2)) So, if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will have to pay: Glass cost x Number of glasses = ($5 + (($5 x 60%) / 2)) x 16 = $80 + ($5 x 60%) / 2 = $80 + $9 = $89 Therefore, Kylar has to pay $89 for 16 glasses.
Response:  We know that in Toulouse there are twice as many sheep as in Charleston and four times as many in Charleston as in Seattle. So if we have x sheep in Toulouse, then in Charleston there will be 2x sheep and in Seattle there will be 4x sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in all three cities is given by the equation: x + (2x) + (4x) = 30. Solving for x, we get: x = 15. So there are 15 sheep in Toulouse, 30 sheep in Charleston, and 80 sheep in Seattle.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can normally transfer 200 GT of data in one minute, which is equal to 2 GB. Therefore, the time taken for her to transfer 1 GB of data is:

$$ \text{Time taken} = \frac{\text{Total amount of data}}{\text{Amount of data transferred per unit time}} $$

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$$ \text{Time taken} = \frac{200 \text{ GT}}{2 \text{ GB}/\text{minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} $$

Now, when Carla is transferring 40% of the total data (which is $40\% \times 200 \text{ GT} = 80 \text{ GT}$), Windows forces a reboot to install updates, which takes $20 \text{ minutes}$. After the reboot, Carla has to start the transfer process from the beginning, so the time taken to transfer the remaining $60\%$ of the data ($60\% \times 80 \text{ GT} = 48 \text{ GT}$) is:

$$ \text{Time taken} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount of data}}{\text{Amount of data transferred per unit time}} $$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$ \text{Time taken} = \frac{48 \text{ GT}}{2 \text{ GB}/\text{minute}} = 24 \text{ minutes} $$

Therefore, the total time taken to transfer all $200 \text{ GT}$ of data is:

$$ \text{Total time taken} = 10 + 24 = 34 \text{ minutes} $$"
Response:  We know that John started his journey at 3 pm and he wants to reach home in 4 hours. So, we can calculate the time when he will start back home as follows: Time = Distance / Speed = 4 hours = 240 minutes = (Distance x Speed) / 60 Where distance is the total distance traveled by John during his journey which is given as 100 km/h for 3 hours i.e., 300 km. Now, we need to find out how much time it takes for him to cover this distance at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Time = Distance / Speed = 300 km / 30 mi/hr = 10 hours Therefore, John starts back home at 5 pm (since there are 4 hours left after he reaches home). To find out how far he is from home, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mi / 30 mi/hr = 2.67 hours or 167 km away from home.
"Response:  If Elisa works for 45 hours this week and her hourly wage is $10, then she has worked for:

$10/hour x 45 hours = $450
So, in total, Elisa has earned $450 this week."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of downloaded programs in the first month was 60. Then, in the second month, there were three times as many downloads as in the first month, which means 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. However, during the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30%, so if we subtract 30% from 180, we get 126 downloads. Therefore, over the course of three months, approximately 60 + 126 = 186 programs have been downloaded.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toula bought 3 bags of donuts which cost $68 per bag, so she paid a total of $68 x 3 = $194 for the donuts. Next, we know that she also bought 2 bags of mini cupcakes, each bag costing $80, so she paid a total of $80 x 2 = $160 for the cupcakes. Finally, we know that she bought 6 bags of mini cheesecakes, each bag costing $55, so she paid a total of $55 x 6 = $330 for the cheesecakes. Therefore, in total, Toula paid $194 + $160 + $330 = $684 for all the treats she bought.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Carlos spends on planting and maintaining the tree each year:  Planting cost = $90 (initial investment) + $3 (annual maintenance) = $93 per year Secondly, we need to calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to break even or start making profit from his tree:  Number of years to break even = Total revenue - Total costs / Annual revenue = ($1.5 x 7 sitruunaa) - ($93/year) / $1.5 = 5 years Therefore, it will take Carlos 5 years to start making profit from his tree after he has spent $93 on planting and maintaining it.
Response:  If Melanie sold one-fourth of her green eggs to a yellow house and two-thirds of them to a red house, then she had 3/4 \* 1/4 = 1/2 of her green eggs left. Similarly, if she sold half of what was left in an orange house, then she had 1/2 \* 1/2 = 1/4 of her green eggs left. So, Melanie started with 5 pöylänimuri (since there are 5 houses).
Response:  We know that 20 students participated in the dance competition and we have to find out how many of them danced hip-hop. From the given information, we can see that: • 20% of the students danced modern dance (4 students). • 25% of the students danced jazz dance (5 students). So, if x is the number of students who danced hip-hop, we can write an equation based on the information provided: 20 - 4x = 25 - 5x + 4 (1) Now let’s solve for x using substitution method. Substitute the value of 4x = 8 into the first equation: 20 - 8 = 25 - 5(x+4) (2) Solving for x, we get: x = 6 Therefore, 6 students danced hip-hop.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected change in price of each product due to inflation. For corsets, the expected change in price is (2.5% x $5000) = $125; for electronics, it is ($1.2% x $8000) = $96. Now, let's compare these amounts and choose the option that offers higher profit potential. Since $125 < $96, Kauppias should opt for selling electronics, which has a higher profit potential. Therefore, the answer is: Kauppias should sell electronics."
"Response: 
Day 1: Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel westward for 80 miles each. Then they turn north and travel more than 240 kilometers in one day. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains in two days is:
Distance = Speed x Time + Distance = (Speed of first train) x (Time of first day) + (Speed of second train) x (Time of second day)
We are given that the speed of the first train is 60 miles per hour, and it takes 8 hours to cover 80 miles. Similarly, we can calculate the time taken by the second train to cover its 80 miles. So, the total distance covered by both trains in one day is:
Distance = 60 miles/hour x 8 hours = 480 miles
Now, let's find out how far they have traveled in two days:
Distance = 480 miles x 2 days = 960 miles
Therefore, the sum of the distances traveled by both trains in two days is 960 miles."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jill makes as an English teacher and then as a cheerleading coach separately. Then, we will add both amounts together to find out her total yearly salary.  As an English teacher, Jill works for 35 hours per week, which means she works for 1,900 hours (35 x 50) in a year. Her hourly wage is $20, so her annual income as an English teacher is $38,000 ($20 x 1,900).  Similarly, as a cheerleading coach, Jill works for 15 hours per week, which means she works for 950 hours (15 x 50) in a year. Her hourly wage is also $20, so her annual income as a cheerleading coach is $19,000 ($20 x 950).  Now, let's add both amounts together to find out Jill's total yearly salary: $38,000 + $19,000 = $57,000. Therefore, Jill's yearly salary is $57,000.
Response:  If Claire makes three eggs per day for breakfast, then she will make 3 x 7 = 21 eggs in one week (Monday to Sunday). Therefore, if she eats 4 weeks of breakfast, she will eat 21 x 4 = 84 eggs in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Marissa walked for 12 miles in total. Therefore, she walked at an average speed of $ \boxed{6 km/h} $ during the first four miles ($ \boxed{4/12} = \boxed{0.33 km/min} $). Then, she walked at an average speed of $ \boxed{4 km/h} $ during the next two miles ($ \boxed{2/12} = \boxed{0.17 km/min} $). To find out her overall average speed, we need to calculate the time taken for each mile and then divide it by the distance traveled. For the first four miles, the time taken is $\boxed{12 \div 4 = 3 min} $. For the next two miles, the time taken is $\boxed{6 \div 2 = 3 min} $. Now, let's add these times together to get the total time taken for the entire journey: $\boxed{3 + 3 = 6 min} $. Finally, we can use the formula: $ \text {speed} = \frac{\text {distance}}{\text {time}} $ to find her average speed: $\boxed{6 km/h = \frac{12}{6} = 2 km/min} $. So, Marissa needs to walk at a pace of approximately $\boxed{2 km/min} $ to cover the remaining distance of $\boxed{8 miles = 12.8 km} $.
Response:  We have 10 liters of apple juice (which is 2/3 water) and we want to add it to 15 liters of orange juice (which is 3/5 water). So, in total, we have 10 + 15 = 25 liters of liquid. However, when we mix them together, we lose 1 liter of apple juice, so now we have 24 liters of liquid left. Therefore, there are 24 - 1 = 23 liters of water left.
Response:  We know that Raymon is six years older than Samantha, so he was born when she was six years younger. Therefore, if Samantha is now 31 years old, then Raymon must have been born 37 years ago (31 +6 = 37). And since Raymon had his son 23 years ago, it means that his son was born 14 years after Raymon's birth (37 + 23 = 60).
Response:  We know that there are 8 customers in total and they buy DVDs as follows: 3 customers buy one each, 2 customers buy two each, and 3 customers do not buy any. So, the total number of DVDs sold is: 3 + 2 x 2 = 10 DVDs. Therefore, Billy sold 10 DVDs on Tuesday.
Response:  If Kynttilä sulaa 2 senttimetriä joka tunti, then it will sulave 4 senttimetriä during an hour (60 minutes). So, if it is paling from 13.00 to 17.00, it will sulave a total of 4 x 5 = 20 senttimetriä. Therefore, the shorter candle is 20 senttimetriä shorter than the original one.
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book last year and it was 25% off the original price. So we can write an equation as follows:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26."
Response:  We know that Marie paid $5 for 5 mangoes and $3 for 4 omelets, so she spent a total of $8. Then we know that she bought one canary bird for $12 and paid $1.50 for 4 eggs. Therefore, her total cost is $14. Finally, we are told that Marie paid $50 in total. So, if each pizza costs $8.50, then Marie must have ordered x = 6 pizzas.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mishka bought three pairs of shorts, which cost $16.50 each, so in total she paid for those $16.50 x 3 = $49.50. Similarly, she bought three shirts, which cost $22.50 each, so in total she paid for those $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. Finally, she bought three pairs of shoes, which cost $42 each, so in total she paid for those $42 x 3 = $126. Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233 dollars on clothes.
"Response:  If she eats one ice cream bar every night and buys a package of 15 bars for $4 each time, then after 60 days (or 2 months), she will have spent:

$$ Numberofdays \times Priceperpackage = 60 \times 4 = 240 $$

So, she has spent $240 on ice cream in 2 months."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Henry stopped twice during his cycling journey of 60 miles (97 km). We also know that he stopped for the first time after traveling 20 miles (32 km) and then again after traveling another 15 miles (24 km) before reaching the end of the journey. So, let's calculate the distance traveled between each stop: Distance = Speed x Time taken = 60/Henry's speed x Time taken For the first stop, time taken is 20 miles / 60 miles = 1/3 or 0.67 hours. Therefore, distance traveled between stops = Speed x Time taken = 60 x 0.67 = 40.2 miles (64.8 km). Similarly, for the second stop, time taken is 15 miles / 60 miles = 1/4 or 0.75 hours. Therefore, distance traveled between stops = Speed x Time taken = 60 x 0.75 = 45 miles (72.4 km). Now, total distance traveled by Henry = Total distance traveled between stops + Distance traveled from start to first stop = 40.2 + 45 = 85.2 miles (137.1 km).
Response:  If Gloria finds two shoes that cost $50 each and she wants to buy them with her budget of $100, then she will have $50 left over after buying the shoes.  Now, if she has to choose between spending $33 for one pair of sandals or $66 for another pair, she will choose the cheaper option, which is the second pair of sandals. Therefore, the price of the sandals is $66.
"Response: 
Darrell is currently 7 years old and Allen will be 10 years older than him in 10 years, so Allen is currently 17 years old (Allen's age = Darrell's age + 10).  Therefore, their combined age now is 189 (Darrell's age + Allen's age) and will be 196 in 10 years (Allen's age + 7)."
Response:  First person says there are 80 pulloa in each box. Second person says that is 20 more than half of the first person's answer, so if there are 80 pulloa in each box, then there are 40 pulloa in half of the boxes (or 40/2 = 20). Third person says that their answer is 25% more than the second person's answer, so if the second person said there were 40 pulloa in half of the boxes, then the third person's answer is 170 (25% more than 40) or 68 pulloa per box (since there are 3 boxes). Therefore, the average of the three answers is 68 + 40 + 170 = 388 pulloa per box.
Response:  If John is taking care of ten dogs and each dog spends half an hour per day for exercise and other activities, then in one week (7 days), each dog will spend 35 hours (half an hour x 7 days). So, John has to take care of the dogs for 35 hours/dog x 10 dogs = 350 hours/week.
Response:  We know that there are 110 coins in total and 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, the number of silver coins is 110 - 30 = 80. Since each silver coin has a value of 50 rahas, we can calculate the total value of silver coins as follows: Value of silver coins = Number of silver coins x Value per coin = 80 x 50 = 4000 rahas Now, since there are more gold coins than silver coins, we can conclude that Gretchen has at least 4000 rahas in gold coins. Therefore, the answer to the question is 4000 rahas.
Response:  We know that Aaron has more than half of Raymond's jewels, so if Raymond has 40 jewels, Aaron has at least 20 jewels (more than half of 40). Now we are told that Siobhan has two fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has 18 jewels (20 - 2 = 18).
Response:  In the first 20 minutes (or 40% of the total time), Pelaa scored 4 points. Therefore, in the remaining 20 minutes (or 60% of the total time), he scored 25% more points than in the previous period. So, we can calculate his total score as follows: Total score = 4 + (25% of 4) = 4 + 1 = 5 points.
Response:  Terry eats two yogurt per day and they are currently selling for $5 each. So in one day, he spends $10 on yogurt. In 30 days, he spends $300 (10 x 30).
"Response: 
John has 13 Lego series and he sells each one for $15. So, he will have $195 from selling all his Lego series ($15 x 13 = $195).  He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends $160 in total ($20 x 8 = $160). Now, he has $35 left ($195 - $160 = $35). Therefore, John still has 5 Legos left ($35 / $15 = 5)."
Response:  First day, he runs for 3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Second day, he runs half as much as first day = (180/2) = 90 minutes. Third day, he doesn't run at all. Total time running in three days = 180 + 90 + 0 = 270 minutes. Therefore, John runs 270 minutes per week or approximately 4.5 kilometers per hour.
Response:  If Dana can run 4 times faster than she can walk and she can jump half as far as she can run in one minute, then she can cover 3 miles in one minute while running. Therefore, if she spends 1/6 of her time running and 5/6 of her time walking or jogging, how many miles will she be able to travel in 6 minutes?  We know that Dana can walk at a speed of x miles per hour, so we need to find out what percentage of her total time is spent walking or jogging. Since she spends 1/6 of her time running and 5/6 of her time walking or jogging, we can write an equation:  Running = (1/6) \* Total Time Walking + Jogging = (5/6) \* Total Time  Now we have two equations:  Running = 1/6 \* Total Time  And Walking + Jogging = 5/6 \* Total Time  Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the following values:  Total Time = 6 minutes  Running Speed = 2 miles per minute  Walking + Jogging Speed = 3 miles per minute  Substituting the values into the first equation, we get:  Running Distance = (1/6) \* (6 minutes) \* 2 miles/minute = 4 miles  So, in 6 minutes, Dana can cover 4 miles while running and another 3 miles while walking or jogging, for a total distance traveled of 7 miles.
Response:  According to the question, Benin's iPhone is two years older than Suzy's iPhone. So, if Suzy's iPhone is one year old, then Benin's iPhone must be two years older = 2 + 1 = 3 years old. Now, according to the question, Brandon's iPhone is three times as old as Benin's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is (3 x 3) = 9 years old.
Response:  First, we know that when Polly doesn't hold any amulet (such as sapphire), she can throw the golden dart 400 jalans (132 meters) away from the dragon's flames. This is because the dragon's flames are only 300 meters wide. Therefore, if Polly throws the dart without an amulet, it will be outside of the dragon's flames.  Next, we know that when Polly holds a specific amulet (such as sapphire), she can throw the dart three times farther than before. However, we don't know what distance this additional throwing power allows her to achieve. So let's assume that with the sapphire amulet, Polly can throw the dart 1080 jalans (327 meters) away from the dragon's flames. This is just an estimate based on the information given in the question.  Finally, we know that the dragon's flames are only 300 meters wide, so even at its maximum range of 1080 jalans (327 meters), the dart would still be outside of the dragon's flames. Therefore, Polly could stand next to the dragon and throw the dart far enough away from the flames to hit it, regardless of whether or not she held an amulet.
"Response: 
Isoäiti Jones made five omelette dishes and cut each one into eight pieces. She placed them on five buffet tables so that guests could serve themselves. At the end of the evening, when the guests had taken and eaten some of the omelette pieces, there were 14 remaining pieces left. Therefore, the number of pieces of omelette that guests took was 14 - 8 = 6."
Response:  We know that in 300g of chocolate there are 5 portions of 60g each. So we have to calculate how many grams of chocolate can be consumed based on the daily calorie intake and the amount already consumed.  Daily calorie intake is 2000 calories, and so far, 1800 calories have been consumed (since 300g x 60g/portion = 1800cal). Therefore, the remaining amount of chocolate that can be consumed without exceeding the daily calorie limit is:  Remaining amount = Total daily calorie intake - Already consumed calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories / 60g portion = 33.3g per portion Since there are 5 portions, the total amount of chocolate that can be consumed is: Total amount = Number of portions x Amount per portion = 5 x 33.3g = 166.5g
Response:  If he sells each candle for $2, and he makes 10 candles from one pound of beeswax, then he will make $2 x 10 = $20 in revenue from selling those 10 candles.  However, he paid $10 per pound of beeswax, so his cost for making those 10 candles is $10 / 10 = $1 per candle. Therefore, his profit from selling those 10 candles is $20 - $1 = $19 per batch of 10 candles.  Now let's move on to the next part of the question, where we are asked to find out how much money he will make if he sells 20 candles. In this case, he will make $2 x 20 = $40 in revenue from selling those additional 10 candles. So, his total profit from both batches of candles would be $19 + $40 = $59.
Response:  On Monday, she wrote 5 articles and spent an average of 4 hours per article, so she spent 20 hours (5 x 4) writing on Monday.  On Tuesday, she wrote 3 articles and spent an average of 4 hours per article, so she spent 12 hours (3 x 4) writing on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, she wrote 2 articles and spent an average of 6 hours per article, so she spent 12 hours (2 x 6) writing on Wednesday.  Therefore, in total, she spent 44 hours (20 + 12 + 12) writing during those three days.
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-it notes before she went to work at the cafe and then bought another pack of 20 Post-it notes. So, in total, she had 80 + 20 = 100 Post-it notes. Since each pack contains 5 sheets (as mentioned in the problem), we can calculate the number of sheets in the pack as follows: Number of sheets in the pack = Total number of Post-it notes / Number of sheets per pack = 100 / 5 = 20 sheets. Therefore, Candice bought 20 sheets of Post-it notes.
Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red balls as blue ones. So if he bought x red balls, he also bought 2x blue balls. Since each red ball costs $1 more than each blue ball, we can write:  Red balls: $x + (2x) = 200 Blue balls: $x = 80  Now we have to find out how much John paid for all the balls together. The total cost of the red balls is: $x + (2x) = 200 $30 per ball Total cost of the blue balls: $x = 80 $4 per ball Therefore, John paid a total of: $30 + $4 = $34 for all the balls together.
"Response:  If Tracy used a meter-long piece of wire to support tomato plants in her garden and cut it into pieces that were 15 centimeters long (or 0.15 meters), then she would have gotten:

$ \text{Number of pieces} = \frac{\text{Length of wire}}{\text{Length of each piece}} $
= $\frac{1\text{ meter}}{0.15\text{ meters}}$
= $7$

So, Tracy received $7$ pieces of wire, each $0.15$ meters long."
Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in total and 3/4 of the building is currently being used, which means we have to subtract 1/4 from the total number of floors. So, the number of empty apartments = Total number of floors x (1 - 3/4) = 15 x (1 - 0.75) = 15 x 0.25 = 3.75. Therefore, there are 3 empty apartments in the building.
Response:  If Lloyd produces 252 eggs per day and sells them in batches of 10, then he will sell $252 worth of eggs per day ($2 x 10 = $20). So, Lloyd earns $252 per day from his egg sales.
Response:  The distance traveled in one hour is given as $10$ miles per hour. Since he travels for an hour from $13:00$ to $14:00$, his distance traveled during this time is $\text {distance} = \frac{\text{speed}}{time} = \frac{10}{1}$ mile = $10$ miles. Now, after this hour, he reduces his speed to $6$ mph and starts moving backward. To find out how long it takes him to cover the same distance again, we can use the formula $ \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} $. So, the time taken to cover the same distance again will be $\text{time} = \frac{10}{6} = 5$ hours. Therefore, the total time taken by Tomin to return to his starting point is $5 + 1 = 6$ hours.
Response:  If Uurian's diary is too heavy and he needs to reduce it by 15 kg, then the weight of his diary before reduction is 15 kg / 2 = 7.5 kg. Since each comic strip weighs half a kilogram and each toy weighs half a kilogram, Uurian has 7.5 kg - (0.5 kg x 30) = 7.5 kg - 15 kg = 7.5 kg - 7.5 kg = 0 kg left after removing 30 comics strips. Therefore, Uurian does not need any toys to replace the removed comics strips.
Response:  On Thursday (Torstai), the mechanic repairs 6 kuorma-auto rims and 4 car rims, so he earns $6 x 6 = $36 for kuorma-auto rims and $4 x 4 = $16 for car rims, totaling $52.  On Friday (Perjanta), the mechanic repairs 12 cars but doesn't repair any rekka, so he earns $40 x 12 = $480 for car rims. Therefore, the total amount of money the mechanic earned that day is $52 + $480 = $532.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:

* Seven cats (including Patchy and Trixy) have been adopted from the local animal shelter.
* Patchy has had three times as many adoptive kittens as Trixy.
* Trixy has had 12 adoptive kittens.

So, if we calculate the total number of cats in Doubtfire's family, we get:

Total number of cats = Number of original cats + Number of adoptive kittens
= 7 + (3 x 3) + 12
= 7 + 9 + 12
= 38

Therefore, Doubtfire's family has 38 cats in total."
Response:  Jean has 30 pieces of bread (leivonnaiset). She eats two slices (kaksi lippua). Now she wants to pack the remaining bread into two bags (säkkiin). Since each bag can hold 15 pieces of bread (säkki), we can fill 2 x 15 = 30 bags with the remaining bread. Therefore, Jean can fill 30 bags with bread.
Response:  If Peter can go to the movies $7$ times per week and he has $42$ dollars per week, then we need to find out how many weeks he can go to the movies with that amount of money. We know that each trip to the movies costs him $7$ for the ticket and $7$ for the popcorn, so in total he spends $14$ dollars per trip. Therefore, if he wants to spend all his money, he needs to divide it by $14$, which gives us $\boxed{308}$ trips to the movies. Since he has $42$ dollars per week, he can go to the movies $\boxed{308/42=7.5}$ times per week.
"Response:  We know that the maximum weight of cargo that can be carried over the bridge is 5000 kg. If we divide this value by the weight of the empty truck (which is 1760 kg), we get the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:

Maximum number of boxes = 5000 / 1760 = 2.83
So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck and transported across the bridge without exceeding the weight limit is 2.83 x 50 = 141 boxes."
Response:  Firstly, Stephen paid $40 for the food. Then, as this was through a commission-based sale, they added 25% to his final amount and charged him an additional $3 in delivery fees, making it $43 in total. Finally, Stephen also spent $4 on drinks, so the total cost of his purchase was $47. Therefore, the lopullinen hinta (final price) was $47.
Response:  We know that there are 20 hedelmää in each pilvi and 67 individual hedelmää scattered throughout the perunankuusen (pear tree). So, we can calculate the total number of hedelmää as follows: Total number of hedelmää = Number of hedelmää in each pilvi x Number of pilvet = 20 x 5 = 100 hedelmää Therefore, there are 100 hedelmää in total.
Response:  We have 25 apples in total. From these, one is bad (huono), 20% are not ripe (kypsytön), two are rotten (hapanta), and the remaining 70% are good (hyvät). So, we can calculate the number of good apples as follows: Good apples = Total apples x Percentage of good apples = 25 x 70% = 17.5 apples Therefore, there are approximately 17.5 good apples out of 25.
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for materials to make the necklace. Then, she paid an additional $800 to the craftsman who made it. Therefore, the total amount she paid is $1300 ($500 + $800). Finally, as a percentage of that amount, she paid $130 (10% of $1300) as insurance. So, in total, she paid $1430 ($1300 + $130).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jos Marcy has been working for the same company for 40 years and will receive $50,000 per year as his pension after he retires.  Secondly, we are told that he will get 5% of his annual pension amount every year for 20 years after he retires. Finally, we are asked what his annual pension would be if he retired 30 years after he started working there. So, let's calculate it! After 40 years of work, Jos Marcy's annual pension is $50,000. If he continues to work for another 20 years before retiring, he will receive an additional $10,000 ($50,000 x 5%) each year for 20 years, making his total annual pension $60,000 ($50,000 + $10,000). Therefore, if he retires 30 years after starting work, his annual pension would be $60,000 / (1 + 0.05) ^ 30 = $37,895.
Response:  First half of the year (January - June): $140 x 6 = $840  Second half of the year (July - December): $840 x 6 = $5,040 Total amount paid for the year: $5,120
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sophia has traveled 160 kilometers since her last fill-up and she wants to know how far she can go with one full tank of gasoline.  Secondly, we are told that her car's fuel tank holds 40 liters of gasoline. Therefore, if we divide the distance traveled (160 km) by the capacity of the fuel tank (40 L), we get the maximum distance Sophia can travel with one full tank of gasoline:  Distance = Capacity / Speed = 160 km / 40 L / 100 km/h = 4 hours. So, Sophia can drive for approximately 4 hours with one full tank of gasoline.
"Response: 
Jim watches TV for two hours and then decides to go to bed and read half of it. He does this three times a week. How many hours does he spend watching TV and reading in four weeks? 

1. First week: Watching TV for 2 hours/day x 3 days = 6 hours
Reading for half of 1 hour/day x 7 days = 3.5 hours
Total time spent = 6 + 3.5 = 9.5 hours/week
2. Second week: Watching TV for 2 hours/day x 3 days = 6 hours
Reading for half of 1 hour/day x 7 days = 3.5 hours
Total time spent = 6 + 3.5 = 9.5 hours/week
3. Third week: Watching TV for 2 hours/day x 3 days = 6 hours
Reading for half of 1 hour/day x 7 days = 3.5 hours
Total time spent = 6 + 3.5 = 9.5 hours/week
4. Fourth week: Watching TV for 2 hours/day x 3 days = 6 hours
Reading for half of 1 hour/day x 7 days = 3.5 hours
Total time spent = 6 + 3.5 = 9.5 hours/week
Add all the total time spent in each week: 9.5 + 9.5 + 9.5 + 9.5 = 38 hours/week
Therefore, Jim spends 38 hours per week watching TV and reading."
Response:  We know that there are four schools participating in the tournament and each school has both boys' and girls' teams. Therefore, we have a total of 8 teams (4 x 2 = 8). Since each team has 5 players, including the coaches, we have a total of 40 people (8 teams x 5 players per team + 1 coach per team) who were sent from the schools to the tournament.
"Response:  We know that there are 175 timanthes in the chest and 35 fewer rubies than timanthes. So, if we have x rubies, then we have 175 + (x - 35) timanthes. Since there are twice as many smaragdes as rubies, we can say that for every ruby, there are two smaragdes. Therefore, the number of smaragdes is half of the total number of jewels minus the number of rubies. So, the number of jewels is:

$$ \boxed{175 + (x - 35)} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 175 + (x - 35) \right) $$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$ 175 + (x - 35) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 175 $$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$ x = 175 + 35 = 200 $$

Therefore, there are 200 jewels in the chest, including 175 timanthes, 25 rubies, and 50 smaragdes."
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in the classroom. So if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys. Since each teacher has 60 girls and 5 boys, we can set up the equation: 60x + 5y = 130 (where y is the number of boys). Solving for y, we get: y = 70. Therefore, there are 70 teachers in the classroom.
Response:  Bailey starts with some money and gets $5 per week for 8 weeks. So he has $40 ($5 x 8) after 8 weeks. Then he gets another $100 after 8 more weeks, so his total amount is now $140 ($40 + $100). Therefore, Bailey had $140 at the start.
"Response: 
Judy teaches for five dance classes per day and eight singing classes per week. If each dance class has 15 students and she charges $15 per student, then she earns $75 from dance classes per week (5 classes x 15 students x $15/student). Similarly, if there are 8 singing classes per week and each class has 15 students, then she earns $120 from singing classes per week ($15/student x 8 classes x 15 students). Therefore, Judy earns a total of $195 per week ($75 + $120) from teaching both dance and singing classes."
Response:  In the first recipe, there are 20 instructions, and in the second recipe, there are twice as many instructions as in the first one. Therefore, Kelianilla has to read 40 instructions (2 x 20 = 40) in total.
Response:  If Tommy sells each brownie for $3 and each bag of juustokakku for $4, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from the brownies and $4 x 23 = $92 from the juustokakku. Therefore, Tommy will have earned a total of $132 + $92 = $224.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Sheila paid for each phone. Since she bought six phones and spent $150 per phone, her total cost would be:

$150 x 6 = $900

Next, we need to find out how much interest Sheila will pay for each phone over three years. As the question states, Sheila pays 2% interest on each phone. So, her annual interest payment can be calculated as follows:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $900 x 2% x 3 years
= $72

Now, let's add up the total amount Sheila has to pay for all six phones over three years:

Total Cost = Initial Price + Annual Interest Payments
= $900 + ($72 x 3)
= $900 + $216
= $1,116

Therefore, Sheila will have to pay approximately $1,116 for all six phones over three years."
Response:  If we assume that each flower is sold for $X dollars per unit (ruukku), then we can calculate how much money Artie makes from selling each type of flower as follows:  Kallisarvi: X = $2.74  Petunia: X = $1.87 Begonia: X = $2.12 Now, let's find out how many units of each flower Artie has sold: Kallisarvi: 12 ruukkua x $2.74/ruukku = $32.08 Petunia: 9 ruukkua x $1.87/ruukku = $16.53 Begonia: 17 ruukkua x $2.12/ruukku = $35.34 Total amount of money Artie makes from selling flowers = $32.08 + $16.53 + $35.34 = $83.95 So, if Artie sells 12 ruukkua of kalsiarvi, 9 ruukkua of petunia and 17 ruukkua of begonia, he will make a total of $83.95 in profit.
Response:  We know that each level of sand has half of the area below it, so if we have $n$ levels of sand, then the total area of all the levels is $\frac{1}{2}^n$. Now, let's consider a square with side length $1$, which has an area of $1$. If we place this square at the bottom of the first level of sand, then the area of the top surface of the first level will be $\frac{1}{2}$ times the area of the square, or $\frac{1}{2} \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, if we place another square at the bottom of the second level of sand, then the area of the top surface of the second level will be $\frac{1}{2}$ times the area of the second square, or $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$. This pattern continues for all $n$ levels of sand, so the area of the top surface of the $n$th level will be $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Therefore, the average area of the top surface of all $n$ levels of sand is $\frac{1}{2^n}$, and since there are $16$ squares in the example, the average area of one square is $\frac{1}{2^n} \times 16 = 8$.
Response:  First year (first 180 days):  Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food every day, so she will use 1 x 180 = 180 cups of dog food in total during this period.  After that first year, she will need to feed her puppy 2 cups of dog food per day, so she will use 2 x 365 = 730 cups of dog food in total for the rest of its life. Therefore, Cecilia uses a total of 180 + 730 = 910 cups of dog food.
"Response: 
Jos Raymond weighs as much as Sarah, and Sarah weighs 4 times as much as David. If Raymond does 300 kg of laundry, how many kilograms of laundry will David do?  Therefore, if Sarah does 400 kg of laundry, David will do 1200 kg (4 x 300) of laundry."
Response:  If he buys 3 bunches of flowers for $2.50 each, he will spend a total of $7.50.  If he buys 2 bunches of flowers for $1 each, he will spend a total of $2.  So in total, he will save $5.50 ($7.50 - $2) by buying more bunches of flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John paid $100 for adoption of the dog. Then, the hairdresser offers him an discount of 30%. So, if he is new customer, he will get 30% off from the original price. Therefore, the amount John pays after applying the discount is: $100 x (1 - 0.3) = $70.

"Response: 
Charlie had $10 to start with and bought $21 worth of goods from the shopping center. So, he has $21 - $10 = $11 left.  Then, he gave $9 to his sister and used $28 for decorating cards. So, he has $11 - $9 = $2 left now. Therefore, there are $2 tarra left in Charliella's possession."
Response:  We know that Alex weighs less than 40 kg (Grace). So, if Alex weighs x kilograms, then Grace must weigh more than x + 2 kilograms. Therefore, their common weight is equal to x + 2 kilograms.
Response:  We have three flowerpots with 25 roses in each pot. Each rose has 8 thorns. So, we need to find out how many thorns are there altogether. To do this, we can use multiplication. The total number of thorns is equal to the number of flowers (3 x 25) multiplied by the number of thorns per flower (8). Therefore, the answer is 3 x 25 = 75 + 75 = 150 thorns.
Response:  We know that the team played 22 games and won more than they lost. So, we can say that W = number of wins > L = number of losses.  Now, we need to find out how many games the team won. Since they won more than they lost, we can write: W > L. Therefore, the number of games the team won is greater than the number of games they lost, which means they won x games where x > 8 (since they won 8 more games than they lost). Thus, the answer is x = 10.
"Response:

2. Each year, they have worn one new shirt from their collection.
3. They have a total of 23 shirts in their collection (one for each year they have been on vacation).
Therefore, the number of shirts the person owns is 23."
Response:  On the first day, it sobbed four times. On the second day, it sobbed three times as long as the first day. So, it sobbed a total of 7 times (4 + 3). Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  Sylvie has been working for five years as of December (month not specified). So her annual salary in year 5 is $600 x 5 = $3000. In year 6, her salary will increase by 10% to $3300 ($3000 + $300). Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary in year 7 is $3300.
Response:  If Marilyn's first album sold 10 times more than Harald's, then the number of copies sold by Marilyn is 10 x 88000 = 880000. So, Harald sold 88000 - 880000 = 792000 copies.
Response:  Since 4/5 of the guests are not coming, and Christina invited 16 friends, we can calculate that 12 (16 x 4/5) guests will actually come to the party. So, she needs $90 ($2 x 12) for the gifts.
Response:  We know that an adult dinosaur eats 10 kg of salad and a child eats half of it. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, we need 20 x 10 = 200 kg of salad in total. Since the child eats half of what the adult does, the child needs 5 x 10 = 50 kg of salad. Therefore, Ted needs 200 - 50 = 150 kg of salad for the whole group.
"Response:  We know that:
Janilla has more pets than Marcia.
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
Cindy has four pets.
So, if Janilla has three times as many pets as Cindy, and Cindy has four pets, then how many pets does Janilla have?
Let J be the number of pets Janilla has. Since J = 3C (according to the question), we can write:
J = 3(4) = 12
Therefore, Janilla has 12 pets."
"Response:  We know that Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. So, we can write an equation based on their ages as follows:  Age of Amy = Age of Jackson + 5  Age of Amy = Age of Corey - 2  Now, let's substitute the age of James (which is 10) into one of these equations to find out how old Jackson is:  Age of Jackson = Age of Amy - 5  Substituting ""Age of Amy = 30"" into this equation gives us:  Age of Jackson = 30 - 5 = 25  Therefore, Jackson is 25 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, which means he has an average speed of $ \boxed{5.26 m/s} $.  Secondly, we are given that Gerald's speed increased by 10% after changing his diet. So, Gerald's new average speed is $ \boxed{5.79 m/s} $, which is calculated as follows: $$ \boxed{5.79 m/s = 5.26 m/s + (0.10 \times 5.26 m/s)} $$ Now, let's find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters in 38 seconds if he has improved his speed by 10%. We can do this by dividing Lee's time by his speed: $$ \boxed{\frac{38 s}{5.79 m/s} = 6.75 s} $$ Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters in 6.75 seconds if he has improved his speed by 10% due to changes in his diet.
Response:  We know that there are fewer cats than dogs in the neighborhood. So, if there are x dogs, then there are x - 12 cats. Since each dog has two cats as pets, and there are 60 dogs, the total number of cats is 60 \* 2 = 120. Therefore, the number of lemurs is 120 - 12 = 108.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in the class, two-thirds are girls and one-third are boys. So, the number of boys is 133 (2/3 x 200). Now, we need to find out how many girls are not party members. Since there are 133 boys, and 77 girls who are not party members, the number of girls who are party members is 56 (77 - 133). Therefore, the answer is 56.
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for nine hours and his friend James slept for two-thirds of Harry's sleep time. So, if we convert Harry's sleep time to minutes (9 x 60 = 540), then we can calculate how many more minutes Harry slept than James:

Harry slept for 540 minutes - James slept for (2/3) x 540 minutes = 378 minutes
So, Harry slept 162 more minutes than James."
Response:  We know that each of Freda's 80-gram containers contains three tomatoes, so in total, she has 80 x 3 = 240 tomatoes. Since one container lost half its volume, it means that after losing volume, there are 240 / 2 = 120 tomatoes left. Therefore, Freda used 120 - 30 = 90 tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 30 cars on the motorway. Then, during the first 15 minutes of congestion, some cars passed through (let's say x). After that, 20 more cars passed through in the remaining 15 minutes (since there were no cars waiting to enter the road during this time). Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through during the entire 30 minutes is:

x + 20 = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10

So, during the first 15 minutes of congestion, 10 cars passed through."
Response:  We know that Maria has 18 new plants from her favorite greenhouse and she already had two plants in her house with 40 windows. So, the total number of plants Maria has = 18 + 2 = 20. Therefore, Maria has 20 plants in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, the total number of presses made by all four friends is: 20 + (1/4) x (20 - 10) + 10 + 60 = 150. Therefore, the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
Response:  Luke read 4 pages of science on Monday, which means he has 3 days left to read 8 pages (since there are 4 days left). So, on average, he needs to read 2 pages per day.
"Response: 
John drinks water every morning, lunchtime and dinner time. So he drinks 3 glasses of water per day (morning, lunch, and dinner).
On weekends, John wants to relax and has one more glass of water before going to bed. So he drinks 4 glasses of water on weekends (morning, lunch, dinner, and before bed).
Therefore, John drinks a total of 7 glasses of water per week (3 x Monday-Friday + 4 x Weekend)."
Response:  If it takes 10 minutes for the fog to cover the entire city every third mile (i.e., 42 miles), then at each mile mark, it will take 10/3 = 3.33 minutes for the fog to cover that distance. Therefore, it will take 3.33 x 60 = 199.9 minutes for the fog to completely cover the city.
Response:  Poppy has placed 4/8 of her pieces on the board, then her mother places 3/4 of the remaining pieces on the board. So, in total there are 4 + 3 = 7 pieces left on the board.
Response:  If Cody eats three times more candy than Amir, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 candies and Amir eats 5 candies. So together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 candies.
Response:  First, we need to find out the volume of each box. The length, width and height of each box are given as 15 cm, 16 cm and 16 cm respectively. So, the volume of each box is: Volume = Length x Width x Height = 15 x 16 x 16 = 3944 cubic centimeters (or 3.944 liters). Now, we have three boxes, so the total volume of all three boxes is: Total volume = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box = 3944 + 3944 + 3944 = 11820 cubic centimeters (or 11.82 liters). Since the walls are 2.5 cm thick, we subtract their volume from the total volume to get the net volume of the boxes: Net volume = Total volume - Wall volume = 11820 - (2.5 x 3) = 11795 cubic centimeters (or 11.79 liters). Therefore, the combined volume of the three boxes is approximately 11795 cubic centimeters or 11.79 liters.
Response:  On Monday, he watched one hour-long show and three 30-minute shows. Therefore, he watched a total of 4 hours (1 + 3) of television that day.  On Tuesday, he watched two 30-minute shows. Therefore, he watched a total of 2 hours (2 x 30 minutes) of television that day.  On Wednesday, he was busy late in the week, so he watched two hour-long shows. Therefore, he watched a total of 4 hours (2 x 60 minutes) of television that day.  On Thursday, he watched one hour-long show and three 30-minute shows. Therefore, he watched a total of 4 hours (1 + 3) of television that day.  On Friday, he watched one hour-long show and no 30-minute shows. Therefore, he watched a total of 1 hour (1 x 60 minutes) of television that day.  Based on these calculations, we can determine how many 30-minute shows Frankie watched on each day:  Monday: 0  Tuesday: 2  Wednesday: 0  Thursday: 3  Friday: 0  So, Frankie watched a total of 5 30-minute shows throughout the week.
Response:  Last year, Henry wanted to double his participation in the local baking competition and made 2 × 15 = 30 keks. He then realized he had accidentally made 15 more keks than intended (15 + 5 = 20). So, last year, Henry made 30 + 20 = 50 keks.
Response:  If the gas station sells $3 per gallon and the app offers $20 for each gallon purchased, then we can calculate how much money they will have after purchasing 10 gallons of gas as follows:  Firstly, let's convert $3 to gallons: $3 / $0.75 (conversion rate) = 4 gallons  Next, let's calculate the total amount paid for 10 gallons of gas at $3 per gallon: 10 x $3 = $30 Then, let's subtract the amount offered by the app ($20 x 10 = $200) from the total amount paid: $30 - $200 = -$170 So, after purchasing 10 gallons of gas, they will have -$170 left over.
"Response: 
Beatrice had 24 rolls of licorice and Marcell had 14 rolls of licorice. If they both eat all of them equally, then each person will have eaten half of the total number of rolls (since there are twice as many people). So if the total number of rolls is x, then each person will have eaten x/2. Since Beatrice has more than Marcell, she will have eaten more than him. Therefore, the average amount that each person will have eaten is:
x/2 = 14 + 24 = 38
So, on average, each person will have eaten 38 rolls of licorice."
Response:  We know that in 16 seconds, Julien traveled 20 meters (since he covered 10 meters every 5 seconds). So, distance = speed x time = 20 m / 5 s x 16 s = 800 m. Now we need to find out how much water was in the boat initially. Since there were 2 liters of water for every 10 meters of travel, and Julien traveled 800 meters, then the initial volume of water in the boat is: Volume of water = Distance x Initial volume per meter = 800 m x 2 L/10 m = 1600 L. Therefore, when Julien reached the shore, the volume of water left in the boat was 1600 - 200 = 1400 L.
Response:  The number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day can be calculated as follows:  Number of hours the teachers have to use the whiteboard = 24 (since they have 2 periods per day) x Number of days in the week = 7 (Monday to Sunday) Total time the whiteboard is used per day = Number of hours the teachers have to use it x Number of days in the week = 168 ( since there are 24 hours in a day ) Now, let's assume that the whiteboard is cleaned thrice an hour. Therefore, the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day = Total time the whiteboard is used per day / Time taken to clean the whiteboard = 168 / 3 = 56 Times per day So, the whiteboard is cleaned 56 times per day.
Response:  On day 1, Ryan has 2 flowers in his garden.  On day 2, he adds another flower, so now he has 3 flowers (2 + 1 = 3).  On day 3, again he adds one more flower, so now he has 4 flowers (3 + 1 = 4).  Now let's assume that from day 4 to day 15, no new flowers have grown. So, Ryan still has 4 flowers in his garden. Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan has a total of 4 flowers in his garden.
Response:  We know that in Britain's phone there are 50 times more pictures than in Jamal's phone. So if there are x pictures in Jamal's phone, there are 50x pictures in Britain's phone.  Now we know that in Jamal's phone there are six times more pictures than in Britain's phone. So if there are x pictures in Jamal's phone, there are 6x pictures in Britain's phone.  Therefore, the number of pictures in Jamal's phone is 1/6 of the number of pictures in Britain's phone.  Solving for x, we get:  x = 1800 / 6 = 300  So there are 300 pictures of animals in Jamal's zoo display.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has bought 10 pieces of wood with dimensions 2x4x10 and each piece costs him $10. So he has spent a total of $100 for these pieces. Secondly, we know that he has also bought 5 pieces of wood with dimensions 4x4x10 and each piece cost him $16. So he has spent an additional $80 for these pieces. Finally, we are asked to find out how much profit Sasha will make if he sells all these pieces of wood. To do this, we need to subtract the total amount he spent from the total amount he sold them for. In this case, if he sells all the pieces he has (including both sets), he will sell them for a total of $370 ($100 + $80 + $170). Therefore, his profit will be $370 - $260 = $110.
Response:  If Katy uses 7:13 of tea leaves and water to make one cup of tea, then she will use 7/13 of her total amount of tea leaves for each cup of tea. Therefore, if she makes x cups of tea, she will use 7x/13 of her total amount of tea leaves. Since there are 120 teaspoons of sugar in total, we can find out how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used per cup of tea as follows:  Number of teaspoons of sugar = Total number of teaspoons of sugar / Number of cups of tea  In this case, the number of cups of tea is equal to the number of teelusikallista sokria (tea bags) that Katy has. So, we can substitute the value given in the question:  Number of teaspoons of sugar = 120 / x  Now, we need to solve for x, which represents the number of cups of tea that Katy made. We know that x is equal to 7/13 of the total number of tea bags, so we can substitute this value into our equation:  Number of teaspoons of sugar = 120 / (7/13)  Simplifying the fraction, we get:  Number of teaspoons of sugar = 120 / 5  There are 5 teaspoons of sugar in each tea bag, so the final answer is:  Katy used 24 teaspoons of sugar to make all those cups of tea!
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three children and each child gets two pairs of shoes. Therefore, the total number of shoes is 3 x 2 = 6 pairs.  Next, we know that each pair costs $60, so the total cost of all six pairs is $60 x 6 = $360.  So, John spent $360 on shoes for his three children.
Response:  On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so in total there were 10 vehicles (2 x 5 = 10).  On the second day, additional 3 containers arrived, and since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 (3 x 5 = 15 + 15). Therefore, the total number of vehicles that passed through the port during those two days is 45 (10 + 15 = 45).
Response:  We know that Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lyla's four years ago and now it has grown by 40%. So, Adrian's current salary is $80,000 (30% more than Lyla's). Four years later, Adrian's salary will be $120,000 ($80,000 x 1.4) and Lyla's salary will be $60,000 ($40,000 x 1.4). Therefore, Adrian earned $60,000 more than Lyla four years later.
Response:  If Miguel uses two papers per week for his sketches and there are 30 papers in one volume of paper, then he will use 2 x 4 = 8 papers per month. So, he uses 8 x 4 = 32 papers per quarter (since there are 4 quarters in a year). Therefore, he uses 32 / 4 = 8 papers per quarter.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 omelets and 8 apples, so together they have 13 (5 + 8) hedelmä.  Kael brought twice as many omelets and half as many apples as Morisette, so he brought 2 x 13 = 26 omelets and 4 x 8 = 32 apples, in total 58 hedelmä.  So, the sum of hedelmä that Morisette and Kael brought is 13 + 58 = 71 hedelmä.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. Then she slept for 2 hours less each of the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday). So, Tuesday = 7 hours, Wednesday = 5 hours. Now we come to Thursday. If she slept more than 2 hours per day that week, then she would have slept for 9 hours on Thursday. Therefore, her total sleep time for the week was 8 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 30 hours.
Response:  Rosie can run for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, which means she covers a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles in that time. Then, she runs at a constant speed of 8 km/h for 7 hours, covering a distance of 7 x 8 = 56 km during this time. Therefore, Rosie can cover a total distance of 30 + 56 = 86 kilometers in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie started working at her mother's office, she had 60 envelopes with stamps that needed to be used and some already stamped ones in the pile. If there are now 30 already stamped letters in the pile, then after Jennie started working, the number of envelopes with stamps that she used was 60 - 30 = 30. So, there were 30 envelopes with stamps left after Jennie started working.
Response:  Julia had 3 lusikkaa left after she used them to make the frittata. Her husband later bought her 5 more lusikkaa, so now Julia has a total of 8 lusikkaa (3 + 5). Later, when Julia was setting the table, she had a total of 12 lusikkaa (8 from the original pack and 4 that her husband gave her). Therefore, the number of lusikkaa in Julia's originally purchased packet is 8.
Response:  We know that Dylan bought more than chicken makkaraa and less than fish makkaraa. So, we can say that the number of chicken makkaraa he bought is greater than or equal to 38 (the total number of makkaraa he bought). Also, since he bought fewer fish makkaraa than chicken makkaraa, we can say that the number of fish makkaraa he bought is less than 38. Therefore, the number of makkaraa Dylan bought is between 38 and 40 (since there are only two options for the number of fish makkaraa he bought). So, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that Amy has 30 more friends than Lily. So, if Lily has x friends, then Amy has x + 30 = 50 friends. Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is x + (x + 30) = 70.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item in dollars:
Vesimelonit: $3 x 4 = $12
Paprikaat: $2 x 20 = $40
Appelsiinit: $3 x 10 = $30
Total cost of items = $12 + $40 + $30 = $82
Now, let's find out how much Dillon paid for all these items:
Dollar amount spent by Dillon = Total cost of items / Number of items bought
= $82 / 4 (vesimeloni) + 20 (paprika) + 10 (appelsiini)
= $82 / 70
= $1.17 per item
Therefore, Dillon's total cost for buying all these items is $1.17 per item."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of patients seen in one day at the hospital. According to the question, there are 500 patients per day. Therefore, the total number of patients seen in one day is: 500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day Now, let's calculate the revenue generated from these patient visits. Based on the information provided, each doctor earns $150 for every hour they work at the hospital, and there are 16 doctors working at the hospital (8 AM - 8 PM). So, the total amount earned by doctors in one day is: 16 doctors x $150/hour x 8 hours = $12,800 per day Similarly, the hospital generates $200 from each patient visit. Since there are 12,000 minutes in a day, the total amount earned by the hospital from patient visits is: 12,000 minutes/day x $200/minute = $240,000 per day Now, let's calculate the profit made by the hospital after deducting the cost of doctors' salaries. The total cost of doctors' salaries for one day is: $12,800 + $12,800 = $25,600 per day Subtracting this amount from the total amount earned by the hospital gives us the profit made by the hospital: $240,000 - $25,600 = $214,400 per day Therefore, based on the given information, the hospital makes a daily profit of $214,400 from treating 500 patients per day.
Response:  Firstly, 60 workers are hired to play with dolls in the store.  Then, one-third of them (20 workers) stop working when their clothes get dirty from the children's vomit. So, there are 40 workers left. Next, another 10 workers stop working when the children start hitting them with sticks. Therefore, there are 30 workers left. Finally, none of the remaining workers want to continue playing with dolls after this incident, so no worker is left. Hence, there are no toys left.
Response:  In May, Joe spent $500.  In June, he spent $60 less than in May, so he spent $440 in June. Therefore, the difference between his spending in May and June is $60 ($500 - $440).
Response:  Pam and Fred went to the carnival together.  Pam rode the roller coaster twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets.  Fred rode it four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets.  In total, they used 12 + 24 = 36 tickets.
Response:  On Monday (maanantai), Walt walked 6 km.  On Tuesday (tiistai), he walked 6 x 5 = 30 km.  On Wednesday (keskiviiri), he walked 6 + 6 = 12 km. Therefore, in total, Walt walked 30 + 12 = 42 km.
Response:  If Tom goes to four laundromats per month and each one costs $15, then he spends $60 per month ($15 x 4). To find out how much he spends in a year, we can multiply this amount by 12: $60 x 12 = $720. Therefore, Tom spends $720 per year.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and he lost 5 before the comparison with Bobby. So, Brian had 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Now, we are asked how many video games Bobby has. Since Bobby has 5 more than Brian, Bobby has 15 + 5 = 20 video games.
"Response:  We know that there are 27 single-horned cows in the world and that one-third of them are located in Scotland. Therefore, we can calculate the number of single-horned cows in Scotland as follows:

Number of single-horned cows in Scotland = Number of single-horned cows in the world x Fraction of single-horned cows located in Scotland
= 27 x (1/3)
= 9

So, there are 9 single-horned cows in Scotland."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money each item costs in total. For example, if two items cost $7.50 each, then they would cost a total of $15 (2 x $7.50). Similarly, if two items cost $1.50 each, then they would cost a total of $3 (2 x $1.50). And if two items cost $1 each, then they would cost a total of $2 (2 x $1). So, the total cost of all three items is: $15 + $3 + $2 = $20. Now, let's find out how much the delivery fee is as a percentage of the total cost. If the delivery fee is 20%, then it would be: $20 x 20% = $4. Therefore, the total amount that Rory needs to pay for the items and delivery fee is: $20 + $4 = $24.
Response:  If Mark took 5 questions per minute in the first test and had 8 hours for that test, then he answered 400 questions (8 x 5 = 40).  Since there were 75 questions in the test, Mark left 35 questions unanswered (75 - 40 = 35).  Similarly, if he took 6 hours for the second test and answered 100 questions, then he left 20 questions unanswered (100 - 80 = 20). Therefore, the answer is 35 + 20 = 55 questions left unanswered.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 red balls in total and four times more than blue ones. So, if there are x blue balls, then there are 4x red balls. Now we can write an equation based on this information:

Red balls = 4x
Blue balls = x

Now we have two equations:

Red balls + Blue balls = Total number of balls (which is given as 108)
4x + x = 108

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

5x = 108

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

x = 21

So, there are 21 blue balls. Therefore, there must be 83 red balls (since 4 x 21 = 83)."
Response:  We know that out of 20 cars, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is 4 + 12 = 16. Therefore, there are 16 semi-automatic cars among the total of 20 cars.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees as drones (i.e., 1400 bees). Since queen bees are also twice as common as drone bees, we can estimate that there are 2800 queen bees. Therefore, the number of worker bees is 1400 - 280 = 1120.
Response:  If Jordan spends two hours playing video games per day and earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, he makes a total of $20 per day from both activities combined (2 hours gaming x $10/hour = $20). To calculate how much Jordan would make in a week, we can multiply this daily amount by seven ($20/day x 7 days/week = $140/week).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John bought $2 worth of meat, $3 worth of bread, and $3 worth of lamp oil. Therefore, he spent a total of:

$2 + $3 + $3 = $8

Next, we are told that all items except foodstuffs have a 10% tax rate. So, the amount of money John paid in taxes can be calculated as follows:

Tax = ($8 x 10%) = $0.80

Now, let's add the tax amount to the total cost of the goods to find out how much John actually paid for everything:

Total Cost = $8 + $0.80 = $8.80

Therefore, John paid a total of $8.80 for all the items he bought."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kim has three customers and she is talking to five potential customers. So, the total number of customers she deals with is 8 (3 + 5).  Secondly, we are given that each customer needs two bottles of cleaning solution and one box of cloths for cleaning. Therefore, the total number of items needed for all eight customers is 16 (2 x 8 = 16).  Thirdly, we are told that each bottle of cleaning solution costs $2 and each box of cloths costs $5. So, the total cost of items needed for all eight customers is $40 (16 x $2 = $40).  Fourthly, we are given that Kim earns $92 per week from her business. Lastly, we need to find out the profit made by Kim per week. Profit is equal to revenue minus expenses. Revenue in this case is $40 (total cost of items) and expenses are $40 (cost of items). Therefore, the profit made by Kim per week is $10 ($40 - $40). So, the answer is $10.
"Response: 
John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare contains 100 ananasias. Therefore, John has a total of 1000 ananasias (10 x 100 = 1000). Since John can correct his ananasias every three months, he will have corrected them 4 times in one year (3 months x 4 = 12 months). So, John can correct 400 ananasias per year (1000 - 600 = 400)."
Response:  If Johnny has thrown 500 Lego bricks onto his room floor and another set with three times as many pieces as 500 (i.e., 1500), and another set with four-thirds of the total number of pieces (i.e., 3000), then we need to find out how many sets of Lego bricks Johnny has in total.  We can do this by using the information provided in the question:  Total number of Lego bricks = 500 + 1500 + 3000 = 4500 Now, let's divide the total number of Lego bricks by the number of sets that Johnny has: Number of sets = Total number of Lego bricks / Number of Lego bricks per set Number of sets = 4500 / 500 = 9 So, Johnny has 9 sets of Lego bricks in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 30 mealworms left the nest in the first 6 hours (Debra saw them leaving). Then, half of those mealworms returned to the nest during the next 6 hours (Debra saw 15 mealworms returning). Therefore, the total number of mealworms that Debra saw returning to the nest was 15 + 30 = 45 mealworms.
Response:  We know that Brittany and her mother go to the museum, and we are given two pieces of information about their visit:  Firstly, the admission fee for adults is $12, while it is $10 for children. Secondly, Brittany's mother gives $8 in change after buying one adult and one child ticket. Now, let's use this information to find out how much money Brittany's mother gave to the cashier:  Adult ticket price = $12 Child ticket price = $10 Total amount paid by Brittany's mother = Adult ticket price + Child ticket price = $12 + $10 = $22 So, Brittany's mother gave $22 to the cashier.
Response:  We know that Charliella has 3 times more friends than Dorothy on Facebook. So, if Charliella has x friends, then Dorothy has 3x friends. Since James has 4 times more friends than Dorothy, he has 4(3x) = 12 friends. Therefore, James has 12 friends on Facebook.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve has to travel 3 miles (or 4.8 kilometers) to get home from school. Since he can drive his bike at an average speed of 440 feet per minute, it will take him 15 minutes to reach home. Now, let's consider Tim's distance - 3 kilometers. If Tim can ride his scooter at an average speed of 264 feet per minute, it will also take him 15 minutes to reach home. So, both Steve and Tim will arrive at their homes simultaneously. Therefore, there is no winner in this race.
Response:  On the first day, five people came to the bike rental service and filled both tires with air. Since each tire costs $0.25, they paid a total of $1.25. Then, three people came to inflate their tires again, so they paid an additional $0.75. Finally, one person came alone and had to pay for only one tire, which cost $0.25. Therefore, the total amount earned that day was $2.25.
Response:  We know that Carl buys 10 packages of cookies and each package contains 6 cookies. So, in total, he buys 10 x 6 = 60 cookies. Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl spends a total of 60 x $0.10 = $6. If he pays with a $10 bill, he will get $10 - $6 = $4 in change. Therefore, Carl gets $4 in change.
"Response:  We know that:

* Dave had 14 French beans before the hungry shipboard took his bag from him.
* The locker (or bird) ate half of Dave's beans.
* Three crows (or ravens) forced Dave off the food and each crow ate three French beans.
* A mole took two thirds of the remaining French beans.
* Ants carried off the last French bean.

So, let's count how many French beans were left after each event:

1. Before the shipboard took the bag, there were 14 French beans.
2. After the locker ate half, there were 7 French beans left (half of 14).
3. After the crows forced Dave off the food, there were 4 French beans left (7 - 3 = 4).
4. After the mole took two thirds, there were 2 French beans left (4 - 2/3 = 2).
5. After the ants carried off the last one, there were 0 French beans left.

Therefore, when Dave bought the bag of French beans, there were 0 French beans in it. So, the answer to the question is 0."
"Response: 
Kimo has three hours of classes per day from Monday to Wednesday and Friday. Therefore, he has 3 x 5 = 15 hours of classes per week. 
Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, Kimo spends 15 x 16 = 240 hours in class during one semester."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bill has to roll out 300 leivas, which means he will need 300 x 15 = 4500 meters of dough for all the leivas. Similarly, he needs 120 x 15 = 1800 meters of dough for the crossants and 60 x 60 = 3600 meters of dough for the baguettes. So in total, Bill needs 4500 + 1800 + 3600 = 9900 meters of dough. Now let's calculate how long these pieces are when laid end to end. For the leivas, each piece is 15 meters long, so they would be 9900 / 15 = 660 meters long if laid end to end. For the croissants, each piece is also 15 meters long, so they would be 9900 / 15 = 660 meters long if laid end to end. Finally, for the baguettes, each piece is 60 meters long, so they would be 9900 / 60 = 165 meters long if laid end to end. Therefore, if Bill lays all the bread products end to end, they would stretch for a total distance of 660 + 660 + 165 = 1485 meters or approximately 1.48 kilometers.
Response:  The total number of bananas required for all three types of monkeys is given as follows: Gorillas require 400 bananas per month, Pygmy chimps require 100 bananas per month, and Common chimpanzees require 200 bananas per month. Therefore, in two months, the total number of bananas required would be: Gorillas - 800 bananas, Pygmy chimps - 200 bananas, and Common chimpanzees - 400 bananas. So, the total number of bananas needed for two months is 1,400 bananas. To determine how many bananas the caretaker should order each time, we need to divide the total number of bananas required by the number of times they are needed in a year (twice). Therefore, the caretaker should order 1,400 / 2 = 700 bananas each time.
"Response: 
Blake runs 15 times around the field, which means he covers a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters. 
Kelly runs once around the field and then decides to run 40 meters away from Blake and back, which means she covers a distance of 40 + (-40) = 0 meters.  Therefore, Kelly does not cover any distance.
So, the winner is Blake, who covered a distance of 1500 meters, while the loser (Kelly) did not cover any distance."
"Response:  We know that Raphael bought four pens for $1.5 each, two notebooks for $4 each, and a pencil case for $20. So, in total, he spent:

$1.5 x 4 = $6 on pens
$4 x 2 = $8 on notebooks
$20 = Total cost of pencil case

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $6 + $8 + $20 = $34."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Finn sees 11 heads while swimming in the lake. Then, he suddenly sees 6 of those heads peeking out from behind the reeds. Next, he sees 2 more heads peeking out from behind a rock. Therefore, the total number of heads Finn sees in the lake is 11 + 6 = 17 heads.
Response:  On Monday (5 meters), Tuesday (7 meters) and Wednesday (4/3 = 6 meters). So, the water level in the tank on Wednesday is 6 meters.
Response:  We know that Anakin got 10 meritähteä and 3 klovninkalaa.  Since Locsin had fewer than Anakin, Locsin got at most 7 meritähteä (since Locsin got 5 less than Anakin). Therefore, Locsin got 7 + 3 = 10 klovninkaloja.
Response:  If the price of the marble increases by 20% every 6 months, then after 1 year (or 6 months), the new price will be $24 (20 x 1.2). After another 6 months, the price will increase again by 20%, so the new price will be $28.80 ($24 x 1.2 x 1.2 = $28.80). Therefore, after 36 months, the price of the marble will be $57.60 ($28.80 x 1.2^3 = $57.60).
Response:  We know that there are 5 red cars and 3 action figures in the room. The stuffed animal cost $3 each, so there are $3 x 3 = $9 worth of stuffed animals in the room. Similarly, we know that the red car costs $4 each, so there are $4 x 5 = $20 worth of red cars in the room. Therefore, the total value of all the toys in the room is $9 + $20 = $29.
"Response:  If Jackie pays her taxes herself, she can do three fewer hours of freelance work and lose $35 per hour. The bookkeeper charges $90 per hour. How much money does Jackie have if she hires a bookkeeper?

Step 1: Calculate how many hours Jackie can save by paying her taxes herself.
Hours saved = Hours worked - Hours lost ($35/hour)
= 3 hours (since she loses 3 hours of work time)

Step 2: Calculate the cost of hiring a bookkeeper.
Cost = Number of hours worked x Bookkeeper's rate ($90/hour)
= 3 hours x $90/hour
= $270

So, if Jackie hires a bookkeeper, she will have $270 left over after paying for their services."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira spent €1090 on the computer and €157 on the scanner, so she has spent in total €1247. Next, we know that her family gave her a budget of €1500 for the whole gift, which means she has €253 left to spend on clothes. Therefore, she will have €253 left over for clothes after buying the computer and accessories.
Response:  If Sandra needs 9 eggs to make one Spanish omelette and she makes 15 Spanish omelettes in total for the school fundraiser, then she will need 9 x 15 = 135 eggs in total. Since each egg is used 8 times (since Sandra uses 8 eggs per Spanish omelette), we can calculate that Sandra will use 135 / 8 = 16.625 eggs per Spanish omelette. So, Sandra will have to go to the store 16 times to buy eggs if she wants to make all 15 Spanish omelettes.
Response:  If Seth is currently 16 years old and Brooke is two years older than him (i.e., 18), then in two years, their ages will be:  Seth - 16 = 14 Brooke - 18 = 20 So, after two years, Seth will be 14 + 2 = 16 years old, and Brooke will be 20 + 2 = 22 years old. Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.
Response:  If Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, and Ethel has $8, then we can write an equation as follows:  Jimmy's money = Ethel's money + $2. So, Jimmy's money is equal to $8 + $2, which equals $10. Therefore, Jimmy has $10.
"Response:  If Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day except for weekends when he walks 10 miles (which is equal to 16 kilometers), then we can calculate his total distance walked in a week as follows:

Weekly distance = Daily distance x Number of days in a week
= 30 km/day x 7 days/week
= 210 km/week

So, Pancho walks approximately 210 kilometers per week."
Response:  The cost of each item is given as follows:  hat - $25, jacket - $75 (3 times the cost of the hat), and pants - $100 (equal to the combined cost of the hat and jacket). Therefore, the total cost of each outfit is:  Hat - $25 Jacket - $75 Pants - $100 Total Cost = $200 So, each outfit costs $200.
"Response:  We know that Jake sees 80 eight-legged insects (hämähäkit), 90 six-legged insects (hyönteet) and three rare, mutated creatures with ten legs each. So, in total, Jake sees:

80 x 8 = 640 legs from the eight-legged insects
90 x 6 = 540 legs from the six-legged insects
3 x 10 = 30 legs from the mutated creatures

Adding all these numbers together gives us a total of:

640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs."
Response:  We know that:  *Sally Two is three years older than Punainen (the grandmother). *Red is twice as old as Sally Four. *Sally Four is eight years old. From this information, we can conclude that:  *Sally Three is two years younger than Sally Four. *Sally Three is six years old. *Sally One is one year younger than Sally Three. Therefore, the total age of all four linnets is: 4 x (6 + 1) = 24 years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays for each loan per month. For example, her student loans have a minimum payment of $300 per month, her credit card has a minimum payment of $200 per month, and her rent is $500 per month. Next, we will multiply these amounts by 12 to get the total amount she pays per year: $300 x 12 = $3600, $200 x 12 = $2400, and $500 x 12 = $6000. Then, if Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum amount, let's say she wants to pay half of the balance, which would be $3600 + $2400 + $6000 = $11000. Therefore, Jessica pays $11000 per year.
Response:  Billy takes approximately 30 minutes to peel and chop the potatoes (peeling takes about half of that time). So he has enough time to prepare all 60 potatoes for his barbecue party. Therefore, the total time it takes him to prepare the potatoes is:  Time = Total work / Efficiency x Time available = 60/2 x 30 = 45 minutes.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that they sell 1 gal of juice for $6 and 1/2 gal of juice for $4. So, their total revenue from selling juice is:

$6 x 50 = $300
$4 x 50 = $200
Total revenue = $500

Now, let's find out how much they spent on sugar. We know that they sold 1 gal of juice for $6 and 1/2 gal of juice for $4, so their total cost of producing 1 gal of juice is:

Cost of 1 gal of juice = ($6 + $4) / 2 = $8

So, their total cost of producing 50 gal of juice is:

Cost of 50 gal of juice = $8 x 50 = $400

Now, let's find out how much they spent on fruit. They sold 1 gal of juice for $6 and 1/2 gal of juice for $4, so their total cost of producing 1 gal of juice is:

Cost of 1 gal of juice = ($6 + $4) / 2 = $8

So, their total cost of producing 50 gal of juice is:

Cost of 50 gal of juice = $8 x 50 = $400

Finally, we can calculate the profit they made by subtracting their total cost from their total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $400 = $100

Therefore, they made a profit of $100."
Response:  We know that there are 240 Asian athletes in total, of which 80 are Japanese and the rest Chinese. If there are 60 boys in the Chinese team, then we can conclude that there are 160 girls in the Chinese team (since the number of boys is equal to the number of girls). Therefore, the answer is 160.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends $4/8 = $1/2 of his income on rent and $3/4 = $0.75 on car expenses. So he has $6000 - ($1/2 + $0.75) = $5925 left after paying for these two things. Next, we know that he gives $200 to his daughter every week and $700 to his wife every month for household expenses. This means he gives a total of $200 x 4 weeks = $800 per month and $700 x 12 months = $8400 per year to his family. Therefore, he has $5925 - $800 - $8400 = -$255 left for himself after giving money to his family. As such, the correct answer is -$255.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kymmenen (10) is more than four (4), so Rani has at least 14 claws.  Next, we know that Monica has fewer claws than Rani, but we don't know exactly how many. So let's assume Monica has x claws.  Finally, we know that Bola has 40 claws, and we want to find out what the sum of his last three claws are. Therefore, the answer is:  Sum = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9
Response:  First week (5 hours): $10 x 5 = $50 Second week (8 hours): $10 x 8 = $80 Total amount earned in two weeks: $50 + $80 = $130
"Response:  Firstly, let X be the number of votes received by the first candidate and Y be the number of votes received by the second candidate. Since there are two candidates in total, we can write:
X + Y = Total number of votes (80)
Now, let's consider how many votes each candidate gets based on their respective percentages:
For the first candidate, if they got 3/4 of the total votes, we can calculate their share as follows:
X = Total number of votes × (3/4) = 80 × (3/4) = 60
For the second candidate, if they got 1/4 of the total votes, we can calculate their share as follows:
Y = Total number of votes × (1/4) = 80 × (1/4) = 20
So, the number of votes received by the first candidate is 60 and the number of votes received by the second candidate is 20."
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white lilies and 5 times more light blue callas than white lilies. So, if she ordered x red roses, then she ordered 4x white lilies and 5x light blue callas. Since she threatened to switch suppliers if the missing roses are not delivered within 5 hours, we can set up an equation as follows:

Number of red roses = 4x
Number of white lilies = 4x
Number of light blue callas = 5x

Now, let's solve for x:

Red roses = 4x
White lilies = 4x
Light blue callas = 5x

Substituting the values given in the question:

Red roses = 4(9) = 36
White lilies = 4(10) = 40
Light blue callas = 5(200) = 1000

Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 36 red roses, 40 white lilies, and 1000 light blue callas within 5 hours to meet Sandra's demands."
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than Jan. So, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then Mark was 35 years old two years ago. Now, we are told that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean is currently 37 years old.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that one team has all its members running exactly 55 seconds for 400 meters, while the other team has an uneven distribution of times among its members. Specifically, the first member runs 60 seconds, followed by each subsequent member who is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. We can represent this situation as follows:
Team A: Time = 55 seconds (all members run same time)
Team B: Time = 60 + (3 x member number) seconds (uneven distribution of times)
Now, let's calculate the average time for both teams:
For Team A: Average time = Total distance / Number of members = 400 meters / 4 members = 100 seconds
For Team B: Average time = Total distance / Number of members = 400 meters / 4 members = 100 + (3 x 3) = 120 seconds
Since Team B has a slower average time than Team A, it will lose in a race against Team A. Therefore, the answer is:
A. Team A wins with a margin of 20 seconds (120 seconds - 100 seconds)."
"Response:  If Jerry throws six-sided dice, then there are six possible outcomes: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, or $6$.  We want to know the probability that Jerry will throw more than two pairs of consecutive numbers.  To calculate this probability, we need to count how many times Jerry can throw more than two pairs of consecutive numbers and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.  The number of times Jerry can throw more than two pairs of consecutive numbers is:

$$\text{Number of ways to throw more than two pairs of consecutive numbers} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{4}{6} + \frac{5}{6} + \frac{6}{6}$$

The denominator in each fraction is always $6$, since there are only six possible outcomes when throwing a six-sided die.  The numerators represent the different ways Jerry can throw more than two pairs of consecutive numbers:

* $\frac{1}{6}$: Jerry throws $1$ and then anything else. There is one way to do this.
* $\frac{2}{6}$: Jerry throws $2$ and then anything else. There are two ways to do this ($2,4$, or $2,5$).
* $\frac{3}{6}$: Jerry throws $3$ and then anything else. There are three ways to do this ($3,4$, $3,5$, or $3,6$).
* $\frac{4}{6}$: Jerry throws $4$ and then anything else. There are four ways to do this ($4,5$, $4,6$, or $5,6$).
* $\frac{5}{6}$: Jerry throws $5$ and then anything else. There are five ways to do this ($5,4$, $5,6$, $4,5$, or $6,5$).
* $\frac{6}{6}$: Jerry throws $6$ and then anything else. There is only one way to do this ($6$).

So, the probability that Jerry will throw more than two pairs of consecutive numbers is:

$$\text{Probability} = \sum_{i=1}^{6}\frac{i}{6}"
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked half of the olives from their olive farm, then they must have picked an equal number of olives. So if Jenna's mother picked 20 olives, then Jenna also picked 20 olives. Therefore, both Jenna and her mother picked a total of 40 olives.
"Response:  We know that there are three groups of rodents: 10 hamsters and 6 rats in one group, 30 rats in another group, and 40 mice in the third group.  Each rat has 5 olives, each mouse has 4 olives, and each hamster has 6 olives. Therefore, we have:

Rodent Group 1 (Hamsters): 10 x 6 = 60 olives
Rodent Group 2 (Rats): 30 x 5 = 150 olives
Rodent Group 3 (Mice): 40 x 4 = 160 olives
Total number of olives: 60 + 150 + 160 = 370 olives
Now, let's divide the total number of olives among the three groups:
Group 1 (Hamsters): 60 / 10 = 6 olives per hamster
Group 2 (Rats): 150 / 30 = 5 olves per rat
Group 3 (Mice): 160 / 40 = 4 olives per mouse
Therefore, there are 6 olives per hamster, 5 olives per rat, and 4 olives per mouse."
Response:  Firstly, we know that $100 is the initial amount of money that Mandy has to pay to Benedict. Then, we are given that there will be a monthly interest rate of 2%, which means that after one month, Mandy will owe Benedict $100 x (1 + 0.02) = $100 x 1.02 = $102. After two months, Mandy will owe Benedict $102 x (1 + 0.02) = $102 x 1.04 = $106.40, and so on. Therefore, if Mandy can pay Benedict after three months, she will have to give him $106.40 x (1 + 0.02) = $106.40 x 1.04 = $109.87. So, Benedict will receive $109.87 from Mandy after three months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kauppias paid $20 for each bag of wheat from the farmer. Therefore, he made a profit of $20 per bag.  Next, we are told that the transportation cost for each bag is $2, so Kauppias made an additional profit of $2 per bag due to the sale of each bag.  Finally, we are given that Kauppias sold all 10 bags and earned a total profit of $400. So, if he sold each bag for $30, then he must have sold 10/($30 - $2) = 5 bags.
Response:  Firstly, we know that they paid $20.25 for three tickets to the fair. Then, we are told that they spent less than $4.50 on food compared to the cost of the tickets. Finally, we learn that they took two different horseback rides, which cost $33 in total. If they decided to split these costs evenly among themselves, how much did each person pay? To find out, let's use the following formula: Total Cost = (Number of People x Individual Cost) + (Total Food Cost / Number of People). In this case, the number of people is four (since there were four friends), and the individual cost per person is $20.25 + ($4.50 / 4) = $28.75. So, each friend paid $28.75 towards the overall cost.
"Response:  If John collects persimmons for three hours and he collects two persimmons per minute, then...

1 hour = 60 minutes
3 hours = 3 x 60 minutes = 180 minutes

So, in one hour, John collects 2 x 60 = 120 persimmons.

Therefore, John collects a total of 180 + 120 = 300 persimmons in 3 hours."
"Response:  If there are 10 ants in the colony and they need to consume approximately 1.5 kg of insects per week to survive, we can calculate their daily requirement as follows:

Daily requirement = Weekly requirement / Number of days in a week
= 1.5 kg / 7 days (assuming a week has 7 days)
= 0.214 kg/day (or about 214 grams per day)

So, each ant in the colony needs to consume around 0.214 kg (or 214 grams) of insects per day to survive."
"Response: 
Tom has 10 trees and he cuts down 2 trees per year. So after 10 years, he will have 10 - (2 x 10) = 8 trees left.  Now, 30% of the remaining trees die every year. After 10 years, 30% of 8 = 2.4 trees will die. Therefore, Tom will have 8 - 2.4 = 5.6 trees left."
Response:  On Friday evening (perjantai-aamu), the neighbors placed 18 bright red plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning (lauantaiaamu), they took back one-third of the flamingos and painted them white. They then returned these white flamingos to Sue's front yard.  On Sunday morning (sunnuntaiaamu), they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to their collection. At midday on Sunday (sunnuntain keskipäivällä), how many more bright red plastic flamingos were outside than white ones?  Based on the information provided, there are 18 + 18 = 36 total flamingos outside. Since only 18 were bright red, that means there are 36 - 18 = 18 white flamingos outside.
"Response:  We know that Violetta needs five different colored pens and she is willing to pay $20 for them. Each pen costs $2, so we can calculate how many pens she will get as follows:

$20 / $2 = 10 pens

Therefore, Violetta will get 10 pens in total."
"Response:  We know that one kynä costs $1.20 and one pyyhkivä costs $0.30. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of 8 kynää as follows:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60

So, 8 kynää would cost $9.60 in total."
"Response:  We have to divide 200 kilos of pork among 40 restaurants in a certain city. Since each restaurant gets half a kilo of pork, we need to calculate how many kilograms of pork are left after dividing them equally among all the restaurants. So, the number of kilograms of pork that is not used or wasted is:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ kilograms\ of\ pork\ not\ used = 200 - (40 \times 0.5) $$

Substituting $40$ for the number of restaurants and $0.5$ for the amount of pork each restaurant receives, we get:

$$ \therefore Number\ of\ kilograms\ of\ pork\ not\ used = 200 - (40 \times 0.5) = 100 kg $$

Therefore, $100$ kilograms of pork are not used or wasted."
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 people in the city of Sodankylä. Of those, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. That means that the total number of adults (men + women) is 8417 + 9092 = 17509. Since we were told that ""the rest"" of the population consists of children, we can deduce that the number of children in Sodankylä is equal to 17509 - 8417 - 9092 = 9900. Therefore, there are approximately 9900 children living in Sodankylä."
Response:  First month (Elaineilla oli aluksi 20 Pokémon-korttia), she gained 3 more cards, so now she has 23 cards (20 + 3). Second month (Toisessa kuussa hän keräsi 20 korttia vähemmän kuin ensimmäisen kuukauden aikana), she lost 7 cards, so now she has 16 cards (23 - 7). Third month (Kolmannella kuukaudella hän keräsi kaksi kertaa enemmän pokemonia kuin ensimmäisen ja toisen kuukauden aikana), she gained 4 cards, so now she has 20 cards (16 + 4). Therefore, Elaineilla is currently holding 20 Pokémon cards in total.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark edits 1000 text every week for two different publishers, and he is paid differently for each publication. The amount he earns from Publisher A is $0.05 per word, while Publisher B pays him twice as much, or $0.10 per word. To find out how much Mark earns in total per week, we can multiply the number of words he edits for each publisher by their respective payment rates:

For Publisher A: 1000 words x $0.05 per word = $50 per week
For Publisher B: 1000 words x $0.10 per word = $100 per week
So, Mark earns a total of $150 per week ($50 + $100)."
"Response: 
1) In the morning, he gets 5 water bottles with 5 liters of water each = 25 liters (2 x 5).
2) In the evening, he gets 6 water bottles with 5 liters of water each = 30 liters (2 x 6).
Total amount of water he receives per day = 25 + 30 = 55 liters."
Response:  Firstly, we know that John won the prize in his work and received $5000 as the reward with a 5% salary increase. Secondly, we are told that he earned $2000 per week every week of the year, which means he earned a total of $104,000 ($2000 x 52 weeks) during the year. Thirdly, since the prize was given to him on the first day of the year, he got the full amount of $5000 plus an additional $5000 (5% of $104,000), making it a total of $10,500. Therefore, John earned $10,500 in that particular year.
Response:  If we have 10 hectares of vineyard and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then we have a total of 50 tons (10 x 5) of grapes per year from the entire vineyard. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate that Josie produces a total of 100 barrels (50 tons x 2 barrels/ton) of wine per year from her entire vineyard.
Response:  We know that Carlin consumed bread and cheese every day for three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). For breakfast, he used two pieces of bread with one piece of cheese each. Therefore, he used a total of six bread pieces with cheese for breakfast.  For lunch, he used four pieces of bread with two pieces of cheese each, so he used a total of eight bread pieces with cheese for lunch. Similarly, for dinner, he used four pieces of bread with two pieces of cheese each, resulting in a total of eight bread pieces with cheese for dinner as well.  Now let's calculate how many juice boxes he used. He drank juice boxes for three days a week, and he used one box more than he did per volume of bread. So if he used x juice boxes for bread, then he used x + 1 juice boxes overall.  Finally, we are asked to determine how many juice boxes Carlin used. Based on our calculations above, we can see that he used a total of 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 bread pieces with cheese, which means he used 24 / 3 = 8 juice boxes overall.  Therefore, the answer is 8 juice boxes.
"Response: 
Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens initially. Then she bought 6 blue pens and 2 red pens. In each blue pen, there are 9 pens, and in each red pen, there are 6 pens. So, the total number of pens that Janet has now is:

Green pens = 22 x 9 = 198
Yellow pens = 10
Blue pens = 6 x 9 = 54
Red pens = 2 x 6 = 12
Total pens = 198 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 374
Therefore, Janet has 374 pens in total."
Response:  If Brinley scores 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in the first five tests, then she has an average score of (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 84. To get an average score of 93 in the sixth test, Brinley needs to score at least 93 - 84 = 8 points higher than her current average. Therefore, the minimum score she can achieve in the sixth test is 93.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Michael rode his bike for five times per week and covered 25 kilometers each time. Therefore, he traveled a total distance of 125 kilometers in one week (5 x 25 = 125).  Then, after four weeks, he decided to reduce the number of bike rides to twice a week but increased the distance he covered to 60 kilometers each time. So, in four weeks, he traveled a total distance of 480 kilometers (2 x 60 = 120 per week x 4 weeks = 480). Finally, after three weeks of this new routine, he returned to riding his bike five times a week again, covering 25 kilometers each time. Thus, in three weeks, he traveled a total distance of 750 kilometers (5 x 25 = 125 per week x 3 weeks = 750).  Therefore, in total, Michael traveled 125 + 480 + 750 = 1355 kilometers during the given period.
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and each bar weighs twice as much as an average apple. So, if one apple weighs x grams, then each chocolate bar weighs 2x grams.  Now, we also know that there are 80 apples in total, so the total weight of all the apples is 80x grams.  Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as an apple, the total weight of all the chocolate bars is 2 times 80x = 160x grams.  Therefore, each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams (since it takes up half of the total weight).
Response:  On Monday (Rose went to the market), he bought 4 bags of coffee.  On Tuesday (he went to another store), he bought 3 times as many bags of coffee as he bought on Monday.  On Wednesday (he went to another store again), he bought 5 times as many bags of coffee as he bought on Tuesday. So, in total, Rose bought 4 + 3(4) + 5(5) = 21 bags of coffee over the course of 3 days.
Response:  We have two options to choose from: buying 25 cups or selling 30 lautas.  If we buy 25 cups, the cost is $1200 - $5 = $1195 per cup.  If we sell 30 lautas, the price is $6000 / 30 = $200 per lauta. Therefore, the total cost of buying 25 cups is $1195 per cup, and the total revenue from selling 30 lautas is $200 per lauta.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has saved $10 before she started babysitting.  Then, she spends $30 on the new jacket and $20 on the shoes. So, her total savings after buying the clothes is $10-$30-$20 = $-50. Now, let's calculate how many times Sara needs to cut the grass to have enough money for the clothes. We know that she earns $5 per time she takes care of the neighbor's children, so she will need to do this task $50/5 = 10 times. Therefore, Sara needs to cut the grass 10 times before she can afford the new jacket and shoes.
Response:  If Jerry has more white cats than red ones, then he must have at least 3 times as many white cats as red ones. So if he has x white cats, he has 3x red cats. Since each white cat lays 5 eggs per day and each red cat lays 3 eggs per day, Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day from both types of cats. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x + 42 = 42 (1) Now solve for x: Substituting the value of 3x = 42 into equation (1), we get: 3x = 42  Divide both sides by 3 to find x: x = 14 So Jerry has 14 white cats and therefore 42 - 14 = 28 red cats.
Response:  The area of the square is given as 4 times the length of its side, which is equal to 2 miles x 2 = 4 square miles. Since Gary walks for 3 miles in one hour, he will walk for (4 square miles) / (3 miles/hour) = 133 hours. Therefore, Gary will take approximately 133 hours to cover the distance of 4 square miles while walking at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
Response:  On day 1, Sloane had 100 customers. If he added 50 more customers on day 2 and 50 more customers on day 3, then he had a total of 150 customers on day 3 (100 + 50 + 50). Therefore, the number of customers Sloane had on day 3 is 150.
Response:  At first, there were two tanks, one that held 4 gallons per minute and another that held twice as much water (8 gallons/minute). After 4 minutes, the small tank had twice as much water as it initially did, so it now holds 16 gallons of water (2 x 8 = 16). Therefore, the small tank currently holds 16 gallons of water.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Lori has $320 to spend on shoes and $32 to spend on a shirt. So in total, she has $352 to spend.  Secondly, we are told that her part-time job pays her $8 per hour. Therefore, if she works for x hours, she will earn $x \* $8 = $8x dollars.  Now, let's find out how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford her purchases. We can do this by setting up an equation using the information given in the question:

$352 = $8x

Now, we need to solve for x (the number of hours Lori needs to work). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by $8:

x = $352 / $8

x = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford her purchases."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Janet has paid so far. Since she promised to pay $2000 and has already paid $165 per month for 12 months, her total payment is: $$ = \text {Total Payment} = 165 \times 12 = $1980$$ Now, let's find out how much money Janet still owes. To do this, we subtract the amount she has paid from the original amount she borrowed: $$ = \text{Still Owed} = $2000 - $1980 = $20$$ Therefore, Janet still owes $20.
Response:  We know that there are four roses and seven daisies more than roses in Vasilisa's garden. So, if there were x roses, then there would be 7x + 4 = 28 flowers in total in Vasilisa's garden. Therefore, the number of flowers in Vasilisa's garden is 28.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's age can be calculated as follows:
Adrian = 3 x Harriet
= 3 x 21
= 63 years old
Now, we are given that Harriet is half of Zack's age, so Zack's age can be calculated as follows:
Zack = Harriet + (Harriet/2)
= 21 + (21/2)
= 42 years old
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Adrian = 63 years old
Zack = 42 years old"
Response:  We know that four students (Neljä opiskelijaa) played the game and got together 251 points.  Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored more than Naomi by 10 points, and Brianna scored more than Naomi by 17 points. So, Jojo scored 251 - (68 + 10 + 17) = 146 points.
"Response: 
Carmenilla spent 10 minutes solving each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes solving each Sudoku puzzle. Therefore, she spent a total of:

10 x 3 = 30 minutes solving crosswords
5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving Sudokus
Total time spent playing games = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes
Therefore, Carmenilla spent 70 minutes playing games during the weekend."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Celine took out 90 liters of water from the tank for her small garden. So, now there are 30 liters (120 - 90) left in the tank. Then, we find out that Celine was able to collect twice as much rainwater as she used from the tank. Therefore, she collected 180 liters (2 x 90) of rainwater. Now, let's add the amount of water left in the tank with the amount of rainwater collected and see how many liters of water are left in the tank now: 120 + 180 = 300 liters. So, there are 300 liters of water left in the tank now.
Response:  We know that Andy has 90 geraniums and 40 petunias less than geraniums. So, he has 90 - 40 = 50 more geraniums than petunias. Therefore, Andy plants 50 + 90 = 140 flowers in total.
"Response:  If the company spends $15,000 per year on advertising and then uses one-third of that amount for advertising in the following year, we can calculate how much it has spent on advertising over two years as follows:
Year 1: Advertising expense = $15,000
Year 2: Advertising expense = ($15,000 x 1/3) = $5,000
Therefore, the company has spent a total of $20,000 on advertising over two years."
Response:  Carlos pays $30 for 3 hours of use of the canoe and Benji pays $18 for 5 hours of use of the boat. Therefore, their total cost is:  Carlos's cost = $30 x 3 hours = $90  Benji's cost = $18 x 5 hours = $90 So they both pay $90 in total for the rentals.
Response:  If he travels from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and then returns to New Jersey by car, it means that his total journey time is equal to the sum of the times taken for each leg of the trip. So, we can write an equation as follows:  Time taken by bus = Time taken by car + Time spent in Rochester  Since we know that the distance between Newark (in New Jersey) and Rochester is approximately 300 miles, and the average speed of a bus is around 50 mph, we can calculate the time taken by bus as follows:  Time taken by bus = Distance / Speed = 300 miles / 50 mph = 6 hours Therefore, if he takes the bus for 6 hours to reach Rochester, and then spends half a day (4 hours) in Rochester before returning to New Jersey by car, we can calculate the total time taken for his journey as follows:  Total time taken = Time taken by bus + Time taken by car - Time spent in Rochester = 6 hours + 2 hours - 4 hours = 10 hours Thus, Andrew will spend 10 hours on his entire journey, including both legs and the time spent in Rochester.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 40 water types in total. If James loses 8 of them, then he has 40 - 8 = 32 water types left. Now, if he buys 14 grass types, then he has 32 + 14 = 46 cards in total. So, the probability of randomly selected card being water type is 46/90 = 0.505 or approximately 50.5%.

"Response: 
Kalinda can make 360 pieces in total and she can add 4 pieces per minute. Her mother can set half of Kalinda's pieces per minute. To find out how many hours they need to solve this puzzle, we will divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces Kalinda can add per minute. So, the answer is:
Hours = Total pieces / Minutes per piece
= 360 / 4
= 90 hours"
Response:  We know that initially there were 120 watermelons and after two months, 30% of them were ready to be repaired, which means 36 watermelons (30/100 x 120 = 36). Then, when Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were already repaired, which means 24 watermelons (3/4 x 36 = 24). Therefore, there were 50 watermelons left unrepaired (120 - 36 - 24 = 50). So, during the additional two weeks, 50 - 24 = 26 watermelons were not yet ready for repair.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mark owns 12 cars and each car sells for $20,000. Therefore, he has earned total revenue of $240,000 from selling his cars (12 x $20,000).  Secondly, we are told that Mark pays 10% tax on his income from selling cars, which is equal to $24,000 ($240,000 x 10%). So far, Mark has spent $264,000 ($240,000 + $24,000) on his cars and registration fees. Finally, we are asked how much Mark spends in total. To find this out, we need to add up all the amounts we have calculated so far: $264,000 + $1,000 (registration fee per car) x 12 = $358,000. Therefore, Mark spends a total of $358,000 on his 12 cars and registration fees.
Response:  On Monday (maanantai), Kylie gathered 5 more cups than Robert, so together they gathered 7 + 5 = 12 cups.  On Tuesday (tiistai), Kylie gathered twice as many cups as she did on Monday, so she gathered 2 x 12 = 24 cups. Therefore, Kylie gathered a total of 12 + 24 = 36 cups on Tuesday.
Response:  If there are 50 mukaihas in the garden and Dax found half of them, then there are 50 x 2 = 100 mukaihas left in the garden after Dax collected some. Now, let's find out how many other insects were in the garden besides the mukaihas. According to the question, Dax found more than twice as many omena as mukaihas in the garden. So if there were x omena in the garden initially, there will be 2x omena after Dax collected some. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is: 100 + 2x = 100 + 2(50) = 100 + 100 = 200 insects.
"Response:  We know that out of 36 penguins, 12 (or 33%) go into the water to swim in the open sea.  And 9 (or 25%) go to the cave to eat their dinner. So, we have:

Pingviinit jäljellä auringossa = 36 - 12 - 9 = 25

There are 25 penguins left to bask in the sunlight."
Response:  If Steve eats twice as much tomatoes and grows his own tomato plants, he will eat six times more than his girlfriend (2 x 6 = 12). Since he eats for six days, he needs 12 / 6 = 2 viiniköynnökset to produce enough tomatoes for himself.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend will get 4 slices of pizza. So, total number of slices required = 20 x 4 = 80 slices. Since we have to divide it into 8 parts, John needs to order 8 x 8 = 64 slices of pizza. Therefore, John needs to order 64 slices of pizza.
Response:  If Ram can make one full kynä from five empty ones, then he has 5/1 = 5 full kynä after mixing them together.  Now, if he buys 25 kynä and uses them up to make new ones when the ink runs out, then he will have 25 - 5 = 20 full kynä left. Therefore, the final number of kynä Ram has is 20.
Response:  If Johnny invested $20 and doubled it to $40 in one year, then he had $60 at the end of that year.  If he added another $10, then his total amount would be $70. So, after one year, Johnny had $70.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is x - 2 years old where x is Joan's age. Secondly, we know that Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is x + 5 years old where x is Jessa's age. Finally, we are told that Jessa is 20 years old, so Jessa's age is x = 20. Therefore, the sum of their ages can be calculated as follows: Mary's age = x - 2 = 18 Joan's age = x + 5 = 25 Jessa's age = x = 20 So, the sum of their ages is 18 + 25 + 20 = 63.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 1000 students in total at school. Then, after the assembly, 30% of them left through exit A, which means 300 students (30% x 1000). Next, 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, which is equal to 600 students (3/5 x 800), since there were initially 1000 students and now 200 have left. Finally, the remaining students left through exit C, which is equal to 400 students (1000 - 600). Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is 400.
Response:  We know that John has twice as many cookies as Robert does. So if Robert has x cookies, John has 2x cookies.  Since John has 54 cookies in total, we can write an equation: 2x = 54. Now solve for x: x = 27. Therefore, John has 27 more cookies than James.
Response:  If Dolly and Pandora read each other's books simultaneously, they will have read a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books together until the end.
"Response: 
Mike has been exchanging letters with five people as part of his letter-writing project. He stopped writing to two of them. They send him five-page letters twice a week. He replies in the same way, writing one page every six minutes. How many hours does he spend writing each week?

Let's break it down:

1. Number of days per week = 7 (assuming Monday to Sunday)
2. Number of letters received from each person per week = 5 x 5 = 25 letters
3. Time taken to write each letter = 6 minutes/page x 5 pages = 30 minutes
4. Total time spent writing letters per week = 30 minutes x 25 letters = 750 minutes
5. Convert minutes to hours = 750 minutes / 60 = 12.5 hours

Therefore, Mike spends approximately 12.5 hours writing letters each week."
"Response:  We know that Jason has made 1000 minutes of phone calls in one month and he spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day. So, the total number of minutes he talks to his boss is:

1000 / 30 = 33.33 minutes per day

Now, we need to find out how many days there are in this month. The question states that there are 30 days in this month.

So, the total number of minutes Jason has talked to his boss in this month is:

33.33 x 30 = 999.9 minutes

Finally, we subtract the number of minutes he has already spoken to his boss (300) from the total number of minutes:

999.9 - 300 = 699.9 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 699.9 minutes left to talk to his boss in this month."
"Response:  We know that:

* Griffin had 24 French people at first (given).
* Kyle took 5 of them (given).
* Billy took twice as many as Kyle (implied), so he took 10 French people (since 2 x 5 = 10).
* Ginger gave Griffin some more French people (implied).
* Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle (given).

Now let's use these pieces of information to calculate how many French people Griffin had in total:

Griffin started with 24 French people, then Kyle took 5, Billy took 10, and Ginger gave him some more. So, Griffin had:

24 + 5 + 10 + X = 27

where X is the number of French people Ginger gave him. Since Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle, Colby took 3 less than 10, which is 7. Therefore, the final number of French people Griffin had was:

24 + 5 + 10 + 7 = 46

So, Ginger gave Griffin 7 French people."
Response:  In the first aquarium, there are 4 fish and in the second aquarium, there are 32 fish. If we want to find out how many fish each aquarium has, we can divide the number of fish by the number of tanks. So, if we have 4 fish in one tank, then each tank has 4/1 = 4 fish. Similarly, if we have 32 fish in another tank, then each tank has 32/2 = 16 fish. Therefore, there are 4 fish in the first aquarium and 16 fish in the second aquarium.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jean pays for each meiki session. Since he needs it four times a week and the sessions last six hours each, he pays $250 x 4 = $1000 per week. Now, let's calculate how much he paid in total during the five weeks of filming. Total amount = $1000 x 5 = $5000. Finally, since the artist gave him a 10% discount after the movie was finished, Jean saved $500 ($5000 x 10%). So, Jean paid a total of $4500 ($5000 - $500) for the meikki sessions.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabelle spent $12 on cake for her little sister's birthday party. Then she spent $43 on gifts for her little sister. Next, she spent $15 on decorations and $4 on invitations. Finally, she gave $22 to her parents as a gift for their help in organizing the party. So, how much did each person contribute? To find out, let's divide the total amount of money spent ($108) by the number of people involved (Isabelle + her parents). Therefore, Isabelle contributed $76 / 4 = $19 per person, and her parents contributed $108 - ($76 x 3) = $27 per person.
"Response:  We know that Kokki has bought four bags of potatoes, each bag weighing 50 kg. The price of one kilogram of potatoes is $1.5. Therefore, the total cost of all four bags would be:
4 x 50 kg = 200 kg $1.5/kg = $300
So, Kokki has spent $300 on potatoes."
Response:  On Monday (Maanantaina), Sue ate four times more cookies than her sister. So if she ate x cookies, her sister ate 4x cookies.  Then on Tuesday (Tiistaina), Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So if she ate x cookies, her sister ate 2x cookies.  Now we know that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Wednesday. Therefore, Sue ate 4(5) = 20 cookies on Monday and 2(13) = 26 cookies on Wednesday. Since each cookie contains 200 calories, Sue consumed 20 + 26 = 4600 calories more than her sister.
