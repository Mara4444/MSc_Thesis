"Response: 
To find out how much money Janet earns from selling her eggs at the market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she has left after using them for breakfast and baking muffins, and then multiply that by the price per egg.

Number of eggs left = Total number of eggs - (3 x Number of eggs used for breakfast) - (4 x Number of eggs used for baking)
= 16 - (3 x 3) - (4 x 4)
= 16 - 9 - 16
= 1

So, Janet has one egg left after using them for breakfast and baking muffins. If each egg is sold for $2, then she earns $2 from selling that one egg. Therefore, her daily income from selling eggs at the market is $2."

"Response: 
To calculate Josh's profit, we need to subtract the cost of purchasing and renovating the house from the increased value of the house after renovation.

Cost of purchasing the house = $8,000 (purchase price)
Cost of renovations = $5,000
Total cost = $8,000 + $5,000 = $13,000

Increased value of the house after renovation = $150% x $8,000 (original purchase price) = $12,000

Profit = Increased value - Total cost
= $12,000 - $13,000
= $900

Therefore, Josh's profit is $900."

"Response: 
Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
2. He then realized he had forgotten something very important and turned back.
3. The first two hours were spent in heavy traffic, so he could not move.
4. For the next 30 minutes, he drove at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
5. After that, he drove at a speed of 80 miles per hour to return home.

We can start by calculating the distance traveled during each segment of the journey:

1. First 2 hours (heavy traffic):
Distance = Speed x Time = 60 x 2 = 120 miles
2. Next 30 minutes (slow speed):
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 x 0.5 = 15 miles
3. Remaining distance to be covered at high speed:
Distance = Speed x Time = 80 x (4 - 2) = 80 x 2 = 160 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = Distance from step 1 + Distance from step 2 + Distance from step 3
= 120 + 15 + 160
= 395 miles

Therefore, John is 395 miles away from his home."

"Response: 6 years.
Explanation:

1. Initial investment = $90 (cost of planting the lemon tree)
2. Annual revenue = 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon = $10.50
3. Annual expenses = $3 (maintenance and care of the tree)
4. Profit/year = Revenue - Expenses = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50
5. Break-even point = Initial investment / Profit/year = $90 / $7.50 = 12 years
6. Time to break even = 12 years - 6 years = 6 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 6 years to break even on his investment in the lemon tree."

"Response: 3 years old.
Explanation:
We know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is two years older than Suzie's iPhone. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Brandon's iPhone = 4 x Ben's iPhone
Ben's iPhone = 2 x Suzie's iPhone

Now we need to find out how many years ago Suzie bought her iPhone. Let's call this time ""t"" years ago.

Suzie's iPhone = t years old

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, we can say that:

Brandon's iPhone = 4 x Ben's iPhone
= 4(t + 2)

Now we have two equations:

1. Brandon's iPhone = 4x Ben's iPhone
2. Ben's iPhone = 2x Suzie's iPhone

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

t = 3

Therefore, Suzie bought her iPhone 3 years ago, and Brandon's iPhone is 4 x 3 = 12 years old."
"Response: 270 feet (92 meters)

Explanation:
The distance that Polly can throw the golden spear without the sapphire gemstone is given as 400 feet (122 meters). With the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it 3 times farther than usual, which means she can throw it to a maximum distance of 3 x 400 = 1200 feet (366 meters).

Since the dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet (305 meters), Polly needs to be at least 1000 - 400 = 600 feet (183 meters) away from the dragon when she throws the spear. If she has the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the spear 3 times farther than usual, so she would need to be at least 3 x 600 = 1800 feet (549 meters) away from the dragon.

Therefore, the minimum distance that Polly needs to be from the dragon in order to hit it with the golden spear while holding the sapphire gemstone is 1800 - 400 = 1400 feet (427 meters)."

To calculate how many grams of potato chips 1800 calories worth can be consumed if one's daily calorie goal is 2000 calories and one has already consumed 1800 calories, we need to divide 1800 by 250 (the number of calories in one serving of potato chips). This gives us:

1800 / 250 = 7.2

So, 7.2 servings of potato chips (or 720 grams) can be consumed if one's daily calorie goal is 2000 calories and one has already consumed 1800 calories."

To find Charlie's pure profit from selling 20 candles, we need to subtract the total cost of producing and purchasing the materials for each candle from the revenue generated by selling each candle.

Total Cost = $10 (cost per pound of wax) x 10 pounds (quantity of wax needed for 20 candles) + $10 (cost per pound of wick) x 2 pounds (quantity of wick needed for 20 candles) + $2 (cost per candle) x 20 candles = $200

Revenue = $2 (price per candle) x 20 candles = $400

Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours
Tuesday: 10 articles x 4 hours per article = 40 hours
Wednesday: 15 articles x 4 hours per article = 60 hours

Total time over the past three days: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 hours

"Response: 
To find out how much money Lloyd can make in a week from his eggs, we need to calculate how many dozen eggs he can sell per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

Let's start with the information given:

* Each hen lays 252 eggs per day.
* One dozen eggs costs $2.

So, if Lloyd sells all the eggs his hens lay each day, he can sell:

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens of eggs per day

Now, let's calculate how much money Lloyd can make in a week:

21 dozens x $2/dozen = $42 per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, Lloyd can make:

$42/day x 7 days/week = $294 per week

Therefore, Lloyd can make approximately $294 per week selling eggs from his chicken farm."

"Response: 24 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds.  
Explanation: The total weight of the truck and its contents is given as 3755 pounds (driver + empty truck). To calculate how many boxes can be loaded without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and empty truck from the weight limit. In this case, that would be:

5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box to find out how many boxes can be loaded:

1245 / 15 = 83

Therefore, up to 83 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit."

"Response: ジャクソンは13歳です。
Explanation:

* エイミーはジャクソンより5歳年上なので、エイミーの年齢を5加えるとジャクソンの年齢になる。
* コリーはジェームスより2歳若いので、コリーの年齢を2 subtract from James's age to get Colin's age.
* James is 10 years old, so Colin is 10 - 2 = 8 years old.
* Since Emily is 5 years older than Jackson, and Colin is 2 years younger than Jackson, we can set up the equation:

Emily's age - Jackson's age = 5
Colin's age - Jackson's age = 2

Solving for Jackson's age, we get:

Jackson's age = (Emily's age + Colin's age) / 2
= (5 + 2) / 2
= 7 / 2
= 3.5

Since ages cannot be half years, rounding up gives us:

Jackson's age = 3 + 1 = 4 years old."

Explanation:
There are 30 cars in total on the highway.
5 cars have exited the highway before the jam started.
15 minutes into the jam, 15 cars have passed through (since there are 15 minutes left).
So, 15 + 5 = 20 cars have passed through the exit during the first 15 minutes of the jam.
Since 20 cars have passed through the exit, there are only 10 cars remaining on the highway.

"Response: 625 pieces of puzzle are left unplaced.
Explanation:
There are 1000 pieces in total.
Poppi has placed 4/10 = 400 pieces (400 / 1000) = 4/5 of the puzzle.
Her mother has placed 3/10 = 300 pieces (300 / 1000) = 3/5 of the puzzle.
So, the remaining number of pieces to be placed is:
1000 - (400 + 300) = 1000 - 700 = 300
Therefore, there are 300 pieces of puzzle left unplaced."

Explanation:
Frankie watches TV for 7 hours in total.
He watches 1-hour episodes on Monday and Tuesday, so he watches 2 episodes (1 hour x 2 days = 2 hours).
On Wednesday, he watches 30 minutes of an episode, so he watches 1 episode (30 minutes x 1 day = 1 hour).
On Thursday, he watches 1 hour of an episode and 30 minutes of another episode, so he watches 2 episodes (1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours).
On Friday, he watches 2 episodes (1 hour x 2 days = 2 hours).
Therefore, Frankie watches a total of 2 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 6.5 episodes. Since he watches 30 minutes of an episode on Wednesday, he watches 30 minutes x 1 day = 30 minutes more than the other days."

10 gal x $3.00/gal = $30.00 (initial cost)
-$0.20/gal x 10 gal = -$2.00 (cash back)

Let's denote the amount of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcel and Bethany as M and B respectively. We know that:

M = 3R (since each roll is 3 inches wide)
B = 2R (since each roll is 2 inches wide)

We also know that the total length of both rolls is:

L = M + B = 3R + 2R = 5R

Since they ate all the rolls, we can set up the equation:

M + B = L

Substituting the values, we get:

3R + 2R = 5R

Simplifying, we get:

5R = 7R

Solving for R, we get:

R = 2

So, both Marcel and Bethany ate an average of 2 rolls each."

To find out how much profit Sasha will make if she sells all of her lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and then subtract that from the total revenue.

Total cost = 2 x 4 x 10 (number of boards) x $10 per board = $200
Total cost + 4 x 4 x 10 (number of boards) x $16 per board = $800
Total revenue = 2 x 4 x 10 (number of boards) x $10 per board + 4 x 4 x 10 (number of boards) x $16 per board = $200 + $800 = $1,000
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $1,000 - $200 = $800
Therefore, Sasha will make a profit of $800 if she sells all of her lumber."

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Johnny has collected 500 pieces of Lego from his bed.
* He has three boxes with 500 pieces each.
* One box contains 1/4 of the total number of pieces.

We can start by finding out how many pieces are in all three boxes combined:

3 x 500 = 1500 pieces

Now, we know that one box contains 1/4 of the total number of pieces, so we can find out how many pieces are in that box:

1500 / 4 = 375 pieces

So, there are 375 pieces in the box that contains 1/4 of the total number of pieces.

Next, we need to add up all the pieces that Johnny has collected:

500 + 375 = 875 pieces

Therefore, Johnny has collected a total of 875 Lego pieces from his bed."

"Response:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Charlie has 3 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
* James has 4 times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
* The total number of Facebook friends for all three is 12.

We can let D be the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has, since we know that Charlie has 3D and James has 4D. We also know that the sum of their Facebook friends is 12, so we can set up the equation:

3D + 4D = 12

Simplify the equation:

7D = 12

Divide both sides by 7:

D = 16/7

So Dorothy has 16/7 Facebook friends.

Now, we need to find out how many Facebook friends James has. Since he has 4 times as many as Dorothy, we can multiply her number of friends by 4:

James has 4(16/7) = 4(16) / 7 = 64/7 Facebook friends.

Therefore, James has 64/7 Facebook friends."

* Tim will take 2 miles / 264 feet = 7.6 minutes (or approximately 8 minutes) to reach his home.

Therefore, if Tim can skateboard at a speed of 1 mile per 264 feet, he will arrive at his home about 8 minutes after starting, while Steve will arrive at his home about 7 minutes after starting."

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* There were 5 people who came to Shaonda's bike shop to inflate their tires.
* Each person had two tires that needed to be inflated, so there were a total of 10 tires that needed to be inflated.
* The cost of inflating each tire was $0.25, so the total amount earned by Shaonda for inflating all 10 tires would be $2.50 (10 x $0.25).
* However, 3 of the customers also asked to have their three-wheeled bicycle tires inflated, which added an additional $0.75 to the total amount earned ($3 x $0.25).
* Finally, one customer arrived with a unicycle and requested to have only one tire inflated, which added another $0.25 to the total amount earned.

Therefore, the total amount earned by Shaonda for that day would be:

$2.50 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $3.50

So, Shaonda earned $3.50 that day."

To find out how many hours Kim spends in lectures per semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends in lectures each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in one semester.

Total hours spent in lectures per week = (3 x 1 hour) + (2 x 2 hours) = 3 + 4 = 7 hours/week

Number of weeks in one semester = 16 weeks

Therefore, total hours spent in lectures per semester = 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours/semester"
"Response: 
To calculate the total length of all the items Bill has baked, we need to multiply the number of each item by its length.

* Rolls: 300 x 4 = 1200 inches (since there are 300 rolls and each is 4 inches long)
* Chocolate croissants: 120 x 6 = 720 inches (since there are 120 chocolate croissants and each is 6 inches long)
* Bagels: 60 x 2 = 120 inches (since there are 60 bagels and each is 2 feet long)

Adding up these lengths gives us a total of:

1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches

Therefore, if Bill were to lay out all the items he has baked end to end, they would be 2040 inches or 170 feet long."

Let's denote the distance traveled by Break as x and the distance traveled by Kerry as y. We know that Break runs 15 laps around the track, so his total distance is 15x. Kerry runs back and forth between the starting line and the 40-yard line, so her total distance is 2y + 40. Since Kerry decides not to run anymore after reaching the 40-yard line, we can set up the equation:

2y + 40 = 34(15x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2y + 40 = 480

Solving for y, we get:

y = 240

Therefore, Kerry ran 240 yards in total. To find out who won, we need to compare the distances traveled by Break and Kerry. Since Break ran 15 times around the track (15x), his total distance is:

15x = 15 \* 400 = 6000 yards

Kerry ran 240 yards, which is less than 6000 yards, so Break wins."

Let's denote the number of fish caught by Anakin as A, and the number of fish caught by Roksin as B.
From the problem statement, we know that:
A = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
B = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10
Since both Anakin and Roksin together caught 19 + 10 = 29 fish, we can say that:
A + B = 29... (1)
We also know that Anakin caught more than Roksin, so we can write:
A > B... (2)
Now solve equation (1) for B:
B = A - 10
Substituting A = 19 from equation (2), we get:
B = 19 - 10 = 9
Therefore, Roksin caught 9 fish."

Response:  To determine whether Jackie should handle her own taxes or hire an accountant, we need to calculate the cost of each option and compare them. Let's assume that Jackie spends 3 hours per week (12 hours/month) doing her own tax preparation, which is equivalent to $35/hour based on her previous statement. This means she would spend $35 x 12 = $420 per month on tax preparation if she does it herself. On the other hand, hiring an accountant for 1 hour per month at $90 per hour would cost $90 per month. Based on these calculations, it makes more sense for Jackie to hire an accountant because the cost of hiring an accountant ($90/month) is less than the amount she would spend on her own time ($420/month). Additionally, hiring an accountant can provide peace of mind and ensure that Jackie's taxes are done correctly, potentially avoiding any penalties or errors.

To calculate how much Jessica will pay per year if she pays at least 50% more than the minimum amount due for each loan, we need to first determine the minimum amounts due for each loan.

For the student loans, the monthly payment is $300, so the annual payment would be:

$300 x 12 = $3,600 per year

For the credit card debt, the monthly payment is $200, so the annual payment would be:

$200 x 12 = $2,400 per year

For the mortgage debt, the monthly payment is $500, so the annual payment would be:

$500 x 12 = $6,000 per year

If Jessica pays at least 50% more than the minimum amount due for each loan, her total annual payment would be:

$3,600 + $2,400 + $6,000 = $12,000 per year"

To find out how much lemon is used in making 25 dollars of profit, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon and sugar used in producing 20 glasses of lemonade.

Let X be the number of glasses of lemonade sold.

Since each glass requires 0.5 liters of lemon juice and 2 dollars worth of sugar, the total cost of ingredients for X glasses would be:

Lemon juice: 0.5 x X = 0.5X
Sugar: 2 x X = 2X
Total cost: 0.5X + 2X = 2.5X

Profit per glass: 25 - 2.5X

Since they made a profit of $25, the equation becomes:

2.5X = 25

Solving for X, we get:

X = 10

So, they sold 10 glasses of lemonade.

Now, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice used:

Lemon juice: 0.5 x 10 = 5 liters

Therefore, they used 5 liters of lemon juice to make 10 glasses of lemonade, which translates to $5 (5 liters x $1/liter)."

If Zeid earns $6,000 per month and spends $200 on his daughter weekly, $700 on food and household items for his wife, and donates half of his remaining salary to charity, how much will he have left after all these expenses?

Formula: Total income - Weekly expenses - Monthly expenses = Amount left

Total income = $6,000 (monthly salary)
Weekly expenses = $200 (daughter's expense) x 4 weeks = $800
Monthly expenses = $700 (food and household items for wife) x 12 months = $8,400

Amount left = Total income - Weekly expenses - Monthly expenses
= $6,000 - $800 - $8,400
= $6,000 - $9,200
= -$3,200

Therefore, Zeid will be left with negative $3,200 after all these expenses."

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. Jane is 2 years older than Mark.
2. 2 years ago, Mark was half of Jake's age.

From point 1, we know that Jane is currently 2 years older than Mark. So if Mark is x years old now, Jane is x + 2 years old.

From point 2, we know that 2 years ago, Mark was half of Jake's age. This means that Mark was (Jake / 2) years old 2 years ago.

Now, let's assume that Jake is 30 years old. Then, Mark was (30 / 2) = 15 years old 2 years ago.

So, Jane is currently (15 + 2) = 17 years old."
"Response: 
The first team has an average speed of 55 seconds per 400 meters, so their total time for the relay is:

400 meters x 4 runners = 1600 meters
1600 meters / 55 seconds per 400 meters = 30 seconds

The second team has a slower average speed, with the first runner taking 60 seconds to cover 400 meters and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Let's break down their times as follows:

First runner: 60 seconds
Second runner: 60 + 3 = 63 seconds
Third runner: 63 + 3 = 66 seconds
Fourth runner: 66 + 3 = 69 seconds

Therefore, the total time for the second team is:

400 meters x 4 runners = 1600 meters
1600 meters / 69 seconds per 400 meters = 23.7 seconds

Since the first team finished in 30 seconds, the second team finished in 23.7 seconds, which means they lost by 6.3 seconds (30 - 23.7)."
"Response: 70%.
Explanation:
When Jerry rolls a 6-faced die, the probability of getting an even number is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of getting a larger number than 3 is also 1/2, since there are two numbers greater than 3 (4 and 5). Therefore, the probability of getting a larger number than 3 in two consecutive rolls is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.
However, since Jerry needs to get a larger number than 3 in two consecutive rolls, the probability of success is lower than the probability of getting a larger number in one roll. Specifically, the probability of success is 1/4, which is 25%.
Therefore, the percentage difference between the probability of getting a larger number than 3 in two consecutive rolls and the probability of getting an even number in two consecutive rolls is:
(1 - 0.25) / 0.25 = 70%."

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* The merchant bought 20 dollars worth of wheat from the farm for 1 bag.
* It cost 2 dollars to transport each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse.
* The merchant sold the wheat for 30 dollars per bag and made a profit of 400 dollars.

We can start by calculating the total amount spent by the merchant on buying the wheat:

20 dollars x 1 bag = 20 dollars

Now, let's calculate the total number of bags the merchant needed to sell to make a profit of 400 dollars:

Profit = 400 dollars
Selling price per bag = 30 dollars
Number of bags to be sold = Profit / Selling price per bag
= 400 dollars / 30 dollars
= 13.33 bags (approximately)

Since we cannot sell a fraction of a bag, we round up to the nearest whole number:

Number of bags sold = 14 bags

Therefore, the merchant sold 14 bags of wheat."

So, the group of 10 birds would need 35 pounds of insects per day."
"Response: 
In 10 years, Tom will have planted 10 trees per year for 10 years, so he will have planted a total of 10 x 10 = 100 trees.
If he cuts down 2 trees per year, then in 10 years, he will have cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees.
So, after 10 years, there will be 100 - 20 = 80 trees left.
Since 30% of the trees are expected to die, we can expect 30% of 80 trees to die, which is:
80 x 0.3 = 24 trees
Therefore, there will be 80 - 24 = 56 trees left after 10 years."

"Response: 
To calculate how much John will receive in one year if he wins the award at the beginning of the year and continues to earn $2,000 per week, we need to first calculate his total earnings for the year.

Total earnings = Number of weeks worked x Weekly salary
= 52 weeks (since there are 52 weeks in a year) x $2,000/week
= $104,000

Now, let's subtract the amount of the award from his total earnings:

$104,000 - $5,000 (award amount) = $99,000

So, John will have earned $99,000 in one year if he wins the award at the beginning of the year and continues to earn $2,000 per week."
"Response: 
To find out how many barrels of wine Joji's farm can produce per year, we need to calculate the total amount of grapes produced in one year and then convert it into barrels of wine.

Total number of grapes produced per year = Number of acres x Total grapes per acre x Yearly production period (in days)

Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and there are 365 days in a year, the total number of grapes produced per year is:

Total number of grapes produced per year = 10 acres x 5 tons/acre x 365 days = 182,500 tons of grapes per year

Now, we need to convert this quantity of grapes into barrels of wine. Since each ton of grapes can be converted into 2 barrels of wine, we have:

Number of barrels of wine produced per year = Total number of grapes produced per year / 2

Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine that Joji's farm can produce per year is:

Number of barrels of wine produced per year = 182,500 tons of grapes / 2 = 91,250 barrels of wine per year"

"Response:  Let's say Jerry owns x white chickens and y red chickens. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the following equation:

x \* 3 + y \* 5 = 42... (1)

where ""x"" is the number of white chickens and ""y"" is the number of red chickens.

We know that Jerry has more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write:

x > y

Substituting this into equation (1), we get:

x \* 3 + y \* 5 = 42

Simplifying, we have:

3x + 5y = 42

Since Jerry has more white chickens, we know that x is greater than y. Therefore, we can solve for x by subtracting y from both sides of the equation:

3x + 5y - 5y = 42 - 5y

Simplifying further, we get:

3x = 37

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that:

x = 12

So Jerry owns 12 white chickens and y red chickens, where y is determined by the equation:

y = 42 - 12 \* 3

y = 42 - 36

y = 6

Therefore, Jerry owns 12 white chickens and 6 red chickens."

"Response: 小さいプールには8ガロンの水が入っています。
Explanation: Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. We know that initially, the large pool had twice the amount of water as the small pool, so the initial amount of water in the large pool is 2x gallons.

After 4 minutes, the large pool loses 1/4 of its water, which means it loses 2x/4 = x gallons of water. Since the small pool only lost 1/2 of its water, it loses x/2 gallons of water.

We are told that after 4 minutes, the large pool has 4 times the amount of water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation:

2x + x = 4(x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

Therefore, there are 8 gallons of water in the small pool."

"Response: 12 months after borrowing $2,000 at 10% interest per annum with monthly payments of $165, the outstanding balance would be approximately $1,843.79.

Here's how to calculate it:

1. Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months:
$165 x 12 = $1,980
2. Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months:
$2,000 - $1,980 = $120
3. Convert the remaining balance from yearly to monthly:
$120 / 10 (monthly interest rate) = $12
4. Add the monthly interest to the remaining balance:
$12 + $120 = $132

Therefore, the outstanding balance after 12 months is approximately $1,843.79."

"Response: 3 years after Harriet is 21, Adrian will be 3 x 21 = 63 years old, and Zach will be half of 63 = 31.5 years old (rounded to 32). So, three years later, their average age will be:

Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66
Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
Zach: 32 + 3 = 35

Their average age will be:

(66 + 24 + 35) / 3 = 125 / 3 = 41.67 years old."
"Response: 39 points (calculation below)

Explanation:
To find out how many points Jojo got, we need to use the information that Naomi got 68 points and Briana got 17 more points than Naomi. We also know that Yuri got half of Naomi's points plus 10.

Let X be the number of points Naomi got. Then, Yuri got X/2 + 10 = 68/2 + 10 = 39 points.

Briana got 17 more points than Naomi, so she got 17 + 68 = 85 points.

Jojo got the remaining points, which is 251 - (68 + 85) = 251 - 153 = 39 points."

Explanation:

* Calinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
* Mother can place half of Calinda's number of pieces, which is 4/2 = 2 pieces per minute.
* Total time to complete the puzzle = (number of pieces / number of pieces placed per minute) x mother's placing speed + Calinda's placing speed.

To calculate the total amount paid by Mark for the 12 cars, we need to add the purchase price of each car, tax (10% of purchase price), and registration fee (1,000 dollars per car).

Purchase Price x 12 = 240,000 dollars (for all 12 cars)
Tax (10%) x 240,000 = 24,000 dollars (for all 12 cars)
Registration Fee x 12 = 12,000 dollars
Total Amount Paid = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 dollars"

To determine how many tomato plants Steve needs to produce 6 tomatoes per day for one week (7 days), we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he needs and then divide that by the number of tomatoes each plant can produce in one week.

Total number of tomatoes needed = 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes

Since each plant can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve will need:

42 / 3 = 14 plants

Therefore, Steve will need 14 tomato plants to produce enough tomatoes for his daily consumption for one week."

Let X be the number of students who exit through door C.
We know that 30% of the total number of students (i.e., 300) exited through door A, and 5/3 of the remaining students (i.e., 500) exited through door B. Therefore, the number of students who did not exit through doors A or B is:

Total students - (300 + 500) = 1000 - 800 = 200

Since 5/3 of these students exited through door B, the number of students who exited through door C is:

X = 200 / 5 = 40

Therefore, 40 students exited through door C."

"Response:  Let's denote the number of fish in the first aquarium as x and the number of fish in the second aquarium as y. We know that the difference between the two is twice the sum of their numbers, so we can write an equation based on this information:

x + y = 2(x + y)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 2y = 4x + 4y

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

y = 2x

So, if there are x fish in the first aquarium, there will be 2x fish in the second aquarium."
