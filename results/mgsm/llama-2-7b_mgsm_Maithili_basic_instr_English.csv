Explanation:
The cost of buying a house worth $800,000 with a down payment of $50,000 is $750,000. If the value of the house increases by 150%, then its new value will be:
New Value = Old Value x 150%
= $750,000 x 150%
= $112,500,000
So, the profit made on investment is:
Profit = New Value - Old Value
= $112,500,000 - $750,000
= $37,500,000
Therefore, the benefit gained from investing in real estate is $37,500,000."

The total value of the investment is $500,000. If the entrepreneur chooses to invest in the electric vehicle market, which has an expected growth rate of 2.5%, the value of the investment will increase by approximately $12,500 after one year ($500,000 x 2.5%). However, if the entrepreneur chooses to invest in the conventional gasoline-powered vehicle market, which has an expected growth rate of 1.2%, the value of the investment will increase by approximately $6,000 after one year ($500,000 x 1.2%). Therefore, the approximate benefit of choosing to invest in the electric vehicle market over the conventional gasoline-powered vehicle market is $6,500 ($12,500 minus $6,000)."

Explanation:
The height of Mahaan Agar is given as 1000 feet. The distance between Agar and Farbod is 400 feet. Therefore, the distance between Agar and Poli Sonak is 600 feet (400 + 200). Since Poli Sonak can climb only 300 feet in one day, he will reach the top of Agar after 2 days (600 / 300 = 2).
Now, let's calculate the time taken by Poli Sonak to reach the top of Dragon Mountain from Agar. The distance between Agar and Dragon Mountain is 1000 feet. Since Poli Sonak can climb at a speed of 100 feet per hour, it will take him 10 hours to reach the top of Dragon Mountain (1000 / 100 = 10).
Therefore, the final answer is 32567890."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Daadi Johns Fireman Launched 5 Tonne Seeds into Space and Each Paike (seed) Weighed 80 Grams. Therefore, the total weight of all 50 seeds is 50 x 80 = 4000 grams or 4 kg."
"Response: 476 grams (calculation below)

Calculation:

Total calories in one bag of chips = 250 calories/bag x number of bags consumed = 250 x 3 = 750 calories

Total weight of chips consumed = weight of 300g thali x number of thalis consumed = 300 x 5 = 1500 grams

Calories per gram of chips = total calories / total weight = 750 / 1500 = 0.5 (or 50%)

Therefore, Ahan consumes approximately 476 grams (0.5 x 300 grams) of chips daily."

From the given information, we can calculate the total number of kantas in each gulabak jhadi as follows:
Number of kantas in each gulabak jhadi = Total number of gulabaks / Number of gulabak jhadis
= 25 gulabaks / 3 gulabak jhadis
= 8 kantas per gulabak jhadi
Now, let's find out the total number of kantas in all the gulabak jhadis:
Total number of kantas = Number of kantas in each gulabak jhadi x Number of gulabak jhadis
= 8 kantas/gulabak jhadi x 3 gulabak jhadis
= 24 kantas
Therefore, there are 24 kantas in all the gulabak jhadis."

"Response: 375
Explanation:
The first friend gave Rs 20 as loan to Jerome for 2 hours at an interest rate of 1/4th of the principal amount per hour. So, the total amount paid by the first friend is Rs 20 x (2/4) = Rs 10.
The second friend gave Rs 10 as loan to Jerome for 1 hour at an interest rate of 1/4th of the principal amount per hour. So, the total amount paid by the second friend is Rs 10 x (1/4) = Rs 2.50.
The third friend gave Rs 50 as loan to Jerome for 1 hour at an interest rate of 1/4th of the principal amount per hour. So, the total amount paid by the third friend is Rs 50 x (1/4) = Rs 12.50.
So, in total, Jerome received Rs 10 + Rs 2.50 + Rs 12.50 = Rs 35 from his three friends.
Now, if the fourth friend gives Rs 60 for 1 hour at an interest rate of 1/4th of the principal amount per hour, then the total amount paid by the fourth friend is Rs 60 x (1/4) = Rs 15.
Therefore, the total amount that Jerome received from all four friends is Rs 35 + Rs 15 = Rs 50."

The total height of three boxes is 3 x 5 = 15 inches. The height of each box is 5 inches. Therefore, the total height of all three boxes is 3 x (5 + 5 + 4) = 15 inches. Since there are three boxes, the total height of all three boxes is 3 x 15 = 45 inches. However, since one wall has a height of 6 inches and another wall has a height of 4 inches, the total height of all three walls is 6 + 4 = 10 inches. So, the remaining height after subtracting the height of all three walls from the total height of all three boxes is 45 - 10 = 35 inches."

* Therefore, the total number of apples that can be eaten by all the people in the village in one day is 16 x 3 = 48 apples.
* Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of apples that can be eaten by all the people in the village in a week is 48 x 7 = 336 apples.
* However, since some people may not eat apples every day or may not eat them at all, we need to subtract the number of days when they do not eat apples from the total number of apples available. Let us assume that out of the 7 days in a week, 2 days are holidays and no one eats apples on those days. So, the total number of apples that can be eaten by all the people in the village in a week after deducting the non-eating days is 336 - 2 = 334 apples.
* Now, let us calculate the average number of apples that each person in the village can eat per day. To do this, we divide the total number of apples available per day by the number of people in the village. In this case, the average number of apples that each person can eat per day is 334 / 16 = 20.94 apples per person per day."

Explanation:
If each teacher has to teach 2 topics per day and each topic requires 3 whiteboards for explanation, then in one week (7 days), each teacher will have to use 42 whiteboards (2 x 7). If there are 5 teachers, then the total number of whiteboards required in one week is 5 x 42 = 210. However, if the whiteboards are used efficiently and each teacher uses only 3 whiteboards per day, then in one day (24 hours), each teacher will have to use 3 whiteboards, which means that the total number of whiteboards used in one day is 5 x 3 = 15. Therefore, in one day, each whiteboard will be used 15 times, which is equal to 15/7 = 2.14 whiteboards per hour."

"Response: 50 km
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we can calculate that Michael travels for 21 days (7 days x 3 weeks) at an average speed of 45 km/h. Therefore, his total distance traveled is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 45 km/h x 21 days = 975 km
However, since he covers 25 km each day on average during the weekdays and 35 km each day on average during the weekends, his total distance traveled over 7 days is:
Weekday Distance = Speed x Time = 25 km/h x 7 days = 175 km
Weekend Distance = Speed x Time = 35 km/h x 7 days = 245 km
Therefore, Michael's overall distance traveled over 21 days is:
Total Distance = Weekday Distance + Weekend Distance = 175 km + 245 km = 420 km
So, Michael travels a total distance of approximately 420 km over 21 days."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of tarbooj (TB) produced in one month as follows:

Total TB produced = Number of farms x Production per farm x Number of months
= 120 x 12 x 3
= 5760

Now, let's find out how much percentage of TB is left unsold after three weeks:

Unsold TB = Total TB produced x Percentage unsold
= 5760 x 30/100
= 1720

So, after three weeks, 1720 TB are left unsold. Now, let's find out how many TB are sold during the remaining four weeks:

Sold TB = Total TB produced - Unsold TB
= 5760 - 1720
= 4040

Therefore, during the last four weeks, 4040 TB are sold."
