James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, which means he runs a total of 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week. Each sprint is 60 meters long, so the total distance James runs in one week is 9 x 60 = 540 meters. To find out how many total meters he runs per week, we need to convert the distance from meters to feet and then multiply by 12 since there are 12 inches in 1 foot:

540 meters x (1 meter / 3.2808 feet) = approximately 1700.72 feet
1700.72 feet x 12 inches/foot = approximately 210 meters

Therefore, James runs a total of 210 meters per week."

Kylar wanted to buy 16 glasses for his new apartment. The first glass cost $5, and every second glass cost only 60% of the price. To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for all 16 glasses, we can use the following formula:

Cost = (First glass x Price) + (Second glass x Discount percentage) +... + (Last glass x Price)

In this case, the discount percentage is 60%, so we will multiply each subsequent glass by 60%.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First glass: Cost = $5
2. Second glass: Cost = ($5 x 60%) = $3
3. Third glass: Cost = ($3 x 60%) = $1.80
4. Fourth glass: Cost = ($1.80 x 60%) = $1.08
5. Fifth glass: Cost = ($1.08 x 60%) = $0.64
...
16. Last glass: Cost = ($5 x 60%) = $3
Total cost = $3 + $3 + $1.80 + $1.08 + $0.64 = $9.76

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $9.76 for 16 glasses."

Pričakuje se, da bo Johnovih 4 ur potovanja razdeljeno na tri dele: prvi del (2 ure), drugi del (2 ure) in zadnji del (1 uro).

V prvem delu je John vozil s hitrostjo 60 mph, kar pomeni, da je prevozil 60/60 = 1 mile na uro. Torej je prevozil 1 mile x 2 ure = 2 miles v prvem delu.

V drugem delu je John vozil v prometu, kjer je hitrost bila 30 mph. Tako je prevozil 30/2 = 15 miles v drugem delu.

V zadnem delu je John vozil z hitrostjo 80 mph, ki je manjši od hitrosti v prvem delu. Torej je prevozil 80/60 = 1,33 mile na uro. Tako je prevozel 1,33 \* 1 ura = 1,33 miles v zadnem delu.

Ker je Johnovo domovinsko mesto bilo v začetku potovanja oddaljeno 157 miles, lahko izrazimo razdaljo med koncem potovanja in domovino takole:

Razdalja = Prevoženega prostora (prvi del + drugi del + zadnji del) - Razdalja do doma
= 2 miles + 15 miles + 1,33 miles - 157 miles
= -149,7 miles

Zato je John po koncu potovanja le -149,7 miles od doma."

So, let's see... if Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10, that means her total earnings for those 40 hours would be $400 ($10/hour x 40 hours). And then, if she works additional 5 hours at a higher rate (1.2 times her regular hourly rate), her total earnings for the week would be $560 ($400 + ($400 x 1.2)). So, her total earnings for the week would be $960 ($400 + $560)."

Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what's her annual salary?

Let T = number of teaching hours per week
Let C = number of coaching hours per week

T = 35 (weeks) x 35 (hours/week) = 1,275 (teaching hours/year)
C = 15 (weeks) x 15 (hours/week) = 225 (coaching hours/year)

Total hours worked per year = T + C = 1,275 + 225 = 1,500 (hours/year)

Annual salary = Total hours worked x Hourly wage
= 1,500 (hours/year) x $20 (hourly wage for teaching)
= $30,000 (annual salary for teaching)

Additional income from coaching = Total hours worked x Coaching hourly wage
= 225 (hours/year) x $30 (hourly wage for coaching)
= $6,750 (additional income from coaching)

Annual salary including coaching = Annual salary for teaching + Additional income from coaching

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.  She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.  After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?

To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to multiply the number of servings she consumes each day by the number of days she has been consuming ice cream. In this case, Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so she has consumed 60 servings in 60 days (1 serving/night x 60 nights).

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of ice cream that Cynthia has spent over these 60 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of servings she has consumed by the cost per serving. Based on the problem statement, the cost per serving is $4.00. Therefore, the total cost of ice cream that Cynthia has spent over these 60 days is:

Total Cost = Number of Servings x Cost per Serving
= 60 servings x $4.00 per serving
= $240.00

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent a total of $240.00 on ice cream."

Razlog:  To calculate Marcy's annual pension, we need to consider two factors: (1) the value of her pension before she became eligible for a percentage of it, and (2) the percentage of the value of the pension that she is entitled to receive each year after becoming eligible. 
The value of Marcy's pension before she became eligible is $50,000/year x 40 years = $2,000,000.
After 20 years of working at the company, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension per year. So, the value of her pension after 20 years is $2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000/year.
Therefore, Marcy's total annual pension after 30 years of work is: $2,000,000 + ($100,000 x 10 years) = $675,000/year."
"Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out how much Aleena was charged in each half of the year and then add those amounts together. Let's assume that the first half of the year lasted from January to June, and the second half lasted from July to December.

In the first half of the year, Aleena was charged the initial amount of $140 + (10% of $140) = $156. So, she paid $156 in the first half of the year.

In the second half of the year, Aleena was charged $140 - (10% of $140) = $126. So, she paid $126 in the second half of the year.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $156 + $126 = $282."

Razlog:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it. We can use this formula:
distance = (gas left / distance driven) x (tank capacity / gallons per fill-up)
In this case, the gas left in Sophia's tank is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons. Since she has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank, the distance she can drive on a single tank of gas is:
distance = (8 / 100) x (12 / 4) = 375 miles
Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 375 miles on a single tank of gas."

Explanation:
Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day during the weekdays, which means she teaches a total of 25 classes (5 x 5 = 25) during the week. Each class costs $15.00, so the total amount Judy earns from teaching classes during the week is:

25 classes x $15.00 per class = $3750.00

On Saturdays, Judy teaches 8 additional classes, for a total of 33 classes (8 x 4 = 33) during the weekend. The calculation remains the same:

33 classes x $15.00 per class = $5050.00

Therefore, Judy makes a total of $8800.00 ($3750.00 + $5050.00) in one week."

Greg's alarm rings three times a day and each time it rings, it continues to ring until he turns it off. Let's break down how many times the alarm rang today based on the information given in the problem:

1. First time the alarm went off, it rang four times. So, the alarm rang 4 times.
2. Second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times longer than the first time. If the alarm rang for X times the first time, then it will ring for 3X times as long as the first time. Since the alarm rang for 4 times the first time, it will ring for 12 times (3X) the second time. So, the alarm rang 12 times the second time.
3. Third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. If the alarm rang for Y times the second time, then it will ring for Y/2 times as long as the second time. Since the alarm rang for 12 times the second time, it will ring for 6 times (Y/2) the third time.

Now, let's add up the number of times the alarm rang for each time it went off:

4 times + 12 times + 6 times = 9 times

Therefore, the alarm rang 9 times today."

Pričakujemo da će biti nekoliko kriterija koji ćete koristiti za reševanje ovog problema:

1. Množina se mora povećati za polovinu volumena kada se kanali čuvari u sauci. To znači da je volumen originalnih 16 ounce (475 ml) kanala polovinski manji nakon što su ovi kanali pretvoreni u saucu.
2. Svaki kanal čuva tri tomate. Ovo kaže nam da je ukupan broj tomata koji su bili u originalnim kanalima 3 x 16 = 48 tomata.
3. Nakon što su kanali pretvoreni u sauce, ostaje 32 ounce (907 ml) sauca. To znači da je volumen sauca jednaka polovini volumnom originalnih kanala.

Korištenjem primera 1 i 3, možemo izračunati kolikih tomata je Freda upotrijebila:

Volumen originalnog kanala = 16 ounce (475 ml)
Polovina volumena originalnog kanala = 8 ounce (237 ml)
Broj tomata u originalnom kanalu = 3 x 16 = 48 tomata
Nakon pretvarivanja u sauce, ostaje 32 ounce (907 ml) sauca

Množimo broj tomata sa polovinom volumena originalnog kanala:
48 tomata × 8 ounce/can = 384 tomata

Ovo je ukupan broj tomata koji su bili u originalnim kanalima. Sada imamo dovoljan informacija za odgovor na vprašanje: Koliko je Freda upotrijebila tomata?

Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total revenue and then subtract the total cost of the materials. The total revenue is calculated by multiplying the number of boards sold by their price per board. For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, this would be $10 x 10 = $100. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, it would be $16 x 5 = $80. So the total revenue is $100 + $80 = $180. Next, we subtract the total cost of the materials from the total revenue to find the profit. In this case, the total cost of the materials is $10 x 10 = $100 (for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 = $180 (for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards). Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $180 - $100 = $80.

"Response:  $X per day

A hospital sees 500 people a day. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. The doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour. To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total time spent with each patient and multiply it by the rate charged to the hospital. Then, we subtract the cost of providing that care to determine the profit.
Total time = Number of patients/Day x Average length of visit (minutes)
= 500/day x 24/hour = 12,000 minutes/day
Rate charged to hospital ($/hour) = $150/hour
Cost of providing care = Rate charged to hospital x Total time
= $150/hour x 12,000 minutes/day = $180,000/day
Profit = Revenue - Cost of providing care
= $200/hour x 12,000 minutes/day - $180,000/day

Jordan's daily video game time is 2 hours, so the number of hours he spends playing video games per week is:

2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

If Jordan works at his part-time job for the same amount of time he spends playing video games, then he will earn:

14 hours/week x $10/hour = $140/week

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn $140 per week."
"Response: 56.80

Answer: $56.80

Explanation:
John bought the following items:

* Milk: $2
* Eggs: $3
* Light bulbs: $3
* Cups: $3
* Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items = $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $17

Tax on non-food items = $17 x 10% = $1.70

Total cost of all items including tax = $17 + $1.70 = $18.70

Therefore, everything cost John $56.80 ($18.70 + $36.10)."

Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach their house. Let's use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. For Steve: Time = 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 7 minutes For Tim: Time = 2 miles / 264 ft/min = 8 minutes Since Steve has a longer distance to cover, he will take longer to reach his house. So, the winner will arrive at their house after 7 + 8 = 15 minutes.

Answer: $10.75
Explanation:
On the first day, 5 people brought bicycles and each tire cost $0.25 to inflate, so total revenue from them was $5 x 4 = $20. Then, 3 people brought tricycles and each tire cost $0.25, so total revenue from them was $3 x 3 = $9. So, total revenue for the day was $20 + $9 = $29. Since there were also 1 person who rode a unicycle, let's assume they paid $0.25 per tire as well (since it's a smaller wheel), so their payment was $0.25. Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day was $29 + $0.25 = $30."

Pričakujemo da bi Billova proizvodnja balkovala tako dolgo, sa 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. For each roll, it's 4 inches long, so there are 4 x 300 = 1200 inches of rolls. Similarly, for each croissant, it's 6 inches long, so there are 6 x 120 = 720 inches of croissants. And for each baguette, it's two feet long, so there are 2 x 60 = 120 inches of baguettes.

Adding up all these lengths gives us a total length of 1200 + 720 + 120 = 1380 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this to feet by dividing by 12: 1380 / 12 = 110 feet. So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they would be approximately 110 feet long."

Pričakuje se, da bo Jackie imela večjo količino denarja, če jo accountant pomaga pri opravljanju proračuna. To lahko razložimo z izračunom količine denarja, ki bi bila dostipna, ko bi uporabila računalnik za opravljanje proračuna samostojno, ter slednji primerjem s ceno accountanta.

Ker Jackie izgubi 3 ur freelance dela, ko opravlja proračune samostojно, bo izgubila $35/urno v nepovratnih izgubah. Torej, če opravlja proračune samostojno, bo moralka izgubiti skupaj $35 x 3 = $105.

Cena accountanta je $90, zato če bi uporabila accountanta, bo moralka dodatno prejela $90 - $105 = -$15.

Zato moramo odgovoriti na vprašanje takole:

More money (if she hires an accountant) = $90 - $15 = $75

Tako lahko rečemo, da bo Jackie imela večjo količino denarja, če jo accountant pomaga pri opravljanju proračuna."

There are 6 possible outings for the die, and 2 of them are greater than 3 (4, 5, 5, 6). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 2/6 = 0.33 or 33%.
To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, there are only 3 even numbers on the die (2, 4, 6), so there are 3 x 2 = 6 possibilities for this to happen. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 6/6 = 1 or 0%."

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. If she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much will be Janeth's remaining balance by then? To find out, we need to calculate the total amount that Janeth needs to pay over the course of the loan. We can do this by multiplying the original principal amount ($2000) by the number of payments (12):
Total Amount = Principal x Number of Payments
= $2000 x 12
= $24,000
Since Janeth agreed to pay an additional 10% of the principal amount as interest, we need to subtract this amount from the total amount paid:
Interest Paid = Total Amount x Interest Rate
= $24,000 x 10/100
= $2,400
Now we can find Janeth's remaining balance after making 12 payments of $165 each:
Remaining Balance = Total Amount - Interest Paid
= $24,000 - $2,400
= $21,600
So, by the end of the 12th payment, Janeth's remaining balance will be $873.49 ($21,600 / 12)."

Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them. How much does he pay for everything?

To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees.

Total cost of cars = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000
Tax = $240,000 x 10% = $24,000
Registration fee = $240,000 x $1000 = $24,000
Total amount paid by Mark = $240,000 + $24,000 + $24,000 = $348,000

Therefore, Mark pays $348,000 for everything."

Mike has been a penpal with 5 people for the past year. Each person sends him 2 letters per week, which are 5 pages long. Since Mike replies to each letter in kind, he spends an equal amount of time writing as he receives. Therefore, if it takes him 1 minute to write a page, he spends 10 minutes (1 minute x 5 pages) writing each week.
To calculate how many hours Mike spends writing per week, we need to convert the number of minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:
480 minutes / 60 = 8 hours per week
Therefore, Mike spends 8 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals."

Tuesday: Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies.
Now, let's find out how many calories Sue consumed compared to her sister:
On Monday, Sue ate 20 cookies and her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue consumed 20 - 5 = 15 more calories than her sister.
On Tuesday, Sue ate 26 cookies and her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue consumed 26 - 13 = 13 more calories than her sister.
Therefore, Sue consumed 15 + 13 = 28 more calories than her sister."
