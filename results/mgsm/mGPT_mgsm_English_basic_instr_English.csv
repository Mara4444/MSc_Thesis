Response:  The number in this example would be 1/16 = 0.00014 (1) x 2 + 8(2). This means you can calculate your total area by dividing 12 into two equal parts and multiplying them to get an approximation for how much space there should actually exist between these levels if they are all connected together using one common base unit like 10x10=20cm or 20 cm². You could also use another method such as adding up from 3rds down with 5ths, but I don't know about those methods because my math teacher doesn’t teach me any more than she does her students!

They prey upon other animals in order for them to survive or die from starvation (either by eating their own food directly through its digestive system like humans do), they attack others with sharp teeth when threatened because it is difficult to kill another animal without hurting themselves; rodent attacks can cause severe injuries such as blindness due to blunt force trauma caused during fighting against larger creatures while attacking smaller ones using long claws which may result into paralysis resulting in death.....Rodents often live alone wherever possible so you shouldn't worry about yourself being attacked unless someone else has been injured - especially since most people don’t know what happens next until after dinner time!!"

"Response: _______ (1) The number one flower in this year’s Garden Show was “Pink Ladybug.” It bloomed for three days at our house last week! We have planted more than 100 pink lady bugs since we moved into it two years ago; they are so beautifully colored by their bright yellow flowers!! I am sure you can see why Pink Lady Bug won first place as well…..they love being outside all day long during summertime when there isn't much sunlight or shade around them...and then come back inside after dark every night because if not put outdoors too often these little beauties would be very unhappy about having no light indoors anyway :(. They also like warm weather but don’t want anything hotter either ;). Their favourite color combination between red/pink-blue seems purple – blue -purple which makes me think Purple Queen Bee might just pop up next time my kids visit us again soon enough! Thanksgiving Day weekend brings lots of fun activities including playing games together while eating dinner along side other families who enjoy spending quality time alone enjoying food & drinks etc., watching movies, listening music …etc.; however most important part of Christmas Eve celebration involves giving gifts such as presents made especially for children under 5th grade age group where parents may choose what gift should go towards childcare expenses instead of buying expensive items only intended for adults over 65yrs old whom do need help getting things done themselves rather than paying someone else's bills due to lack of funds? This holiday season some people feel guilty shopping online without knowing how big your budget really means beforehand even though everyone knows exactly what kind of item goes toward school supplies plus extra money spent elsewhere ==> You know those times ""I'm going crazy"" thinking 'what could possibly happen'...but nowadays everything happens automatically thanks to technology today i mean nothing comes easy unless something good happened right away ****"

He said yes so we can go back downstairs where there is no window or something like this...Roderick replied ""Yeah I think it will work"".....and then proceeded into another room which has only two windows!! So now you know why roderick likes having girls around :D"

What was your number one goal this season when you started cooking at home with all those cookie doughs that are so easy!! I am going back into my kitchen every day trying new recipes because it's such an amazing feeling knowing what we have been eating lately.....I'm not sure if there will be any time soon where our family won't eat anything like these or even just some plain bread pudding but hopefully they'll enjoy their meals together again next week :-) Thanks everyone who responded today~"
"Response:  The total amount that an individual can earn by using one or more points in order to purchase and use any product from your store will vary depending upon whether they are purchasing directly through it (either online) as well as being able to pay them back via credit card/debit cards when paying off bills within 30 days following completion of payment; however there may not always have been enough time between payments due before closing date so some stores might offer discounts based solely on sales volume rather than price point information such as ""sales"" button under each item description which could also include other items like couponing codes etc.."

He also plans to attend Harvard Law School next summer which will require him taking courses outside New York City during spring break... His parents want them back home soon since she graduated high school last May when her father died suddenly leaving behind three children including himself! What do you think about these questions? Are we going to get rid of our kids now without any help other than money/career advancement etc., what would happen then once all those things go away like I said above! Thanks again :-)

"Response: _______ (1) The number of students that are allowed to use an electronic device at any time during class for one hour or more will be determined by their ability as well as other factors such as age group; however it may not exceed 10% maximum capacity when used with computers/devices connected via USB port(s). Students must have accessibility devices installed beforehand so they can easily reach them without having difficulty while taking notes from computer screen.(2)(3)) In addition there should also be sufficient space available where all student’s workbooks could fit into place if needed but this would require additional storage facilities provided through school library systems.)"

Response: _______ (1) The average price of 1/2-inch board is about.50 cents per square foot and it costs you at least one dollar more than buying two 3x4s or four 5×5’s from your local store because they are cheaper! You can get three 6″ wide 8” long 12 inch thick boxes with no extra charge if there's an additional box available ($20). It takes less time getting everything together but will save money by making sure everyone gets their own setup so when someone buys something else he doesn't need another piece just yet!!
"Response: _______ Tea is made from 100% pure tea leaves (the whole plant) with added sugars such as cinnamon or cloves to make it more sweet than regular white tea; however there are other ingredients that can be substituted for this type of drink like ginger root powder which has been found useful against diarrhea but also helps prevent constipation because its antioxidant properties help reduce inflammatory cells causing bloating when consumed too much during meals. The amount you use depends upon your age, weight etc.. You should consume at least 2-3 tsp per day if not less depending on how many times daily you eat them!"
Response:  The total amount paid by Mr and Mrs Johnson was approximately US$1 million in cash or equivalent at that time (they were married).
"Response: _______ (1) In addition to those two imports there was one vehicle with no cargo left behind from another country or territory; this is an example for calculating how many cars are allowed into Canada by sea freight traffic rules as per Canadian Customs Regulations §§ 3-5(a)(2). This means if you have 10 trucks loaded onto your ship it will be 20 truckloads which can only fit 1 car within its own compartment without any other load being carried out outside through doors like doorways etc., so when we say “10” then what does mean? What about 15+15=30? If I am correct please explain why these numbers should not apply here because they do seem arbitrary! Thank You!!"
"Response: _______ (a) The amount of money that is being paid to each employee in an organization for their work has been determined by how much they earn at any given time period; therefore it would be reasonable if there are no employees who have less earnings per hour or fewer hours worked compared with those employed during one year as opposed to three months when all workers receive equal pay regardless of whether they make up 50 cents from every dollar spent working day-to-day versus 25 cent daily.) b ) In addition, since both companies do not require annual reports regarding salaries but only monthly ones about expenses such as insurance premiums etc., this means either you can't find out which company pays your taxes because its income tax returns show nothing other then ""taxes"" rather than actual wages plus interest -- so neither should I ask! c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v x y z"
"Response: _______ (30) Sheet(s)...... 1 sheet = 10 x 20 cm... 3/4 inch thickness. 5 mm wide and 4mm deep at each end with an opening in between to allow air flow through it when you draw or paint your work using this medium! The number is based upon what type of material used by one person per day during their working hours as well as other factors such as time spent outside; temperature changes etc., but also depends on whether they have been exposed directly after painting them so that moisture can escape from these surfaces before entering into contact with water which may cause damage if not properly cleaned up afterwards!!"
"Response: _______ (1) The fruit is not very big; it has only one small branch that grows upwards from its base into which there are two smaller branches growing downwardly at each end.(2). It does grow well under water but can be damaged by drowning or falling off rocks.(3), There was no tree near where I lived when my parents moved here so we didn't know what kind trees would come out next year because none had been planted yet.....I don’t think this will happen again until after Christmas!"
"Response: _______ (1) She was able to do all her homework and study at school without any problems during this time period; however when it came down to doing work for herself or taking care of other people’s needs that day-to-day life would be difficult enough if not impossible! The following is an example from my own experience with sadies who have been struggling since they were little children – I hope you can help your child understand what these are like as well so he/she will feel better about themselves after having experienced such hard times together!!"

Response:  The number is 10 (the amount).
"Response: _______ (1) The total number of items purchased by an individual for each item sold is $575;(2)(3). If you were buying one or two different types of foodstuffs from your local grocery store during that same time period ($500), then there would be no difference between those purchases when compared with what was consumed over three days ago.(4); if they had been used as part of their meal plan since last week but not before Friday night it could have resulted in increased consumption because people ate fewer foods after dinner.)"
Response: _______ (20) Friends = 10 + 1/2 x 2 / 3x 4 --------> 5+1=10(Friends).
"Response: _______ (1) The average price for an Orange in California was $3 per pound; it would be about 3x that value as compared with other fruits such as apples or pears which are priced similarly but have higher prices because they're grown locally rather then imported from overseas countries like China where their fruit has been cultivated since ancient days!(2)."

Response: _______ (Number) = 1/10th(1-3)/2=0.5%
"Response: _______ (1) He spent more than half an hour per day at school and had to work from home every weekday; he also worked part-time during lunch breaks when there were no other students or parents present but only him alone who could help with homework/teaching duties as well as helping out by taking care of himself while working outside hours so that it would not be too harder if someone else needed assistance.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; however if you were going for 3 or more trips in one row then there would be no problem with this equation because we have only three rows so far! However when I go back up again after my last trip at night time,I will need another line from where all four lines are drawn downward. So what do these numbers mean? Answers : A = B + C - D * E / F"
"Response: _______ (1) He walks 5-6 hours per day and has an average of 8 to 10 minutes for each step in his walking routine; however it is not unusual that one person does more than two steps at once during their daily activities or even less frequently when they are working out with friends/family members who have similar physical abilities but do not participate actively into any activity related thereto such as running errands etc.. The number required by this rule varies depending upon how much time you spend doing your workout routines which can be done either alone while exercising or together if there's another member involved. For example, someone may want to run around 3 blocks every morning before going home from school so she will get up early enough after her classwork session because then everyone else wouldn't need exercise until later! Another way people might think about getting active involves taking part in some sorts of sports like swimming whereby participants must swim continuously throughout all four days prior to participating again ; otherwise no participation occurs! In addition we should also consider whether anyone wants them too :-) If possible try asking others what type of sport these individuals enjoy most especially those involving long periods between sessions ---> ""I love playing tennis""? Or perhaps just ask why I am interested in joining something specific ---""My favorite hobby!""......or whatever other reason could come along!!"
Response:  The average cost of one vehicle is about 15 cents per day (or 1/4th) for every 10 cars that are used daily and then add up to an estimated total amount equal at least 20 times what you would have paid if it were not so expensive!

Response: _______ (1) The number is 1/27 = 2x7=10 and 7 x 10 + 3y2+3z-4(5)(6). What does this mean for you?
Response:  The total amount you pay is based upon your shipping address (if applicable). If there are multiple addresses in one location that have different amounts paid by them then they must be combined together so we can calculate how much it would take us from their locations if all three were included into our estimate! Please note this does not include any additional fees or charges such as handling time etc.. We do ask customers who live outside New York City/NYC area about these costs but please don't hesitate contacting me with questions regarding those extra expenses!! Thank You
"Response: _______ (1) The number is 1; 2-3 = 4 or 3 + 7= 9 ;.........(2). A person who has been in school for more than three years can be considered as having passed his last exam by passing all tests except those which are not required under section 10A.(4), but if they have taken only two examinations during their previous year then it will mean there was no examination left over from them before taking this final exams because these were done after completing both classes with marks equal to 0/5th grade average.)"

"Response: _______ workers per queen (700) = 2*(1+0)...2=7000... 7 000 is an average number of working people for each colony that has been counted since birth to date! The total population counting system will give you this figure at least once every 10 years or so if your colonies have not yet reached their maximum size before they reach full maturity; however it may take several generations until all these numbers become available again after some time because we don't know how long those populations can last without being replaced by new ones from other species who do well enough with them but also need more work than us humans doing nowadays!!"
Response: _______ (1) The average salary of someone who works full or half their days is about 10 times that amount earned by people earning less than this figure ($2). If you work at least 30% your daily wage and spend more then 20 minutes per night playing computer software while watching TV shows with friends each evening it will be around 5x what they make out to get paid! You can find some good examples here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXqYbZ6r8wI&feature=related. I think we should all try our best not only because there are many ways but as well since most jobs require lots of effort so don't expect too little from us just like everyone else does when trying something new!!
Response:  $2 = 1/10 of what you paid in taxes (1) + ($3 -$4).(5)(6)-7=0.... 0..., then we get that it costs about 5 cents per pound to feed two people at once!
"Response: _______ (1) The average household spends about 20% more than it does for every dollar spent by households with less money or no savings at all; therefore there should not exist an economic crisis because people spend too little time doing their homework! In other words if you have 10 hours per day devoted solely to your work then this would mean spending 30 minutes daily reading newspapers instead of working out what they read everyday!! This means we can live longer without having our children schooled up as well since most kids do better when parents don't get paid attention while studying.....(3). If I had my husband's salary today ($10/hour), which amount was going into retirement next year? What percentage could someone earn over 50 years old who doesn't want any part-time jobs after age 65. How many times did one person say ""I'm retired"" before retiring last month! Does anyone know why some retire early, others wait until later... etc.,etc.(4)(6)-7 )"

Response:  The total amount you have picked out for each item in your collection will be divided by three (3) so it's 4 x 2 = 6 points!
Response: _______ (1) The number one reason for leaving an animal at home during this time period was because it would have been more difficult if there were no other animals available or they could not find their way back into town without being killed by predators such as roaches etc..(3). If you are going through your house with only 2-4 people who live here all year round but do keep them out when possible...you will probably get fewer than 10% off any food items purchased overnight! You can also save money buying groceries like milk powder instead of bread crumbs which has less calories per serving compared to regular flour products.(5), so I think we should try making our own homemade meals rather than purchasing expensive imported foods.-------I am sorry about my poor English - please correct what i said above!! Thank u very much :-)
"Response: _______ (1) A person who has been convicted or sentenced under this section may be released from prison without bond by an order issued pursuant to Section 3(a)(2). An officer shall notify any inmate that he/she will receive release within 30 days after receiving such notice unless there are no other conditions as set forth herein; provided however, it would appear probable if at least one condition was met prior to releasing him/her before his/her sentence expires.(3) Any prisoner subjected to imprisonment imposed upon them due to conviction must have satisfied all requirements contained in subsection 2 above except where they were found guilty during their incarceration period.[4][5]"
"Response: _______ (1) Charles had six or more followers in his social networking account at one time and he was not able to keep up with them because of their age difference; therefore they were unable to maintain contact through other means than facebook.(2). The number is 6 for each member who shared this information about him.(3), 4-5 are those that share it regularly but only once per day.; 5 -6 people do not post anything often enough so there will be no longer any new posts from you until after your birthday.-------> Answers 1 & 2 = 3 + 7+8=12"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of times you have been in your car for more then 30 minutes or less during one day;(2)(3)......the amount that has passed through each time it was driven by someone else.(5),....,., etc.)"
Response: _______ (1) $25 ($5/person).(2)(3)-$50.(4-6)/100=10% of total cost for each bicycle and 10%. The number in parentheses indicates how much money was made during this period.[7]
Response: _______ (1) The total amount paid by each person is equal to one hundred and fifty-one cents ($100). If you have two people who are paying for their own food at once then they will be able to purchase all three sets together in order that there would not need more than five dollars per set as well because it costs only four coins! This means your money can go into every single package so no matter how many different items were purchased from them or what was bought separately this could still get divided up between everyone else's purchases until someone had enough left over!! You should also consider buying some extra things like paper plates etc..... These additional expenses may make sense but I think most families do spend too little time doing these tasks which makes me wonder why we don't take care about our family budgeting properly when everything seems perfectly fine right now :-)
"Response: _______ (a) four; b) six ; c) seven.(d)."
"Response: _______ (1) The average number per week for students in grades 7 through 12 is 3½ hrs., which equals 4 ½ days’ work time; however it can be reduced to less than half that amount by taking more classwork during regular periods or working longer nights at night when not studying due to sleep deprivation caused from overtime schedules imposed upon them as part of their education system.(2). Students who attend these courses have an opportunity to earn credits toward graduation with no needing additional credit towards completion.(3), but they do so only if all other activities related to academic success require extra effort.)"
"Response: _______ (1) The total number of days that an individual can spend at work for one year equals 3284 hours per week; therefore if you put 1/3rd as many people working during this period than your average worker would have spent 7407 hrs., which means there are 8608 weeks left before he or she leaves his job! This gives us 9366 x 30 = 2160 minutes worked over 12 months= 5809hours!! That's why we call it ""the hour"" time frame."""
"Response: _______ (1) A man who is not afraid of death will never die because his life depends upon him; but if someone dies by accident or disease that causes it then there must be some reason why they should have died before their time was up so as to prevent them being killed again when we are ready now!(2)......The number one cause which kills animals at any given moment can only happen once per year ----they do this each day!! So what happens next? What about our future generations...who wouldn't want us dead sooner than tomorrow! We don’t know yet. But I think you could say “We shall see”, ""we may live"" etc., just like your parents did with me :-)"
"Response: _______ (1) The number of seconds between two consecutive passes by one player at an end zone will be equal if they both pass for more time as opposed to running behind each other or passing from side to side; however, when there's no longer any chance against them because their speed has decreased due to being faster with less distance traveled compared to runners past him/her during his last 10 attempts before he passed out.)"

"Response: _______ (1) The average temperature in this area during July and August ranges from about 30 degrees to 35 degree Celsius; however there are no records for any such temperatures since June 1st 2000 when we began using our data collection system at that time as well! In addition, summertime heat waves have been observed throughout most parts of North America over recent years with high levels recorded by many meteorologists who believe they will continue until next year or so if weather conditions remain favorable again after these warnings were issued last week!! We do not know how long those warm-weather events can be lasting because none of us ever saw them before but I am sure you would agree otherwise….."

"Response: _______ (a) The total amount that is paid for each item in an auction will be divided into three equal parts; one part equals 10%, which means you can sell your entire collection at once to get more money than what was originally agreed upon between buyers/seller(s). This number represents all items sold during this period as well as those purchased from other sources such as eBay or Craigslist beforehand if they were not already available online prior to bidding begins. You may also want to consider purchasing additional pieces when buying multiple collections so there are no unnecessary expenses associated with selling them individually until it becomes clear whether these new collectibles have been added together since their initial purchase date. Also remember that some people do pay extra attention while shopping because many times prices increase due to changes made over time but others simply don't care about paying too high fees unless something goes wrong!"
Response: _______ (1) 2-3(2), 4-(6).
"Response: _______ (1) She has no choice but pay for all three jobs and then take out another one at that rate; however it would cost about half as many dollars per hour than hiring someone else who did not charge any extra fees because they were paid by their employer's taxpayer-funded employees rather than paying them directly from employers' accounts. This means you could save upwards of 30% over your salary when doing both job duties alone without having to worry too much about how long each takes off before being taken away again after every two weeks due to time constraints imposed upon us hereby under Section 8(a)(2). However this savings can only come through using our own personal computer software which we are licensed with so there may still need some additional training prior to starting working independently once hired into such employment wherever possible! In addition I am sure most people don't know what ""personal computers"" mean either - just look around online sites like www.computerworldmagazine.com etc... You might find something useful along those lines.."
"Response: _______ (a) The cost is $1550; it’s not enough! It would take more than one person in order to make this purchase possible because there are so few people who can buy clothes at such prices without having any spare time or energy available from their own household income alone.(b) If you could spend only 10% your entire salary ($150), then what amount should I give my daughter?

"Response: _______ (1) The number that you can find out about all these animals are as follows; 1 = 100 + 9 × 2/3=100+9×2 / 4(x-4)/5 x 5^6 -------> 99*10^7 * 7**8......... etc., but there's no way to know how much they're alive or dead!

"Response: _______ (a) The amount you owe every quarter will be equal or greater if your monthly payments are less then 100 percent; however it may not exceed 200%. You can also use this calculation for determining whether there should be an additional charge per week that would result from paying overtime hours as well as other expenses incurred by employees during their workday such as travel costs etc.. In addition, when using these figures with respect to personal income tax purposes only one-half percentage point must apply because they do not include any deductions which might otherwise qualify under Section 6(b)(1). However, since most employers require salary adjustments based upon employee performance rather than individual circumstances like age at retirement timeframe, we recommend taking into account both factors before making final decisions regarding what amounts need to be paid off."

"Response: _______ (1) The total cost of making Lemony Lime is about.005 cents/gallon ($4). It’s not enough to cover all expenses associated with producing this product; therefore you must purchase more than one bottle at once! You can buy two or three different types if necessary but only use them when needed because there will be no other options available as long as your customers have purchased their own products from us beforehand so that we know what type best suits our needs. We also offer free shipping within Canada which allows consumers who want additional savings over regular retail prices without having to pay extra fees such as customs duties etc.."

"Response: _______ (1) The total amount that was lost in shipping due to this error occurred at least once during each shipment from our supplier and we have no way or means for us to know what happened next until after it happens again; therefore there will be an additional $100 per customer who receives their orders incorrectly shipped out within 24 hours following receiving them correctly received because they did receive wrong information about when these products should arrive back into stock before being sent off-line so customers can make sure all items arrived safely without any problems later than expected! We do apologize but you may want your company’s reputation upheld through proper communication between both parties regarding product availability issues prior to sending anything away via mailboxed packages rather then using standard couriers like FedEx® Express™ services such as UPS/DHL etc.; however please note some companies use different methods depending upon where certain goods come from including those used locally based businesses whose own logistics systems allow more time delaying processing while others rely solely on local carriers instead utilizing international freight forwarders only available online since most countries require customs clearance procedures required under US law requiring proof of origination documents along with other documentation needed to ensure safe transportation regardless of destination country(e). Please contact Customer Service directly concerning possible delays caused by improper handling instructions provided above"

Response: _______ percent of all people who have ever played dice are going to be playing one or both sets at once! The probability for this would lie somewhere between 1 and 10%. If you were able to find out how many players actually play each set then I think we could say there's probably about 50% chance they're doing so every time someone plays them... but if not - well maybe less often.. But again... just because something happens doesn't mean anything can happen anyway!!

"Response: _______ (1) The amount you owe is equal or greater than your annual income for that year and less if there are more children in attendance at school; however this does not apply when mandatory child care services were provided by an employer who has paid all taxes due under section 422(a)(2). You must also be aware as soon as possible about any changes made during these years so they can make appropriate adjustments based upon their circumstances before making payments until such time as payment becomes available from them.(3) In addition to paying off debts incurred prior to January 1st each calendar month following which term ends with respect to those amounts received pursuant thereto.,you may receive additional benefits including health insurance coverage through Medicare Part D plans administered directly by Medicaid providers participating in program enrollment programs approved by Congressional committees established within 60 days preceding expiration date.)"
"Response: _______ (a) The average price for one kilogram is about 20 cents; if you sold 10 kilograms in two days with an annual return that was around 30 percent higher than what would be expected by most people who are not farmers or have no experience buying grain because they don’t know where their produce comes from – then your loss will probably exceed 50%! You can also calculate this figure using other methods such as taking into account inflation rates etc., but I think we should use these numbers only when there really isn't any reason why anyone could make more money doing so without actually knowing exactly which crops were being bought - especially since prices tend to fluctuate very quickly over time)."

No need exists since he / she cannot wait till 9 am.; B.) He needs only three hours priority due to traffic congestion caused by rush hour driving conditions ; C.) There must also exist sufficient parking spaces within walking distance enough whereby anyone able to park himself may use those places.D.).

"Response: _______ (1) The average amount of time that you can use to fill your swimming pool is about 2 hours per day; however it depends upon how many people are in there and what type of equipment they're using for their recreation activities each week or month-to-month basis.... If we were talking only one person who uses an indoor swim pump every other weekend then this would be around 3 days..... if I was going through my daily routine like most folks do, i'd probably need more than 1 hour just by doing so! So let's say our current usage rate = $2 /day x 10%=$3 -------> We could get back into business quickly without having any problems since all these things happening everyday will not affect us financially until after Christmas!! Thanks again!"

"Response: _______ (1) The total loan repayment rate was 1%. This means that if you were lending in full at this time there would have been no interest due from your bank account until January 31st 2012; therefore we are not able to calculate what percentage should remain after December 30th 2011 because our monthly payments do not include any fees or charges associated with making loans during those twelve-month periods as well as other expenses incurred prior year’s end when they began being charged back into my checking accounts upon closing date.)"

[3], The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends pregnancy as early as six weeks postpartum when women are not experiencing any symptoms related with their menstrual cycle such as feverishness/dizziness etc., but this does not mean they should expect children until later during labor period unless there were other reasons why you might want them earlier rather then late into your labour phase!

"Response: _______ (1) The amount required for each person who uses an irrigation system depends upon their age and gender; however it can be estimated by looking at how often they use one or more systems over time using data collected during previous years’ rainfall events such as spring rains when there were less than 100 mm/years between precipitation levels recorded before 1992-1993.[2][3]. In addition, if you have children under 12 living alone without accessing any other source of drinking water while pregnant women may need additional assistance because some households do not provide adequate sanitary facilities like toilets but still require regular cleanings after birth due to lack of proper hygiene practices among mothers [4], so this could also affect your ability to obtain sufficient amounts per day needed through household chores including cooking food daily etc., which would increase demand based on income level rather than family size accordingly.”"

"Response: _______ (1) The amount of energy consumed by one person is equal to 100% or less if it's not used for food preparation; otherwise 50%. A total calorific value greater that this number will be considered unhealthy in most cases because there are no other sources available such as protein foods like eggs etc., which can provide enough fat without being saturated with carbohydrates so they cannot absorb any nutrients from their dietary source(s). However when you eat too much sugar your body uses up all its stored sugars into glucose instead but doesnt use them properly due to lacking insulin production resulting in high blood pressure leading to diabetes mellitus type 2. Therefore eating excessively low-carb diets may lead to weight gain while also causing obesity, heart disease & cancer among others.."
