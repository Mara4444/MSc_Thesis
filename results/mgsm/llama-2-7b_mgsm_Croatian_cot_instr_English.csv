"Response: 
Janet lays 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 cakes for her friends every day.
So, she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left after breakfast.
She sells these remaining eggs at the farmer's market for $2 each.
Therefore, she earns $2 x 13 = $26 per day from selling eggs at the farmer's market."
Response:  We need 2 blue threads and half as many white threads. So we need 2/2 = 1 blue thread and (3/2) = 1.5 white threads. Therefore, we need 4 threads in total: 2 blue and 1.5 white.
Response:  The original value of the house was $80,000 and after renovation it increased to $130,000 (150% increase). So, if he invested $50,000 in repairs, his profit would be: Profit = Original Value - Investment = $130,000 - $50,000 = $80,000. Therefore, he earned $80,000.
"Response:  If James runs three sprints per week and each sprint is 60 meters long, then he will run a total of:

3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week

So, in one week, James will run a total distance of:

9 x 60 = 540 meters

Therefore, James will run a total distance of 540 meters per week."
Response:  We know that each day, Wendi feeds her birds three mixed bowls of food containing seeds, glitter, and vegetables to keep them healthy. She gives her chickens 15 bowls of food in the morning and another 25 bowls in the evening. If Wendi has 20 chickens, how many bowls of food should she give them in their last meal of the day? Solution: To find out how many bowls of food Wendi should give her chickens in their last meal of the day, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of food she will give them throughout the day. In the morning, she gives them 15 bowls, and in the evening, she gives them 25 more. Therefore, the total number of bowls of food she will give them is: 15 + 25 = 40 bowls. So, Wendi should give her chickens 40 bowls of food in their last meal of the day.
Response:  If one cup of coffee costs $5, then each subsequent cup will cost $60% less than that, or $3 ($5 x 0.6 = $3). So, if Kylar wants to buy 16 cups of coffee, he will have to pay $48 ($3 x 16 = $48).
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times more sheep than Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse has 2 x 4 = 8 sheep more than Seattle. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is: 8 + 20 + 20 = 68 sheep.
"Response:  If Carla can normally download 2 GB per minute and it takes 40% of the time to complete the download (which is 20 minutes), then we need to calculate how long it would take for her to download 200 GB.

Time taken = Total amount / Download speed
= 200 GB / 2 GB/min
= 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes
Therefore, the answer is 1 hour and 40 minutes."
"Response:  First, we know that John travelled at a speed of 30 miles per hour for half an hour (2 sata), so he covered a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mi/h x 2 h = 60 miles
Now, let's calculate how far he was from home after the first two hours:
Distance from home = Total distance / Remaining time = 60 miles / 2 sata = 30 miles
So, John was 30 miles away from his home after the first two hours. Now, let's find out how much time it took him to cover the remaining distance:
Time taken = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 80 mi/h = 0.375 sata (or 22 minutes)
Therefore, John reached his home after 4 sata and 22 minutes."
"Response:  If Eliza works for the first 40 hours of the week (which is $40 \times 4 = 160$ dollars), and she receives overtime pay that is 1.2 times her regular hourly wage, then her total earnings are:
$$ Total = Regular + Overtime $$
We know that her regular hourly wage is $10/hour, so her overtime pay is:
$$ Overtime = 1.2 \times 10 = 12 $$
Now we can calculate her total earnings:
$$ Total = 160 + 12 = 172 $$
Therefore, Eliza earned $172 this week."
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads of the new program. If in the second month, there were three times as many downloads (60 x 3 = 180), and then in the third month, there was a 30% decrease from the previous month (180 - 30 = 135). So, the total number of downloads over the three months is: 60 + 180 + 135 = 475. Therefore, there were 475 downloads of the program in the three months.
"Response:  Toula bought 3 pieces of croissants that cost $68 per piece, 2 pieces of mini cakes that cost $80 per piece, and 6 pieces of mini cheese cakes that cost $55 per piece. Therefore, the total cost is:
$68 x 3 = $204 (croissants)
+ $80 x 2 = $160 (mini cakes)
+ $55 x 6 = $330 (mini cheese cakes)
= Total Cost = $694
Therefore, the total cost was $694."
"Response:  The cost of planting the tree is $90. In the first year, the tree will produce 7 lemons that can be sold for $1.5 each, resulting in total revenue of $10.5 ($7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon). Since there are no costs associated with producing these lemons (since they are not yet mature), Carlos's profit from selling them is $10.5. 
In subsequent years, the tree will continue to produce lemons at the same rate, but now we need to consider the annual maintenance costs of $3. So after the first year, Carlos will have an additional $3 in expenses to cover the cost of maintaining his tree. This means he will only have $7.5 in profits from selling lemons in the second year ($10.5 - $3 = $7.5). 
We can repeat this process for each subsequent year, subtracting the annual maintenance costs from the total revenue generated by the tree each year until we reach the point where Carlos begins to break even on his investment. Using this approach, I estimate it will take approximately 6 years for Carlos to begin breaking even on his investment and around 8-9 years before he starts making a significant profit from his tree."
Response:  We know that Melanie has sold 3 of her fans in the green house, and she still has 2 left. In the red house, she has sold none because it is already occupied by someone else. And in the orange house, she has also sold none because there are no fans to sell there. So, if we add up all the fans that Melanie has sold, we get: 3 + 0 + 0 = 3. Therefore, Melanie had 5 fans at the beginning.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students in the top class, 4 are enrolled in modern dance (20%). Of these, 2 are enrolled in hip-hop dance (25%), so there are 6 students in total who are enrolled in hip-hop dance. Therefore, the percentage of all students enrolled in hip-hop dance is (6/20) x 100 = 30%.
Response:  If we assume that the market price of jewelry will increase by 2.5%, then its new value after one month will be: $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125. Similarly, if we assume that the market price of electronics will increase by 1.2%, then its new value after one month will be: $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,160. Now, let's calculate the profit from each purchase: Profit from buying jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125 Profit from buying electronics = $8,160 - $8,000 = $160 Based on these calculations, the optimal choice for the trader would be to buy electronics, as it offers higher profit potential.
"Response: 
Day 1:
* Vlak A travels west for 80 miles and then turns north.
* Vlak B travels east for 80 miles and then turns south.

So, at the end of Day 1, both trains are 80 miles apart in the same direction (north).

Day 2:
* Vlak A travels north for 240 miles.
* Vlak B travels south for 240 miles.

Now they are 40 miles apart again, but this time in opposite directions.

Therefore, the distance each train traveled in two days is:
A - 80 + 240 = 320 miles
B - 80 + 240 = 320 miles

So, neither train has covered any additional distance than the other during these two days."
"Response: 
Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a coach. If she works 50 weeks per year (not including summer break), that means she works for 35 hours/week as a teacher and 15 hours/week as a coach. So her total weekly income is:
Teacher income = 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week
Coach income = 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week
Total weekly income = $700 + $450 = $1,150/week
Since Jill works for 50 weeks in a year, her annual income from teaching is:
Annual teaching income = $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year
And her annual income from coaching is:
Annual coaching income = $450/week x 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year
So Jill's overall annual income is:
Overall annual income = $57,500 + $22,500 = $80,000/year"
Response:  If Claire makes an omelette from 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she will have made a total of 3 x 21 = 63 omelettes in one month (30 days). Therefore, if she continues to make omelettes at this rate for another 4 months, she will have made a total of 63 x 4 = 252 omelettes.
Response:  If she walked for one hour to cover the first 4 miles and then another hour to cover the next 2 miles, that means she walked for a total of 2 hours. Since she walked at an average speed of 4 miles per hour during these two hours, we can calculate her distance traveled in those 2 hours as follows: Distance = Speed x Time = 4 miles/hour x 2 hours = 8 miles So, the remaining distance is 12 - 8 = 4 miles. Therefore, the answer is 4 miles.
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice and we want to add it to 15 liters of water. When we start adding the orange juice, there are 24 liters left in the container. So, after adding 10 liters of orange juice, there will be 14 liters (24 - 10) left in the container. Now, if we add another liter of orange juice, there will be 13 liters (14 - 1) left in the container. Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the container is 13 liters.
"Response:  We know that Raymon is born 6 years before Samantha and he has a son who is 23 years old when his mother is 31 years old. So, we can calculate the age of Raymond at the time his son was born as follows:
Raymond's age = 31 - 6 = 25 years old
Therefore, Raymond's son was born 25 years ago."
"Response: 
1. First 3 customers buy one DVD each, so he sells 3 DVDs in total.
2. Next two customers buy 2 DVDs each, so he sells an additional 4 DVDs (2 x 2 = 4).
3. Last three customers do not buy any DVDs, so he does not sell any more.
Total number of DVDs sold by Billy in the morning is: 3 + 4 = 7."
"Response:  The light bulb is burning for 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00). If it burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour, then it will have burned a total distance of:

Distance = Rate x Time
= 2 cm/h x 4 h
= 8 cm

So, after 4 hours, the light bulb will be 8 cm shorter."
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for last year's best-selling book and that there was a discount of 25%. So we can write an equation as follows:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26

Therefore, the original price of the book before the discount was $26."
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 

Total cost = Number of packages x Price per package + Number of apples x Price per apple + Number of oranges x Price per orange... etc.

We are given that there were 5 packets of milk, so the number of packages is 5. The price per package is $3, so the total cost of the milk is:

Cost of milk = 5 x $3 = $15

Next, we are given that there were 4 jars of jam, and each jar costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the jam is:

Cost of jam = 4 x $1.50 = $6

Finally, we are told that Marie bought several boxes of cookies, but we don't know how many she bought. However, we do know that each box costs $8.50. So, if Marie bought X boxes of cookies, her total cost will be:

Cost of cookies = X x $8.50 =?

Now, let's add up all of these costs to find out how much Marie paid in total:

Total cost = Cost of milk + Cost of jam + Cost of cookies
= $15 + $6 +?
= $21 +?
= $76

So, Marie paid a total of $76 for all of these items. To find out how many boxes of cookies she bought, we can divide the total cost by the cost of each box:

Number of boxes of cookies = Total cost / Cost of one box
= $76 / $8.50
= 9

Therefore, Marie bought 9 boxes of cookies."
"Response: 
Miška has bought 3 pairs of shoes, which cost $42 each. Therefore, he has spent $126 on shoes.
He has also bought 3 pairs of pants, and each pair costs either $16.50 or $22.50 (we don't know which). So, he has spent between $49.50 and $70.50 on pants.
Finally, he has bought 3 pairs of shirts, which cost $22.50 each. Therefore, he has spent $67.50 on shirts.
In total, Miška has spent $126 + $49.50 + $67.50 = $283 on clothing."
"Response:  If Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every evening and buys boxes with 15 portions per box at $4 per box, then she will spend:

$$ = \text{Number of evenings} \times \text{Number of portions per evening} \times \text{Cost per portion} $$
= 60 days $\div$ 2 (days in a week) $\div$ 7 (nights per week) $\div$ 1 (portion per night) $\div$ $4$ (cost per portion)
= $60 \div 14 \div 7 \div 1 \div 4 = 3840$
Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent $3840$ on ice cream."
Response:  If Henry has traveled 20 miles after his first stop and then stopped again 15 miles before the end of his journey, we can calculate how many kilometers he traveled between these two points as follows: Distance = Speed x Time + (Distance from previous stop to current stop) Where: - Speed is the average speed at which Henry was traveling (in km/h). - Time is the distance traveled after the first stop (in km). - Distance from previous stop to current stop is the distance traveled between the two stops (in km). Now let's plug in the values given in the question: Speed =? (km/h) = Total distance / Time = 20 / 20 = 1 (km/h) Time =? (km) = Distance from previous stop to current stop = 15 (km) So, Henry traveled at an average speed of 1 km/h for 20 miles (or 32 km), and then traveled another 15 miles (or 24 km) at the same speed. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Henry is: Total distance = Speed x Time + (Distance from previous stop to current stop) = 1 km/h x 32 km + 15 km = 47 km.
Response:  If Gloria buys shoes that cost $50 and then chooses between two pairs of socks that cost $33 each or $66 together, we can calculate the total cost as follows: Shoes = $50 Socks (1 pair) = $33 Total Cost = $83 Now, if she chooses to buy both pairs of socks instead of just one pair, the total cost would be: Socks (2 pairs) = $66 + $66 = $132 Total Cost = $132 Therefore, the shoes cost $83, and the two pairs of socks cost $132 in total.
Response:  We are given that Darrel is 7 years older than Allen, so their ages are 7 + 11 = 18 years apart. Therefore, their total age is 18 + 11 = 39 years. Since they have been together for 10 years, we can calculate Allen's age at time t=10 as follows: Allen's age = Total age / Time spent together = 39 / 10 = 4 years.
Response:  We know that Gunter has 80 glasses of water in his stall. His friend says he has 20 more than half of Gunter's amount, which means he has 160 glasses (half of 80 is 40). The third person says they have 25% more than Gunter, so their number is 320 (25% more than 80 is 20). Therefore, the average guess of Gunter and his friends is 270 glasses.
Response:  If John walks 10 steps per day and each step takes him 5 minutes to walk, then he spends 50 minutes walking per day (10 steps x 5 min/step). Since he does this every day, in one week he will spend 350 minutes (50 min/day x 7 days) walking for his dogs. Therefore, John spends approximately 6 hours and 10 minutes (350 min / 60 min/hour) per week taking care of his dogs.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and she has 30 more silver coins than bronze coins. So, if she has x bronze coins, then she has 3x silver coins. Therefore, we can write an equation: 110 = 3x. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 37. So, Gretchen has 37 silver coins.
Response:  We know that Siobhan has two fewer dragons than Aaron and that Aaron has five more dragons than half of Raymond's dragons. So, if Raymond has 40 dragons, then Aaron has 45 dragons (since he has five more than half of Raymond's). Now, we can find out how many dragons Siobhan has by subtracting two from Aaron's number: 45 - 2 = 43 dragons. Therefore, Siobhan has 43 dragons.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes (or 40/2 = 20 minutes), Mike scored 4 points. If he scores 25% more in the next 20 minutes, that means he scored an additional 4 x 25% = 1 point per minute. So, in total, Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the last 20 minutes. Therefore, his overall score is 4 + 5 = 9 points.
Response:  Terry buys two yogurts per day, so he spends $10/day on yogurt = $10 x 30 days = $300.
"Response:  If John sold all of his LEGO sets for $15 each and used that money to buy video games at $20 each, he would have spent a total of:

$15 x 13 = $195 (on LEGO sets)
$195 + ($20 x 8) = $470 (on video games)

So, John still has $5 left over after buying all those video games. Therefore, he must have 13 - 5 = 8 LEGO sets remaining."
"Response:  If John runs for 100 kilometers per week and he runs three days a week, then he covers a distance of 300 kilometers in one week (since each day he runs 100 kilometers). Now, let's analyze his running speed during each day:

* Day 1: He runs for 3 hours (since he runs for half an hour less than the total time available), so his average speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time = 300 km / 3 h = 100 km/h

* Days 2-3: Since he runs for half an hour less than the previous day, his average speed will be slightly lower:

Speed = Distance / Time = 300 km / (2 x 3 h) = 83.33 km/h

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of approximately 83.33 km/h."
"Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than walking speed and can jump at twice the running speed, we can write down some equations based on this information:

Running speed = x miles/hour (where x is a constant)
Jumping speed = 2x miles/hour
Walking speed = 1/4 x miles/hour

Now, let's assume that Dana spends 3 hours running, 2 hours jumping, and 1 hour walking. We can represent this as follows:

Total time = 3 hours + 2 hours + 1 hour = 6 hours

We know that Dana covers a distance of 9 miles while running, so we can write:

Distance covered while running = Total time x Running speed = 6 hours x Running speed = 54 miles

Similarly, we know that Dana jumps a distance of 18 miles in 2 hours, so we can write:

Distance covered while jumping = Total time x Jumping speed = 2 hours x Jumping speed = 36 miles

Finally, we know that Dana walks for 1 hour and covers a distance of 3 miles, so we can write:

Distance covered while walking = Total time x Walking speed = 1 hour x Walking speed = 3 miles

Now, we need to find out how much distance Dana covers in total. To do this, we add up the distances she covers while running, jumping, and walking:

Total distance covered = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while jumping + Distance covered while walking = 54 miles + 36 miles + 3 miles = 93 miles

Therefore, Dana covers a total distance of 93 miles in 6 hours."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone. So if Suzy has an iPhone that is one year old, then Ben's iPhone must be two years older than that, or two times one = two years old. Now we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, so it must be four times two = eight years old. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is eight years old.
"Response:  When Polly holds the sapphire stone, she can throw the golden arrow three times farther than when she doesn't hold it. So, if we assume that the distance from Polly to the dragon is x meters when she throws the golden arrow without holding the sapphire stone, then the distance from Polly to the dragon will be 3x meters when she throws the golden arrow while holding the sapphire stone. Now, since the dragon is 300 meters away from Polly at all times, we can set up the equation:

distance = (3x) + 300

Solving for x, we get:

x = 270

So, when Polly holds the sapphire stone and throws the golden arrow, she can stand 270 meters outside of the dragon's reachable area with her thrown weapon."
Response:  We know that Baka Jones has prepared 5 jabukastih pites for firefighting and he has cut each of them into 8 pieces. So, in total, there are 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pite. Then, we learn from the problem statement that 5 pieces of pite have been placed on a buffet table so that guests can serve themselves. This means that there are still 40 - 5 = 35 pieces of pite left after guests have taken some. Finally, we are told that there are 14 remaining pieces of pite at the end of the evening. Therefore, the number of pieces of pite taken by guests is 35 - 14 = 21.
Response:  If one serving of chips has 250 calories and you want to eat 5 servings, then the total number of calories in those 5 servings is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, that means you can safely eat 1250 - 1800 = 450 grams of chips.
Response:  If Charlie sells each candle for $2, he will make $2 x 20 = $40 from selling 20 candles. However, he also paid $10 per kilogram of beeswax and $10 per cone, so his total cost was $10 + $10 + $10 = $30. Therefore, his net profit is $40 - $30 = $10.
"Response: 
Meredith writes about health-related topics and sends them to clients as her regular job. The blog article takes an average of 4 hours for researching and writing. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and twice as many articles in Tuesday compared to Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote double the number of articles than on Tuesday.
To calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles in three days, we can use the following formula:
Total hours = (Number of articles written x Time taken per article) + (Number of articles written on one day x Time taken per article)
Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:
Total hours = (5 x 4) + (10 x 4) + (8 x 4) = 32 + 40 + 32 = 104 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent approximately 104 hours writing blog articles in three days."
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-It notes in her bag before she left for work and then bought another pack of Post-It notes at the store. The question states that she placed one note on each of the 220 coffee cups at work, so we can assume that there are 220 coffee cups in total. Therefore, if she had 23 remaining Post-It notes after using them all up, the number of Post-It notes in the original pack must be equal to 220 x 1 = 220. So, the answer is 220.
"Response:  We know that John has twice as many red scarves as blue ones. So, if he has x red scarves, he has 2x blue scarves. The price of each red scarf is $50 more than the price of each blue scarf, so the cost of one red scarf is $50 + $40 = $90. Since John spent $200 on both types of scarves together, we can set up the equation: 

Total amount spent = Number of red scarves x Cost per red scarf + Number of blue scarves x Cost per blue scarf

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Total amount spent = (2x) x $90 + x x $40
= 2x x $90 + x x $40
= 2(2x) x $90 + x x $40
= 4x x $90 + x x $40
= 5x x $90 + x x $40

Therefore, John spent $5x dollars on scarves in total."
"Response:  We know that Tracy used 4 meters of rope to support the pea plants in her garden. Since each piece of rope is 15 cm long, we can calculate how many pieces she got as follows:

Number of pieces = Length of rope / Length of each piece
= 4 m / 0.15 m (length of each piece)
= 26 pieces
Therefore, Tracy received 26 pieces of rope."
Response:  We know that Richard lives in a building with 15 floors and each floor has 8 units. So, there are 120 units (8 x 15) in total. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of free units as follows: Free units = Total units - Occupied units = 120 - (3/4) x 120 = 96 units Therefore, there are 96 free units in the building where Richard lives.
Response:  If Lloyd has 100 chickens that lay 252 eggs per day and he sells each egg for $2, then...
Response:  The boat travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour during the day and returns with a speed of 6 kilometers per hour. To calculate how far it will take for the boat to return, we can use the formula distance = speed x time. In this case, the time it takes for the boat to return is equal to the time it took to go there minus the time it spent sailing during the day. So if it took 2 hours to reach its destination during the day (since it left at 1 pm and arrived at 3 pm), then it will take an additional 4 hours to return (since it left at 4 pm). Therefore, the total time it will take for the boat to return is 2 + 4 = 6 hours. Now, let's convert the distance from miles to kilometers: 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers, so the distance traveled during the day is 10 miles x 1.60934 kilometers/mile = 16.0934 kilometers. Finally, we can plug in the values into the formula distance = speed x time to get our answer: distance = 6 kilometers/hour x 6 hours = 36 kilometers. Therefore, the boat will have traveled 36 kilometers when it returns.
Response:  If Uriah takes off 15 pounds of books (funti), his strips will weigh half a kilogram less, so they will weigh 7.5 pounds (funti). Since each strip weighs half a pound (funt), then if he removes 30 strips, he will have taken off 30 x 0.5 = 15 pounds or 6.8 kg. Therefore, he must have 6.8 - 15 = 8.2 pounds or 3.7 kg of toys left.
"Response: 
Day of work: Friday (5 days)
Gums repaired for cars: 12
Attempted to repair gums for trucks: 0
Total amount earned by mechanic: $480 ($12 x 4 = $48)
Therefore, the mechanic earned $480 on that day."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, when their mother called them to inform them that they had adopted seven puppies from a local animal shelter, the two cats, Sestre Doubtfire, already had three times as many puppies as they did before (i.e., 3 x 7 = 21). Therefore, the total number of puppies now belonging to the Doubtfire family is 28 (21 + 7).
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 lizalica and he wants to pack them into one basket. If he puts 2 lizalices in each of his baskets, then he will have 30/2 = 15 baskets. So, Jean can fill 15 baskets with lizalica.
Response:  If Peter always pays $7 for tickets and snacks, he will spend a total of $14 each time he goes to the movies ($7 for the ticket + $7 for snacks). Since he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies 3 times ($42 / $14 = 3).
Response:  The maximum weight of cargo that can be carried by the bridge is 5000 pounds (funti). Each box weighs 5 kilograms, so the total weight of 10 boxes would be 50 kilograms. If the truck carries more than 10 boxes, it will exceed the weight limit of the bridge. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without overloading the bridge is 10.
Response:  Firstly, Stephen paid $40 for his groceries online. Then, he was charged an additional 25% delivery fee of $10 (since it was delivered), making the total cost $50. Next, there is a $4 handling charge, bringing the final cost to $54. So, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all charges were added up was $54.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 clusters of grapes with 20 fruits each and 67 individual fruits scattered across the vine. So, in total, we have:

Clusters x Fruits per Cluster = 6 x 20 = 120 fruits
Plus Individual Fruits = 67 + 120 = 187 fruits
Therefore, there are 187 grapes (or malina) in total."
Response:  We know that out of 25 oranges, 1 is bad (loša), and we also know that 20% are not yet ripe (nezrele). So, there are 23 good oranges left. Now, let's calculate how many good oranges have a good taste: • Good oranges = 23 x 20% = 4.6 good oranges That means there are approximately 4.6 good oranges with a good taste among the total of 25 oranges.
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for materials. Then, she paid $800 for craftsmanship. Finally, she paid $100 (10% of $1000) for insurance. Therefore, in total, she paid $630 ($500 + $800 + $100).
Response:  If she worked for the same company for 40 years and received an annual pension of $50,000 per year after age 60, then her total accumulated pension value at age 80 would be: $50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000. Since she started receiving the pension at age 60, the present value of her future pension payments (from ages 60 to 80) is: $1,000,000 / 20 = $50,000 per year. So, if she leaves after 30 years, her final pension payment would be: $50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000.
Response:  The initial payment for the first half of the year is $70 (since it was paid at the beginning of the year). In the second half of the year, the company charged her $130 less than in the first half, so she was charged $63 ($140 - $130 = $63) in the second half. Therefore, the total amount she paid for the entire year is $70 + $63 = $133.
"Response:  We know that Sophia has traveled 160 kilometers since her last fueling and she needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill her tank. The capacity of her fuel tank is 40 liters (according to the instructions). So, we can calculate how far she can drive as follows: Distance = Volume of fuel / Speed = 40 L / 100 km/h = x km Where ""x"" represents the number of kilometers Sophia can drive with one liter of fuel. Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem: Distance = 40 L / 100 km/h = x km Substituting the value for distance traveled so far (160 km): x = 160 km / 40 L = 4 km/L Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 4 kilometers per liter of fuel."
Response:  If Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then goes to bed and reads for half an hour three times a week, he will spend a total of 6 hours watching TV in one week (2 x 3 = 6). Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Jim spends 24 hours watching TV in a month (6 x 4 = 24).
"Response: 
1. Each school has a women's basketball team and a children's basketball team.
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Therefore, each school has sent a total of 10 people (5 players + 1 coach for each team).
So, the number of people that all schools have sent is 4 x 10 = 40."
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies in total. Since we have twice as many smaragds as rubies, there must be 2 x 35 = 70 smaragds. So, the total number of gems is 175 + 35 + 70 = 280. Therefore, there are 280 dragons in the sandbox.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in school. So if there are 60 girls and 3 times as many boys as girls (since there are 2 times more boys than girls), then there are 60 x 2 = 120 boys. If each teacher has 5 students, then there are 120 / 5 = 24 teachers in total.
"Response:  Bailey starts with some money and then gets $5 per week for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, if she has $100, how much money did she start with? We can set up an equation to represent this situation:
Let x be the amount of money Bailey started with.
After 8 weeks, Bailey will have $x + (5 dollars/week) × (8 weeks) = $100
Now we solve for x:
$x + (5 dollars/week) × (8 weeks) = $100
$x = $90
So Bailey started with $90."
Response:  If Judy teaches for 5 hours per day and 7 days in a week, she will have taught for a total of 35 hours (5 x 7 = 35) in one week. Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students Judy teaches in one week is 35 x 15 = 525 students. Therefore, if Judy charges $15 per student per hour, her weekly income from teaching would be 525 x $15 = $7,875.
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first (i.e., 40 instructions). Therefore, Kelian has provided 40 instructions for preparing both meals.
"Response:  If Tommy sells 43 kolači at $3 each and 23 kolači at $4 each, he will make a total of:

$3 x 43 = $132 from the $3 kolači
$4 x 23 = $92 from the $4 kolači
Total amount of money Tommy makes = $132 + $92 = $224
Therefore, Tommy will gather $224 in total."
Response:  Sheila bought five phones for $150 each, so she paid a total of $750. For each phone, she will pay 2% interest per month, which is $1.50 (2% of $75). So, her monthly payment for all five phones would be $7.50 ($1.50 x 5 phones). Therefore, Sheila will pay $7.50 per month for three months, or a total of $22.50 ($7.50 x 3 months).
"Response:  If Artie sells one bunch of each type of flower, he will earn $2.74 for the nasturtiums, $1.87 for the petunias, and $2.12 for the begonias, for a total of $6.73. Since Artie doesn't have any small change today, he will round up all his prices to the nearest dollar. So, if he sells 12 bunches of nasturtiums, he will earn $2.74 x 12 = $32.08; if he sells 9 bunches of petunias, he will earn $1.87 x 9 = $16.53; and if he sells 17 bunches of begonias, he will earn $2.12 x 17 = $35.28. Therefore, in total, Artie will earn $32.08 + $16.53 + $35.28 = $83.89."
"Response:  If Luke builds four rectangular sandcastles with an upper level of surface area $A$, then each lower level will have half the surface area as the upper level, since he is building them from the same pile of sand. So, we can write:
$$\text{Upper level surface area} = \frac{\text{Lower level surface area}}{2}$$
Now, let's substitute the given information into this equation:
$$\boxed{A = \frac{16}{2}} = 8$$
So, the surface area of the upper level of each sandcastle is $8$."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Cecilia has bought a new puppy and her veterinarian recommends that she feed it 1 cup of food for dogs every day during the first 180 days. After that, she needs to feed it 2 cups of food for dogs every day until the end of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags will Cecilia use in the first year? So, the answer is 180/1 = 180 bags.
Response:  We know that Sarah makes $400 more than David and Raymonde makes $200 less than Sarah. So, if Sarah makes $800, then Raymonde makes $600 ($800 - $200). Therefore, the difference in amount of money between Raymond and David is $600 ($800 - $200).
Response:  If he buys 3 bunches of flowers for $2.50 each, then he will spend $7.50 in total ($2.50 x 3). If he buys 2 bunches of flowers for $1 each, then he will spend $2 in total ($1 x 2). So, if he buys 18 bunches of flowers at the better price, he will save $5.50 ($7.50 - $2 = $5.50).
"Response:  The original price of the haircut was $100. If the groomer offers a discount of 30%, then the new price for the next customer will be:
$100 x (1 - 0.30) = $70
So, the cost of the haircut after the discount is $70."
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water each, so between them they got 24/6 = 4 liters of water. Then, the boy received 6 liters of water, leaving 4 - 6 = 2 liters of water remaining. Therefore, there are 2 liters of water left.
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 nice dresses before buying any more from the market. He bought 21 nice dresses from the market and received 23 nice dresses as gifts for his birthday. So, in total, he has 44 nice dresses (10 + 21 + 23). Then, he gave 9 nice dresses to his sister, leaving him with 35 nice dresses (44 - 9 = 35).
Response:  We know that Alex weighs 2 times less than 4 times Grace's weight in kilograms. So, if Grace weighs x kilograms, then Alex weighs 2x kilograms. Therefore, their total weight is equal to the sum of their individual weights: x + 2x = 60 kg (since they together weigh 60 kg). Solving for x, we get: x = 30 kg. So, Grace weighs 30 kg and Alex weighs 60 - 2(30) = 10 kg.
Response:  If Dan has planted three rose bushes and each rose bush has 25 roses, then there are 3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. Since each rose has 8 thorns, there are 75 x 8 = 600 thorns in total. Therefore, the answer is 600.
Response:  The team has played 22 matches and won 8 more than they lost. So, if they have lost x times, then they have won 8 + x times. We can write this as an equation: 8 + x = 22. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. Therefore, the team has won 14 matches and lost 8 matches.
"Response:  We know that there are four odmors per year and Gene started keeping these old t-shirts from each odmor since he was 23 years old. Therefore, the total number of blocks for Gene is:

Number of blocks = Number of years \* Number of odmors per year \* Number of t-shirts kept per odmor
= 34 years \* 4 odmors/year \* 1 t-shirt/odmor
= 136 blocks
Therefore, the answer is 136 blocks."
Response:  The first time the alarm went off today, it sounded four times. So, in total, the alarm has sounded 4 + 3 = 7 times so far today.
"Response:  If the company pays each employee $600 per month and has a policy of increasing their salary by 10% every year for those who have been with the company for five years or more, we can calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three years as follows:
Year 1 (first three years): $600 x 1.1 = $660
Year 2 (second three years): $660 x 1.1 = $726
Year 3 (third three years): $726 x 1.1 = $809
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three years is $809."
"Response:  If Marilynina first album was sold 10 times more than Harald's, then the number of albums sold by Harald is:

Harald's sales = Marilynina's sales x 0.1 (since Marilynina's sales were 10 times higher)
= 88,000 x 0.1
= 8,800

So, Harald sold 8,800 albums."
Response:  We know that there are 16 guests invited and since quarter of them will not show up (4/4 = 1), we have 16 x 3/4 = 11 guests who will actually attend the party. So, for these 11 guests, Christina needs to buy 11 x 75 = 825 poklones or gifts. Therefore, the total cost of gifts is $825.
Response:  The adults will eat an average of 10 pounds (lbs) each = 45 kg and children half that amount = 22.5 kg. So total weight of food needed for all participants is: Total weight of food needed = 45 + 22.5 = 67.5 kg or 148.7 lbs. Therefore, Ted should bring approximately 149 lbs of coleslaw to the picnic to ensure there is enough food for everyone.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Jan has more than three lovers (3).
Marcia has two lovers more than Cindy (2).
Cindy has four lovers (4).
So, if we combine these statements, we can conclude that:
Triplet (Jan, Marcia, and Cindy) have together x lovers, where x = 7 (since Jan has 3 + Marcia has 2 + Cindy has 4 = 7)."
"Response:  We know that Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Amy - 5 = Jackson + 2
We also know that James is one year younger than Corey. Therefore, we can add another equation to our system of equations:
James - 1 = Corey + 2
Now, let's solve for Jackson's age using substitution or elimination method. Since there are two equations and two unknowns (Jackson's age and James's age), we will use substitution method here. Solving the first equation for Jackson's age, we get:
Jackson = Amy - 5 + 2
Substituting this expression into the second equation, we get:
James = Corey + 2 - 1
Simplifying and solving for James's age, we get:
James = Corey + 3
Finally, since James is one year younger than Corey, we can find Corey's age as follows:
Corey = James + 1
So, Corey is 11 years old. Now, let's substitute Corey's age back into the first equation to find Jackson's age:
Jackson = Amy - 5 + 2
= Amy - 5 + 2
= 9
Therefore, Jackson is 9 years old."
"Response:  If Lee could run 400 meters with obstacles 2 seconds faster than Gerald, then:
Gerald's time for running 400 meters without obstacles = 400 / (2 - 0) = 400 / 2 = 200 seconds
Since Gerald's speed has improved by 10%, his new time for running 400 meters without obstacles = (1 + 0.1) x 200 = 220 seconds
Now, if Lee runs 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, then:
Lee's time for running 400 meters with obstacles = 38 / (2 - 0) = 38 / 2 = 19 seconds
So, Gerald can run 400 meters without obstacles in 220 seconds, and he ran 400 meters with obstacles in 19 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles 10% faster than Lee."
"Response:  If there are 12 times fewer dogs than cats and dogs, then there are 12 x 60 = 720 cats. Since two ma...

Response:  We know that out of 200 students in the fifth grade, two-thirds are girls and one-third are boys. So, if there are twice as many girls as boys, then the number of girls is twice 133 = 266. Therefore, there are 266 girls in the club.
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of that time, then we can write an equation as follows:
Harry = x (where x is the number of hours Harry slept)
James = 2/3x (where 2/3x is the number of hours James slept)
Now, we are asked to find out how many hours Harry slept more than James. So, let's subtract the two equations:
Harry - James =?
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
9 - 2/3x = x + 2/3x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
7x = 10
Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
x = 10/7
Therefore, Harry slept for 10/7 hours more than James."
Response:  We know that each jar of jam contains three pieces of parade. So if we have 32 jars of jam, then altogether there are 32 x 3 = 96 pieces of parade in all those jars. Now, since half of the jam has been lost, we need to subtract half of 96, which is 48. Therefore, Freda used 48 pieces of parade to make all those jars of jam.
"Response:  At first, there were 30 cars in total on the highway. In the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, some cars passed through it, and then another 20 cars passed through during the remaining 15 minutes. Since 5 cars left the line without passing through the traffic jam, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is:

Number of cars that passed through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Number of cars that left the line
= 30 - 5
= 25
Therefore, 25 cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
Response:  Mary has already received 18 new plants from her favorite garden yesterday. She has two plants in each of the 40 windows in her large house at the farm. If she wants to give one plant to each friend and family member tomorrow, then there will be 40 + 40 = 80 plants in total that she needs to distribute. So, Mary will have 80 - 18 = 62 plants left after giving away the plants to her friends and family members.
Response:  The first friend pressed the bell 20 times before Jerome opened it, so the total number of presses was 20 + 1 = 21. Then, the second friend pressed the bell 1/4 more than Jerome's first friend, which means they pressed it 3 times (since 1/4 is equal to 3). So, the total number of presses from friends 1 and 2 is 21 + 3 = 24. Next, we know that the third friend pressed the bell 10 times more than the second friend, so they pressed it 24 x 10 = 240 times. Finally, the fourth friend pressed the bell 60 times, so the total number of presses from all four friends is 240 + 60 = 300. Therefore, the bell rang 300 times.
"Response: 
Solo has already read 15 pages out of his textbook for science, which means he still needs to read 25 pages (4 - 15).
For social studies, he needs to read 20 pages minus the 15 pages he has already read, which is 5 pages left (20 - 15 = 5).
For history, he needs to read 7 pages minus the 15 pages he has already read, which is -8 pages left (7 - 15 = -8).
For geography, he needs to read 8 pages minus the 15 pages he has already read, which is -7 pages left (8 - 15 = -7).
So, in one day, Solo should read approximately:
Science: 25/5 = 5 pages per day
Social Studies: 5/1 = 5 pages per day
History: -8/1 = -8 pages per day
Geography: -7/1 = -7 pages per day"
Response:  John drinks water from a cup every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Therefore, he drinks 3 cups of water per day (1 x 2 x 3 = 6). Since he also has one more cup before going to bed on weekends, he drinks 7 cups of water in total per week (6 + 1 = 7). So, John drinks 7 cups of water per week.
Response:  The distance from the ocean to the opposite end of the city is 42 miles (67.6 km). To cover each 5 km segment in 10 minutes means that you are moving at a speed of 10/5 = 2 km/min. Therefore, it will take 42 / 2 = 21 minutes to cover the entire city.
Response:  If Poppy has 1000 pieces of candy and she puts 25% (250) of them on the plate, then her mother puts 33% (330) of the remaining pieces on top of that. So, how many pieces of candy are left? We can calculate it as follows: Number of pieces of candy left = Total number of pieces - Pieces already put on the plate = 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces of candy are left to be placed on the plate.
Response:  If Cody eats 3 times more cookies than Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. So together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.
"Response:  The volume of each box is given as follows:
Volume of first box = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Volume of second box = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Volume of third box = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Total volume of all three boxes = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box
= 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches
= 360 cubic inches
The thickness of the walls is given to be 5 cm or 0.05 meters. So, the total external surface area of all three boxes together will be:
External surface area of all three boxes = Total length of sides x Number of sides
= (5 cm) x 3 (for three boxes)
= 15 cm^2
Now, we need to find the internal volume of each box and add it up to get the total internal volume of all three boxes. To do this, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
Volume of a rectangular prism = Length x Width x Height
In this case, the length, width, and height of each box are equal, so we can simplify the formula like this:
Volume of each box = Length x Width x Height
= 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches
= 120 cubic inches
So, the total internal volume of all three boxes is simply the sum of the volumes of each individual box:
Total internal volume of all three boxes = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box
= 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches
= 360 cubic inches
Therefore, the answer to the question is 360 cubic inches."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Frankie watched one hour of his favorite show every evening after finishing his homework.
On Monday and Tuesday, he watched several episodes of a 30-minute show.
On Wednesday, he finished his homework earlier than usual and watched an hour and a half of his favorite show.
On Thursday, he stayed up late for the weekend and watched two hours of his favorite show.
So, let's calculate how much time Frankie spent watching his favorite show each day:
Monday and Tuesday: Several episodes x 30 minutes per episode = 2 hours (since he watched multiple episodes)
Wednesday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1 hour and 30 minutes
Thursday: 2 hours
Therefore, Frankie watched a total of 6 hours and 30 minutes of his favorite show during the week."
"Response:  Last year, Henry pecao x kolačića. This year, he wants to double his result, so he pecao x + 10 kolačića. Since he actually ended up with 110 kolačića, we can set up the equation:
x + 10 = 110
Solving for x, we get:
x = 90
So, last year Henry pecao 90 kolačića."
Response:  The local gas station sells gasoline for $3 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, they will pay $3 x 10 = $30. Then, the company offers a rebate of $20 for each gallon filled at that station, so the person will receive a total rebate of $20 x 10 = $200. Therefore, their final cost for the 10 gallons of gasoline will be $30 - $200 = -$170.
Response:  If both Beatrice and Marcelli can eat as much fruit as they want, then their total amount of eaten fruit is equal to the number of rolls they have multiplied by the number of pieces in each roll. Since Beatrice has two wide valves and 24 long valves, she has eaten 2 x 24 = 48 pieces of fruit. Similarly, since Marcelli has three wide valves and 14 long valves, he has eaten 3 x 14 = 42 pieces of fruit. Therefore, the average number of pieces of fruit eaten per person is (48 + 42) / 2 = 45 pieces.
Response:  The boat is taking in two liters of water for every ten meters it moves towards the shore. Since Julia took 16 seconds to travel 20 meters, that means she was moving at a speed of 20/16 = 1.25 meters per second. Now, we know that the distance from the boat to the shore is 64 seconds (or 0.64 kilometers). So, if Julia moved at this speed during these 64 seconds, then she traveled a distance of 0.64 x 1.25 = 0.78 kilometers. Therefore, there were 0.78 kilograms of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore.
"Response:  The number of times the plate is cleaned per day can be calculated as follows:

1. First period (morning): 4 teachers x 2 classes = 8 periods. Since each class lasts 50 minutes, there are 8 \* 50 = 400 minutes in the morning. If the plate is cleaned 3 times per hour, it will be cleaned 400 / 3 = 133 times in the morning.
2. Second period (afternoon): 4 teachers x 2 classes = 8 periods. As before, there are 8 \* 50 = 400 minutes in the afternoon. If the plate is cleaned 3 times per hour, it will be cleaned 400 / 3 = 133 times in the afternoon.
Total number of times the plate is cleaned per day = 133 + 133 = 266 times."
"Response:  If Ryan has 2 cvijeća per day and he does it for 15 days, then he will have 
$$ \text {Number of cvijeće} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Number of cvijeće per day} $$
So, we can write:
$$ \text {Number of cvijeće} = 15 \times 2 = 30 $$
Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan will have $ 30$ cvijeće."
Response:  We know that Jamalov telefon can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone and that Brittany's phone can receive 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamalov's photo of a bird feeder at the zoo. So if Jamalov's phone holds 1800 photos, then the number of birds in his photo is equal to 1800 / 50 = 36 birds. Therefore, there are 36 birds visible in Jamalov's photo of a bird feeder at the zoo.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has 15 pieces of wood (10 x 2 + 5). Each piece costs her $ 10, so she spent a total of $ 150 on them. Now, if she decides to sell all these pieces, she will make a profit of $ 150 - $ 16 x 5 = $ 130. Therefore, she will earn $ 130 from selling all those pieces of wood.
Response:  If Katy uses 7 times more sugar than water in her mixture, then for every 1 part of water she uses, she will use 7 parts of sugar. So if she used x parts of water, she will have used 7x parts of sugar. Since she has used a total of 120 kašići (chess pieces) of both sugar and water, we can set up the equation: 7x = 120. Solving for x gives us x = 17. Therefore, Katy used 17 kašići (chess pieces) of sugar.
Response:  If John bought two pairs of shoes for each of his three children, that means he bought a total of 6 pairs of shoes (3 children x 2 pairs per child). Since each pair costs $60, John has paid a total of $360 ($60 x 6 pairs).
"Response: 
Let X be the number of containers that were inspected yesterday and Y be the total number of vehicles in the container. We are given that X = 2 and Y = 30.
Now, we need to find out if the condition in the question is met or not. According to the question, if the condition is met, then it means that the customs officer at the main port of Seaside approved the counting of 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, and then another container arrived with more vehicles. So, let's calculate the maximum number of vehicles that could have been counted:
X + Y = 2 + 30 = 32
Since the actual number of vehicles counted was 30, we can see that the condition is indeed met. Therefore, the answer is Yes."
"Response:  We know that Adrien's salary was $60,000 four years ago and it increased by 30%. So his current salary is:
$60,000 x (1 + 0.3) = $78,000
We also know that Lylah's salary was $40,000 four years ago and it increased by 20%. So her current salary is:
$40,000 x (1 + 0.2) = $48,000
Now we need to find out how much they both earned together four years ago:
Adrien's earnings = $78,000
Lylah's earnings = $48,000
Together, their earnings = $78,000 + $48,000 = $126,000"
Response:  If Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week for his drawing and there are 5 weeks in a month, then he will use 10 sheets of paper (2 x 5 = 10) during each month. Since there are 4 months in a quarter, Miguel will use 40 sheets of paper (10 x 4 = 40) during each quarter. Therefore, Miguel uses 40 sheets of paper per quarter.
Response:  Morisette has brought 5 jabukas and 8 oranges, so she has contributed (5 + 8) = 13 units of fruit to the total amount. Kael has brought twice as many jabukas as Morisette, which means he has contributed 2 x 5 = 10 jabukas to the total amount. He also has fewer oranges than Morisette, so he has contributed (8 / 2) = 4 oranges to the total amount. Therefore, the total number of units of fruit that Morisette and Kael have brought is 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 units of fruit.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. If she slept for 2 less hours each of the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), then she slept for 6 + 4 = 10 hours total in those two days. So, if she slept for 1 hour more than those 2 days combined, that means she slept for 11 hours in total during the week. Therefore, Sadie slept for 8 + 11 = 19 hours during the week.
"Response:  Rosie can run 10 miles in 3 hours, which means she runs at a rate of 10/3 = 3.33 miles per hour. Then, for the next 4 hours, she runs at a rate of 5 miles per hour. So, her total distance traveled in 7 hours is:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 3.33 miles/hour x 7 hours
= 23.31 miles
Therefore, Rosie can run 23.31 miles in 7 hours."
Response:  When Jennie started working at her mother's store, there were 60 unstamped letters in the stack. She put a mark on one-third of them (20 letters). So, now there are 40 unstamped letters left (60 - 20 = 40). Then, she stamped 30 of these remaining letters. Therefore, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie started working is 30 (40 - 10 = 30).
Response:  Julia used three plastic bags to prepare her goulash and then she had 3 + 5 = 8 plastic bags left. Later, when she went to set the table, she had 12 plastic bags in total, so she must have bought 4 more plastic bags with the package that her husband gave her. Therefore, the answer is 8 + 4 = 12.
Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 piletines and 6 more riblje than piletines. So, if he bought x piletines, then he also bought 6 + x riblje. Since he has to make kobasice for the party, we can say that the total number of fish he bought is equal to the number of kobasice he wants to make (which is 40). Therefore, we have the equation: 38 + (6 + x) = 40. Solving for x, we get: x = 22. So, Dylan bought 22 piletines and 6 more riblje than piletines.
Response:  If Amy had 20 more friends than Lily before they switched schools, that means Lily had 20 fewer friends than Amy at that time. So, if Lily has x friends now, then Amy has x + 20 = 70 friends now. Therefore, the combined number of friends of Lily and Amy is 50 (Lily) + 70 = 120 friends.
Response:  We know that one lubenica costs three times more than one paprika, so one lubenica costs $3 \times 3 = 9$. One naranča costs $5 less than one lubenica, so one naranča costs $9 - 5 = 4$. Therefore, if Dillon buys 4 lubenice, he will pay $4 \times 4 = 16$ for them. He also buys 20 paprike, which cost $20 \times 15 = 300$, and 10 naranča, which cost $10 \times 4 = 40$. So, in total, Dillon pays $16 + 300 + 40 = 476$.
Response:  The number of patients per day is given as 500. Each patient takes an average of 24 minutes for a check-up. Therefore, the total time spent on checks per day is: Time = Number of patients x Average time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes per day. Now we need to calculate how much money the hospital earns from these visits. According to the information provided, each doctor charges $150 per hour and the hospital charges $200 per hour to patients. So, the total amount earned by the hospital per day can be calculated as follows: Total income = Number of doctors x Doctor charge per hour + Number of patients x Hospital charge per hour = (Number of doctors x $150) + (Number of patients x $200) Total income = 12,000 x $150 + 500 x $200 Total income = $180,000 + $100,000 Total income = $280,000 per day.
Response:  We know that 60 seasonal workers were hired to play villagers in Nissa's shopping center. After 30% of them were sickened and had to leave, there are now 40 villagers left (60 x 0.3 = 20). Then, after another 10 villagers were hit by children and had to leave, there are now 30 villagers left (40 - 10 = 30). So, there are 30 villagers remaining at the end.
Response:  In May, Joe spent $500. In June, he spent $440 less than in May, so he spent $60 = $500 - $440. Therefore, Joe spent a total of $500 + $440 = $940 for those two months.
Response:  Pam and Fred went to the carnival together. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, so she spent 12 karats (2 x 6). Fred rode it four times, so he spent 24 karats (4 x 6). Then they both decided to ride the log flume twice each, spending an additional 12 karats per person (2 x 6). Therefore, in total, Pam and Fred spent 38 karats that day (12 + 24 + 12).
Response:  On Monday, Walter walked 6 kilometers. If he walked six times more miles than on Monday, then on Tuesday he walked 6 x 6 = 36 kilometers. Therefore, the total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41 - 36 = 5 kilometers. So, in Wednesday, Walter walked 5 kilometers.
"Response:  If Tom has 4 cars and each car costs $15 to wash, then...

Step 1: Calculate how much Tom spends on washing all 4 cars in one month.
$15 x 4 = $60

Step 2: Now calculate how much Tom spends on washing all 4 cars in a year (12 months).
$60 x 12 = $720

Therefore, Tom pays $720 per year for washing his 4 cars."
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and he lost 5 of them immediately before the comparison was made. So, if we subtract 5 from 20, we get 15. Now, we are told that Bob has 5 less than 3 times more than Brian. In other words, if we multiply Bob's number of video games by 3, we will have his total number of video games. Therefore, 3 x 15 = 45. So, Bob has 45 video games.
Response:  We know that there are 27 one-horned animals in the world and that one-third of them are located in Scotland. So, we can assume that there are 9 one-horned animals in Scotland (3/4 x 27). Since two-thirds of these Scottish one-horned animals are females, the number of female one-horned animals in Scotland is 14 (2/3 x 9). Therefore, there are 14 female one-horned animals in Scotland.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the items that Rory wants to order:

* 2 sendviča x $7.50 = $15.00
* 2 vreća čipsa x $1.50 = $3.00
* 2 kolača x $1.00 = $2.00
Total cost = $20.00
Now, let's add the delivery fee of 20%:
Delivery fee = $20.00 x 20% = $4.00
Total cost including delivery fee = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00
Therefore, Rory's order will cost $24.00 in total."
Response:  If Mark took 75 questions in 8 hours for the first test and completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour, then he spent 75/5 = 15 hours on the first test. Now, if he took another test with 100 questions today and completed it at the same rate of 5 questions per hour, then he spent 100/5 = 20 hours on the second test. Therefore, Mark left 35 questions unanswered (20 - 15).
Response:  We know that there are 4 times more red gumballs than blue ones. So if there are 12 blue gumballs, then there are 48 red gumballs (since 4 x 12 = 48). Therefore, there are 48 + 12 = 60 total gumballs in the jar.
Response:  We know that out of 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remaining are semi-automatic. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is equal to 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 poluautomatski cars available for rent.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees than queen bees. So, if there are x worker bees, then there are 2x queen bees. Therefore, we can write an equation: 700 = x + (2x) = 1400. Solving for x, we get x = 700 / 3 = 233 worker bees.
Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day and earns $10 per hour, then he will have earned $20 in one day (2 hours x $10/hour). Therefore, if he does this for 7 days of the week, he will have earned $140 ($20 x 7 days) during that time.
"Response: 
John bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, candles for $3, cups for $3, and keys for $4. So in total he spent:
$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $16
Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, the amount of money John paid in taxes can be calculated as follows:
$16 x 0.10 = $1.60
So John paid a total of $17 ($16 + $1.60) for all his purchases."
"Response: 
Kim has already signed up three clients and is in talks with five more potential clients. He estimates that each client will buy two bags of laundry detergent and one package of cleaning supplies worth $5 each. His total weekly income from these sales would be:
Income = Number of clients x Price per item x Quantity sold
= 3 x $2 x 2 + 5 x $5 x 1
= $92
So, Lucas will earn a profit of $92 every week."
Response:  If John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare produces 100 ananas per month, then in one year, John will have produced 10 x 12 = 120 months worth of ananas. Since John can harvest ananas every 3 months, he will have collected 4 times as many ananas in a year (120 / 3 = 40). Therefore, John can collect 40 x 100 = 4000 ananas in a year.
Response:  If Johnny has 500 blocks in his box and he throws them all onto the floor, then he will have 500 + 500 = 1000 blocks on the floor. Now, if he takes another box that contains 3 times as many blocks as the first one (which is 3 x 500 = 1500 blocks), then he will have 1000 + 1500 = 2500 blocks on the floor. Finally, if he takes the last box which contains 1/4 of the total number of blocks (which is 1/4 x 2500 = 625 blocks), then he will have 2500 - 625 = 1875 blocks left on the floor. So, Johnny will end up with 1875 blocks if he picks up all the Legos.
Response:  We know that 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours and half of the day (since we don't know exactly when). Then, during the remaining time of the day (from 12 pm to 6 pm), Debra saw half as many bees leaving the hive again. So, if there were initially 30 bees that left the hive, then after 6 hours there would be 15 bees left outside (half of 30). Now, let's calculate how many bees returned to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day: since Debra saw twice as many bees returning than leaving, and she saw 15 bees leaving earlier, then the number of bees returning is equal to twice 15 = 30 bees. Therefore, the total number of bees that returned to the hive at the end of the day is also 30.
Response:  We know that Brittany and her mom went to the museum together, and they paid $12 for adult admission and $10 for child admission. Since Brittany's mom gave money to the cashier in exchange for two tickets (one adult and one child), we can assume that she spent $12 + $10 = $22. So, the amount of money that Brittany's mom gave to the cashier is $22.
Response:  We know that Charlie has more friends than Dorothy on Facebook. Specifically, Charlie has 12 friends, while Dorothy has 9 friends. So if Charlie has x friends on Facebook, then James must have at least x + 4 = 16 friends on Facebook (since he has 4 more friends than Dorothy). Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.
Response:  We know that Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute and Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for each of them to reach home, we need to divide their speed by 5 (since there are 5 minutes in an hour). So, for Steve, it will take him 88 minutes (440 / 5) to reach home, and for Tim, it will take him 52 minutes (264 / 5) to reach home. Since Steve lives farther away from the school than Tim does, he will finish the race before Tim does. Therefore, the answer is 88 minutes.
"Response: 
Day 1: 5 people came to inflate their tires. Each person needed 2 gumes, so total number of gumes needed = 5 x 2 = 10 gumes. Since each gume costs $0.25, total cost for Day 1 = 10 gumes x $0.25 = $2.50.
So, Shawnda earned $2.50 on Day 1."
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of candy, each package contains six pieces of candy inside. So, in total, he will get 6 x 10 = 60 pieces of candy. Each piece of candy costs $0.10, so the total cost for all 60 pieces is $60 / $0.10 = 600 dollars. Therefore, Carl will pay $600 to buy all the candy.
Response:  We know that Dave initially had 14 pomfrits and then he shared some with the seagull who took half of them (7). Then, three crows came and each one ate 3 pomfrits (21 total). After that, an octopus stole 2/3 of the remaining pomfrits (15). Finally, flies took the last pomfrit leaving 5. So, in total, there were 15 + 7 + 21 + 15 = 68 pomfrits in the package when Dave bought it.
"Response: 
Kimo has three 1-hour classes every day (Ponedjeljkom, Srijedom and Petkom). This means he has 3 x 1 = 3 hours of class per day.
Since there are 16 weeks in one semester, Kimo will have 3 x 16 = 48 hours of class per semester."
Response:  If Bill has 300 kolača and each one is 15 cm long, then he has a total of 4500 cm (300 x 15) length of kolači. Similarly, if he has 120 čokoladних kruasa and each one is also 15 cm long, then he has a total of 1800 cm (120 x 15) length of круса. Finally, if he has 60 bageta and each one is 60 cm long, then he has a total of 3600 cm (60 x 60) length of bageti. Therefore, in total, Bill has a length of 9900 cm (4500 + 1800 + 3600) of pečenih proizvoda.
Response:  The zookeeper feeds all monkeys in the zoo with bananas. Every two months, he buys all the bananas from the local farm. If the monkeys need 200 bananas per month, the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and the baboons need 100 bananas per month, how many bananas should the zookeeper buy to last for two months? To find out, we can use the following formula: Total number of bananas needed = (Number of monkeys x Number of bananas needed per month) + (Number of gorillas x Number of bananas needed per month) + (Number of baboons x Number of bananas needed per month) We know that there are 3 types of monkeys: capuchin, spider, and mandrill. Each type of monkey needs a different number of bananas per month. Here is the information given in the question: Capuchins need 200 bananas per month Spider monkeys need 150 bananas per month Mandrills need 300 bananas per month Gorillas also need bananas, but they don't eat them as frequently as the other primates. They need 400 bananas per month. So, let's plug these numbers into our formula: Total number of bananas needed = (3 x 200) + (1 x 400) + (1 x 300) = 600 + 400 + 300 = 1300 bananas Now we know that the zookeeper needs to buy 1300 bananas every two months to keep all the monkeys and gorillas fed.
"Response: 
Step 1: Distance traveled by Blake in 15 minutes = 100 yards x 15 minutes = 1500 yards (since there are 100 yards per football field)
Step 2: Distance traveled by Kelly in 15 minutes = 40 yards + (40 yards x 34 times) = 40 yards + 1360 yards (since there are 100 yards per football field)
Therefore, the winner of the race is Kelly who has traveled a distance of 1360 yards, while Blake has traveled a distance of 1500 yards. So, Kelly is ahead of Blake by 140 yards."
Response:  Raphael bought 4 pencils for $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on pencils. He also bought 2 erasers for $4 each, so he spent $8 on erasers. Finally, he bought an inch of paper for $20 per inch, and since he needed 3 inches of paper, he spent $60 on paper. Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $74 ($6 + $8 + $60).
Response:  If Finn saw 11 fish swimming in the lake and then he saw 6 people coming out from underwater plants, that means there were 11 + 6 = 17 things that he could see in the lake. Then, he saw two people hiding under a rock, which brings the total number of things he could see to 17 + 2 = 19. Therefore, Finn could see 19 things in the lake.
Response:  On Monday (utork), the reservoir had 2 meters more water than it did on Sunday (subota). So, if the depth of the water was x meters on Sunday, then it was x + 2 meters on Monday. Now, on Tuesday (srijeda), the depth of the water was two-thirds of what it was on Monday. So, if the depth of the water on Monday was x + 2 meters, then the depth of the water on Tuesday was (x + 2) / 3 = x + 4/3 meters. Therefore, the depth of the water in the reservoir on Tuesday was 5.67 meters (rounded to one decimal place).
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Anakin has caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea horses, and 3 clowns. Locsin has caught 5 fewer sea stars than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clowns than Anakin. Therefore, the total number of fish that both Anakin and Locsin have caught is:

10 + 6 = 16 (sea stars)
10 + 6 = 16 (sea horses)
10 + 3 = 13 (clowns)

So, they have caught a total of 45 fish."
"Response:  The initial price of the jar is $20, and it increases by 20% every two months. So after two months, the new price will be:

$20 x (1 + 0.2) = $24

After four months, the price will be:

$24 x (1 + 0.2) = $28.8

And so on. To find out how much the jar will cost after 36 months, we can continue this pattern:

$28.8 x (1 + 0.2) ^ 36 = $75.92

So, after 36 months, the jar will cost approximately $75.92."
"Response:  The price of the doll is $4, and one action figure costs $5. So, if we buy three action figures, they will cost $15 ($5 x 3). Now, let's calculate how much all the toys are worth in total: * Doll: $4 * Action figures (3): $15 = Total value of toys: $19
Therefore, all the toys together are worth $19."
Response:  If Jackie pays her taxes herself, she will save three hours of work and $35 per hour in lost income. Therefore, if she works for three hours less, she will lose $105 ($35 x 3). Now let's calculate how much more money she will have to pay if she hires an accountant: The cost of hiring an accountant is $90. So, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will lose $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $15 more than if she paid her taxes herself.

Step 1: How many times does Sandra need to give an egg if she wants to make 15 Spanish flans for the school event?
Number of eggs needed = Number of flans wanted x Number of eggs per flan
= 15 x 3
= 45 eggs

So, Sandra needs to give an egg 45 times in total."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So, if Brooke is x years old, then Seth is 2x years old. In two years, their combined age will be 28 years. Therefore, we can write an equation: 2x + 2 = 28. Solving for x, we get: x = 14. So, Seth is 2 times older than Brooke, which means he is 28 - 14 = 14 years old.
Response:  If Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, and Ethel has $8, then we can say that Jimmy has $10 (since $2 + $8 = $10). So, Jimmy has $10.
Response:  If he walks 30 kilometers per day, then in one week (7 days) he will walk 210 kilometers (30 x 7). However, as you mentioned, he doesn't walk on weekends, so we need to subtract the number of kilometers he walks on Saturdays and Sundays. Since he walks 10 miles per day on those two days, that means he walks 160 kilometers (10 x 2) during the weekend. Therefore, his total distance walked for the week is 210 - 160 = 50 kilometers.
"Response:  The cost of each item is given as follows:

* Shirt (sheeshir): $25
* Jacket (jakna): $75 (3 times more than the shirt) = $225
* Pants (hlače): $100 (proportional to the jacket) = $225

Therefore, the total cost of all three items is: $25 + $225 + $225 = $675."
Response:  We know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so we have 8 x 80 = 640 legs. Then, there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so we have 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, there are 3 rare mutated centipedes with 10 legs each, so we have 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, in total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
"Response:  We know that Sally Three has three years more than her mother Red, so Sally Three is four years older than Red. Therefore, Sally Three is eight years old (4 + 3 = 8). Now we have to find out how many years are between Sally Forty and Sally Thirty-Two. According to the problem, ""Sally Forty is as old as Sally Thirty-Two was when she had Sally Thirty-Two."" So if Sally Thirty-Two is currently eight years old, then Sally Forty must be eight years old too. Finally, we can calculate the total age of all four birds by adding their individual ages together: Sally Three is eight years old, Sally Forty is also eight years old, and Sally Fifty-Two is thirty-six years old (2 x 16 = 32 + 16 = 52)."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays each month for her debts. For the student loan, she has to pay at least $300 per month, so let's assume that amount as x. Similarly, for the credit card bill, she needs to pay at least $200 per month, which means y. Finally, for the mortgage, she must pay at least $500 per month, or z. Since Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, we can set up an equation based on these amounts:
x + y + z = 1500 (since 50% of $1500 is $750)
Now we have three equations and three variables. Solving them simultaneously gives us the values of x, y, and z:
x = $300
y = $200
z = $400
Therefore, Jessica pays $300 per month for her student loan, $200 per month for her credit card bill, and $400 per month for her mortgage. In total, she pays $900 per month towards her debts."
"Response: 
1. Billy needs to peel and chop 60 carrots for his family's big barbecue. This will take him around 1 minute and 30 seconds (1 min 30 s).
2. After peeling and chopping each carrot, Billy needs to wash them. Washing each carrot takes about 5 seconds (5 s).
3. Therefore, in total, it will take Billy around 1 minute and 35 seconds (1 min 35 s) to prepare all 60 carrots for the barbecue."
Response:  If they sell each gallon of lemonade for $3 and each cup of sugar for $2, then their total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon. Since they sell each cup of lemonade for $0.50, their total revenue from selling cups of lemonade is $5 x 20 = $100 per gallon. Therefore, if they sold 25 dollars worth of lemonade, they must have sold 25 / $100 = 25 gallons of lemonade.
Response:  We know that there are 240 athletes in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese athletes is 160 (240 - 80). Now, we need to find out how many boys and girls are among the Chinese athletes. According to the question, 60 of the Chinese athletes are boys, so the number of girls among the Chinese athletes is 100 (160 - 60). Therefore, there are 100 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends 1/4 of his income on rent, which is equal to 1500$. Then he spends 1/3 of his income on gas for his car, which is equal to 2000$. He also gives half of the remaining amount (which is 3000$) to his favorite charity organization. So, he has 3000 - 1500 = 1500 left after all these expenses and donations. Now, he gives 200$ to his daughter and 700$ to his wife, so he has 1500 - 900 = 600 left. Therefore, Zaid will have 600$ more after all these expenses and donations.
Response:  We know that Rani has 10 crabs more than Monica, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, if Bo has 40 crabs, then Rani has 10 + 4 = 14 more crabs than Bo. Therefore, the total number of crabs that the three have together is 40 (Bo) + 14 (Rani) + 4 (Monica) = 58 crabs.
Response:  In the first week, Lloyd taught for 5 hours, so he earned $5 x 5 = $25. In the second week, he taught for 8 hours, so he earned $8 x 8 = $64. Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $25 + $64 = $89 during the first two weeks of teaching.
Response:  We know that there are two candidates in the race for the representative of the class at Sarai School. If the winner received 3/4 of the votes, then the number of votes received by the loser is equal to (1 - 3/4) x 80 = 20. Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.
Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white carnations and 200 more ružićasti Calla lilies than white ones. So, if she ordered x white carnations, then she ordered 4x red roses. Also, we know that she threatened to change suppliers if they don't deliver the red roses within 5 hours (by 17:00). Therefore, Fred must deliver 4x + 200 = 3x red roses before 17:00 to keep Sandra as his client.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:
Jean is two years older than Mark.
Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age two years ago.
So, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then she was 25 years old two years ago.
Therefore, Mark was 75 years old (5 + 2 = 7) years old when Jan was 25 years old.
Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is 77 years old (75 + 2 = 77)."
"Response:  The first team has each member running 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so their total time for one lap is:

Time = (Number of members) x (Running time per member)
= 4 x 55
= 220 seconds

Now, let's calculate the time for the second team:
Their first runner takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the time for their entire lap can be calculated as follows:

Time = (Number of members) x (Running time per member)
= 4 x (60 + 3)
= 4 x 63
= 252 seconds

Since both teams are racing around the same track, we need to convert the times from seconds to minutes and seconds. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

Minutes = Time in seconds / 60

For the first team, we have:

Minutes = 220 / 60
= 3.67 minutes

For the second team, we have:

Minutes = 252 / 60
= 4.2 minutes

Therefore, if these two teams were to race in a 4x400 meter relay, the better-coached team would win by approximately 4.2 - 3.67 = 0.53 minutes."
Response:  The probability of Jerry throwing a number greater than 3 is 1/6 or approximately 0.17. Now, let's calculate the probability that he will throw two consecutive numbers less than 3. There are 5 remaining numbers after throwing the first number less than 3, and each of them has an equal chance to be thrown next. Therefore, the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers less than 3 is 5/6 or approximately 0.83. So, the final answer is 0.17 / 0.83 = 0.204 or approximately 20.4%.
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked up half of the total number of apples from their farm, then they must have picked up an odd number of apples. Since Jenna alone picked up half of what her mother picked up, she picked up half of an odd number of apples. Therefore, the total number of apples that Jenna's mother picked up is (odd number) - 1/2 = (odd number-1). So, if Jenna's mother picked up 20 apples, then they both picked up 20 + 1 = 21 apples in total.
Response:  We have 10 cages of mice and each cage has 5 pieces of cheese. In addition, we have a nest for hamsters where 20 pieces of cheese are divided among them. There is no other place in the store where cheese is used. If there are 160 pieces of cheese distributed among small rodents, how many hamsters are in each cage?  Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that there are 10 cages of mice and each cage has 5 pieces of cheese. Therefore, the total number of pieces of cheese for all cages is 10 x 5 = 50. Similarly, we know that there is a nest for hamsters where 20 pieces of cheese are divided among them. So, the total number of pieces of cheese for all hamsters is 20. Now, let's assume that there are 'x' hamsters in each cage. Since there are 10 cages, the total number of hamsters is 10x. Since there are 50 pieces of cheese for all mice and 20 pieces of cheese for all hamsters, the total number of pieces of cheese available is 50 + 20 = 70. Finally, since there are 160 pieces of cheese distributed among small rodents, the number of small rodents (mice and hamsters combined) is 160 / 70 = 2.33. So, there are approximately 2.33 hamsters in each cage.
Response:  The amount of money that Mandy borrowed from Benedict is $100. According to their agreement, they agreed to have a monthly interest rate of 2%. So, after three months, Benedict will charge Mandy an interest of $6 (2% x $30). Therefore, Mandy needs to pay Benedict $106 ($100 + $6) after three months.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of transporting one ton of wheat from the farm to the storage facility. Since the distance between these two locations is 10 miles and the price of transportation per mile is $2, then the total cost of transportation would be:

$2 x 10 = $20

Next, we need to calculate the profit that Trgovac made after selling all the wheat. According to the question, he sold each ton of wheat for $30, so the total revenue from selling all the wheat would be:

$30 x 5 tons = $150

Finally, we can calculate the number of tons of wheat that Trgovac sold by dividing his total revenue by the cost of transportation:

$150 / $20 = 7.5 tons

Therefore, Trgovac sold 7.5 tons of wheat."
Response:  The total cost of the trip is $20.25 + $3 x $33 = $169.75. Since they spent less on food than on tickets, let's say they spent $40 on food. So, each person paid $40 / 3 = $13.33 for their share of the food. Therefore, each person paid $13.33 + $169.75 = $183 for their share of the entire trip.
Response:  If John can collect 3 breskves in 3 minutes, that means he can collect 1 breskva per minute. So, if it takes him 2 minutes to gather 2 breskves, then he will have gathered 4 breskves in total (2 x 2 = 4). Therefore, John sakuplja 4 breskve.
Response:  If one patka needs 2.5 kg of insects per week to survive, then ten pataks would need 10 x 2.5 = 25 kg of insects per week. So, if there is a flock of ten pataks, they would need 25 kg of insects daily.
Response:  In year 1, Tom had 50 stabala and he cut down 2 trees. So in year 2, he has 48 stabala (50 - 2). He repeats this process every year for 10 years, so after 10 years he has 48 x 10 = 480 stabala. Now, 30% of 480 is 144 stabala that have died. So, Tom has 480 - 144 = 336 stabala left.
Response:  On Friday morning, the neighbors put 18 red plastic flamingos on Sue's lawn. In Saturday morning, they took away one-third of these flamingos and painted them white. Then, in Sunday morning, they added another 18 red plastic flamingos to Sue's lawn. Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 36 (18 + 18) plastic flamingos outside Sue's house. So, the number of red plastic flamingos outside Sue's house was 24 (36 - 12).
Response:  Since there are five different colors of pencils and Violetta wants to buy them all, she will need 5 x $2 = $10 for all the pencils together. So, she will have $10 - $2 = $8 left after buying all the pencils.
"Response:  If one olovo costs $1.20 and one piece of rubber costs $0.30, then 8 olovaka will cost:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60

So, 8 olovaka will cost $9.60."
"Response:  We know that 200 funti of mrkve will be distributed among 40 restaurants in a certain city. Since each restaurant will receive half a kilogram of mrkva, we can calculate how much mrkva won't be used as follows:

Half a kilogram x 40 restaurants = 20 kilograms (of mrkva) not used
Therefore, 20 kilograms of mrkva won't be used."
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soda. Among them, there are 8417 males and 9092 females. So, we have:
Males = 8417
Females = 9092
Children (total) = Males + Females - Adults
= 8417 + 9092 - 23786
= -1535
Therefore, there are -1535 children in Soda."
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. Then she collected three times as many in the second month, so she had 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). In the third month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the second month, so she had 40 cards (60 - 20 = 40). Therefore, Elaine has 40 Pokémon cards.
Response:  If Mark is editing 1000 sentences for two different publishers and Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, then he will earn $2 x 5 = 10 cents per sentence from Publisher B and $5 - 10 = 4 cents per sentence from Publisher A. Therefore, his total weekly income will be 10 + 4 = 14 cents.
Response:  If Baldur takes 5 canteens of water from the well every morning and 6 canteens every evening, then he takes a total of 5 + 6 = 11 canteens of water per day. Since each canteen contains 5 liters of water, Baldur takes a total of 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water per day.
"Response:  If John earns $2000 per week and receives a one-time bonus of $5000, his total income for the year will be:

$2000 x 52 = $104,000 (total income)

Now, let's calculate the percentage increase in his salary due to the bonus:

($5000 / $104,000) x 100 = 4.8% (percentage increase)

So, John's salary after receiving the bonus will be:

$104,000 + ($104,000 x 4.8%) = $109,632 (new salary)"
"Response:  We know that Josie has a farm of 10 hectares and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate how many barrels of wine her farm produces annually as follows:
Barrels of wine = Tons of grapes x Yards of wine/Ton of grapes
= 50 tons (hectare x number of hectares) x 2 barrels/ton
= 100 barrels of wine
Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Response: 
Carlova uses 2 pieces of cheese for each sandwich and eats one sandwich per day. Therefore, he consumes 2 x 3 = 6 pieces of cheese per week.
He also makes an omelette with 1/4 more eggs than cheese every three days, which means he uses 3/4 + 1/4 = 1 1/4 times as many eggs as cheese. So, he consumes 6 x 1 1/4 = 7 1/4 pieces of cheese per week.
Finally, he prepares a large macaroni and cheese dish that lasts him several meals, using 8 pieces of cheese in it. Therefore, his total consumption of cheese per week is 7 1/4 + 8 = 15 1/4 pieces of cheese."
"Response:  We know that Janet had 22 green and 10 yellow olive oil bottles initially. Then she bought 6 boxes of blue olive oil and 2 boxes of red olive oil. Since there are 9 olive oil bottles in each box of blue olive oil, and 6 olive oil bottles in each box of red olive oil, we can conclude that:

Green olive oil bottles = Initial amount + Number of blue olive oil bottles = 22 + (6 x 9) = 43
Yellow olive oil bottles = Initial amount - Number of red olive oil bottles = 10 - (2 x 6) = 8
So, Janet has 43 green olive oil bottles and 8 yellow olive oil bottles now."
Response:  If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, then her average score is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 845 / 5 = 169. So, if she gets a score of 93 on the sixth test, her overall average will be (169 + 93) / 6 = 262 / 6 = 43.33. Therefore, Brinley needs to get a score of at least 43 on the sixth test to have an overall average of 93.
"Response: 
Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week and each time he covered 25 kilometers. So in one week, he covered 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers.
Then, for four weeks, he rode his bike 4 x 125 = 500 kilometers.
After that, he decided to ride only twice a week, but each time he covered 60 kilometers. For three weeks, he covered 3 x 60 = 180 kilometers.
So, in total, Michael covered 500 + 180 = 680 kilometers."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate candies and 80 jelly beans in Joeva's bag. Since each chocolate candy weighs twice as much as each jelly bean, we can find out how much each chocolate candy weighs by multiplying its weight by 2. So, the total weight of all the chocolate candies is:

25 chocolate candies x 2 = 50 grams

And the total weight of all the jelly beans is:

80 jelly beans x 1 = 80 grams

Therefore, the total weight of all the sweets in Joeva's bag is:

50 grams + 80 grams = 130 grams"
Response:  On Monday, she bought 4 cookies. If on Tuesday she bought three times more cookies than on Monday, then she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cookies. On Wednesday, she bought five times more cookies than on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cookies in total. Therefore, after all three days, she bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cookies.
"Response:  We have to calculate the cost of one cup and then multiply it by the number of cups needed. So we need to know how much is one cup of coffee. The question states that ""dvadeset desetina"" (which means 12) cups of coffee cost $1200 less than the total price of half a tanjir (which is $6000). Therefore, if we divide $6000 by 2, we get $3000 for each half-tanjir. Now, since there are 12 cups in a half-tanjir, we can calculate the cost of one cup as follows: Cost of one cup = $3000 / 12 = $250 per cup."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 already saved before she starts babysitting. Then, she earns $5 for each time she babysits, and her parents pay her $4 for each time she cuts the grass. So, after one babysitting session, she will have earned $9 (5 + 4). After two sessions, she will have earned $18 ($9 + 9), and so on... To find out how many times she needs to cut the grass to buy the jacket and shoes, we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem: Number of times Sara must cut the grass = Total amount needed for jacket and shoes / Amount she earns per time she cuts the grass. In this case, the total amount needed is $30 + $20 = $50, and the amount she earns per time she cuts the grass is $9. Therefore, number of times Sara must cut the grass = $50 / $9 = 5.5 times. Since you cannot cut the grass half a time, the final answer is 6 times.
Response:  We know that each day Jerry collects 42 eggs and there are two types of chickens - red and white. The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so they give him 3 x 7 = 21 eggs in total. And the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so they give him 5 x 8 = 40 eggs in total. Therefore, Jerry has 21 + 40 = 61 eggs from both types of chickens. Since there are more than twice as many white chickens as red ones (5 > 2), we can conclude that there are at least 2 times as many white chickens as red chickens. So, there must be at least 61 / 2 = 30.5 red chickens.
"Response:  We know that Gary is walking along the edge of a local park which has an irregular shape and measures 1.5 miles wide by 6 miles long. If he walks at a speed of 5 km/h, we can calculate how many hours he will spend walking as follows:
Time = Distance / Speed
In this case, the distance traveled by Gary is given as 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles. So, if he walks for 5 hours at a speed of 5 km/h, he will cover a total distance of 9 miles x 5 hours = 45 miles. Therefore, Gary will spend 45 minutes (or 0.75 hours) walking around the local park."
Response:  On day one, there were 100 customers in the store. If there were 50 more customers on the second day, then there would be 150 customers in total (100 + 50 = 150). And if the total number of customers on the third day was 500, then there must have been 350 customers on that day (500 - 150 = 350). Therefore, the correct answer is 350.
"Response:  The initial volume of water in the large basin was twice that of the small basin, so the total volume of water initially in both basins was:
Large basin: 2x = 8 gallons (since it had twice as much water as the small basin)
Small basin: x = 4 gallons (the initial volume of water in the small basin)
Now, after 4 minutes, the large basin loses 4 gallons per minute, and the small basin loses none. So, the new volume of water in each basin is:
Large basin: 8 - 4minutes * 4gal/minute = 6 gallons
Small basin: x = 4 gallons (unchanged)
Since the large basin now has four times as much water as the small basin, we can set up the equation:
Large basin volume = Small basin volume × 4
Solving for the small basin volume gives us:
x = 6 / 4 = 1.5 gallons
So, the small basin currently contains 1.5 gallons of water."
Response:  If she wants to buy shoes worth $320 and a matching belt that costs $32, then her total cost is $352. To calculate how many hours she needs to work, we can use the following formula: Total Cost / Hourly Wage = Number of Hours Worked. In this case, Total Cost = $352, and Hourly Wage = $8/hour. So, Number of Hours Worked = $352 / $8 = 44 hours. Therefore, she needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt.
Response:  If we assume that $2000 is the amount borrowed and $165 is the monthly payment for 12 months, then we can calculate the total amount paid as follows: Total Amount Paid = Monthly Payment x Number of Months = $165 x 12 = $2000 So, after 12 months, Janet will have paid off the entire loan amount of $2000. Therefore, her remaining balance will be zero.
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the vase and seven daisies more than roses. So, if there are x daisies in the vase, then there would be 4 + 7 = 11 flowers in total. Therefore, the answer is 11.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is twice as old as Zack. So we can write:
Adrian = 3Harriet
Harriet = 2Zack
Now we want to find out what is the average age of these three people in three years. So let's substitute the equations above into each other:
Average age = (Adrian + Harriet + Zack) / 3
= (3Harriet + Harriet + Zack) / 3
= (4Harriet + Zack) / 3
= (5Zack + Harriet) / 3
= (6Zack + 2Harriet) / 3
= (8Zack + 4Harriet) / 3
= (12Zack + 6Harriet) / 3
= (18Zack + 9Harriet) / 3
= (27Zack + 12Harriet) / 3
= (39Zack + 18Harriet) / 3
= (57Zack + 27Harriet) / 3
= (74Zack + 33Harriet) / 3
= (91Zack + 40Harriet) / 3
= (108Zack + 46Harriet) / 3
So the average age of these three people in three years will be approximately 60 years old."
"Response:  We know that four students played the game and scored a total of 251 points. Naomi got 68 points, Yuri got 10 more than half of what Naomi and Brianna got together (which is 17 points), and Jojo scored some number of points. So we can write an equation based on this information:

Jojo's score = Total score - Naomi's score - Yuri's bonus
= 251 - 68 - 10
= 174

Therefore, Jojo scored 174 points in the game."
"Response:  According to the question, Carmen took 10 minutes to finish the crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish the Sudoku puzzle. Since she solved 3 crosswords and 8 Sudokus during her weekend, we can calculate how much time she spent solving each type of puzzle as follows:
Time spent solving crosswords = Total time spent playing crosswords / Number of crosswords solved = (10 minutes + 5 minutes) / 3 = 4 minutes per crossword
Time spent solving Sudokus = Total time spent playing Sudokus / Number of Sudokus solved = (10 minutes + 5 minutes) / 8 = 2.75 minutes per Sudoku
Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 4 x 3 = 12 minutes solving crosswords and 2.75 x 8 = 22 minutes solving Sudokus during her weekend."
Response:  We know that Zaliva has 120 liters of water in her reservoir for irrigating her small garden. Celene used 90 liters of water from this reservoir to irrigate her garden. Therefore, there are 30 liters (120 - 90) left in the reservoir after Celene used some of it. So, the amount of water remaining in the reservoir is 30 liters.
Response:  If Andy has 90 geraniums and 40 petunias less than geraniums, then he has 50 petunias in total. So, the total number of flowers that Andy planted is 90 + 50 = 140.
Response:  In year one, TVRTKA spends $15,000 on advertising. Since they spend only one-third of that amount in the next year, they will spend $5,000 ($15,000 x (1/3)). So, in two years, TVRTKA has spent a total of $20,000 on advertising ($15,000 + $5,000).
Response:  If Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours and pays $30 per hour, he will pay $90 for using the canoe ($30 x 3 = $90). Similarly, if Benji uses the raft for 5 hours and pays $18 per hour, he will pay $90 for using the raft ($18 x 5 = $90). Therefore, the total amount that Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals is $180 ($90 + $90).
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half that time (or 3 days) to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car, then it will take an additional 3 days to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car. Therefore, the total number of days required for the trip is 9 days.
Response:  We know that James has 40 water-type cards and he lost 8 of them. So now he has 32 water-type cards left. Then, he bought 14 grass-type cards, so he has 14 + 8 = 22 grass-type cards in total. Now, we need to calculate the probability that the randomly chosen card will be a water type. Since there are 40 water types out of 56 total cards (including both water and grass), the probability is 40/56 or approximately 0.72.
Response:  Firstly, he ordered a basic burrito for lunch which cost $6.50. Then, he added extra meat ($2), cheese ($1), avocado ($1), and salsa ($0.25) to his order, making the total cost of his meal so far $9.45. Next, he decided to upgrade his meal with chips and drink for an additional $3, bringing the new total cost to $12.45. Finally, he used his $5 gift card at checkout, leaving him with no balance owed. Therefore, he still owes nothing.
Response:  Kalinda can add 4 pieces in one minute, so her mother can also do half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute. To find out how many hours they will need to complete this task, we divide the total number of pieces (360) by their combined rate (4 + 2 = 6). So it will take them approximately 60 hours to finish the puzzle.
Response:  If Ashlyn found that 30% of the lettuce was ready to be harvested after two months and collected 30% of it, then there were initially 120 x 0.7 = 84 lettuce plants ready for harvest. After two weeks, if 3/4 of the remaining plants (i.e., 84 - 30) were ready, then there were 84 x 0.75 = 62 lettuce plants ready for harvest. So, in total, Ashlyn collected 30 + 62 = 92 lettuce plants.
"Response:  The total number of cars that Mark buys is given as 12. Each car costs $20,000, so the total cost of all the cars is:

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

Mark pays 10% tax on each car, which means he pays $20,000 x 0.10 = $20,000 in taxes. Additionally, there is a registration fee of $1,000 for each car, so the total amount Mark pays for all the cars is:

$240,000 + $20,000 + $1,000 x 12 = $261,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of $261,000 for his fleet of 12 cars."
Response:  On Monday (ponedjeljak), Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, which means she collected 5 + 20 = 25 shells in total. On Tuesday (utorak), Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collects 2 x 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 mravi in the garden and Dax found half as many insects as flies, then the number of insects he found is equal to 50 x 0.5 = 25. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 50 + 25 = 75.
Response:  We know that 36 penguins are sitting on the snow and 1/3 of them (i.e., 12) jump into the water and swim in the ocean. So, there are now 36 - 12 = 24 penguins left on the shore. Now, another 1/3 of these penguins (i.e., 8) enter the cave to have dinner. Therefore, there are now 24 - 8 = 16 penguins remaining outside to bask in the sun.
Response:  We know that Steve eats twice as much as his daughter and he eats 6 days a week. So, if his daughter can produce 3 raisins per day, then Steve needs to eat 2 x 3 = 6 raisins per day. Therefore, one loaf of raisins would need to produce 6 / 10 = 0.6 raisins per day.
"Response:  We know that John has 20 friends and he wants to make sure each friend gets 4 pieces of pizza. Since the pizzas are sold in 8-piece portions, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to buy:

20 / 8 = 2.5
So John needs to buy 3 pizzas (since you can't buy a fraction of a pizza)."
Response:  If he uses one full ink cartridge to make 5 empty ones, then he will have 5 - 1 = 4 full ink cartridges left after making those 5 empty ones. So, if he buys 25 ink cartridges initially and makes 5 empty ones using each of them, he will have 25 - 5 = 20 full ink cartridges left.
Response:  If John used his $20 savings and added an additional $10, he had a total of $30 to invest. After one year, if it doubled, he would have $60. So, after one year, John had $60.
"Response: 
Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Joan is five years older than Mary.
Joan is also five years older than Jesse, which means that Jesse is two years younger than Joan.
So, if Jesse is 20 years old, then Joan must be 25 years old (since she is five years older than Mary).
And since Mary is two years younger than Joan, Mary is 23 years old (since she is two years younger than Joan and Joan is 25 years old).
Therefore, the total age of the three girls is: 23 + 25 + 20 = 68 years."
Response:  We know that there were initially 1000 students in the school and they left through one of three entrances (A, B or C). After some time, 30% of them left through entrance A, which means that 300 students left through this entrance. Now, we need to find out how many students left through each of the remaining two entrances. Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through entrance B, it means that 600 - 3(300) = 420 students left through entrance B. Finally, since all the remaining students left through entrance C, the number of students who left through entrance C is equal to 1000 - 420 = 580 students. Therefore, the total number of students who left through entrance C is 580.
Response:  We know that James has more sweets than Robert (James - Robert = 6). And we also know that John has twice as many bubble gums as Robert (John - Robert = 2 x 10 = 20). So if John has 54 sweets, then he must have 34 more sweets than James (54 - James = 34). Therefore, John has 34 + 6 = 40 more sweets than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they will have three books to read. If they both read each other's books as well as their own, then in total they will have read 3 + 2 = 5 books. Therefore, they will finish reading all the books in 5 sessions.
"Response: 
Mike has been writing letters to five people and stopped writing with two of them. He sends two letters every week, and each letter takes him 6 minutes to write. So, he spends a total of 12 minutes per week (2 letters x 6 minutes/letter) writing to these two people.
Now, let's calculate how much time Mike spends writing to the other three people. Since he doesn't write to them anymore, we can assume that he spent no time writing to them after stopping. Therefore, the total time Mike spends writing letters every week is 12 minutes."
"Response: 
Jason has 1000 minutes of phone calls per month, and he spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day. So, in one month, he talks to his boss for 15 x 30 = 450 minutes.
Now, he has 300 additional minutes of calls to other people this month. So, his total number of minutes of phone calls is 1000 - 450 + 300 = 650 minutes.
Therefore, Jason has 650 minutes of phone calls this month."
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 pomfrits and Kyle took 5 of them. So, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 pomfrits left. Then, Billy took twice as many pomfrits as Kyle did, so he took 2 \* 5 = 10 pomfrits from Griffin. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 pomfrits left. After that, Ginger gave Griffin her collection of crumpets, which we assume is equal to 3 times the number of pomfrits that Kyle took (since she gave him 3 fewer than what he took). Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 3 \* 5 = 15 crumpets. Finally, Colby took 3 less than the number of crumpets that Griffin received from Ginger, so he took 3 \* 15 = 45 crumpets from Griffin. Thus, at the end of all these events, Griffin had 9 + 15 - 45 = 27 crumpets.
Response:  In one aquarium there are 4 turtles and in another aquarium there are 32 fish. The difference between the number of turtles in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. If we assume that the number of fish in both aquariums is the same, then...
"Response: 
Jeansova šminkerka charges $250 per hour and she works for 6 hours every day (for a total of 36 hours per week). Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks, she will work for a total of 180 hours (36 x 5 = 180) during that time.
The amount Jean pays is calculated as follows:
$250/hour x 180 hours = $45,000
Now, let's calculate the discount Jean gets after the movie is finished:
$45,000 x 10% = $4,500
So, Jean pays a total of $40,500 ($45,000 - $4,500)."
Response:  We know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on party favors. Since she shared the cost with her parents, we can assume that each of them contributed equally to the total cost. Therefore, the amount that each parent paid is equal to one-third of the total cost. So, if we calculate the total cost as follows: Total Cost = Ingredients + Gifts + Decorations + Invitations + Party Favors = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 Now, let's divide the total cost among three people: Parent 1: Share of Cost = $96 / 3 = $32 Parent 2: Share of Cost = $96 / 3 = $32 Parent 3 (Isabella): Share of Cost = $96 / 3 = $32 So, each parent paid $32 towards the cost of the party.
Response:  The total weight of the luk is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since each kilogram costs $1.50, then the cost of all the luk is 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300. So, the cook spent $300.
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. Then, on Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 5 = 10 cookies. Therefore, in total, Sue ate 20 + 10 = 30 cookies. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 30 x 200 = 6000 calories more than her sister.
