"Response: 
Janet makes 16 eggs per day and sells each egg for $2. So she earns $32 per day from selling eggs (16 x $2 = $32).  Now let's consider how much money she earns from making muffins. She bakes 4 muffins every morning and sells them for $5 each. Therefore, she earns $20 per day from selling muffins ($5 x 4 = $20). In total, Janet earns $52 per day from both her egg business and muffin-making business ($32 + $20 = $52)."
Response:  We have 2 blue threads and half of white thread. To calculate how many stitches it will take, we need to divide the total length of the fabric by the length of one stitch. The length of one stitch is equal to half of the width of the thread plus half of the width of the other thread (since they are both used together). So, if we assume that the width of each thread is 1 cm, then the length of one stitch would be: Length of one stitch = Half of blue thread width + Half of white thread width = 0.5 cm + 0.5 cm = 1 cm. Now, let's calculate how many stitches we can make with the given amount of thread: Number of stitches = Total length of fabric / Length of one stitch = 10 cm / 1 cm = 10 stitches Therefore, it will take 10 stitches to sew the piece of fabric using the given amount of thread.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the original price of the house before Josh bought it. We know that the house cost $80,000, so the original price is $80,000. Then, Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150% (according to the problem). So, the new value of the house after the repairs is: New Value = Original Price x (1 + Percentage Increase) = $80,000 x (1 + 150%) = $120,000 Now, let's find out how much profit Josh made from selling the house: Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price = $120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000 Therefore, Josh made a profit of $40,000 from selling the house.
"Response:  If he runs 60 meters per sprint and does three sprints per day, then he will run a total distance of:

3 x 60 = 180 meters per day

So, in one week (7 days), he will run a total distance of:

180 meters/day x 7 days = 1260 meters per week

Therefore, the answer is 1260 meters."
Response:  We know that Wendy gives her curts 15 shakes of mixed feed every morning and then another 25 shakes in the afternoon. So, in total, she gives them 40 shakes of food per day. If the size of Wendy's fleet is 20 cats, we need to divide the total number of shakes of food given to the cats by the number of cats in the fleet. Therefore, the answer is 40/20 = 2.
"Response:  If one cup costs $5 and each subsequent cup costs only 60% of its previous price, then we can find the cost of n cups as follows:
Cost = (n-1) x $5 + (n/2) x ($5 / 60%)
= (16 - 1) x $5 + (16 / 2) x ($5 / 60%)
= $80 + $40
= $120
So Kylar will have to pay $120 for 16 cups."
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse has 2 x 2 = 4 sheeps more than Seattle. Therefore, Toulouse has 20 + 4 = 24 sheep in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla has to download a file of size 200 GB. The normal speed of downloading is 2 GB per minute, so it will take 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download the entire file. However, during the download process, Windows needs to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. After the update installation, Carla must restart the download from the beginning, which means she loses 40% of the progress made so far. Therefore, the remaining time for downloading the file is 60 minutes (or 1 hour and 10 minutes). So, the total time taken to download the file is 160 minutes or 2 hours and 40 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, John travelled at a speed of 60mph for 3 hours, which means he covered a distance of 60 x 3 = 180 miles. Then, he turned around and started moving back home. In the first two hours (or 2/3 of the total time), his speed was 30 miles per hour, so he covered a distance of 30 x 2 = 60 miles. After that, he increased his speed to 80 miles per hour for the remaining 2 hours, covering a distance of 80 x 2 = 160 miles. Therefore, after 4 hours, John is 160 - 180 = -20 miles away from his destination (i.e., home).
Response:  If Eliza works for 40 hours per week and earns $10/hour, her weekly salary is $400 ($10/hour x 40 hours/week). Then, she gets overtime pay of $1.2 times her hourly wage for each additional hour worked beyond 40 hours, so her total weekly income including overtime is: $400 + (1.2 x $10) = $400 + $120 = $520 per week.
Response:  In month 1, there were 60 downloads.  In month 2, there were 3 times more downloads than in month 1 = 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.  In month 3, there were 30% fewer downloads than in month 2 = 180 - (30/100) x 180 = 126 downloads. So, over three months, there were 126 + 180 + 60 = 466 downloads.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that she bought 3 types of pastries:

1. Šišiek (which means ""rolls"" in Slovak) - 3 rolls cost $68.
2. Mini cupcakes - 2 packs of mini cupcakes cost $80.
3. Mini cheesecakes - 6 packs of mini cheesecakes cost $55.

So, the total amount spent on pastries is:

$68 + $80 + $55 = $203

Therefore, the correct answer is $203."
Response:  First year:  * Revenue from selling lemons = 7 x $1.5 = $10 + V&M cost = $3 = $13  Second year:  * Revenue from selling lemons = 7 x $1.5 = $10 + V&M cost = $3 = $13  Third year:  * Revenue from selling lemons = 7 x $1.5 = $10 + V&M cost = $3 = $13... (Year n) = * Revenue from selling lemons = 7 x $1.5 = $10 + V&M cost = $3 = $13 Total revenue = $13 x number of years = $13 x 90 = $1,120 So it will take approximately 90 years for the lemon tree to start making money.
Response:  Melanie gave away one-third of her savings from the green house (3/5) = 60%. She also gave away half of what was left in the red house (2/4) = 50%. So far, she has given away a total of 110% of her original savings. Therefore, if Melanie had 5 savings at the beginning, she would have 4 remaining (5 - 110%) = 4.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students, 20% are enrolled in contemporary dance, which means 4 students (20% x 20).  Out of the remaining 16 students, 25% are enrolled in jazz dance, which means 4 students (25% x 16 = 4). And finally, out of the remaining 8 students, 33% are enrolled in hip-hop dance, which means 2 students (33% x 8 = 2). Therefore, the total number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 2 + 4 + 2 = 8. So, 8/20 or 40% of the students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the expected value of each investment plan based on their respective growth rates. For the jewelry market, the expected growth rate is 2.5%, and for the electronic device market, it's 1.2%. Now, let's calculate the expected value of each investment as follows: Jewelry Market: Expected Value = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) ^ 3 = $5,475 Electronic Device Market: Expected Value = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) ^ 3 = $8,696 Next, we need to compare these two values to determine which investment has the higher expected return. The higher expected return means that the investor will have more money at the end of the month if they choose that option. In this case, the calculated expected value of the jewelry market is higher than that of the electronic device market, so the optimal choice for the investor would be to invest in jewelry. Therefore, the answer is: Invest in jewelry.
Response:  Day 1: Vlak 1 travels west for 80 miles and then north for 150 miles. So, it has traveled a total distance of 230 miles (80 + 150).  Day 2: Vlak 2 travels east for 80 miles to catch up with Vlak 1, which means that Vlak 2 has also traveled 80 miles. Now, both trains are together again, so their combined distance traveled is 230 miles + 80 miles = 310 miles. Therefore, the answer is 310 miles.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jill earns as an English teacher per week. We know that she works 35 hours/week as an English teacher and her hourly wage is $20. Therefore, her weekly income from teaching is: $$ \therefore \text {Weekly income from teaching} = 35 \times 20 = 700 \$. Next, we need to calculate how much Jill earns as a fitness trainer per week. We know that she works 15 hours/week as a fitness trainer and her hourly wage is $30. Therefore, her weekly income from training is: $$ \therefore \text{Weekly income from training} = 15 \times 30 = 450 \$. Now, let's add both of these amounts together to find out Jill's total annual income: $$ \therefore \text{Total annual income} = 700 + 450 = 1,150 \$. So, Jill's annual salary is $1,150.
"Response:  If Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning for breakfast and she does it for 4 weeks, then we can calculate how many eggs she used in total as follows:

Week 1: 3 x 7 = 21 egg omelets
Week 2: 3 x 8 = 24 egg omelets
Week 3: 3 x 9 = 27 egg omelets
Week 4: 3 x 10 = 30 egg omelets
Total number of egg omelets made by Claire = 21 + 24 + 27 + 30 = 122 egg omelets
Therefore, Claire used 122 eggs in total over the course of 4 weeks."
Response:  First, we know that Marissa traveled for 12 miles in total. Then, she walked for an hour and covered 4 miles. So, her average speed during this hour was 4/1 = 4 miles per hour. Now, to find out how many hours it took her to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles, we can divide the remaining distance by her average speed: 8 miles / 4 miles/hour = 2 hours. Therefore, Marissa traveled for 2 hours to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles.
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice and we want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice. So, the total volume is 25 liters (10 + 15). When we add one liter of orange juice to this mixture, the new volume will be 26 liters (25 + 1). Therefore, there are 26 liters of water left in the remaining 24 liters.
Response:  We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha and he has a son who is 23 years old now. So, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then she must have been born when Raymond was 25 years old (6 + 25 = 31). Therefore, Raymond's son was born 8 years ago (31 - 23 = 8).
Response:  The first three customers bought one each, so that's 3 DVDs. The next two customers bought two each, so that's another 2 DVDs. Finally, none of the last three customers bought any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs. Therefore, in total, Billy sold 3 + 2 + 0 = 5 DVDs on Wednesday.
Response:  If the pendulum swings down 2 cm for every hour it is raised, and it takes 5 hours to reach its maximum height of 10 cm, then after 5 hours, the distance from the starting point will be:  Distance = Speed x Time = 2 cm/h x 5 h = 10 cm - 10 cm = 0 cm So, the pendulum will not move any further after 5 hours.
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book and there is a 25% discount from the original price. So we can write an equation as follows:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $26.00

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for her meal. This means she bought:

* 1 x Kuracie jedlo ($12) = $12
* 5 x Mliek ($3 x 5) = $15
* 4 x Jablky ($1.50 x 4) = $6
Total cost of food = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33
Since Marie also bought some pizza, we can calculate how many pieces she bought based on the total cost of food and the price per piece of pizza:
$33 / $8.50 (price per pizza slice) = 4 pieces of pizza
Therefore, Marie bought 4 pieces of pizza."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mis
"Response: 
Cynthia eats one portion of ice cream every night for $4 per portion. How much will she spend in total after 60 days?
To find out how much Cynthia spends on ice cream over time, we need to calculate the number of portions she buys each day and then multiply that by the cost per portion. So, if she buys one portion of ice cream every night, she will buy 60 \* 30 = 1800 portions of ice cream over 60 days. Therefore, her total expenditure on ice cream is:
$$ Total Expenditure = Number of Portions \times Cost per Portion $$
$ Total Expenditure = 1800 \times 4 $
Total Expenditure = $7200
Therefore, Cynthia will spend $7200 on ice cream over 60 days."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Henry stopped after 20 miles and then he continued cycling for another 40 miles before reaching his destination. So, the distance traveled between the first and second stops is equal to 40 - 20 = 20 miles.
Response:  We know that Gloria has to choose between $50 worth of small boxes and two pairs of high-quality socks that cost $49 each. So, in total, she needs to spend at most $50 + ($2 x $49) = $50 + $98 = $148. Therefore, the price of the small boxes is $148 / $50 = $2.96 per box.
"Response:  If Vek Darrella is currently in the position of 7:11 and his total weight now is 162 kg, we can calculate Allen's weight after 10 years as follows:

Allen's weight = Total weight x Time elapsed (in years) / 10
= 162 kg x 10 years / 10
= 1620 kg

Therefore, Allen's weight after 10 years will be approximately 1620 kg."
Response:  The first friend said there are 80 marbles in the jar. The second friend said that 20 is more than half of the first friend's number, so there must be at least 40 marbles in the jar (since 20 + 20 = 40). The third friend said that their estimate is 25% more than the first friend's number, which means they estimated 100 marbles ( since 80 x 125% = 100). Therefore, the approximate number of marbles in the jar is 100 + 40 = 140.
Response:  If John has to take care of 10 dogs and each dog needs 0.5 hours of exercise per day, then he will spend 0.5 x 10 = 5 hours per day taking care of the dogs. Therefore, John spends 5 hours/day \* 7 days/week = 35 hours/week taking care of the dogs.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and 30 of them are more valuable than silver coins. So, if we subtract the number of silver coins from the total number of coins, we get: 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, Gretchen has 80 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more diamonds than Raymon
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he had 4/40 = 1/10 of the total score. Since he increased his score by 25%, that means he got (1/10) \* (1 + 25%) = 3/10 of the remaining score. So, in total, Mike scored 4 + 3 = 7 points.
Response:  Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Currently, they are being sold for $4 each. How much will he spend in 30 days?  To find out, we need to multiply the number of yogurts he eats per day by the number of days he will be buying them. So, Terry will spend $8 per day ($4 x 2). In 30 days, he will have spent a total of $240 (8 x 30).
Response:  Firstly, John has $15 for each of his 13 LEGO sets, which means he has a total of $195 ($15 x 13). Then, he buys 8 video games for $20 per game, so he spends a total of $160 ($20 x 8). Finally, he is left with $5 after buying the video games, so there are still 13 LEGO sets left. Therefore, John still has 13 LEGO sets.
Response:  On day one, John runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 km.  On day two, he runs for half the time (i.e., 2/3) of day one, which is 2/3 x 60 = 40 km. Therefore, in total, John has covered a distance of 180 + 40 = 220 km during these two days. Now, let's calculate how far he will run each day if he continues to run at this pace for another 79 days: Day 3: He will run for 2/3 x 60 = 40 km per day. Total distance covered after 79 days = 40 x 79 = 3,160 km. So, John ran a total distance of 3,160 km in 79 days.
"Response:  If Dana can run 4 times faster than walking and jump half as fast as running, then she can walk at a speed of $ \frac{1}{2} \times 3 miles/hour = 1.5 miles/hour$.  Now, if she spends $\frac{1}{3}$ of her time running and $\frac{2}{3}$ of her time walking, then she will cover a total distance of:

$$ Distance = Time \times Speed $$

For running:

$$ Distance = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 hours \times 3 miles/hour = 9 miles $$

For walking:

$$ Distance = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 hours \times 1.5 miles/hour = 9 miles $$

Therefore, Dana can cover a total distance of $9 + 9 = 18 miles$ in $6 hours$."
Response:  We know that Brandon's iPhone is four years older than Ben's iPhone. So, if Ben's iPhone is two years old, then Brandon's iPhone must be six years old (4 + 2 = 6). Now we also know that Suzy's iPhone is one year old, so Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is three times as old as Suzy's iPhone (3 x 1 = 3).
Response:  First, we know that when Polly doesn't hold the dragon stone, she can throw her golden arrow 400 steps away from herself.  Then, we know that the great dragon can see and be angry at anything within 1000 steps of it. So if Polly holds the dragon stone, she can throw her golden arrow 600 steps away (since 400 + 200 = 600). Therefore, if Polly stands in one place and throws her golden arrow three times, she will be able to reach the great dragon each time, since the distance between them is less than 1000 steps after each throw.
Response:  Babička Jonesová gave 5 apple pie slices to the firefighters. She cut each slice into 8 pieces and placed 5 slices on a plate so that the guests could serve themselves. At the end of the evening, when the guests had taken their plates and eaten their apple pie slices, there were 14 slices left. How many slices did the guests take?
Response:  We know that one serving of chips contains 250 calories and weighs 30 grams. If you have eaten 5 servings of chips with a total weight of 300 grams, how many calories do you need to calculate in order not to exceed your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories if you have already consumed 1800 calories so far? To find out, we can use the following formula: Total Calories = Number of Servings x Calories per Serving x Weight of Each Serving So, for this case, Total Calories would be: Total Calories = 5 x 250 x 30 = 3750 calories Now, let's check whether the amount of calories from the chips you have eaten so far (1800) is less than or equal to the total number of calories calculated above (3750). Since 1800 is indeed less than or equal to 3750, it means that you are within your daily calorie goal and did not overeat. Therefore, the correct answer is: You cannot estimate the exact number of grams of chips you can eat without going over your daily calorie goal because the calculation depends on various factors such as the size of each serving, the type of food, and individual differences in metabolism. However, based on the information provided, you can safely assume that you have consumed around 3750 calories worth of chips so far, which is well below your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie can make 10 candles from one kilogram of beeswax. So if he sells each candle for $2, his total revenue will be:  Revenue = Number of candles x Price per candle = 10 x $2 = $20.  Now, we need to find out how much profit Charlie makes after selling all these candles. Profit = Total revenue - Cost = $20 - ($10/kg) x Number of kg = $20 - $10 x 20 = $40. Therefore, Charlie's pure profit is $40.
Response:  On Monday, she wrote 5 articles in 4 hours = 20 hours of work.  On Tuesday, she wrote 7 articles in 8 hours = 56 hours of work.  On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday = 14 articles in 8 hours = 112 hours of work. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles for three days is 20 + 56 + 112 = 198 hours.
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-its before she went to the coffee shop and bought a bag of them. Then, in her workplace, she put one Post-it note on each of the 220 different types of coffee cups. So, the total number of Post-its used is 220 x 1 = 220. Since we are told that there were 23 Post-its left over after she finished working, the number of Post-its in the original bag must be equal to the number of Post-its left over minus the number used, which is 23 - 80 = 57. Therefore, there were 57 Post-its in the original bag.
Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red cows as blue ones. So, if he bought x red cows, he also bought 2x blue cows. Since each red cow cost $50 more than each blue cow, we can write: Red cows: $50 + (blue cows price) = total cost of red cows Blue cows: $40 + (blue cows price) = total cost of blue cows Now, we are given that John spent $200 on blue cows and they cost him $40 each. Therefore, the total number of blue cows he bought is: Number of blue cows = Total cost / Price per cow = $200 / $40 = 5 cows Similarly, since John spent double the amount on red cows, the total number of red cows he bought is: Number of red cows = Double the number of blue cows = 5 x 2 = 10 cows Therefore, the total amount John spent on all his cows is: Total cost = Number of blue cows x Cost per cow + Number of red cows x Cost per cow = 5 x $40 + 10 x ($50 + $40) = $200 + $500 - $40 = $760
Response:  We know that Tracy used a long drill (4 feet) to dig holes for vegetables in her garden.  The drill was then cut into pieces of length 15 cm each. So, we need to find out how many pieces she got from the original drill. To do this, we can use division.  Number of pieces = Total length of drill / Length of each piece  In this case, total length of drill is 4 ft = 480 cm, and length of each piece is 15 cm = 150 mm.  Therefore, number of pieces = 480 cm / 150 mm = 3.2.  So, Tracy obtained 3.2 pieces from the original drill.
"Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units. So, we have:

Number of floors = 15
Number of units per floor = 8
Total number of units = Number of floors x Number of units per floor
= 15 x 8
= 120 units
Now, we are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that:

Occupied area = Total area / 4
= 120 units / 4
= 30 units
So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:
Unoccupied area = Total area - Occupied area
= 120 units - 30 units
= 90 units
Therefore, the total number of non-residential units in the building is 90."
"Response:  We know that Lloyd has chickens that produce 252 eggs per day and sell them for $2 per dozen. So, we can calculate how much money Lloyd makes in a week as follows:

Total number of eggs produced = Number of days x Total number of eggs per day
= 7 x 252
= 1,704 eggs

Now, let's convert the total number of eggs to dollars:

Money earned = Total number of eggs x Selling price per egg
= 1,704 eggs x $2
= $3,408

Therefore, Lloyd earns $3,408 per week from his chicken farm."
Response:  The boat can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour. It goes from one place to four places and then returns with a speed of 6 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it takes for the boat to return.  To solve this problem, we will use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.  First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the boat in one direction: Distance = Speed x Time = 10 x (4 - 1) = 40 miles.  Now, let's calculate the time taken to cover that distance: Time = Distance / Speed = 40 / 10 = 4 hours. Therefore, it takes the boat 4 hours to return.
Response:  We know that there are 15 kilograms of books in the box and each comic book weighs 1 kilogram. Therefore, the total weight of the comics is 15 x 1 = 15 kilograms. Similarly, each toy weighs 1 kilogram, so the total weight of the toys is also 15 kilograms. To find out how many toys need to be removed to make up for the weight of the comics, we can divide the weight of the comics (15 kilograms) by the weight of one toy (1 kilogram). This gives us 15 / 1 = 15 toys. So, if 30 comics are removed from the box, 15 - 30 = 25 toys need to be removed to balance the weight.
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate how much money the mechanic earned from repairing tires of trucks and cars. For each repaired tire of a truck, the mechanic earns $60, and for each repaired tire of a car, he/she earns $40. Now, we know that the mechanic repaired 6 tires of trucks and 4 tires of cars on Thursday. So, his total earnings from these repairs are:  $$ Total earnings = 6 \times 60 + 4 \times 40 = 360 + 160 = 520$$ Therefore, the mechanic earned a total of $520 on Thursday.  Next, let's find out how many more dollars the mechanic earned on Friday compared to Thursday. We know that the mechanic did not repair any tires on Friday, so his income from this day is zero. Hence, the difference between the mechanic's income on Friday and Thursday is:  $$ Difference = Total earnings on Thursday - Total earnings on Friday = 520 - 0 = 520$$ Therefore, the mechanic earned $520 more on Thursday than on Friday.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:

* The first cat, Patchy, had three adopted kittens.
* The second cat, Trixie, had 12 adopted kittens.

So, if we add up the number of kittens that both cats had, we get:
3 + 12 = 15

Therefore, the family Doubtfire has 15 cats now."
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 lizards and he eats 2 of them. He wants to put both remaining lizards in one basket. So, we need to find out how many baskets Jean can fill with this amount of lizards. To do this, we divide the total number of lizards (30) by the number of lizards he can put in one basket (2):  Number of baskets = Total number of lizards / Number of lizards per basket = 30 / 2 = 15 baskets Therefore, Jean can fill 15 baskets with the remaining lizards.
Response:  If Peter has $42 to spend in total and he wants to go to the cinema twice, then he will have to pay for two tickets and two bags of popcorn. The cost of each ticket is $7, so he will need $14 for both tickets ($7 x 2 = $14). Additionally, the cost of each bag of popcorn is also $7, so he will need $14 for two bags of popcorn ($7 x 2 = $14). Therefore, if Peter has $42 to spend, he can only afford to go to the cinema once.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the truck and its load is 3755 libras (lb). The load consists of 5000 boxes each weighing 5 kg (kg), so the total weight of the load is 5 x 5000 = 25,000 lb. Now, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. To do this, we divide the maximum weight capacity of the bridge (in lb) by the weight of one box (in lb): max weight capacity / weight of one box = 5000 / 5 = 1000 boxes. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 1000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen ordered food worth $40 online. Then, there was an additional 25% charge added to his final total amounting to $10 (25% of $40). So, his new total amount became $50 ($40 + $10). After that, he paid $3 for delivery, bringing his new total amount to $47 ($50 - $3). Finally, he also had to pay $4 in taxes, making his new total amount $51 ($47 + $4). Therefore, the final cost of Stephen's food was $51.
"Response:  We know that there are 6 groups of plums with 20 plums in each group, so the total number of plums is:

$$ \text {Total number of plums} = 6 \times 20 = 120 $$

We also know that there are 67 individual plums scattered throughout the creek, so we need to add this amount to the total number of plums:

$$ \text{Total number of plums} = 120 + 67 = 187 $$

Therefore, there are $187$ plums in total in the creek."
Response:  We know that 25 is the total number of oranges in the basket. From this group, 1 orange is bad (it tastes terrible). So, we have 24 good oranges left. Now, let's calculate the percentage of good oranges: 24/25 = 96%. Therefore, there are 96% good oranges in the basket, which means 23 good oranges out of 25.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Janet paid $500 for the material and $800 for the craftsmanship, so she paid a total of $1300. Then, she paid 10% of the remaining amount, which is $130 (($1300 - $800) x 10%). So, in total, Janet paid $1430.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ak has worked for this company for 40 years and will receive an annual pension of $50,000 per year after retirement. Then, he has been working for 20 years and is entitled to 5% of his pension annually. Finally, he stops working after 30 years. So, we can calculate his annual pension as follows: Annual Pension = (Total Years Worked x Average Yearly Earnings) - (Years Worked Before Retirement x Percentage of Pension Entitlement) = ($40 \times $50,000) - ($20 \times 5%) = $800,000 - $10,000 = $790,000 Therefore, Ak's annual pension after 30 years of work would be $790,000.
Response:  First half of the year ( January to June):  $140 x 6 = $840  Second half of the year (July to December): $840 x 9/12 = $576 Total amount paid for the year: $840 + $576 = $1,416
Response:  We know that Sophia has driven for 160 kilometers since her last fill-up and needs to put in 4 gallons of gasoline to refill her tank again. Her car's fuel tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline. To find out how far she can go with one full tank of gasoline, we need to divide the total distance traveled (160 km) by the amount of gasoline left in the tank (4 gallons). So, Sophia can travel approximately 40 miles (160 km / 4 gal = 40 mi) on one full tank of gasoline.
"Response:  Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then decides to go to bed and read for half of that time. So he spends 1 hour reading after watching TV. Now, let's assume he does this every day (Monday to Friday).

For Monday:
Jim watches TV for 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
He reads for half of that time = 120/2 = 60 minutes
So, Jim spends 60 minutes watching TV and 60 minutes reading on Monday.

For Tuesday to Friday:
Repeat the same process as above:
Tuesday: Jim watches TV for 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
He reads for half of that time = 120/2 = 60 minutes
Wednesday: Jim watches TV for 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
He reads for half of that time = 120/2 = 60 minutes
Thursday: Jim watches TV for 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
He reads for half of that time = 120/2 = 60 minutes
Friday: Jim watches TV for 2 hours = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
He reads for half of that time = 120/2 = 60 minutes

Total time spent watching TV and reading for 4 days = 60 + 60 + 60 + 60 = 240 minutes

Therefore, Jim spends 240 minutes watching TV and reading over 4 days."
"Response:  We know that there are four schools participating in the tournament and each school has two teams (girls and boys). So, we have:

* Number of girls' teams = 4 schools x 2 teams/school = 8 teams
* Number of boys' teams = 4 schools x 2 teams/school = 8 teams
* Total number of players = Number of girls' teams + Number of boys' teams = 8 + 8 = 16
* Total number of coaches = Number of teams x Coaches per team = 8 x 1 = 8 coaches

So, the total number of people (players and coaches) participating in the tournament is:

16 players + 8 coaches = 24"
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds in the chest, and each diamond is worth less than half as much as a dragon stone. So, if we have x dragon stones, then the value of all the diamonds is less than half x. Also, we know that there are three times as many emeralds as rubies, so if there are y rubies, then there are 3y emeralds. Finally, we know that there are 175 diamonds plus or minus 35 rubies, which means that the total number of gemstones in the chest is either 200 (if there are no rubies) or 235 (if there are 35 rubies). Therefore, the number of dragon stones must be between 146 and 189 inclusive. Since this range includes the correct answer of 175, we can conclude that the number of dragon stones in the chest is exactly 175.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in school. So if there are 60 girls and 5 students per teacher, then there must be 120 boys (since there are twice as many boys). Therefore, there are 120 boys in total. And since each boy has 5 teachers, we can conclude that there are 600 teachers in total (120 boys x 5 teachers/boy).
Response:  Bailey starts with some initial amount of money (let's call it x). Then she receives weekly payments of $5 for 8 weeks, so she has $40 ($5 x 8) in total. At the end of 8 weeks, she has $100 in total, which means she received an additional $60 ($100 - $40). So, initially Bailey had $x = $60.
"Response: 
Judy teaches for 5 hours per day during the week and an additional 8 hours on Saturday. If each class has 15 students, she earns $15 per student per hour. Therefore, her total income per week is:
$5 x 5 = $25 (hours taught per day) x $15/hour = $375 (total income per week)"
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one (i.e., 40 instructions), then Kelian needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both meals.
Response:  If Tommy sells 43 sušienoks and 23 plátek cheesecake, he will earn $132 (43 x $3) + $92 ($23 x $4). So, Tommy will have earned a total of $224.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Sheila will pay for each mobile phone. Since she paid $150 for each phone and there are five phones in total, her total cost would be:

$150 x 5 = $750

Now, let's find out how much interest she will have to pay over three months based on the given percentage of 2%. The interest can be calculated as follows:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $750 x 2% x 3/12
= $45

So, Sheila's total payment for all five mobiles over three months would be:

Total Payment = Cost + Interest
= $750 + $45
= $895

Therefore, Sheila will have to pay $895 for all five mobiles over three months."
Response:  If Artie sells each type of flower at $2.74, $1.87, and $2.12 per bouquet respectively, then he will sell:  Nalievky - 12 x $2.74 = $32.96 Petúnie - 9 x $1.87 = $16.53 Begónie - 17 x $2.12 = $35.34 Total sales = $32.96 + $16.53 + $35.34 = $84.83 So if Artie sells 12 bunches of nalievky, 9 bunches of petunia, and 17 bunches of begonias, he will make a total of $84.83.
"Response:  If we have a level of the castle with an area of $ \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8$ square meters and each subsequent level has half the area of the previous one, then the areas of the levels will be:

Level 1: $\frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8$ square meters
Level 2: $\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 4$ square meters
Level 3: $\frac{1}{8} \times 4 = 2$ square meters
Level 4: $\frac{1}{16} \times 2 = 1$ square meter

So, the total area of the castle is:

Area of the castle = Area of Level 1 + Area of Level 2 +... + Area of Level 4
= 8 + 4 + 2 + 1
= 15 square meters"
Response:  According to the problem statement, Cecilia needs to feed her new puppy dog food for 180 days. During this period, she must give the puppy one shot of dog food per day, and then increase the amount to two shots per day after that. If one bag of dog food contains 110 servings, how many bags will Cecilia use in the first year? To find out, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem: Number of bags = (Days x Shot size) / (Serving size x Number of shots/day) Days = 180 Shot size = 1 shot/day = 110 servings Serving size = 1 serving/bag = 110 servings/bag Number of bags = (180 x 110) / (110 x 2) = 360 bags In conclusion, according to the problem, Cecilia will need 360 bags of dog food in the first year to feed her new puppy.
Response:  We know that Sarah has washed 4 times more clothes than David and she washes 400 liters of water per load. So, if David washed n loads, then Sarah washed n x 4 = 4n loads. Therefore, the difference in the number of loads is: 4n - n = 3n.
"Response:  If we buy 3 bunches of flowers for $2.50 each or 2 bunches for $1 each, then the total cost is:

$2.50 x 3 = $7.50 (for buying 3 bunches)
$1 x 2 = $2 (for buying 2 bunches)
So, the total cost is either $7.50 or $2.
Now, let's find out how much money we will save if we buy 18 bunches instead of separately:
Total cost of 18 bunches = Total cost of 3 bunches + Total cost of 2 bunches
= $7.50 + $2
= $9.50
So, by buying 18 bunches, we will save $9.50 - $7.50 = $2.
Therefore, the answer is $2."
Response:  The original price of the psaltery is $100. If John buys it, he will get a discount of 30%, which means that he will pay $70 instead of $100. So, the cost of oshetrine is $70.
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 4 liters (since 24 / 6 = 4). Then, one boy took 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water left after he took it is: 4 - 6 = -2 liters. Therefore, there are -2 liters of water left.
Response:  Charlie has 10 pencils and buys 21 more from the shop in the mall. So he has 31 pencils now (10 + 21 = 31). Then, he gives 9 pencils to his sister and uses 28 for decorating the room. Therefore, Charlie has 31 - 9 - 28 = 4 pencils left.
Response:  We know that Grace weighs 40 kg and Alex weighs less than her. So, if we divide the weight of Alex by 2, we will get the weight of Grace in kilograms. Therefore, the total weight of both is 40 + (2/3) x 40 = 60 kg.
"Response:  We have:

* 3 rose-colored kites (Dan)
* Each rose-colored kite has 25 roses (ruže).
* Each rose has 8 thorns (trně).

So, we can calculate the total number of thorns as follows:

Total number of thorns = Number of kites x Number of roses per kite x Number of thorns per rose
= 3 x 25 x 8
= 1000

Therefore, there are 1000 thorns in total."
Response:  We know that they played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost. So, if they won x games, then they lost 22 - x games. Since they won 8 more than they lost, we can set up an equation as follows: 8 = x + (22 - x). Solving for x, we get: x = 14. Therefore, they won 14 games and lost 8 games.
"Response:  We know that Gene has been on vacation for 16 years (since he is currently 34 and started going on vacation at age 23). In each year of his vacation, he buys one souvenir t-shirt from each place he visits. So far, we have:

* Number of places visited = 4 (one per year)
* Total number of souvenir t-shirts bought = 4 x 16 = 64 t-shirts

Now, let's calculate how many decks of cards Gene has collected over the years:

* Each deck of cards contains 52 cards (standard deck size)
* Since Gene goes on vacation four times a year, he collects 52 x 4 = 208 decks of cards in total

Therefore, Gene has collected 64 t-shirts and 208 decks of cards during his 16 years of vacationing."
Response:  The first time the alarm went off, it rang four times (once in the morning). Then, the second time it went off, it rang three times longer than the first time (three times = six times total). Finally, the third time it went off, it rang for only half as long as the second time (half of three times = one and a half times). So, the alarm rang a total of 1 + 6 + 1/2 = 8 times.
Response:  First year (year 1): $600 x 1 = $600 Second year (year 2): $600 x 1 + 10% = $660 Third year (year 3): $660 x 1 + 10% = $728 Fourth year (year 4): $728 x 1 + 10% = $805 Fifth year (year 5): $805 x 1 + 10% = $886 Total annual salary after 5 years of service: $886 Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after 5 years of service is $886.
Response:  We know that Marilynina first recording sold 10 times more than Harald's and that the total number of copies sold was 88,000. So, if we divide the total number of copies sold by 10, we get the number of copies sold by Harald. Therefore, the answer is 8,800 (88,000 / 10).
"Response:  We know that there are 16 invitees and each of them will receive a gift bag with $2 inside. So, the total amount spent on gifts is:

$2 x 16 = $32

Now, we need to calculate how many gift bags Christina needs to buy for the party. Since 1/4 of the guests did not show up, we can assume that 3/4 of the invited guests actually attended the party. Therefore, the number of guests who attended the party is:

16 / 4 = 4

So, Christina needs to buy 4 x $32 = $128 worth of gift bags."
Response:  If an adult dinosaur can eat 10 libras of salad in one time and a baby dinosaur can eat half of that, then the total amount of salad that all the dinosaurs can eat is:  Adult + Baby = 10 + (1/2) x 10 = 15 libras.  Since there are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 babies attending the picnic, we need to divide the total amount of salad among them:  Total Salad / Number of Dinosaurs = 15 / 25 = 0.6 libra per dinosaur. So, Ted needs to bring approximately 0.6 x 20 = 12 libras of salad to the picnic for all the dinosaurs to share.
"Response:  We know that:
Jan has three times more pets than Marcia.
Marcia has two dogs more than Cindy.
Cindy has four pets more than Jan.
So, if Jan has x pets, then Marcia has 3x pets, and Cindy has 4x pets.
We are asked to find out how many domestic animals (pets) there are in total.
Let's sum up all these amounts:
x + 3x = 2(4x)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 16
Therefore, there are 16 domestic animals (pets) in total."
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write:
Amy = Jackson + 5
Amy = Corey - 2
Now, we are given that James is one year younger than Corey. So, we can write:
James = Corey - 1
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
Amy = Jackson + 5
Amy = (Jackson + 5) + (-1)
Amy = Jackson + 4
Therefore, Jackson has 4 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lee can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, and Gerald improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet. So, if Gerald runs 400 meters without obstacles, he will take approximately 35.2 seconds (38 seconds x 1.10). Now, let's calculate how much time Gerald will take to run 400 meters with obstacles: Time taken by Gerald = Time taken by Lee + Time taken by Lee to overcome obstacles Time taken by Lee = 38 seconds Time taken by Lee to overcome obstacles = 400 meters / 10 seconds per meter = 40 seconds Therefore, the time taken by Gerald to run 400 meters with obstacles is: Time taken by Gerald = 35.2 seconds + 40 seconds = 75.2 seconds
Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer dogs than cats and 3 more cats than dogs. So, if there are 60 dogs, then there are 48 cats. Now, we need to find out how many domesticated animals (cats or dogs) are around. Since there are 3 more cats than dogs, the number of domesticated cats is equal to the number of dogs minus 3. Therefore, the number of domesticated animals around is 60 - 3 = 57.
Response:  We know that there are 200 boys in the fifth grade and 2/5 of them are boys (i.e., 40). Therefore, the number of girls is 2/3 of 200, which is 133. So, there are 133 girls in the scout clubs who are not boys.
Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for only two-thirds of that time (i.e., 2/3 \* 9 = 6). So, Harry slept for 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James.
"Response:  We know that when Fred mixes preserved pickles into his sauce, he uses half of the total volume of the jar. So if he used half of a 16-ounce jar (which is equal to 8 ounces), and each jar contains three pickles, then we can calculate how many pickles Fred used as follows:

Number of pickles = Total amount of sauce / Amount of sauce per jar
= 8 ounces / 3 pickles per jar
= 2.67 pickles
So, Fred used approximately 2.67 pickles from the jar."
Response:  We know that some cars pass through the first 15 minutes of traffic jam, then another 20 cars pass during the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. Out of 30 cars on the route, 5 cars are chosen not to pass through the traffic jam. So, in the first 15 minutes, how many cars passed through the traffic jam?  Number of cars passing through the traffic jam = Total number of cars - Number of cars choosing not to pass through the traffic jam Total number of cars = 30 cars Choosing not to pass through the traffic jam = 5 cars Therefore, the number of cars passing through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is: Number of cars passing through the traffic jam = 30 x (100%) - 5 x (100%) = 28 cars
"Response:  We know that Maria has 18 new plant seedlings from her favorite nursery and she wants to give one plant to each of her friends and family members. If there are 40 windows in her big house with 2 plants per window (since we already counted the two plants she had), then the total number of plants she will have is:

18 new seedlings x 40 windows = 720 plants!"
Response:  First friend pressed the button 20 times before Jerome opened the door, so the first friend pressed the button 20 / 5 = 4 times more than Jerome.  Second friend pressed the button 1/4 more than the first friend, so he pressed it 4 x (1/4) = 1 time more than Jerome. Third friend pressed the button 10 times more than the second friend, so he pressed it 3 times more than Jerome. Fourth friend pressed the button 60 times, so he pressed it 60 / 4 = 15 times more than Jerome. Therefore, the total number of times the bell was rung is: 4 + 1 + 3 + 15 = 23.
"Response:  If Solo has already read 15 pages in one day (on Monday), and he has 4 days left to finish reading all 36 pages, then we can calculate how many pages he needs to read each day as follows:

Number of days left = 4 days
Total number of pages to be read = 36 pages

To find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of days left:

Pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days left
= 36 pages / 4 days
= 9 pages per day

Therefore, if Solo wants to finish reading all 36 pages within 4 days, he will need to read approximately 9 pages per day."
Response:  John drinks one glass of water for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, so he drinks 3 glasses of water per day. Since he doesn't drink any water during weekends, he drinks 21 glasses of water (3 x 7) in a week. Therefore, John drinks 21 glasses of water per week.
Response:  The distance from the coast to the city is 42 miles (68 km). Since it takes 10 minutes for the mist to cover each 3 miles of land, it will take 42/3 = 14 minutes for the mist to cover the entire city. Therefore, the answer is 14 minutes.
Response:  Poppy solved 1000-piece puzzle and put half of them (500 pieces) onto the table. Then her mother put one third (333 pieces) of the remaining pieces onto the table. So, how many pieces are left in the box?  There are 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces left in the box.
Response:  If Cody can make three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir makes 5 cookies, then how many cookies will both of them together make?
Response:  First, we need to find out how many cubic centimeters are in each cube. Since each side of the cube is 5 cm long, and there are 6 sides, the volume of one cube is: Volume = length x width x height = 5cm x 6cm x 4cm = 120 cubic centimeters. Now, let's calculate the total internal volume of all three boxes: Total volume = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box = 120 cm^3 + 120 cm^3 + 120 cm^3 = 360 cubic centimeters. Therefore, the total internal volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic centimeters.
"Response: 
Frankie watches TV every night after completing his homework. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour of his favorite show. On Wednesday, he watches several episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished his domestic work quickly and watched one hour of a long episode and a 30-minute series. In Friday, he had to stay late, so he watched two hours of TV. If he watched 7 hours of TV in total, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?"
Response:  We know that Henry made 15 more kolacheks than he intended and now has 110 total. So if he had only intended to make 10 (which is half of his current total), then he must have made 50 additional kolacheks. Therefore, Henry made 60 kolacheks last year in addition to the 10 he intended to make.
Response:  The price of gasoline is $3 per gallon and the company offers $20 cash back for each gallon purchased at that station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, how much will they pay after getting the cash back?  We can calculate this as follows:  Price of gasoline = $3/gallon Cash back = $20/gallon Total cost with cash back = $3/gallon x 10 gallons = $30 + $20 = $50 So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at that station, they will pay $50 in total, including the cash back.
Response:  We know that Beatrice has two wide and 24 long eggs, while Marcel has three wide and 14 long eggs. If they both eat their entire amount in one go, how much will they have eaten in total?  So, we can calculate it as follows:  Beatrice has 2 x 24 = 48 eggs, Marcel has 3 x 14 = 42 eggs. In total, they have eaten 48 + 42 = 90 eggs.
Response:  The boat took in 2 liters of water every 3 meters it traveled, and it took 6 minutes to travel 100 meters (since it was moving at a speed of 2 meters per second). So, in total, the boat took in 12 liters of water during its journey. Now, we know that from the shore, 64 seconds passed before Julia reached the beach. Therefore, if the distance between the shore and the beach is x meters, then we can set up the equation: 2 liters/3 meters = x meters / 64 seconds. Solving for x, we get: x = 100 meters. So, when Julia arrived at the beach, there were 100 liters of water in her canoe.
Response:  If each teacher cleans their table 3 times per hour and there are 4 teachers in total, then the number of times each table is cleaned per hour can be calculated as follows: Teacher A - 6 (3 x 2) = 12 Teacher B - 6 (3 x 2) = 12 Teacher C - 6 (3 x 2) = 12 Teacher D - 6 (3 x 2) = 12 So, the tables are cleaned 12 times per hour. Now, if they clean the tables 3 times per hour for a day, then the total number of times the tables are cleaned over the course of a day can be calculated as follows: Teacher A - 12 x 8 = 96 Teacher B - 12 x 8 = 96 Teacher C - 12 x 8 = 96 Teacher D - 12 x 8 = 96 In total, the tables are cleaned 96 times per day.
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers every day and it takes 15 days for them to bloom, then after 15 days he will have planted a total of 2 x 15 = 30 flowers. Now, if 5 of these flowers did not bloom, then we need to subtract that number from the total number of flowers. So, the final answer is 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.
Response:  We know that: * Jamalov telefon can store 6 times more images than Brittany's phone (6 x 50 = 300) * The number of birds visible in Jamalov's picture is 24 times greater than the number of images that Brittany's phone can hold (24 x 50 = 1200) So, if Jamalov's phone can store 1800 images, then the number of birds visible in his picture is: 1800 / 24 = 75 Therefore, there are 75 birds visible in Jamalov's picture.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has 10 pieces of 2x4 lumber (worth $10 each) and 5 pieces of 4x4 lumber (worth $16 each). So in total she has:

$10 x 10 = $100 for the 2x4 lumber
$16 x 5 = $80 for the 4x4 lumber
Total value of all wood = $100 + $80 = $180
Now let's assume that Sasha decides to sell all her wood at the current market price of 50% higher than before. So the new price of each piece of wood would be:

$100 / 0.5 = $200 per 2x4 piece
$80 / 0.5 = $160 per 4x4 piece
So if Sasha sells all her wood, she will make:

$200 x 10 = $2000 from the 2x4 lumber
$160 x 5 = $800 from the 4x4 lumber
Total profit = $2000 + $800 = $2800
Therefore, Sasha will make a total profit of $2800 from selling all her wood at the current market price."
Response:  We know that Katy used 7:13 to make coffee with sugar and water. So, she used 7 parts of sugar for every 13 parts of water. Now, we are asked how much sugar Katy used in total. To find this out, we need to multiply the number of parts of sugar (lyzhicheks) by the ratio of sugar to water (7:13). Therefore, if Katy used 120 lyzhicheks of sugar, then she used 84 lyzhicheks of sugar in total (since 120 x 7 = 840).
Response:  We know that John bought 2 pairs of fans for each of his 3 children. So in total he bought 6 pairs of fans = 12 fans. The cost per fan is $60. Therefore, John paid a total of $720 ($60 x 12).
Response:  On day one, two containers were delivered with each container containing 5 vehicles, so there were 10 vehicles in total (2 containers x 5 vehicles/container).  On the second day, more containers arrived and the total number of vehicles increased to 30 (not including the ones already present). Therefore, the number of additional containers that arrived on the second day is:  Number of additional containers = Total number of vehicles on second day - Total number of vehicles on first day  Number of additional containers = 30 - 10  Number of additional containers = 20
Response:  We know that Adrian's total salary was $120,000 higher than Lyla's after four years. So, if Adrian's salary increased by 40% in the last four years and he earned $40,000 more than before, then his current salary is $160,000 ($120,000 + $40,000). Therefore, the total salary of both Adrian and Lyla after four years will be $280,000 (Adrian's salary x 1.4) = $280,000.
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 blocks of paper per week for drawing and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he uses 8 blocks of paper per month (2 x 4 = 8). Since there are 30 sheets of paper on the roll, Miguel uses 30 / 8 = 4 sheets of paper per month. Therefore, each month, Miguel uses 4 sheets of paper for drawing.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so together they have 13 fruit (5 + 8 = 13). Then Kael brought twice as many apples and half as many oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples and 4 x 8 = 32 oranges. So in total, they have 13 + 10 + 32 = 67 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. The next two days she slept for 2 hours less than on Monday, so she slept for 6 hours each day. Therefore, in total during that week, Sadie slept for 40 hours (8 + 6 + 6).
Response:  Firstly, Rosie can run 10 miles in one hour, so she can cover 3 x 10 = 30 miles in 3 hours. Then, she runs for another 4 hours and covers 8 km/h x 4 = 32 km. Therefore, Rosie can cover 30 + 32 = 62 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jennie started helping her mother at the office, there were 60 lists that needed stamps and she was giving one-third of them (20 lists) already stamped. So, the number of lists that did not have stamps yet when Jennie started = 60 - 20 = 40 lists.
Response:  Julia bought one new bag of five pairs of skis and her husband also bought another bag with ten pairs of skis. So in total, there were 15 pairs of skis (5 + 10 = 15).
Response:  We know that Dylan bought 38 sausage rolls and 6 more fish rolls as sausage rolls. So in total he bought 38 + 6 = 44 rolls. Since each roll contains two pieces of Kolache, we can conclude that Dylan bought 44 x 2 = 88 Kolaches.
Response:  If Lily has 50 friends and Amy has 20 friends more than Lily, then Amy has 70 friends in total. So, if Lily finds 5 new friends, their combined number of friends will be 120 (Lily's + Amy's).
Response:  We know that one melon costs three times as much as each of the paprikas. So if one paprika costs $X, then one melon costs $3X. Similarly, we know that an orange costs $5 less than a melon. Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3X - $5 = $2X. Now, let's find out how many dollars Dillon will spend in total. If he buys 4 melons, their cost will be $3(4)X = $12X. He also wants to buy 20 paprikas, which will cost him $20X. Finally, he wants to buy 10 oranges, whose cost is $2X. Therefore, his total expenditure can be calculated as follows: Total Expenditure = $12X + $20X + $2X = $34X.
"Response:  We know that there are 500 patients in the hospital and each patient is observed for 24 minutes. So, the total time spent observing patients is:

Time = Number of patients x Observation time per patient
= 500 x 24
= 12,000 minutes

Now, we need to calculate how much money the hospital earns from these observations. We know that each doctor charges $150 per hour and the hospital charges each patient $200 per hour. Therefore, the total amount earned by the hospital from observation is:

Total amount earned = Number of doctors x Doctor's fee per hour x Time spent observing patients
+ Number of patients x Patient's fee per hour x Time spent observing patients

Let's assume there are X doctors working at the hospital and Y patients being observed. Then, we can write the equation as follows:

Total amount earned = X (150) (12,000) + Y (200) (12,000)

We are given that the number of doctors is 3 times the number of patients, so X = 3Y. Substituting this value into the above equation, we get:

Total amount earned = 3Y (150) (12,000) + Y (200) (12,000)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total amount earned = 3Y (180,000) + Y (240,000)

Therefore, the total amount earned by the hospital from observation is $360,000 ($180,000 from doctors + $240,000 from patients)."
Response:  We know that 60 seasonal workers were hired to play at Santa's workshop in Naji's store. Then, 30 of them got sick and left (2/3 x 60 = 40). Finally, 10 more elves got sick and left (10/30 x 60 = 20), so there are only 20 elves left.
Response:  In May, Joe spent $500. In June, he spent $440 less than in May, so he spent $60 less than $500 = $440. Therefore, Joe lost $100 ($500 - $440) during those two months.
Response:  Pam and Fred went to the carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster twice, while Fred rode it four times. Then they decided to go skiing together. If each ride cost $6, how many tickets did they use that day?  Solution:  To find out how many tickets they used, we need to multiply the number of rides Pam took by the cost per ride, and then add that amount to the number of rides Fred took. So, if Pam took two rides at $6 per ride, she used $12 in total ($6 x 2 = $12). And if Fred took four rides at $6 per ride, he used $24 in total ($6 x 4 = $24). Therefore, the total number of tickets used that day is $36 ($12 + $24).
Response:  On Monday, Walter traveled 6 kilometers. On Tuesday, he traveled 7 times farther than on Monday, so he traveled 42 kilometers (7 x 6 = 42). In total, he traveled 41 miles from Monday to Wednesday. Therefore, in Wednesday, he traveled 41 - 40 = 1 mile.
Response:  If Tom has 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he will pay:  Number of car washes per month = 4  x  number of months in a year = 12  So, total cost for car washes in a year = Total cost for one car wash x Number of car washes in a year = $15 x 12 = $180 Therefore, Tom will pay $180 for all 4 car washes in a year.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and he played 5 before comparing with Bobby. So, if we subtract 5 from 20, we get 15. Now, we know that Bobby has 5 times less than Brian, so Bobby has 15 / 5 = 3 video games. Therefore, Bobby has 3 video games.
Response:  We know that out of 27 one-horned creatures in the world, 9 (3/4) are located in the Skoczy Mountains. Since two-thirds of the Skoczy Mountain population are females, there are 14 female Skoczy Mountain one-horned creatures. Therefore, the number of male Skoczy Mountain one-horned creatures is 14 - 9 = 5. So, there are 5 males among the 27 one-horned creatures in the world.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all items that Rory wants to buy: Sušienky x 2 = $14.00 Vrecia čipov x 2 = $3.00 Total cost = $17.00 Now, there is a delivery fee of 20%, which means we have to subtract 20% of the total cost from it: $17.00 x 20% = $3.40 Delivery fee = $13.60 So, the final price for Rory's order will be $13.60.
Response:  If Mark took the first test for 8 hours and answered 5 questions per hour, he would have answered 40 questions in total (8 hours x 5 questions/hour).  If he then took the second test for 6 hours and answered 5 questions per hour again, he would have answered an additional 30 questions (6 hours x 5 questions/hour). Therefore, the total number of unanswered questions is 10 (40 - 30 = 10).
Response:  We know that there are 22 red beads and 4 times as many blue beads as red beads. So, if there are 12 blue beads, then there must be 48 red beads.
Response:  We have 20 available cars for rent and we know that 12 of them are automatic (A). So, the number of manual transmission cars is: 20 - 12 = 8. Now, let's find out what percentage of automatic cars there are among all available cars: Percentage of automatic cars = Number of automatic cars / Total number of cars x 100 = 12/20 x 100 = 60%. Therefore, 60% of the available cars are automatic.
Response:  There are 700 bees in total. Each worker bee is equal to 5 bees, and each drone is equal to 2 bees. So, there are 350 workers (5 x 700) and 140 drones (2 x 700). Therefore, there are 350 + 140 = 490 robots.
Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games per day and earns $10/hour working part-time, he will make $20 in one day (2 hours x $10/hour). Therefore, if he continues to play video games for 7 days straight, he will make a total of $140 ($20 x 7 days) during that time period.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John bought milk for $2, cheese for $3, eggs for $3, potatoes for $3, and bread for $4. So, in total, he spent:
$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $16
Now, if there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, then the amount of money John paid for those items will be:
$3 (cheese) x 10% = $0.30
$3 (eggs) x 10% = $0.30
$3 (potatoes) x 10% = $0.30
$4 (bread) x 10% = $0.40
So, the total amount of money John paid for everything including taxes is:
$16 + $0.30 + $0.30 + $0.30 + $0.40 = $17.40"
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total revenue of all clients for one week. The number of clients is given as 8 (3 existing clients + 5 potential clients). Each client will require 2 pieces of cleaning and sanitizing services at $2 each, so the total revenue from existing clients is:  Existing clients x Number of services per client x Price per service = $60. Similarly, the total revenue from potential clients is: Potential clients x Number of services per client x Price per service = $100. Therefore, the total revenue for one week is: Total revenue = Existing clients' revenue + Potential clients' revenue = $60 + $100 = $160. Next, we need to subtract the total cost of goods sold (COGS) from the total revenue. The COGS is given as $40, which represents the cost of buying and preparing the cleaning solutions used in the business. So, the profit for one week is: Profit = Total revenue - COGS = $160 - $40 = $120. Finally, since Lucas wants to make sure he has enough money to cover his expenses, he needs to set aside some amount for expenses. Let's assume he wants to save 20% of his profits for expenses, or $24 in this case ($120 x 20%). So, his net profit for one week is: Net profit = Profit - Expenses = $120 - $24 = $96.
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of orange grove and each hectare produces 100 oranges. He can harvest oranges every 3 months. So, in one year, John can harvest oranges for 4 times (3 months x 4 = 12 months). Therefore, John can harvest 400 oranges (10 hectares x 100 oranges/hectare x 4 times per year) during a year.
Response:  Firstly, there are 500 LEGO blocks in the big box.  Secondly, there is another box with three times as many blocks as the first one, so there are 3 x 500 = 1500 blocks in that box. Thirdly, there is another box with half as many blocks as the second one, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 blocks in that box. Finally, we have to add all these numbers together to find out how many LEGO blocks Johnny has collected in total. Therefore, the answer is: 500 + 1500 + 750 = 3050 LEGO blocks.
Response:  At first, 30 bees left the nest during the first 6 hours (Debra saw this). Then, half of that number returned in the next 6 hours (since Debra saw twice as many bees leaving than returning). So, after 12 hours, there were 15 bees left outside the nest (half of the original 30). Finally, all the bees that had left earlier came back, so at the end of 18 hours, there were no bees left outside the nest. Therefore, the answer is 15.
"Response:  We know that Brittany's mom gave $8 in small change (in dollars). So we can write this as:

$8 = 8 × $1 (since each dollar is equal to 1 penny)

Now, we need to find out how many pennies are equivalent to $8. To do this, we divide $8 by $0.10 (the value of one penny):

$8 ÷ $0.10 = 80 pennies

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave 80 pennies in small change ($8 / $0.10 = 80)."
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends.  Now we are told that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends, James has 4x friends.  Finally, we are given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. So we can set up the equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 4. Therefore, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook, and James has 16 friends on Facebook (since he has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve is farther away from school than Tim and can bike faster at 440 steps per minute. Therefore, it will take Steve longer to reach home after the teacher finishes their lesson. We are given that Steve lives 3 miles (or 4.8 kilometers) away from school, so he will need to travel for 3 miles in 1 mile = 5,280 feet = 1609.6 meters distance. Since Steve can bike at 440 steps/minute, he will cover this distance in time t = distance / speed = 1609.6 m / 440 steps/min = 3.6 minutes. Now let's consider Tim who can skateboard faster than Steve at 264 steps per minute. Tim lives 3 km away from school, which means he needs to travel for 3 km x 1000 m/km = 3000 m distance. Since Tim can skateboard faster than Steve, he will cover this distance in less time than Steve. Using the same formula as before, we get t = distance / speed = 3000 m / 264 steps/min = 11.4 minutes. So, Tim will be the winner if they both start racing at the same time, and Tim will overtake Steve after 11.4 minutes.
Response:  On day one, there were 5 people who rode bicycles and each person had to pay $0.25 for the tire. So, the total amount of money earned that day was: 5 x $0.25 = $1.25. Then, on the second day, 3 people rode tricycles and each person had to pay $0.25 for their tires too. Therefore, the total amount of money earned on the second day was: 3 x $0.25 = $0.75. Finally, someone came on a unicycle and paid $0.25 for their tire as well. So, the total amount of money earned that day was: $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25.
"Response:  We know that Carl bought 10 packages of dried mushrooms and in each package there are 6 pieces of cake. So we have:

Number of packages = Number of pieces of cake per package x Total number of packages
= 6 x 10
= 60 pieces of cake

Since each piece of cake costs $0.10, the total cost of all the pieces is:

Total cost = Number of pieces x Cost per piece
= 60 x $0.10
= $6.00

So, if Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will get $4.00 change (since $10 - $6.00 = $4.00)."
"Response:  We know that:

* Dave bought a large box of crackers (100).
* He ate half of them (50).
* Three robins took three crackers each (9).
* A magpie took two thirds of what was left (33).
* The last cracker was taken away by a crow (1).

So, in total, there were 50 + 9 + 33 = 82 crackers in the box when Dave bought it."
"Response: 
Kimo has three hours of class per day from Monday to Friday, which means he has 3 x 5 = 15 hours of classes per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month and 2 months in a semester, Kimo has a total of 15 x 4 = 60 hours of classes per month. Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends 60 x 2 = 120 hours on teaching."
Response:  If Bill makes 300 rolls per day and each roll is 10 cm long, then he has made a total of 300 x 10 = 3000 cm of pasta in one day. Similarly, if he makes 120 chocolate croissants per day and each croissant is 15 cm long, then he has made a total of 120 x 15 = 1800 cm of croissants in one day. Finally, if he makes 60 bagels per day and each bagel is 60 cm long, then he has made a total of 60 x 60 = 3600 cm of bagels in one day. In total, Bill has made 3000 + 1800 + 3600 = 7400 cm of pasta, croissants, and bagels in one day.
"Response:  We need to calculate how many bananas each type of monkey needs for two months and then add them up to find out how many we need in total. Here are the calculations:
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so they need 800 bananas for two months (400 x 2 = 800).
Howler monkeys need 100 bananas per month, so they need 200 bananas for two months (100 x 2 = 200).
Orangutans need 150 bananas per month, so they need 300 bananas for two months (150 x 2 = 300).
In total, we need 800 + 200 + 300 = 1300 bananas for two months."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Blake runs 100 yards in 15 minutes, which means he covers a distance of 100/15 = 6.67 yards per minute.  Next, we know that Kelly runs 40 yards and back, which means she covers a total distance of 40 + (-40) = 0 yards. Therefore, her time is not relevant to this problem. Finally, we can calculate the distance between the two runners at any given moment as follows: Distance = Speed x Time (in minutes), where speed is the rate at which Blake covers distance, which we have just calculated as 6.67 yards per minute. So if it takes Blake 15 minutes to cover 100 yards, then the distance between him and Kelly after 15 minutes would be: Distance = 6.67 x 15 = 99.5 yards. Now, let's assume that Kelly starts running when Blake has covered 99.5 yards, so she has to cover the remaining distance of 100 - 99.5 = 0.5 yards. Since she runs at a constant speed throughout, she will take the same amount of time to cover this short distance, which we can call t seconds. Then, the distance between them after t seconds is simply: Distance = Speed x Time = 6.67 x t = 6.67t yards. Therefore, the winner's lead after t seconds is equal to the distance between them multiplied by their relative speeds: Lead = Distance / (Speed of winner - Speed of loser). In this case, the speed of the winner is 6.67 yards per minute, and the speed of the loser is 0 yards per minute (since Kelly doesn't move). Plugging these values into the formula above gives us: Lead = 6.67t / (6.67 - 0) = 6.67t yards. So, after t seconds, the winner will lead the loser by a distance of 6.67t yards. To find out how far ahead the winner will be after 15 minutes, we can simply multiply the lead by 15: Winner's lead after 15 minutes = Lead x
Response:  First, he bought 4 pencils for $1.5 each = $6. Then, he bought 2 notebooks for $4 each = $8. Finally, he bought paper for $20. So, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  We know that Finn sees 6 fish swimming under the lily pad and then he sees 2 more hiding under the rock. So, in total, Finn sees 8 fish in the pond.
"Response:  We know that in Wednesday (utorok), the reservoir was 2 meters deeper than it was in Monday (pondelok). So, if the depth of water in the reservoir on Monday was x meters, then the depth of water in the reservoir on Wednesday was x + 2 meters.  Now we are told that on Thursday (streda), the depth of water in the reservoir was 2/3 of what it was on Wednesday. So, if the depth of water in the reservoir on Wednesday was y meters, then the depth of water in the reservoir on Thursday was y / 3 meters.  Putting these two equations together, we get:
y / 3 = (x + 2) / 3
Solving for y (the depth of water in the reservoir on Thursday), we get:
y = (4x + 6)/3
So, the depth of water in the reservoir on Thursday was 4 times the depth of water in the reservoir on Monday plus 6 meters.  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
y = (4(5) + 6) / 3
y = 20 / 3
y = 6.67 meters
Therefore, the depth of water in the reservoir on Thursday was 6.67 meters."
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea horses, and 3 clowns. Locsin caught fewer than Anakin in each category: 5 fewer sea stars, 3 fewer sea horses, and 2 more clowns than Anakin. So, if we subtract these amounts from Anakin's total catch, we get:  Sea stars: 10 - 5 = 5 Catch of Locsin Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3 Catch of Locsin Clowns: 3 + 2 = 5 Therefore, Anakin caught 5 sea stars, Locsin caught 3 sea stars, and Locsin caught 5 clowns.
Response:  The initial price of the watch is $20, and it increases by 20% every two months. So after one month, the new price will be: $20 x 1.2 = $24. After two months, the new price will be: $24 x 1.2 = $28.80. And so on... To find out how much the watch costs after 36 months, we can continue this process: $28.80 x 1.2 = $35.76. Therefore, the watch will cost $35.76 after 36 months.
Response:  We know that the red car cost $4 and the action figure costs $5. So, if we want to find out how much each toy costs, we can use the following equation: Cost of toy = Price of toy / Number of dollars spent on toy For example, if we spend $4 on the red car, then the cost of the red car is $4 / 1 = $4 per toy. Similarly, if we spend $3 on the action figure, then the cost of the action figure is $3 / 1 = $3 per toy. Therefore, the cost of each toy is as follows: Red car: $4 per toy Action figure: $3 per toy
Response:  If she pays $120 for her taxes herself, she will have to work 3 hours less and earn $35 per hour less than if she had an accountant do it. So, if she works 40 hours per week, she will save 12 hours x $35 = $420 per week. Therefore, she will have $420 - $120 = $300 more per week in her pocket if she pays her taxes herself.
Response:  Firstly, Elvira spent 1090 euros on the computer itself (including monitor, keyboard and mouse). Then she bought a scanner for 157 euros, a CD player for 74 euros, and a printer for 102 euros. Therefore, her total expenses are: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 euros. Since she had a budget of 1500 euros given by her family, she will have 1500 - 1423 = 77 euros left for clothing.
Response:  We know that to make one Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs. So if she wants to make 15 Spanish flans for her school charity, she will need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs. Now we have to divide this number by the number of times she has to check on the children while they are baking in the oven. According to the question, Sandra has to check on them every 20 minutes. Therefore, she will have to check on them 45 / 20 = 2.25 times.
"Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke and in 2 years their age difference will be 28 years. So, we can write an equation:
Seth's age = 2 x Brooke's age + 2
Now we have to solve for Seth's age. Substituting Brooke's age from the problem, we get:
Seth's age = 2 x 16 + 2
= 32 + 2
= 34
So, Seth is 34 years old."
Response:  If Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, and Ethel has $8, then we can say that Jimmy has $8 + $2 = $10. So, Jimmy has $10.
Response:  If Pancho ran 30 kilometers in one day, that means he covered 30/7 = 4.29 miles per day (since there are 7 days in a week). Therefore, he will cover 4.29 x 5 = 21.45 miles for the weekend.
Response:  The marching band wants to buy new uniforms. Each uniform costs $25 for the hat, $75 for the jacket (which is three times as much as the hat), and $40 for the pants (which are twice as much as the hat). So, how much does each uniform cost in total? We can calculate this by adding up the prices of all the items: $25 + $75 + $40 = $130. Therefore, each uniform costs $130.
Response:  We know that Jake saw 80 beetles with 8 legs and 90 insects with 6 legs. So far, we have counted 170 legs (8 x 8 + 6 x 90). Now let's consider the three rare mutant creatures with 10 legs each. That means there are 30 additional legs (10 x 3 = 30). Therefore, in total, Jake saw 200 legs (170 + 30 = 200).
"Response:  We know that Sally is 32 years old and has three children: Starka (16), Red (8), and Baby (4). So, we can write down the information as follows:
Sally = 32
Starka = 16
Red = 8
Baby = 4
Now, we are asked to find the total age of all four birds together. To do this, we need to add up their ages:
Total age = Sally + Starka + Red + Baby
= 32 + 16 + 8 + 4
= 50 years
So, the total age of all four birds together is 50 years."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica has to pay for all her debts in one month. The total amount of money she needs to pay is: $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000 per month. Now, if she wants to pay more than the minimum payment, let's say she wants to pay half of that amount which is: $1000 / 2 = $500 per month. So, Jessica will have to pay $500 per month for all her debts. To find out how much she will pay for a year, we can multiply this amount by 12: $500 x 12 = $6000 per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Billy has 60 carrots and he needs about 1 minute and 30 seconds (or 90 seconds) to peel each one of them. Therefore, it will take him approximately 54 minutes (60 x 90 = 5400 seconds) to peel all the carrots. Now, let's consider the time required for chopping the carrots. We are given that Billy can chop each carrot in about 5 seconds. So, it will take him approximately 12 minutes (60 x 5 = 300 seconds) to chop all the peeled carrots. Finally, we need to add the time taken for both tasks, which gives us a total time of approximately 66 minutes (54 + 12 = 66 minutes).
Response:  Firstly, we know that they sell each liter of lemonade for $0.50 and make $2 per gallon. So, if they sold 25 dollars worth of lemonade, they must have sold 50 liters (25 x $0.50/gal). Now, we need to calculate how much they spent on lemons. Since they made $2 per gallon, they spent $10 per gallon ($2 x 5 gal = $10) and since they sold 50 liters, they spent $500 on lemons ($10 x 50 liters = $500). Therefore, they spent $500 - $250 = $250 on lemons.
Response:  We know that there were 240 Asians (including 80 Japanese and 60 Chinese), so the number of girls among them is equal to the total number of boys minus the number of Japanese boys. Therefore, we can write: Number of girls = Total number of boys - Number of Japanese boys. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Number of girls = 240 - 80 = 160. So, there were 160 girls in the Chinese group.
Response:  Firstly, Zaid spends $1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $1500 (since he earns $6000 per month). Secondly, he spends $1/3 of his salary on fuel, which is $2000 (again, since he earns $6000 per month). Lastly, he donates half of what remains to his favorite charity, which is $3000 (since he has $6000 left after paying for rent and fuel). Therefore, the total amount that Zaid has left after all expenses and donations is $6000 - ($1500 + $2000) = $3500.
Response:  We know that Rani has more crabs than Monica, who has fewer crabs than Bo. So, we can start with Bo and count how many crabs he has:  Bo has 40 crabs. Now let's add up all the crabs of these three people:  Rani has 12 crabs more than Monica, so she has 12 + 4 = 16 crabs more than Bo. In total, there are 40 (Bo) + 16 (Rani) = 56 crabs.
Response:  First week (days 1-7): 5 hours/day x $10/hour = $50 total Second week (days 8-14): 8 hours/day x $10/hour = $60 total Total for two weeks: $50 + $60 = $110 Therefore, Lloyd earned $110 in two weeks.
Response:  We know that there are two candidates running for the representative position in the school election at Sarai School. The winner received 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in the election. To find out how many votes the loser got, we can use the following equation: Loser’s votes = Total votes - Winner’s votes. Substituting the given values into this equation, we get: Loser’s votes = 80 - (3/4)80 = 80 - 20 = 60 votes. Therefore, the loser received 60 votes.
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white carnations and also ordered 200 rose-colored lilies, which are five times more than white carnations. So, if we multiply these quantities together, we get:

Red roses = 4 x (red roses + white carnations) = 4 x (4 + 200) = 1600 red roses
Rose-colored lilies = 5 x (red roses + white carnations) = 5 x (1600 + 200) = 8000 rose-colored lilies
Total flowers = Red roses + Rose-colored lilies = 1600 + 8000 = 9600 flowers
Now, to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver in order for Sandra to continue her business, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of orders she received:

Number of red roses = Total flowers / Number of orders = 9600 / 5 = 1920 red roses
Therefore, Fred must deliver 1920 red roses to Sandra in order for her to continue her business."
"Response:  We know that:

* Jean is older than Mark by 2 years (given).
* Mark is younger than Jean by 5 years (given).
* Jean is 30 years old (given).

So, we can write an equation based on these statements:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Mark's age = Jean's age - 5

Now, let's solve for Jean's age:

Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
= 30 + 2
= 32

Therefore, Jean is 32 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we know that one of the teams has four members who run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds each. So, their total time for running 1200 meters (4 x 400) is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 280 seconds or 4 minutes and 40 seconds.  Now, let's consider the second team. We are told that their first member runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means their total time for running 1200 meters is 60 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 290 seconds or 4 minutes and 50 seconds. Since the second team is slower than the first team, they will take longer to complete the race. Therefore, if the two teams compete against each other, the faster team will win by a margin of 280 - 290 = 10 seconds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jerry threw a six-sided die. Since it is a fair die, each number has an equal probability of being thrown, which means that each number occurs with probability $ \frac{1}{6} $. Now, let's consider two cases: Case 1: The number thrown by Jerry is greater than 3. In this case, there are three numbers ($4$, $5$, or $6$) that are greater than $3$. Therefore, the probability that Jerry threw one of these numbers is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. So, the probability that Jerry threw a larger number than $3$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. Case 2: The number thrown by Jerry is less than or equal to $3$. In this case, there are only two numbers ($1$ and $2$) that are less than or equal to $3$. Therefore, the probability that Jerry threw one of these numbers is also $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. So, the probability that Jerry threw a smaller number than $3$ is also $\frac{1}{3}$. Now, we need to find the probability that Jerry threw a larger number than $3$ plus the probability that he threw a smaller number than $3$, which gives us the total probability that Jerry threw a larger number. Using the above calculations, we get: Total probability = Probability of throwing a larger number + Probability of throwing a smaller number = $\frac{1}{2}$ + $\frac{1}{3}$ = $\frac{7}{6}$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ Therefore, based on the given information, it is more likely that Jerry threw a number greater than $3$ than a number less than or equal to $3$.
Response:  Jenna picked half of the apples as her mother did. If Jenna picked 10 apples, then her mother must have had 20 - 10 = 10 apples left. So, both Jenna and her mother together picked 15 apples (half of 30).
Response:  We know that there are 3 groups of small mammals and each group has 10 individuals (totaling 30). Each individual is given 6 pieces of meat, so in total, we have 30 x 6 = 180 pieces of meat distributed among the three groups. Now, let's assume that there were originally 160 pieces of meat available before they were divided among the groups. Since there are 3 groups, and each group received an equal amount of meat (180 / 3 = 60), then each group must have received 60 pieces of meat. Therefore, there are 60 small mammals in each group.
"Response:  If Mandy pays $100 to Benedict after 3 months with an annual interest rate of 2%, then we can calculate it as follows:

Total amount paid = Principal + Interest
= $100 + (Interest x Time)
= $100 + ($2% x 3 months)
= $100 + $6
= $106
Therefore, Mandy will have to pay Benedict $106 after 3 months."
Response:  We know that the trader buys from the farmer several bags of wheat for $20 per bag and then sells each bag at $30 per bag. So, if he sold all the bags, he would make a total profit of $400. Now, we need to find out how many bags he sold. To do this, we can use the information given in the question that the cost of transporting one bag from the farm to the storage is $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling one bag = $30 (selling price) - $2 (transportation cost). So, if he sold x bags, his total revenue from selling those bags = $x \times ($30 - $2), or $x \times $28. Since he made a total profit of $400, we can set up the equation: $28x = $400. Solving for x, we get x = 16. Therefore, the trader sold 16 bags of wheat.
Response:  Firstly, they spent $20.25 for three tickets to the market. Then, they paid less than $4.50 per ticket as compared to the original price of $16 each. So, they saved $4.50 x 3 = $13.50. Next, they took two bus rides that cost $33 each. Therefore, if they equally divide their expenses among themselves, each person will pay $\frac{Total Expenses}{Number of People} = \frac{135 + 33}{3} = 45$.
Response:  If John can collect 3 hours of broken bricks in one hour, then he can collect 6 hours of broken bricks in 2 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). So, if he can collect 2 bricks per minute, he will have collected 12 bricks in 1 hour ( since 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 brick/minute x 60 minutes = 60 bricks). Therefore, John has collected 720 bricks (12 bricks/hour x 60 minutes/hour x 2 hours).
Response:  If each of the ten crows needs to eat 2.5 kg of food per week to survive, then they need a total of 25 kg (10 x 2.5) of food per week. So, in one day, each crow would need approximately 375 grams (25 / 7) of food.
Response:  In year 1, Tom has 10 trees and cuts 2 every year. So in year 10, he will have 50 - (2 x 10) = 40 trees left. Now, 30% of the remaining trees die each year, so in year 10, he loses 30/100 = 3 trees. Therefore, Tom has 40 - 3 = 37 trees left after 10 years.
Response:  On Friday morning, Susie and her friends put 18 red plastic flamingos in front of her house. In the afternoon, they took back three-quarters of them (i.e., 24 flamingos). Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 red plastic flamingos to the collection. So, at lunchtime on Sunday, there were 42 red plastic flamingos in total in front of Sue's house.
Response:  We know that Violetta wants to buy new pens in 5 different colors and has $20 for this purpose. Since one pen costs $2, we can calculate how many pens she will be able to buy as follows: Number of pens = Total amount available / Price of each pen = $20 / $2 = 10 pens So, Violetta will be able to buy 10 pens.
Response:  We know that one ceruzka costs $1.20 and one gumka costs $0.30. To find out how much 8 of each will cost, we can multiply the price of each item by 8. So, the total cost of 8 ceruzkas is $9.60 ($1.20 x 8), and the total cost of 8 gumkas is $2.40 ($0.30 x 8). Therefore, 8 per will cost a total of $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00.
Response:  We have to divide 200 liters of milk among 40 restaurants. Each restaurant will get 2 liters of milk. To find out how much milk each restaurant won't use, we need to subtract the amount they will receive from the total amount available (200 - 80 = 120). So, 120 liters of milk won't be used by any of the restaurants.
"Response:  We know that there are 23786 inhabitants in Soda and 8417 of them are men, which means that there are 15369 women (23786 - 8417 = 15369). Now we need to find out how many children there are in Soda. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of children = Total population x Percentage of population that are children. In this case, the percentage of children is given as ""Zvyšok populácie tvoria deti"" which means ""Children increase the population"". So, if we substitute the values we have obtained, we get: Number of children = 23786 x 0.3 = 7130. Therefore, there are approximately 7130 children living in Soda."
Response:  In month 1, Elaine collected 20 Pokémon cards. Then in month 2, she collected 3 times as many cards (60 cards). In month 3, she collected twice as many cards as in month 2 (120 cards). So far, Elaine has collected a total of 280 Pokémon cards.
Response:  We know that Mark is a editor and he has to edit 1000 vectors for two different publishers who pay him differently. Publisher A pays him double what Publisher B pays. So, if Publisher A pays $5 per vector, Publisher B pays $2.5 per vector. Now, we need to find out how much Mark earns in total for editing 1000 vectors. Total amount earned = Number of vectors edited x Price per vector For Mark, it would be: Total amount earned = 1000 x ($5 + $2.5) = $500 + $250 = $750 Therefore, Mark earns a total of $750 for editing 1000 vectors.
"Response: 
1) In the morning, he gets 5 VEDRO of water, and each VEDRO contains 5 LITROV of water. So in total, he gets 5 x 5 = 25 LITROV of water in the morning.
2) In the afternoon, he gets 6 VEDRO of water, and each VEDRO contains 5 LITROV of water. So in total, he gets 6 x 5 = 30 LITROV of water in the afternoon.
Total amount of water he gets in one day is: 25 + 30 = 55 LITROV of water per day."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John won an award in his work and received a one-time bonus of $5000 with a 5% increase in salary. We are also told that he earns $2000 per week every week throughout the year and received the bonus on the first day of the year. Therefore, we can calculate how much money John earned in that year as follows:

Weekly income = $2000 x number of weeks worked in a year = $2000 x 52 weeks/year (assuming a standard working year)
Total annual income = Weekly income x Number of years worked = $2000 x 1 year (since it is assumed to be a standard working year)
One-time bonus = $5000 + 5% of total annual income = $5000 + ($2000 x 5%) = $5000 + $1000 = $6000
So, John earned a total of $6000 in that year, including the one-time bonus."
Response:  Firstly, we know that each hectare of land produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Then, we are told that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, if we multiply the amount of grapes produced per hectar by the number of hectares used for grape cultivation (which is not given in the question), we get the total quantity of grapes produced annually by Josie's farm. This would be equal to 5 tons x number of hectares =? tons/year. Next, we can use this value and the fact that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine to calculate the total quantity of wine produced annually by Josie's farm. So, the final calculation would look like this: total quantity of wine produced annually by Josie's farm = total quantity of grapes produced annually by Josie's farm x number of barrels of wine produced from one ton of grapes =? barrels/year. Since we don't have any additional information about the size of a barrel or how many barrels fit into one ton of grapes, we cannot provide an exact numerical answer without further assumptions. However, based on these calculations, it seems likely that Josie's farm produces hundreds or even thousands of barrels of wine per year, depending on the specific sizes of the barrels and the amount of land used for grape cultivation.
Response:  We know that Carlo made 7 days of meals and used 2 sheets of cheese per day for breakfast. Therefore, he used a total of 14 sheets of cheese (2 x 7 = 14) for breakfast.  For lunch, he had soup with macaroni and cheese, which cost him $8 worth of cheese. So, he used 8 sheets of cheese for lunch ($8 / 2 = 4). In addition to this, he also had an egg omelette three times a week, using one more sheet of cheese each time (3 x 1 = 3). Therefore, the total number of sheets of cheese Carlo used is: 14 + 4 + 3 = 21 sheets of cheese.
"Response:  We know that Janet had initially 22 green and 10 yellow peri. Then she bought 6 blue peri with each containing 9 peri, and 2 red peri with each containing 6 peri. So, in total, Janet has now:

Green peri = 22 + 6 = 28
Yellow peri = 10 + 0 = 10
Blue peri = 6 x 9 = 54
Red peri = 2 x 6 = 12
Therefore, Janet has a total of 28 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 104 peri."
Response:  We know that Brinley has already scored 89, 71, 92, and 100 on the first five tests. To find out what score she needs on the sixth test to have an average of 93, we can use the formula for calculating the mean: Mean = (x1 + x2 +... + xn) / n Where x is each score and n is the number of scores. In this case, the scores are: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. So, we need to add these numbers together and divide by the total number of scores: Mean = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 458 / 5 = 91.6. Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 91.6 on the sixth test to have an average of 93.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Michael rode his bike at least 5 times per week and covered 25 kilometers for each ride during the first four weeks. Therefore, he covered a total distance of 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers in those four weeks.  Then, after four weeks, Michael decided to reduce his cycling frequency to twice a week but increase the distance he covers for each ride to 60 kilometers. So, he covered a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers in the next three weeks. In conclusion, Michael covered a total distance of 125 + 120 = 245 kilometers in seven weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 chocolate sticks and 80 candied apples in total. So, if each chocolate stick weighs twice as much as each candied apple, then...
Response:  On Monday, she bought 4 pastries. On Tuesday, she went to another shop and bought three times as many pastries (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she went to yet another shop and bought five times as many pastries (5 x 12 = 60) more than she bought on Monday. So, in total, she bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 pastries over the four days.
Response:  We know that there are 20 pieces of fabric in one bale and each piece costs $1200 less than the total cost per bale. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total Cost = Price per Piece x Number of Pieces + Total Cost per Bale - Price per Bale x Number of Bales The given information is: Total Cost = $6000, Price per Piece = $1200 (less), Number of Pieces = 20, and Total Cost per Bale = $1200. Substituting these values into the above equation, we get: Total Cost = ($1200 x 20) + ($1200 - $1200 x 1) = $24,000 + $0 = $24,000 Now, let's calculate the price of each piece of fabric: Price per Piece = Total Cost / Number of Pieces = $24,000 / 20 = $1200 per piece Therefore, the price of each piece of fabric is $1200.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 to spend on new shoes and two pairs of socks. So she can buy one pair of socks for $20 or two pairs of socks for $40. Secondly, we know that each pair of socks costs $20, so if Sara buys two pairs, it will cost her $40 in total. Thirdly, we know that Sara earns $5 per time she takes care of the neighbor's children, and she does this four times. Therefore, she earns $20 in total from taking care of the children. Fourthly, we know that Sara's parents give her $4 per time she cuts the grass, and she does this once. So she earns $4 from cutting the grass. Finally, we want to find out how many times Sara needs to cut the grass to have enough money to buy the shoes and socks. To do this, we divide the amount of money she wants to spend ($30 + $40) by the amount of money she earns ($20 + $4). This gives us $60 / $24 = 2.5 times. Since you cannot cut the grass twice, the answer is 2 times.
Response:  Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and there are red chickens that produce 3 eggs per day and white chickens that produce 5 eggs per day. So, in total, Jerry collects 42 + 3 = 45 eggs per day. Now, if the number of white chickens is greater than the number of red chickens, then the ratio of white to red chickens will be more than 1:1, so we can say that for every 1 white chicken, there are more than 1 red chicken. Therefore, the number of red chickens must be less than half the number of white chickens. Let's assume that the number of white chickens is w and the number of red chickens is r. We know that w > r because the number of white chickens produces more eggs than the number of red chickens. So, the equation becomes: w - r = x where x is the number of red chickens. Since w > r, we have: x < (w/2) Substituting this value into our original equation gives us: 45 - x = (w/2)x / 2 This simplifies to: 90 - 2x = (w/2)x / 2 Simplifying further gives us: 78 = (w/2)x / 2 Solving for x gives us: x = 39 So, there are 39 red chickens.
Response:  The perimeter of the park is given as 1.5 x 6 = 9 meters. Since he walks at a speed of 5 km/h, we can calculate how long it takes him to walk around the park in hours using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is the perimeter of the park (9 meters), so: Time = 9 / 5 = 1.8 hours. Therefore, it will take Gary approximately 1.8 hours to walk around the town park.
Response:  On day one, there were 100 customers in the store. On day two, there were 50 more customers than on day one, so there were 150 customers in total (100 + 50). On day three, there were again 50 more customers than on day two, so there were 200 customers in total (150 + 50). Therefore, the total number of customers on day three was 200.
Response:  At first, both pools had the same amount of water (4 gallons per minute). So after 1 minute, they would have the same amount of water - 8 gallons (2 x 4 gallons). Then, the big pool gained twice as much water as the small pool in 3 minutes, so it now has 16 gallons more than the small pool (16 = 2 x 8). Therefore, the small pool currently has 4 gallons of water.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Lori will have after buying the shoes and paying for them. The cost of the shoes is $320, so she will have $320 - $32 = $288 left after buying the shoes. Now, let's calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn enough money to buy the shoes. She works at an hourly rate of $8, so she needs to work for hours to earn $288. Therefore, she will need to work for hours to buy the shoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to pay it back with an increase of 10%. So, the total amount she needs to pay is: $2000 x (1 + 0.10) = $2200. Now, if she pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance will be: $2200 - ($165 x 12) = $1835. Therefore, Janet will have $1835 left after paying off the loan over 12 months.
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in 1 pound (or 4 ruži in Slovak). So if we have 7 pounds of flowers (or 7 dalcii), then there will be 7 x 4 = 28 roses in total. Therefore, there are 28 roses in 7 pounds of flowers.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is half the age of Zack. So we can write an equation as follows:
Adrian = 3Harriet
Zack = 2Harriet
Now, if Harriet is currently 21 years old, then in 3 years, she will be 24 years old (since she will have aged 3 + 3 = 6 years). And in another 3 years, she will be 27 years old (since she will have aged 9 + 3 = 12 years). Therefore, the approximate weight of these four individuals after 3 years can be calculated as follows:
Adrian: 3 x 24 = 72 kg
Harriet: 24 kg
Zack: 24 kg
So the approximate weight of these four individuals after 3 years is 72 kg for Adrian, 24 kg for Harriet, and 24 kg for Zack."
Response:  We know that Jojo did not get any points because he is not mentioned in the passage as having scored any points. Therefore, we can conclude that Jojo scored zero (0) points.
"Response: 
Carmen needs 10 minutes to complete a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete a Sudoku. She spent 3 hours solving crosswords and 8 hours solving Sudokus over the weekend. Therefore, she spent a total of 11 hours (3 + 8) playing these games."
Response:  We know that initially there were 120 liters of water in the tank. Then Celene used 90 liters of water from the tank for irrigation her small garden. So now there are 30 liters (120 - 90) left in the tank. After that, she collected twice as much rainwater as was left in the tank, which means she collected 60 liters (3 x 20 = 60). Therefore, the current amount of water in the tank is 30 + 60 = 90 liters.
Response:  If Andy has 90 geraniums and he wants to divide them equally among 40 pots, then each pot will contain how many geraniums? So, the answer is 90/40 = 2.25 geraniums per pot.
Response:  The company spent $15,000 on advertising in year 1 and then one-third of that amount ($5,000) in year 2. So, the total amount spent on advertising over those two years is: $15,000 + ($5,000 / 3) = $20,000. Therefore, the company spent $20,000 on advertising over those two years.
Response:  If Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and pays $30 per hour, he will pay $90 ($30 x 3).  And if Benji uses the sailboat for 5 hours and pays $18 per hour, he will pay $90 ($18 x 5). So they both will pay $90 each.
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half a day to get there by car, then it will take 12 days in total to go there and come back by bus. So, the answer is 12 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that James has 40 water-type cards in his deck.  If he loses 8 of them, he will have 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards left.  Now, let's calculate the percentage of water-type cards in his remaining deck: (32/100) x 100% = 32%. So, there is a 32% chance that a randomly chosen card from James' deck will be a water-type card.
Response:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the basic burrito: $6.50 + $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.25 = $9.90. Now, let's add the additional toppings: $9.90 + $3 (for the drink and chips) = $12.90. So, the final price is $12.90.
Response:  Kalinda can add 4 pieces in one minute and her mother can add half of that in one minute as well. So, if they work together for an hour (60 minutes), Kalinda will have added 240 pieces (4 x 60) and her mother will have added 30 pieces (half of 4 x 60). Therefore, it will take them 210 minutes (or 3 hours and 30 minutes) to complete the task.
Response:  After two months, 30% of the total number of small watermelons (120) were ready to be harvested, so Ashlyn took 30 of them home. When she returned after two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons (75%) were ready to be harvested, so she collected another 22.5 watermelons. Therefore, there were 97.5 watermelons left unharvested after two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how many autos are being bought by Mark for his company. Since each car is sold for $20,000, and Mark pays 10% tax on each one, he will buy 12 cars in total. So, the number of cars = 12. Now, let's calculate the cost of all these cars including registration fees. The cost of each car = $20,000 + ($20,000 x 10%) + ($20,000 x 0.01) = $24,800. Therefore, Mark will pay a total of $24,800 for all 12 cars.
Response:  In Monday, Kylie gathered 5 more mussels than Robert, who gathered 20. So, in total, Kylie gathered 25 mussels (5 + 20 = 25).  In Tuesday, Kylie gathered twice as many mussels as she did on Monday, which means she gathered 4 times as many mussels as Robert (since he gathered 20). Therefore, Kylie gathered 80 mussels in Tuesday (4 x 25 = 100).
Response:  If there are 50 mushrooms in the garden and Dax picked up half of them (which is 25), then the total number of insects in the garden would be:  50 - 25 = 25.
Response:  We know that 1/3 of the snowflakes will jump into water and swim in the ocean. So, there are 3/3 = 1 snowflake left to consider. Then we know that another 1/3 of the remaining snowflakes will return to the cave to eat dinner. So, there are now 2/3 = 2 snowflakes left to consider. Therefore, the number of snowflakes that still need to melt is 1 + 2 = 3. Hence, 3 snowflakes will still melt.
Response:  Steve goes twice as fast as his friend and eats 6 apples per day. If Vinic can make 3 apple pies per week, how many vinics does he need?  We know that Steve eats 2 times more than his friend, so he eats 2 x 6 = 12 apples per day. Therefore, Vinic needs 12 / 3 = 4 vinics to produce enough apples for Steve.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each friend can have 4 slices of pizza. So, we need to find out how many slices of pizza John needs to order for all his friends.  Number of slices = Total number of friends x Number of slices per friend  Number of slices = 20 friends x 4 slices per friend  Number of slices = 80 slices  Therefore, John needs to order 80 slices of pizza.
Response:  If Ram uses many periods and he knows that he can save money by mixing ink from empty pens to create one full pen, then we can assume that each pen contains a certain amount of ink.  If he buys 25 pens and uses them to produce new pens, how much ink will he have left after using all the ink from those pens?  Therefore, the answer is 25.
Response:  First, John invested $20 and then added another $10, so he had a total of $30. Then, this amount tripled over the year, which means it grew to $90. So, after one year, John had $90.
"Response:  Mary is two years younger than Joan, who is five years older than Jessica. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Mary = Joan - 5 + 2
Joan = Jessica + 5
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
Mary = Jessica + 7
Therefore, the sum of their ages is 73 (Jessica = 20, Mary = 53, and Joan = 45)."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 1000 students in the hall. Then, 30% of them left through entrance A, which means 300 students left through this entrance. Next, 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., 600 - 300 = 300) left through entrance B. Finally, some additional students left through entrance C, but we don't know how many exactly. So, let's assume that x is the number of students who left through entrance C. Therefore, the total number of students who left the building is: 300 + (600 - 300)x = 900.
Response:  We know that James has more than 6 candies and less than or equal to 72 candies (since he has 6 + 1 = 7 candies).  So, if John has twice as many candies as James, then John must have between 13 and 148 candies (since 2 x 7 = 14).  Now we can see that John has 54 candies, which is strictly between these two values. Therefore, John has 54 - 13 = 41 candies more than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they will read 3 books at the end.
Response:  We know that each of them sends two letters per week and they have five pages in each letter. So, if one of them writes for six minutes every day, then he/she will write 30 minutes per week (since there are seven days in a week). Therefore, the other person who used to be their friend also writes for 30 minutes per week. Since both of them write for the same amount of time, we can conclude that they write for 1 hour and 20 minutes per week (30 minutes x 2 people = 1 hour and 20 minutes).
Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month for calls.  He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, which means he talks to him for a total of 15 x 30 = 450 minutes per month.  Now, we are asked how many days Jason can talk to other people if he has 300 minutes available per month. To find out, let's divide the remaining minutes (300 - 450) by the number of days left in the month (30). So, Jason can talk to other people for 300 / 30 = 10 minutes per day. Therefore, Jason has 10 minutes per day to talk to other people.
Response:  Griffin had 24 marbles initially and gave 5 to Kyle. So, he has 24 - 5 = 19 marbles left. Then, Billy took twice as many marbles from Griffin as Kyle did, which means Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 marbles from Griffin. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 marbles left. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer marbles than Griffin gave to Kyle, which means Colby took 3 - x = 6 marbles from Griffin, where x is the number of marbles Griffin gave to Kyle (which is 5). Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 9 + 6 = 15 marbles in total.
Response:  In one aquarium there are 4 fish and in another aquarium there are 32 fish. The difference between the number of fish in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. If they have the same number of fish in both aquariums, how many fish are in each aquarium?
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jean will pay for each hour of makeup work. According to the question, the makeup artist charges $250 per hour. Therefore, Jean will pay $250 x 6 = $1500 for the total makeup work in one week (6 hours/day \* 7 days/week).  Next, we need to calculate how much money Jean will pay for the entire duration of the movie shoot. Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks and the makeup work takes 6 hours/day, the total number of hours of makeup work is 5 x 6 = 30 hours. So, Jean will pay $1500 + ($250 x 30) = $1850 for the entire duration of the movie shoot. Finally, since the makeup artist gives Jean a discount of 10%, Jean will pay $1850 x 90% = $1675 for the total cost of makeup work. Therefore, Jean will pay a total of $1675 for the makeup work during the movie shoot.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabella spent $12 on party favors for her sister's birthday. Then she spent $43 on gifts for her sister's birthday. Next, she spent $15 on decorations for the party. After that, she spent $4 on invitations and finally, she spent $22 on goodies for the guests at the party. Now let's divide these expenses equally among three people - Isabella and her two parents. So each person will have to pay $780 / 3 = $260. Therefore, each person will pay $260 towards the total cost of the party.
Response:  We know that the chef bought 4 bunches of parsley. Each bunch weighs 50 libras. Therefore, the total weight of all bunches is: 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Now, let's convert this weight to dollars: $/lb = 1.5$/€. So, the total cost of all bunches is: 200 lb x $/lb = $1800. Finally, since there are 4 bunches in total, the number of bunches bought by the chef is: 4.
Response:  On Monday (pondelok), Sue ate 4 times more Kolacheks than her sister. So she ate 4 x 4 = 16 Kolacheks.  In Tuesday (utorok), Sue ate twice as many Kolacheks as her sister. So she ate 2 x 4 = 8 Kolacheks.  Her sister ate 5 Kolacheks on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of Kolacheks eaten by both sisters is: 5 + 13 = 18. Now we need to find out how many calories Sue consumed in total. Since each Kolacheck contains 200 calories, Sue consumed: 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.
