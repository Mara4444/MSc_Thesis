Explanation: To calculate the expected value of the portfolio at the end of the month, we need to multiply the price of each item by its probability of being chosen and then sum up all these products. The probabilities are given in the question as follows:

Probability of choosing Nakit = (1 + 0.025) / 2 = 0.0275
Probability of choosing Elektronski uređaj = (1 + 0.012) / 2 = 0.0135
The expected value of the portfolio can be calculated as follows:
Expected Value = (Price of Nakit x Probability of Choosing Nakit) + (Price of Elektronski Uređaj x Probability of Choosing Elektronski Uređaj)
= ($5,000 x 0.0275) + ($8,000 x 0.0135)
= $137.50 + $108.80
= $246.30
Therefore, the expected value of the portfolio is $246.30."

"Response: 136
Explanation: Let's analyze each friend's statement:
Friend 1 says there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.
Friend 2 says there are 20 more jelly beans than half of Friend 1's count, which is 40 (since half of 80 is 40).
Friend 3 says there are 25% more jelly beans than Friend 1's count, which is 32 (since 25% more of 80 is 32).
Now, let's find the average of these three counts:
Average = (80 + 40 + 32) / 3 = 136
Therefore, the friends' collective estimate for the number of jelly beans in the jar is 136."

Response: 27.65 km/h
"Response: 18 miles
Explanation: If Dana can run four times faster than she can walk and can jump at a speed that is half as fast as her running speed, then we know that her running speed is $ \boxed{3} \text {miles per hour}$. Since she spends $\boxed{2/3} \text{time walking}$ and $\boxed{1/3} \text{time running}$, we can calculate the total distance traveled in $ \boxed{6} \text{hours}$ as follows:

$ Distance = Speed \times Time $

For walking:
$$Distance = 3 \text{miles per hour} \times 2/3 \text{hours} = 4.5 \text{miles}$$

For running:
$$Distance = 3 \text{miles per hour} \times 1/3 \text{hours} = 9 \text{miles}$$

Total distance traveled:
$$Distance = 4.5 + 9 = 13.5 \text{miles}$$
Therefore, if Dana spends $\boxed{2/3} \text{time walking}$ and $\boxed{1/3} \text{time running}$, she will travel $\boxed{13.5} \text{miles}$."

Explanation: To calculate how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie goal and the number of calories in one serving of chips, we need to use simple arithmetic. Let's assume that you have already consumed 1800 calories out of your daily goal of 2000 calories. If each serving of chips contains 250 calories, then you can eat 5 servings (250 x 5 = 1250) before reaching your daily calorie limit. Therefore, if you want to stay within your calorie budget, you can eat up to 47 grams (1250 / 250 = 47) of chips."

She then stopped at a store and bought a pack of Post-It notes that contained 220 different shades of coffee. If she used one Post-It note per cup of coffee, as the passage states, then she would have used all 80 of the original Post-It notes plus an additional 14 from the pack she bought (since there are 220 total cups of coffee). Therefore, there were 14 Post-It notes remaining in the pack after Candice was done using them."

"Response: 35 miles
Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (in this case, the speed), and t is the time. We know that Tomov's boat travels at a speed of 6 km/h, which is equal to 3.7 mph. We also know that he travels for 2 hours, which is equal to 120 minutes. Therefore, the total distance traveled can be calculated as follows: d = rt = 3.7 mph x 120 min = 434 miles. However, since Tomov starts his journey at 1 pm and returns at 4 pm, he has actually traveled for 4 hours, not 2 hours. So, the correct answer is 35 miles."

"Response: 32768
Explanation: The maximum number of kits that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 32768. This calculation is based on the following assumptions:
The weight of each kit is 5 kg (given in the problem statement).
The total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 1400 kg (also given in the problem statement).
The maximum weight that the bridge can handle is 5000 funti (also given in the problem statement).
To find the maximum number of kits that can be loaded onto the truck, we need to divide the maximum weight that the bridge can handle by the weight of each kit:
Maximum number of kits = Maximum weight of the bridge / Weight of each kit
= 5000 funti / 5 kg
= 10000 kits
However, since the truck has a capacity for carrying 32768 kits, this is the maximum number of kits that can be loaded onto the truck while still staying within the weight limits of the bridge."

"Response: 1768900
Explanation: To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working for the same company, we need to use the formula provided in the question: ""A = P x (1 + r)^n"", where:

* A is the future value of Marcy's annuity at time n
* P is the present value of Marcy's annuity at time 0 (which is equal to $50,000/year)
* r is the annual rate of growth in the pension amount (which is 5% per year)
* n is the number of years from time 0 to time n (in this case, n = 30)

Using these values and plugging them into the formula above, we get:

A = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^30 = $176,890

Therefore, after 30 years of working for the same company, Marcy will receive an annual pension of $176,890."
"Response: 236 dollars. 
Explanation: To calculate the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year, we need to find out how much she was charged in each half of the year and then add those amounts together. In the first half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena $140 per month, which means she was charged a total of $140 x 6 = $840. In the second half of the year, the company charged her $10% less than the previous amount, or $76 ($840 - $10%). Therefore, the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year is $840 + $76 = $916."
"Response: 280 kilometers (km)

Explanation:
Jim watches TV for 2 hours per day and then goes to bed and reads for half an hour. This happens three times a week. In four weeks, he will have done this 12 times (since there are 4 weeks). So, in total, he spends 12 x 2 = 24 hours watching TV each week. Since he also spends half an hour reading every night, he spends 24 / 2 = 12 hours reading per week. Therefore, over the course of 4 weeks, Jim spends a total of 12 x 4 = 48 hours reading and watching TV."

"Response: 108
Explanation:
Gene has one shirt from each of his vacations, and each shirt has its own unique block cover. There are four vacations per year, and he started keeping track of them at age 23. Therefore, there are 4 x 4 = 16 blocks for each year, and since he is now 34 years old, there are 34 - 23 = 11 years worth of blocks in total. Since each block covers one shirt, the total number of blocks is 11 x 16 = 176. However, we need to subtract the number of blocks that overlap between consecutive years, which is half of the number of years (i.e., 5 years). So, the final answer is 176 - 5 = 108 blocks."

* The number of dogs is 1/12th of the total number of pets (zečeva).
* There are twice as many cats as dogs (mačka).
* The number of dogs is equal to 60.

Using these facts, we can calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood as follows:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs x 12 + Number of cats
= 60 x 12 + 2(Number of cats)
= 720

Therefore, there are 720 kućnih ljubimaca (pets) in the neighborhood."

This means that he watched a total of 7 hours of television during the week (6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours). Since each episode of his favorite show is 30 minutes long, Frankie watched a total of 4 episodes (7 hours / 30 minutes per episode = 4 episodes) on Wednesday."

"Response: 
Marcell and Beatrice have a competition to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice is wide two rows and long 24 rows while Marcel is wide three rows and long 14 rows. If they both ate the entire amount, how much did they eat on average? 

Solution:
To find out how much each of them ate on average, we need to divide their total length by the number of rows they are wide.

Beatrice's length = 24 rows x width = 2 rows = 48 cm
Marcel's length = 14 rows x width = 3 rows = 42 cm

Average length for Beatrice = 48 / 2 = 24 cm
Average length for Marcel = 42 / 3 = 14 cm

Therefore, Beatrice ate an average of 24 cm, and Marcel ate an average of 14 cm."
"Response: 3.5 liters (L) of water were in the boat when Julia reached the shore.
Explanation: According to the question, the boat was taking in two liters of water every ten meters it traveled towards the shore. Since Julia traveled 20 meters towards the shore, she encountered 20 / 10 = 2 liters of water during that distance. Therefore, there were initially 2 + 2 = 4 liters of water in the boat when Julia started moving towards the shore. Since it took her 16 seconds to travel 20 meters, the rate at which the boat was taking in water is equal to the rate at which it was leaking, which is 2 liters per 10 meters. Therefore, the amount of water that entered the boat during those 16 seconds is 2 x 20 = 40 liters. Finally, since Julia reached the shore after 64 seconds, and the boat had taken in 40 liters of water during that time, there are now 40 - 4 = 3.5 liters of water left in the boat when she reaches the shore."

Explanation:
To find out how much Dillon will spend in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

Lubenica costs three times as much as paprike, so the cost of one lubenica is 3 x 15 = 45.
Naranča costs 5 less than Šteto, so the cost of one naranča is 10 - 5 = 5.

Dillon wants to buy 4 lubenice, which will cost him 4 x 45 = 180.
He also wants to buy 20 paprike, which will cost him 20 x 15 = 300.
Finally, he wants to buy 10 naranča, which will cost him 10 x 5 = 50.

Therefore, the total amount that Dillon will spend is 180 + 300 + 50 = 378.67."

Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute, and Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. Since Steve lives farther away from school than Tim, he will finish the race first. It will take Steve 15 minutes to reach home, since he is 3 miles away from school. Tim, who is only 2 miles away from school, will take 10 minutes to reach home. Therefore, the winner of the race will be Steve, and he will arrive at his house before Tim does."
"Response: 175 dollars
Explanation:
The total cost of one tire is $0.25, so if 5 people came to inflate both tires, the total cost would be $1.25 (5 x $0.25). If 3 people came to inflate the tires on their tricycle, the total cost for them would be $0.75 ($0.25 x 3). Finally, if one person came to inflate just one tire, the cost would be $0.25. Therefore, the total amount earned that day was $175 ($1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25)."

Explanation: The total cost of all five uniforms can be calculated as follows:
Uniform with shirt = $25 + $25 = $50
Uniform with jacket = $3 x $50 = $150
Total cost of first two uniforms = $50 + $150 = $200
Uniform with pants = $25 + $25 = $50
Uniform with shoes = $25 + $25 = $50
Total cost of last three uniforms = $50 + $50 + $50 = $150
Total cost of all five uniforms = $200 + $150 = $350
Therefore, the total cost of all five uniforms is $350."

"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's assume that the two candidates are X and Y. Since X has received 3/4 of the total votes, we can write:

X = (80 x 3/4) / 2

Now, we need to find out how many votes Y got. We know that the total number of votes is 80, so Y must have gotten the remaining votes:

Y = 80 - (80 x 3/4) / 2

Substituting the values, we get:

Y = 16

Therefore, the candidate who lost got 16 votes."

"Response: 12 seconds
Explanation:
The first team has each member running 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so their total time for one lap is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 280 seconds.
The second team's times are as follows:
Trkač 1: 60 seconds (for 400 meters)
Trkač 2: 55 seconds (for 400 meters) - 3 seconds faster than Trkač 1
Trkač 3: 52 seconds (for 400 meters) - 7 seconds faster than Trkač 2
Trkač 4: 49 seconds (for 400 meters) - 11 seconds faster than Trkač 3
Therefore, the total time for one lap by the second team is:
Trkač 1: 60 seconds
Trkač 2: 55 seconds
Trkač 3: 52 seconds
Trkač 4: 49 seconds
Total time: 60 + 55 + 52 + 49 = 294 seconds
Since the first team's total time is 280 seconds and the second team's total time is 294 seconds, the difference between the two teams' times is:
280 - 294 = -14 seconds
So, the second team will be 14 seconds slower than the first team."
"Response: 0.672 or approximately 67.2%
Explanation: To calculate this probability, we need to use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). In this case, A is ""Jerry will throw a number greater than 3"" and B is ""Jerry throws two consecutive even numbers."" We know that Jerry threw an odd number, so P(A ∩ B) = 1. Since there are only three even numbers less than 6, P(B) = 3/10 = 0.3. Therefore, P(A|B) = 1/0.3 = 3.33 or approximately 33.3%. However, since Jerry did not throw two consecutive even numbers, the probability of him throwing a number greater than 3 is higher, at 0.672 or approximately 67.2%."
Response: 15 (Jenna's mother has 20 jabukes and Jenna has half of them, so she has 10 jabukes).
"Response: 4 shrews in each cage (or 48 shrews total).
Explanation: According to the information provided, there are 10 cages of hedgehogs and each cage contains 5 pieces of slime. Therefore, the total number of pieces of slime for all 10 cages is 5 x 10 = 50. Since there are no other uses of slime mentioned in the problem, we can assume that this is the only source of slime available.
Now, let's calculate the number of shrews that can be fed with 50 pieces of slime. We know that each shrew requires 4 pieces of slime, so the number of shrews that can be fed with 50 pieces of slime is 50 / 4 = 12.5 shrews. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a shrew, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 13 shrews. Therefore, there are 13 shrews in each cage or 130 shrews total."

This means that the total number of children (i.e., non-adults) is equal to the total population minus the number of adults. Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 23786 - (8417 + 9092) = 5556."
"Response: 140
Explanation:
In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. In the second month, she collected three times as many cards, so she had 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). In the third month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the previous two months combined, so she had 40 cards (60 - 20 = 40). Therefore, Elaine has 140 Pokémon cards in total (20 + 60 + 40 = 140)."

"Response: 16374.89
Explanation:
Let X be the total amount of money earned by John in a year. Since he earns $2000 every week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual income is:
X = $2000 x 52 = $104,000
The bonus he receives is 5% of his annual income, which is:
Bonus = $104,000 x 5% = $5200
So, the total amount of money he receives as bonus is:
Total Bonus = $5200 + $2000 (weekly salary) = $7200
Since he receives the bonus at the beginning of each year, the amount he receives in the first week of the year is:
Amount Received in First Week = Total Bonus / Number of Weeks in Year = $7200 / 52 = $140 per week
Therefore, the amount he received in the first week of the year is $140."

"Response: 16
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Jerry collects 42 jaja each day and there are more white chickens than red ones. Therefore, if there were x red chickens, there would be x + 9 (the number of white chickens) = 42 jaja collected by Jerry each day. Since Jerry collects 42 jaja each day, we can set up an equation: x + 9 = 42. Solving for x, we get x = 16. So, there are 16 red chickens."
"Response: 4 hours
Explanation: To find out how many hours Gary will spend walking in the local park, we need to divide the distance he needs to cover by his speed. The distance of the park is given as 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles. Since Gary walks at a speed of 5 km/h, which is approximately equal to 3.1 miles per hour, it takes him 9 / 3.1 = 2.9 hours to walk the entire length of the park. Therefore, Gary spends 4 hours walking in the park, since he has already spent 2.9 hours walking before reaching the end of the park."

"Response: 2 gallons
Explanation: Let's assume that initially, the small basin had x gallons of water and the large basin had 2x gallons of water. After 4 minutes, the small basin lost 4 gallons of water, while the large basin gained 4 gallons of water. Therefore, the total amount of water in the small basin after 4 minutes is x - 4 = 3x/5 gallons, and the total amount of water in the large basin after 4 minutes is 2x + 4 = 6x/5 gallons. Since the large basin now has four times as much water as the small basin, we can set up the equation 6x/5 = 2(3x/5), which simplifies to x = 2 gallons. So, the small basin currently contains 2 gallons of water."

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The number of students in the school was 1000.
* There were 3 entrances to the hall - A, B, and C.
* After the meeting, 30% of the students left through entrance A, which means that 300 students (30% of 1000) left through entrance A.
* Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 (or 60%) left through entrance B, which means that 420 students (60% of 700) left through entrance B.
* Therefore, the total number of students who left through entrance C is equal to the number of students who did not leave through either entrance A or B, which is 700 - 300 - 420 = 280 students.
So, the number of students who left through entrance C is 280."

Explanation: Let's assume that the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Since there are twice as many fish in the second aquarium as in the first one, we can write:
x = 4 (from the first aquarium) or x = 8 (from the second aquarium).
Now, we know that the total number of fish in both aquariums is equal to the sum of their individual numbers:
x + 32 = x + 8 = 40
So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 16."

$250/hour x 6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = $375,000
After completing the job, the shimmer gives Jean a 10% discount, so she will pay:
$375,000 x 90% = $337,500

"Response: 560 calories
Explanation:
Sue ate 4 times as much cake as her sister on Monday, which means she ate 4 x 4 = 16 kolača (cake). Her sister ate 5 kolača on Monday and 13 kolača on Tuesday, for a total of 18 kolača (cake) consumed by both sisters combined. Since each kolač has 200 calories, the total number of calories consumed by both sisters is:
18 kolača x 200 calories/kolač = 3600 calories
Since Sue ate 4 times as much cake as her sister, Sue's share of the total calories consumed is:
4 x 3600 calories = 14400 calories
So, Sue consumed 14400 - 3600 = 10800 calories more than her sister."
