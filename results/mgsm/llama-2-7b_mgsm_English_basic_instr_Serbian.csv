"Response: 30 кутија (cups)

Основна идеја за решење овог питања је да се утврди колико седамкапелних комора потребно давати хлеба својим петком кад су током дана. У питању су следеће информације:

* Сваки дан, Венди даје сва три коморе хлеба својим петком.
* Хлеб се састоји из семена, мељу и поврћа, а Венди га даје у три сепараte месеца.
* Ујутру, Венди даје својој фlock од 20 комора 15 кутија хлеба.
* Поподне, Венди даје својој флок од 20 комора још 25 кутија хлеба.

Не знамо колико седамкапелних комора Венди има, па не можемо директно наћи броj хлеба које треба давати јој у последњем оброку дана. Међутим, можемо доказати да Венди укупно даје својим петком 30 кутија хлеба дневно.

Укупно, Венди даје својим петком 15 + 25 = 40 кутија хлеба у јутро и послеподневима. Ако она има 20 комора, онда свака комора прими 2 кутије хлеба дневно. Такође, Венди даје својим петком укупно 30 кутија хлеба у свим мерима дана."
Response:  Кларификација:  The answer is 48 dollars. Here's how we can calculate it: Glass 1: $5 + (60% of $5) = $7.50 Glass 2: $7.50 + (60% of $7.50) = $9.38 Glass 3: $9.38 + (60% of $9.38) = $11.27... and so on until glass 16: $11.27 + (60% of $11.27) = $48.00 Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $48 for 16 glasses.

"Response: 157 miles

Explanation:
John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, which means he traveled a distance of 60 x 3 = 180 miles. Then, he spent 2 hours in standstill traffic, which does not change his position. Finally, he drove for the last 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph, which means he traveled a distance of 80 x 2 = 160 miles. Therefore, John is 180 + 160 = 340 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."

"Response:  Total number of downloads = 60 + (3 x 60) - 20 = 180

A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so there were 60 x 3 = 180 downloads in the second month. Then, in the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, which means that there were 180 - 30 = 150 downloads in the third month. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months was 60 + 180 + 150 = 490."

"Response: 4,6 years

Carlos needs to calculate how long it will take him to start making money from his lemon tree. To do this, he needs to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree over time, as well as the revenue he will generate from selling the lemons.

Total Cost = $90 (planting cost) + ($3 x number of years) (maintenance cost)
Revenue = $1.5 x number of lemons grown per year

To find out when Carlos will start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to set up an equation using these two formulas:

Total Cost - Revenue = 0

Substituting the values given in the problem:

$90 + ($3 x number of years) - $1.5 x number of lemons grown per year = 0

Solving for number of years:

number of years = 4.6 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 4.6 years to start earning money from his lemon tree."

"Response:  Jill's annual salary is $48,000 (20 x 50 weeks) + $45,000 (30 x 50 weeks)...""

This problem requires the use of multiplication and addition to calculate Jill's annual salary based on the information provided in the question. To solve it, you can follow these steps:

1. Multiply the number of weeks Jill works as a teacher by her hourly rate of pay: 50 weeks x $20/hour = $1,000/week
2. Add this amount to the number of weeks Jill works as a coach at her higher hourly rate of pay: $1,000/week x 35 weeks = $35,000
3. Add the total amount earned from teaching and coaching to find Jill's annual salary: $35,000 + $48,000 = $83,000

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $83,000."
"Response: 16 дозе (доз) егги.
Claire makes a 3 egg omelette every morning for breakfast. If she does this for 4 weeks, how many dozen eggs will she eat in total?
To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of eggs per day. Since Claire makes one 3-egg omelette per day, she will eat 3 x 28 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks. Therefore, Claire will eat 84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks."
"Response: 3.5 миља/ч (мада се може изразити и у форми миле по часу).
Marissa needs to walk at an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the remaining distance. Since she has already walked 8 miles (the first 4 + the next 2), the remaining distance is:
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already walked = 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles
To find Marissa's average speed for the remaining distance, we can divide the remaining distance by the time it takes her to cover that distance:
Average speed = Remaining distance / Time taken = 4 miles / 2 hours = 3.5 miles per hour
Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at an average speed of 3.5 miles per hour for the remaining distance of 4 miles."

Rеакција:
The rate at which the candle melts is given as 2 centimeters per hour. Therefore, the distance traveled by the wax in one hour is:

Distance = Rate x Time
= 2 cm/h x 1 h
= 2 cm

Now, we are asked how much shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The time interval between these two times is:

Time interval = 5 hours

Therefore, the distance traveled by the wax during this time interval is:

Distance = Rate x Time interval
= 2 cm/h x 5 h
= 10 cm

So, after burning for 5 hours, the candle will be 10 centimeters shorter than its original height."

"Response: Marie ordered 6 boxes of pizza ($8.50 x 6 = $51)... (1)

Now, let's solve the problem using algebraic manipulation. We know that Marie paid a total of $50 for all her purchases. From equation (1), we can see that she spent $51 on pizza alone. Therefore, the amount she spent on other items is:

$50 - $51 = $-1

So, Marie spent $1 less than the cost of 1 box of pizza. Since there are 6 boxes in total, Marie spent $6-$1 = $5 on other items.

Therefore, the answer to the question is $5."

Response:  Gretchen has 42 gold coins.
"Response:  Siobhan has 36 jewels.

Rationale:
Let A be the number of jewels that Raymond has. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, Aaron has:
A = 0.5A + 5

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has:
S = A - 2

We know that Aaron has 40 jewels, so we can substitute this value into the equation for Siobhan's jewels:
S = 0.5A + 5 - 2

Simplifying and solving for S, we get:
S = 36

Therefore, Siobhan has 36 jewels."

Причина: According to the problem, John sold all of his Lego sets and used the money to buy video games. If he had 13 Lego sets and sold them for $15 each, he would have made $195 ($15 x 13). Then, if he bought 8 video games for $20 each, he would have spent $160 ($20 x 8). This means that he has $35 left over ($195 - $160 = $35), which is equal to 5 Lego sets."
"Response: 12 минута/км

Explanation:
John runs for 3 hours on the first day, which means he covers a distance of 3 x 3 = 9 miles. Since he runs half as much on the other two days, he covers a total distance of 9 + (2 x 3) = 18 miles per week. Therefore, his average speed is:

Average speed = Total distance / Time taken = 18 miles / 3 days = 6 mi/h or 12 min/km

So, John's running speed is approximately 12 minutes per kilometer."
Response:  Дана може да пошаље 21 миљу у шест сати ако је трећину времена провела на скакању и два трећа на ходању. У току шест сати, Данова брзина на скакању износи 4 пута већа од брзине ходања, тако да на скакању може да пошаље 8 миља у току шест сати (4 x 2 = 8). У истом периоду, Данова брзина ходања износи 1/2 брзине скакања, па може да пошаље 6 миљи у току шест сати (1/2 x 8 = 6). Укупно, Дан може да пошаље 14 миље у шест сати (8 + 6 = 14).

"Response: 567 feet

Основна идеја за решење јесте да се узети просек бројева израчунатог за сваку ситуацију и користити га за налажење најдаље тачке где Поли може стати и још увек погодити диргана са златном праменком.

Прво, вредност просека брзине лета за неће holds the sapphire gemstone (380 feet) и без ње (400 feet):

Prosek brzine leta = (380 ft + 400 ft) / 2 = 350 ft

Тепер, кад Поли holds the sapphire gemstone, она може да баци златни праменek three times farther than without the gemstone:

Distance = 3 x (400 ft - 350 ft) = 900 ft

Такође, кад Поли stands outside of the reach of the dragon's flames, she can still hit the dragon with the gold javelin if she is at least 1000 feet away from it:

Distance = 1000 ft

Следећи томе, ако Поли holds the sapphire gemstone, она може стати на око 567 feet away from the dragon to be safe from its flames and still hit it with the gold javelin:

Distance = 567 ft

Therefore, the answer is 567 feet."

Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon.  She cut each pie into 8 pieces and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves.  At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.  How many pieces were taken by the guests?

Based on the question, we can formulate a numerical answer as follows:

Number of pieces taken by guests = Total number of pieces - Number of pieces remaining
= 5 x 8 = 40 - 14 = 26

Therefore, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests."

"Response:  John spent $360 on ties.

Explanation:
John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties. Let's call the number of blue ties ""b"". Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost of one red tie is 50% more than the cost of one blue tie. So the cost of one red tie is $40 + (50% of $40), or $40 + $20 = $60 per tie.
Since John spent $200 on blue ties, and there are b blue ties, John spent a total of $200 x b dollars on blue ties.
To find out how much John spent on red ties, we can multiply the number of red ties by their cost: 2x$60 = $120.
So John spent a total of $200 + $120 = $360 on ties."

Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives a $50,000 annual pension starting in year 20, then her total pension accrued over those 40 years is: $50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000. Since she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years of service, her annual pension at retirement would be: $2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000. Therefore, if she quits after 30 years of service, her annual pension would be: $100,000 + $2,000,000 = $2,100,000.

RеаSONING:
The total number of gems is equal to the sum of the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. Since there are 175 diamonds, and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, there are 175 - 35 = 140 rubies. Additionally, since there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, there are 140 x 2 = 280 emeralds. Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = 205 gems."
"Response:  There are 12 teachers at the school.

Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

* ""There are twice as many boys as girls"" means that if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys.
* ""If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher"" means that there are a total of 60 + (5 \* 49) = 60 + 245 = 305 students in the school.

Now, we can use the information that there are twice as many boys as girls to find the number of boys:

Boys = Girls × 2 = 60 × 2 = 120

So, the total number of students in the school is 305 (girls + boys). Since there are 12 teachers, the number of students per teacher is:

Number of students per teacher = Total number of students / Number of teachers = 305 / 12 = 25.4 students per teacher (round down to 25 students per teacher)

Therefore, there are 12 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."

"Response:  Judy makes $750.00 per week.

Here's how you can calculate it:

Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day (weekdays) = 5 x 5 = 25 classes/week
Judy teaches 8 dance classes on Saturdays = 8 x 8 = 64 classes/week
Total number of classes taught by Judy per week = 25 + 64 = 89 classes/week
Number of students enrolled in Judy's dance classes = 15 students/class x 89 classes/week = 1325 students/week
Revenue generated by Judy from teaching dance classes per week = $15.00/student x 1325 students/week = $19,375.00 per week
Therefore, Judy makes $19,375.00 per week from teaching dance classes."
"Response: 40

Rationale:

Response:  Tommy raised $135. To calculate this, you can use the following formula: Number of brownies sold x Price per brownie = Total amount raised from brownies Number of cheesecake slices sold x Price per cheesecake slice = Total amount raised from cheesecakes Total amount raised = Total amount raised from brownies + Total amount raised from cheesecakes In this case, Tommy sold 43 brownies at $3 each, so he raised $135 from brownies ($43 x $3). He also sold 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 each, so he raised an additional $92 from cheesecakes ($23 x $4). Therefore, Tommy raised a total of $135 + $92 = $227.
Response:  For the first question, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then find out how much Shiela will pay each month. The formula for calculating the total cost is: Total Cost = Number of Cell Phones x Price per Unit x Interest Rate x Time Period In this case, the number of cell phones is 5, the price per unit is $150, the interest rate is 2%, and the time period is 3 months. Therefore, the total cost of the cell phones is: Total Cost = 5 x $150 x 2% x 3/12 = $450 So, Shiela will have to pay $450 for the three months.

Rationale:
Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days (since each bag contains 110 cups and there are 180 days in a year). Therefore, she will need 180 bags of dog food during this period. After that, she will need to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day, which means she will need 2 x 365 = 730 bags of dog food in the second year. Since Cecilia already used 180 bags in the first year, she still needs 730 - 180 = 550 more bags of dog food in the second year."

RеаSONING:
Gene has been on vacation every year for the past 13 years (from age 23 to 34). Since each shirt represents one quilt block, we can assume that Gene has at least one shirt from each vacation he has taken. Therefore, the number of quilt blocks Gene has is equal to the number of vacations he has taken.

So, if Gene takes 4 vacations per year, as stated in the problem, then he has taken a total of:

4 x 13 = 52 vacations

Since each shirt represents one quilt block, Gene has a total of:

52 x 1 = 52 quilt blocks

Therefore, the answer is 52 quilt blocks."

Обозримо даље у питању:  Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all? 
Према наведеном у питању, можемо написати следећи формулацијски израз за бројање пута када је алarm gone off:

Number of times the alarm rang = 4 + (3 x Time difference between two consecutive rings) + (1/2)

У овом случају, требало би да се узе時 разлика између два консекutive rings, која једначи 3 (since the second time the alarm went off, it rang for 3 times longer than the first time). Therefore, we can write:

Number of times the alarm rang = 4 + (3 x 3) + (1/2) = 9

So, the alarm rang 9 times in total."

Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. So if Marilyn sold x copies, Harald sold 10x copies.
The problem states that the total number of copies sold by both artists is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (10x) = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:

11x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 49,000 copies."

Christina has planned a birthday party for her 16 friends. Each friend will receive a gift bag as a token of appreciation. Unfortunately, only half of the guests show up to the party. How much does Christina end up spending on gift bags?

Let X be the number of gift bags Christina actually gives out (i.e., half of the original number). Since Christina invited 16 friends initially, we can write:

X = 16 / 2 = 8 gift bags

Since each gift bag costs $2, Christina ends up spending:

Total cost = Number of gift bags x Cost per gift bag
= 8 x $2
= $16

Therefore, Christina ends up spending $16 on gift bags."
"Response: 35 lb (pounds)

Основна идеја за решењем овог питања је да се зна количина хране која ће бити потребна за сваког госта на пикнику. На основу тога, можемо доказати количину хране коју треба носити на пикник.

Тедови планове су да буде 20 пута већи него количина хране које ће бити потребно за децу. Ово значи да ће Тед морати да носи 20 x 1/2 = 10 lb (pounds) хране за децу.

Затим, остаје само да утврдимо количину хране која ће бити потребна за одрасле. Према задаци, одрасли ће конзумирати 10 lb (pounds) хране, па тако Тед мора носити још 20 - 10 = 10 lb (pounds) хране за одрасле госте.

Укупна количина хране која треба носити на пикњик је, тада: 10 + 10 = 20 lb (pounds).

Овде је укупна количина хране која треба носити на пикњик: 20 lb (pounds)."

Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which means that if Marcia has X pets, then Jan has 3X pets.
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, which means that if Cindy has X pets, then Marcia has X + 2 pets.
So, the total number of pets among the three is:
3x + (x + 2) = 12
Solving for x, we get:
x = 4
Therefore, the three people have a total of 3 x 4 = 12 pets."

Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. So if Lee ran it in 38 seconds, Gerald could have run it in 36 seconds (since he was running 2 seconds slower). However, since Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%, now he can run the 400-meter hurdles in 42 seconds (since 36 + 10 = 42)."
Response:  The number of rabbits = 12 - (D + C) Where D is the number of dogs and C is the number of cats. According to the problem: D = 60 and C = 2D = 60 x 2 = 120 So, the number of rabbits in the neighborhood is: 12 - (60 + 120) = 12 - 180 = 150 Therefore, there are 150 pets in the neighborhood, including 120 cats and 30 dogs.

Rationale:
The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, so the total number of doorbell rings is 20.
The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means they pressed it 20 x 1/4 = 5 times. So, the total number of doorbell rings is now 20 + 5 = 25.
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means they pressed it 60 / 10 = 6 times. So, the total number of doorbell rings is now 25 + 6 = 31.
Therefore, the doorbell made 31 doorbell rings in total."

"Response: 208 cubic inches

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:
V = length x width x height
In this case, the length, width, and height of each box are given as follows:
length = 5 inches = 0.05 feet
width = 6 inches = 0.06 feet
height = 4 inches = 0.04 feet
So, the volume of each box is:
V = length x width x height = 0.05 x 0.06 x 0.04 = 0.0024 cubic feet
Now, we need to find the total volume of all three boxes:
Total volume = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box
= 0.0024 + 0.0024 + 0.0024 = 0.0072 cubic feet
Finally, to convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic inches, we divide the total volume by 1728 (since there are 1728 cubic inches in a cubic foot):
Total volume in cubic inches = Total volume in cubic feet / 1728
= 0.0072 / 1728 = 0.0004 cubic inches
Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is approximately 208 cubic inches."

"Response:  Last year, Henry baked 105 cookies.

Обосновање:
Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so this year he baked 2 x 105 = 210 cookies. However, he dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, so the total number of cookies he had was 210 - 5 = 205 cookies. Then, he realized he accidentally baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the final number of cookies he baked was 205 + 15 = 220 cookies. Finally, after dropping 5 cookies, he had 220 - 5 = 215 cookies left. Therefore, last year Henry baked 105 cookies."

Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?

Based on the problem, formulate a numerical answer. Answer: 20 + (10 x 6) = 38 liters of water

The problem states that the boat takes in two liters of water for every ten feet Julia rows back towards shore. Since it took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet, the boat took on 20 liters of water during that time (2 liters/10 feet x 20 feet). Additionally, there are 64 seconds until Julia reaches shore, so the total amount of water the boat takes on is 20 liters + (10 x 6) = 38 liters."

"Response: 30

Rationale:
Let B be the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, Jamal's phone can hold 6B photographs.
The problem states that the number of photographs in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo is equal to 50 times the number of birds in the photo. Therefore, the number of birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo is:
Number of birds = Number of photographs / 50
= 6B / 50
= 6 × (B/50)
= 6B - 30
Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we know that B must be a multiple of 50, since 1800 = 50 × 36. Therefore, B = 200. So, there are 30 birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo."
Response:  To calculate the total amount of money Sasha made from selling the lumber, we need to multiply the number of boards by their original price and then subtract the cost of the remaining boards.

Response:  To calculate the number of containers imported on the second day, we need to use the information given in the problem: Total number of vehicles at the port = 30 Containers with 5 vehicles per container = 2 containers On the first day, only 2 containers were imported, so the number of containers imported on the second day is: Number of containers imported on the second day = Total number of vehicles - Number of containers imported on the first day = 30 - 2 = 28 containers Therefore, 28 containers were imported on the second day.
"Response:  The total salary of both Adrien и Lylah four years later can be calculated as follows:
Let A be Adrien's salary four years ago and L be Lylah's salary four years ago.
A + L = Total salary four years ago (given)
Adrien's salary four years later = A + (30/100) \* (A) = A + 30% of A
Lylah's salary four years later = L + (40/100) \* (L) = L + 40% of L
Now we know that Adrien's salary is 40% higher than Lylah's salary:
Adrien's salary - Lylah's salary = 40% of (Lylah's salary)
Substituting the values given in the problem:
$40000 + (30/100) \* ($40000) = $56000 + (40/100) \* ($40000)
$56000 + $2800 = $58800
Therefore, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is $58800."

* On Tuesday and Wednesday, Sadie slept for 2 hours less than on Monday (S2 = S1 - 2 and S3 = S1 - 4)
* Throughout the rest of the week, Sadie slept 1 hour more than on Tuesday and Wednesday (Sk = S2 + 1 for k > 2)

So, the total amount of time Sadie slept throughout the week is:

Stotal = S1 + S2 + S3 +... + Sk = 8 + (8 - 2) + (8 - 4) +... + (8 + 1) = 36 hours

Therefore, the answer is 36 hours."

Rosie's running speed can be modeled by the equation:

Speed = 10 + (5/t)

Where t is the time in hours.

We know that Rosie can run for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, so during this time she will have covered:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 x 3 = 30 miles

After 3 hours, her speed decreases to 5 miles per hour, and she continues to run for another 4 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time = 5 x 4 = 20 miles

Therefore, in total, Rosie can run 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours."

"Response: 42

Rеакција:  Great! Let's break it down step by step:

For the first test, Mark had 75 questions and completed them at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So, he spent:

75 questions / 5 questions per hour = 15 hours to complete the test

Since Mark had 8 hours to complete the test, we can subtract the time he actually used from the total time available:

8 hours - 15 hours = 7 hours remaining

So, Mark left 7 hours worth of questions unanswered on the first test.

Now, let's move on to the second test. Mark had 100 questions and completed them at the same rate as before:

100 questions / 5 questions per hour = 20 hours to complete the test

Again, since Mark had 6 hours to complete the test, we can subtract the time he actually used from the total time available:

6 hours - 20 hours = 14 hours remaining

So, Mark left 14 hours worth of questions unanswered on the second test.

Therefore, the answer is 42 questions."

* There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so there are 2 x 300 = 600 worker bees.
* There are twice as many babies as queens, so there are 2 x 100 = 200 baby bees.
* Since there are no queens, the total number of bees is equal to the sum of worker bees and baby bees: 700 + 600 + 200 = 1400 bees.
Therefore, there are 1400 worker bees in the hive."

Secondly, let's find out how many LEGO pieces are in each of the three boxes:

Box 1 has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.

Box 2 has 1/4 the number of pieces as Box 1, so it has 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces.

Finally, let's add up the total number of LEGO pieces Johnny picked up:

Total number of LEGO pieces = 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2700 pieces.

Therefore, Johnny picked up 2700 LEGO pieces from the floor."

"Response:  James has 48 Facebook friends.

Explanation:
Let's assume that Charlie has x friends on Facebook. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, James has 4x = 4x friends on Facebook.
Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, Charlie has 3x = 3x friends on Facebook.
We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can set up the equation:
3x = 12
Solving for x, we get:
x = 4
So, James has 48 friends on Facebook (4x)."

Основна идеја за решење је да се утврђује количина новца коју Shawnda добија на дан када су биле потребне услуге за инфлацију велосипедних тачака. У питању су следеће трансакције:

* 5 особа са бензином (обе тјарке) = $1 x 5 = $5
* 3 особе са трикоцијалом (три тјарка) = $3 x 3 = $9
* 1 особа на уницикулуму (една тјарка) = $0.25 x 1 = $0.25

Укупно: $5 + $9 + $0.25 = $14.25

Таким чином, Shawnda је на дан узела $14.25 за инфлацију велосипских тачака."

"Response: 40

Rationale:

1. Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack. (So far, 14 fries have been eaten.)
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining fries, which is 7 fries. (Now there are 7 + 14 = 21 fries left.)
3. Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 fries. (Now there are 21 - 9 = 12 fries left.)
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is 8 fries. (Now there are 12 - 8 = 4 fries left.)
5. Ants carried off a single french fry. (Now there are 4 - 1 = 3 fries left.)

Therefore, when Dave bought the pack of french fries, there were 40 fries in total."

Rationale:
Jackie can save $35/hour by doing her own taxes instead of hiring an accountant. Since she has 3 fewer hours of freelance work available to her, she will miss out on $35 x 3 = $105 in income.
The cost of hiring an accountant is $90. To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost from the amount she would have missed out on by doing her own taxes: $105 - $90 = $15. Therefore, hiring an accountant will result in a gain of $15 for Jackie."

"Response: 35 миља / дан = 245 миље / недељи
Pancho walks 20 miles (32 km) per day, except on weekends when he walks 10 miles (16 km). How many miles does he walk in a week?
To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in a seven-day period. Since he doesn't walk on weekends, we will use the daily mileage for Monday through Friday and add it up for the entire week.

Daily mileage = 20 miles/day x 5 days/week = 100 miles/week

Therefore, Pancho walks approximately 100 miles (161 km) in a week."

Explanation:
The first team's total time for all four legs would be:
Team 1: 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 260 seconds (or 4 minutes)

The second team's total time for all four legs would be:
Team 2: 60 + 58 + 56 + 54 = 258 seconds (or 4 minutes 9 seconds)

So, Team 1 wins by 12 seconds (260 - 258)."
Response:  The probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on the die is 5/6 or approximately 83%. To calculate the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling another even number on the second roll. This can be done by multiplying the probabilities of each event separately: P(rolling an even number on the first roll) = 4/6 = 2/3 P(rolling an even number on the second roll | rolling an even number on the first roll) = 1/2 Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities together to get the overall probability: P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = 2/3 x 1/2 = 1/3 or approximately 33%

"Response:  Elaine currently has 60 Pokémon cards. Here's how we can calculate it:

Month 1: Elaine starts with 20 cards, so she collects 3 times that = 60 cards (20 x 3 = 60)
Month 2: Elaine collects 20 fewer cards than in Month 1, so she gets 40 new cards (60 - 20 = 40)
Month 3: Elaine collects twice the combined number of cards from Months 1 and 2, so she gets 80 new cards (40 + 20 = 80)
Total number of cards Elaine has after Month 3: 60 + 40 + 80 = 180 cards
Therefore, Elaine has 180 Pokémon cards in total."

"Response:  Total distance = 5 x 25 km + 4 x 60 km = 175 km + 240 km = 415 km

Овај задатак се може решити на следећи начин:

1. Прво, утврдимо колико је Мicheal возио бицикл у недељи. Он је возио га 5 пута у недељи и сваки пут је пошао 25 километара. Зато он је укупно пошао 5 x 25 = 125 километара у недељи.
2. Затим, утврдимо колико је Мicheal возио бицикл у наредних 4 недеље. Он је возио га 4 пута у наредних 4 недеље и сваки пут је пошао 60 километара. Зато он је укупно пошао 4 x 60 = 240 километара у наредних 4 недеље.
3. На крају, утврдимо колико је Мicheal возио бицикл у последњих 3 недеље. Он је возио га 3 пута у последњих 3 недеље и сваки пут је пошао 60 километара. Зато он је укупно пошао 3 x 60 = 180 километара у последњих 3 недеље.

Укупна дужина које је Мicheal пошао на бициклу је:

125 + 240 + 180 = 415 километара

Таким чином, Мicheal је укупно пошао 415 километара на бициклу."

Response:  After all three days, Rose bought a total of 120 cakes.
Response:  The total cost of buying each cup is $4800. To calculate this, we need to use the information given in the problem: Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. So, if the total cost of half a dozen plates is x, then the total cost of twenty dozen cups is x - $1200. Since the problem states that the total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000 each, we can set up the equation: x = $6000. Solving for x, we get: x = $36000. Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $4800 ($36000 / 20).
"Response:  Sara needs to mow the lawn 8 times in order to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. Here is how we can calculate this:

* Jacket cost = $30
* Shoe cost (x) = $20
* Total cost = $30 + ($2 x 2) = $60
* Money Sara has before babysitting = $10
* Babysitting income per time = $5
* Number of times Sara will babysit = 4
* Total amount earned from babysitting = $5 x 4 = $20
* Amount left after buying jacket and shoes = $60 - $20 = $40
* Number of times Sara needs to mow lawn = $40 / $4 = 8 times
Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 8 times in order to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
"Response:  Jerry has 10 red chickens.

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Jerry has a total of 42 eggs every day. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by both types of chickens is 3 + 5 = 8 eggs per day.
Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day and there are only 8 eggs produced per day, it means that Jerry has twice as many eggs as there are red chickens. Therefore, if Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, then the number of red chickens must be half of the total number of chickens.
So, the number of red chickens = Total number of chickens / 2 = 10 red chickens."
"Response:  Gary will spend 2 hours walking if he walks at 3 miles per hour along the edge of the park.

To calculate this, we need to divide the distance of the park's edge (1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles) by Gary's walking speed (3 miles/hour). This gives us the time it takes him to walk one mile: 9 miles / 3 miles/hour = 3 hours. Since he wants to walk around the entire park, we multiply this time by the number of miles in the park (9 miles), which gives us the total time he spends walking: 3 hours x 9 miles = 27 hours. Therefore, Gary will spend 2 hours walking if he walks at 3 miles per hour along the edge of the park."

"Response: 20 галона

Explanation:
Let's call the amount of water in the small pool x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the big pool is 2x = 8 gallons.
Now, we are told that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so the amount of water in the big pool after 4 minutes is 4x = 32 gallons.
Since the big pool initially had twice as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the small pool after 4 minutes is x - 2(8) = x - 16 gallons.
Therefore, the small pool has 20 gallons of water left after 4 minutes."
"Response: 160 hours

Rationale:
Lori's total cost for the shoes and belt is $352.00 ($320.00 + $32.00). To find out how many hours she needs to work to afford these items, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$352.00 / $8.00/hour = 160 hours
Therefore, Lori will need to work for 160 hours (or approximately 6 weeks at 8 hours per day) to save enough money to buy the shoes and belt."
"Response:  Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months = ($2000 x 1.10) - $165 x 12 = $2340 - $2080 = $260

Janeth borrowed $2000 from a friend and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. If she is going to pay $165 per month for 12 months, how much will be her remaining balance by then?
To find out Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay, including both the principal and interest.
The formula for calculating the total amount due on a loan is:
Total Amount Due = Principal + Interest
In this case, the principal is $2000, and the interest is $165 x 12 = $2080. So, the total amount due is:
Total Amount Due = $2000 + $2080 = $4080
Now, let's subtract the amount Janeth has already paid each month:
Remaining Balance = Total Amount Due - Monthly Payments
= $4080 - $165 x 12 = $260
Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months is $260."

Основна идеја за решење овог питања је да се нађе количина поена коју јеJojo остварио у игри. Наиме, according to the problem statement, Jojo scored 39 points less than the total number of points scored by all four students together (251). Therefore, we can write:

Jojo's score = Total score - (Naomi's score + Yuri's score + Brianna's score)

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Jojo's score = 251 - (68 + 10 + 17)
= 251 - 95
= 156

Therefore, Jojo scored 156 points in the board game."

Response:  The amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters is 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30). Since she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, there are 60 liters of additional water in the tank (30 + 2 x 30 = 60). Therefore, the total amount of water in the tank now is 60 + 30 = 90 liters.

To find the time it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the number of pieces in the puzzle by their combined hourly rate:
Number of pieces in puzzle = 360 pieces
Combined hourly rate = 24 + 12 = 36 pieces/hour
Time to complete puzzle = Number of pieces in puzzle / Combined hourly rate = 360 pieces / 36 pieces/hour = 10 hours
Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom 10 hours to complete the 360-piece puzzle."

We know that 70% of the total number of watermelons were ready for harvest after two months (30% x 2 = 60). So, the total number of watermelons was 120 + 60 = 180.

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which means that 3/4 x 180 = 135 watermelons were left unharvested. Therefore, there were 180 - 135 = 56 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks."
"Response:  Mark pays a total of $240,000 for the fleet of 12 cars. Here's how we calculate it:

1. Tax on cars: $20,000 x 10% = $2,000 (per car)
Total tax: $24,000 ($2,000 x 12 cars)
2. Registration fee: $1,000 per car
Total registration fee: $12,000 ($1,000 x 12 cars)
3. Total cost: $240,000 ($24,000 + $12,000)
Therefore, Mark pays a total of $240,000 for the fleet of 12 cars."

Rationale:
On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Robert collects 20 shells.
On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday, so she collects 60% more shells = 1.2 x 20 = 24 shells."

1/3 x 36 = 24 (број пенгуина који су у процесу санча)
1/3 x 24 = 8 (број пенгуина који су у океану)
1/3 x 24 = 8 (број пенгуина који су у пећини дајућег за оброу)
Таким чином, остаје 24 пенгуина које још увек санче у снегу."

Mike has been a penpal with 5 people for the past year. Each person sends 2 letters per week, and Mike replies to each letter in kind. Since there are 5 people, Mike receives a total of 10 letters per week (2 letters x 5 people = 10 letters).

To calculate how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to divide the number of letters he writes by the time it takes him to write one letter. According to the problem, Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so he can write an entire letter in 6/7 of an hour (or 43.2 minutes). Therefore, Mike spends approximately 43.2 minutes per day writing letters. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we multiply this value by 7 days:

43.2 minutes/day x 7 days/week = 303.4 minutes/week

Finally, to convert minutes to hours, we divide the total number of minutes by 60:

303.4 minutes/week / 60 = 5.05 hours/week

Therefore, according to the problem, Mike spends approximately 5.05 hours per week writing letters to his pen pals."

Griffin had 24 french fries to start with.
Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 2 x 5 = 10 fries.
So now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is equal to 5 fries (since she only has 18).
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which means he took 3 less than 10 = 7 fries.
Now Griffin had 9 + 5 + 7 = 21 fries left.
Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries."
Response:  Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write: Snails in first aquarium = 2x Fish in first aquarium + Snails in second aquarium = 32 - 2x Fish in second aquarium We know that the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32, so we can substitute this value into the equation: Snails in first aquarium = 2x Fish in first aquarium + (32 - 2x) Fish in second aquarium Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Snails in first aquarium = 2(8) + (32 - 16) = 16 + 16 = 32 Fish in first aquarium = 8 Fish in second aquarium = 16 Now we know that there are 8 fish in the first aquarium and 16 fish in the second aquarium.

Explanation:

* Hourly rate of makeup artist = $250/hour
* Number of hours required per day = 6 hours/day x 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
* Total number of hours worked = 24 hours/week x 5 weeks = 120 hours
* Total cost = hourly rate x total number of hours worked = $250/hour x 120 hours = $30,000
* Discount given by makeup artist = 10% of $30,000 = $3,000
* Final cost paid by Jean = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000
Therefore, Jean paid a total of $27,000 for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot."

"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of calories that each girl ate over the two days. Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister (let's call this number x). So, Sue ate x cookies on Monday.
* On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister (so, Sue ate 2x cookies on Tuesday).
* The sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday (so, the sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies over the two days).

Now, let's calculate the total number of calories that each girl ate over the two days:

Sue:
Cookies eaten = x + 2x = 3x cookies
Total calories = 3x x 200 calories/cookie = 600 calories

Sister:
Cookies eaten = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies
Total calories = 18 x 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

Since Sue ate 600 calories and her sister ate 3600 calories, Sue consumed 3000 - 600 = 2400 fewer calories than her sister over the two days."
