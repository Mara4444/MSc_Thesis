"Response: 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Jenny sells per day (in dozens).

Jenny sells 16 dozen eggs per day, which is equal to 192 eggs (16 x 12 = 192).

Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from egg sales.

If each dozen eggs costs $2, then Jenny earns $38.40 per day from egg sales ($2 x 192 = $38.40).

Step 3: Calculate the weekly revenue from egg sales.

Since Jenny works 7 days a week, her weekly revenue from egg sales would be $38.40 x 7 = $270.80.

Now, let's calculate how much money Jenny spends on feed for her chickens.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of feeding her chickens.

Assuming she feeds them with $2 worth of feed per day, her weekly expense on feed would be $2 x 7 = $14.

So, Jenny's weekly profit from egg sales minus her weekly expense on feed would be:

$270.80 - $14 = $256.80

Therefore, Jenny makes approximately $256.80 per week selling eggs."
"Response:  We know that we need to make a pot with two layers of clay - one layer is 2 rupees and another layer is 10 taka. So, if we calculate the total cost of making this pot, it will be:

2 rupees (for the first layer) + 10 taka (for the second layer) = 12 taka

Therefore, the maximum amount of money you can spend to buy this pot is 12 taka."
Response:  We know that the cost price of the house is $80,000 and Josh sold it for $130,000 (150% of the cost price). So, we can calculate the profit as follows: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price Profit = $130,000 - $80,000 Profit = $50,000 Therefore, Josh made a profit of $50,000 from selling the house.
"Response:  We know that James has three sprinklers and each sprinkler uses 60 liters of water per hour. So, if he wants to water his garden for one hour, he will use 3 x 60 = 180 liters of water. Now, we need to find out how much water James will use in one week (7 days). One day is equal to 24 hours, so:

1 week = 7 days x 24 hours/day = 168 hours

Therefore, James will use 168 hours x 60 liters/hour = 9520 liters of water in one week."
Response:  We know that Wendy eats 3 meals a day and each meal consists of 5 cups of rice, 2 cups of lentils, and 1 cup of vegetables. So, she consumes a total of 3 x 5 = 15 cups of food per day. Now, we need to calculate how much food Wendy will consume if she has 20 chickens. Since each chicken produces about 1.5 kg of meat per week (assuming 7 days), Wendy will have a total of 20 x 1.5 = 30 kg of meat per week. To convert this amount to cups, we can use the fact that 1 kg of meat is approximately equal to 4 cups. Therefore, Wendy will have 30 kg x 4 cups/kg = 120 cups of meat per week. Adding this to her daily consumption of 15 cups gives us a total of 15 + 120 = 135 cups of food per week.
"Response:  We know that each bottle of cola costs $5 and has two glasses. So the cost per glass is $5 / 2 = $2.50. Since 60% of the cost of the second glass is covered in the price of the first glass, we can calculate the cost of the second glass as follows:

Cost of the second glass = (60% of $5) + ($2.50 x 2)
= $3 + ($2.50 x 2)
= $3 + $5
= $8

Therefore, the total cost of 16 bottles of cola would be:

Total cost = 16 x $5
= 16 x $2.50
= 40 x $2.50
= $1000

So, the total amount of money that Kailar needs to pay for 16 bottles of cola is $1000."
Response:  We know that Charles has 4 times as many books as Tuluj does. So if Tuluj has x books, Charles will have 4x books. Now we are told that Siyatola has 20 more books than Tuluj. Therefore, Siyatola has x + 20 books. To find out how many books Charles and Siyatola together have, we can add their respective numbers of books: 4x + (x + 20) =?
Response:  We know that Carl can download files at a rate of 2 GB per minute. So if he wants to download a file of 200 GB, it will take him approximately (200 GB / 2 GB/min) = 100 minutes to complete the download. However, as you mentioned, after downloading for 40% of the total time, Windows updates were installed, which took an additional 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to download and install the updates will be (100 min + 20 min) = 120 minutes or 2 hours.
"Response:  We know that Tinu has to travel 60 miles in 3 hours and then return back for another 4 hours to cover a total distance of 80 miles. So, we can start by finding out how far he will be able to go in 3 hours at a constant speed.

Speed = Distance / Time
Distance = Speed x Time

In this case, the distance is 60 miles, and the time is 3 hours.

Speed = 60 / 3 = 20 miles per hour

Now, let's find out how far Tinu will be able to go in 4 hours at the same speed.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 20 x 4 = 80 miles

So, Tinu will be able to go 80 miles in 4 hours. To find out how far he will be from home after 4 hours, we need to subtract the distance he traveled in 3 hours (60 miles) from the total distance he covered (80 miles).

Distance from home = Total distance - Distance traveled in 3 hours
Distance from home = 80 - 60 = 20 miles

Therefore, Tinu will be 20 miles away from home after completing his journey in 4 hours."
"Response:  We know that Eliza works for 40 hours per week at $10 per hour. So her weekly earnings are:

$10 x 40 hours = $400 per week

Now, if she works for an additional 5 hours (i.e., 45 hours in total), her extra earnings would be:

$10 x 5 hours = $50

So, her total earnings for the week would be:

$400 + $50 = $450

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for the week would be $450."
"Response:  We know that in the first month, there were 60 downloads and in the second month, there was a 30% increase in downloads from the previous month. So, if we can find out how many downloads there were in the second month, we can calculate the total number of downloads for three months.

In the second month, there were 60 x 1.3 = 78 downloads (since there was a 30% increase).

Now, let's add up all the downloads for three months:

60 + 78 + 60 = 198

So, there were 198 downloads over three months."
"Response:  We know that Tulasi bought three types of sweets - 3 dozen donuts at $8 each, 2 dozen chocolate bars at $10 each, and 6 packs of mint chocolates at $5 each. So we can start by calculating the cost of each item separately:  
Donuts: 3 dozen x $8/dozen = $24  
Chocolate Bars: 2 dozen x $10/dozen = $20  
Mint Chocolates: 6 packs x $5/pack = $30  
Total Cost: $24 + $20 + $30 = $74  
Therefore, the total amount Tulasi spent is $74."
"Response:  We know that Carlos will sell each lemon tree for $1.5 and he has 7 trees in total. So his total revenue from selling all the trees will be:

Revenue = Number of trees x Price per tree
= 7 x $1.5
= $10.5

We also know that Carlos spends $3 per year on watering and taking care of each tree. So his total expenses for all the trees will be:

Expenses = Number of trees x Cost per tree
= 7 x $3
= $21

Now we need to find out how many years it will take for Carlos to break even, i.e., when his total revenue equals his total expenses. We can set up an equation using the information given in the problem:

Total Revenue - Total Expenses = Break Even Point
$10.5 - $21 = Break Even Point
-$10.5 = Break Even Point

Since the break-even point is negative, it means that Carlos will never break even if he continues to sell the lemons at $1.5 per tree. He will always lose money because his expenses are higher than his revenue."
Response:  Melani has 3 houses - one main house and two additional houses. She sold each of these houses for $100,000, so she earned a total of $300,000 from selling her houses. Now, let's calculate how much money Melani made from each of her houses. Since she had three houses, she made $100,000 from each house. Therefore, the answer is 3 x $100,000 = $300,000.
Response:  We know that there are 20 students in total and we have to find out how many of them are hip-hop fans. According to the information given, 20% of the students are class monitors, which means they cannot be hip-hop fans because only 25% of the students can be class monitors. So, if 20% of the students are class monitors, then 80% of the students are not class monitors (100 - 20 = 80). Now, we need to find out how many of these non-class monitor students are hip-hop fans. Since 25% of the students are class monitors, it means that 75% of the students are not class monitors (100 - 25 = 75). Therefore, among the non-class monitor students, 25% of them are hip-hop fans (75 x 25 = 18). In total, there are 18 hip-hop fans among all the students.
"Response:  We know that the total cost of both options is $5,000 or $8,000, depending on whether they choose the basic or advanced package. The profit margin for each option is 2.5% and 1.2%, respectively. To calculate the revenue required to break even, we need to first determine the fixed costs associated with each option.

For the basic package, the fixed costs are $5,000 (the cost of the package). For the advanced package, the fixed costs are $8,000 (the cost of the package) + $3,000 (the additional cost of the advanced features) = $11,000.

Next, we can use the formula for breakeven point to calculate the revenue required to break even for each option:

Break-even point = Fixed costs / Profit margin

Substituting the values, we get:

Basic Package:
Break-even point = $5,000 / 0.025 = $200,000

Advanced Package:
Break-even point = $11,000 / 0.012 = $916,667

Therefore, if the business owner wants to break even within one month, they would need to generate at least $200,000 in revenue from the basic package or $916,667 in revenue from the advanced package."
"Response:  We know that each train travels for two days and covers a distance of 80 miles per day in the east and 150 miles per day in the west. So we can calculate the total distance traveled by both trains as follows:

Eastbound Train (Day 1):
Distance = 80 miles

Westbound Train (Day 2):
Distance = 150 miles

Total Distance Traveled by Both Trains = Distance Eastbound + Distance Westbound
= 80 miles + 150 miles
= 230 miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled by both trains is 230 miles."
Response:  We know that the monthly salary of a teacher is $20 and that of a principal is $30. If they work for one year, which is equal to 12 months, then their annual salaries will be: Teacher's annual salary = $20 x 12 = $240 Principal's annual salary = $30 x 12 = $360 Now, if they work for half a year (i.e., 6 months), then their respective salaries will be: Teacher's half-yearly salary = $240 / 2 = $120 Principal's half-yearly salary = $360 / 2 = $180 So, the total amount earned by both the teacher and the principal in six months will be: Total earnings of teacher = $120 x 2 = $240 Total earnings of principal = $180 x 2 = $360
Response:  We know that each day, Klayar eats three eggs and produces one omelette. So in four weeks (since there are seven days in a week), she will eat 3 x 7 = 21 eggs.
Response:  We know that Marisa can paint 4 miles in one hour and she has already painted 3 miles in two hours. So, we need to find out how much distance she can cover in one hour if she is painting at a constant speed. To do this, we will divide the total distance she needs to cover (4 miles) by her speed (which we want to find out). Therefore, we have: Total Distance / Speed = Time Taken Now, let's substitute the values we know: 4 miles / Speed = 2 hours Since we are asked to find out the speed, we can solve for it as follows: Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken Speed = 4 miles / 2 hours Speed = 2 miles/hour Therefore, Marisa can paint 2 miles per hour.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 liters of water in the large jug and 15 liters of water in the small jug. So if we pour all the water from the small jug into the large jug, how much water will be left in the small jug?

We can start by subtracting 15 liters (the amount of water in the small jug) from 24 liters (the total amount of water):

24 liters - 15 liters =?

Do you see the pattern here? Keep going!"
"Response:  We know that Reman is 6 years older than Samantha and has a son who is 23 years old. So, we can start by finding out how old Samantha is.

Samantha's age = Reman's age - 6 years

We also know that Reman's son is 23 years old, so we can use that information to find out how old Reman is.

Reman's age = Son's age + 6 years

Now we have two equations:

Samantha's age = Reman's age - 6 years

Reman's age = Son's age + 6 years

Can you solve for Reman's age using one of these equations? Once you have Reman's age, you can find out how many years before Samantha was born by subtracting her age from Reman's age."
"Response:  We know that Bill has sold 8 copies of his DVD to 8 customers. He has given 3 copies to the first three customers at $15 each, and he has given 2 copies to the next two customers at $10 each. So, how many more DVDs did Bill sell?

Let X be the number of additional DVDs sold. Since there are only 3 remaining copies left after giving 3 copies to the first three customers, we can write an equation based on this information:

X + 3 = 8 (since 8 customers bought DVDs)

Now, let's simplify the equation:

X + 3 - 3 = 8 - 3

Solving for X, we get:

X = 5

So, Bill sold 5 additional DVDs."
Response:  We know that there are two sentiments in total (one positive and one negative). So if we divide the time period of 5 hours into two equal parts, each part will be 2.5 hours long (5 hours / 2 = 2.5 hours). Now, let's consider how many sentences each sentiment has to cover this time period. Since each sentence takes 30 minutes to an hour to express, we can say that: Positive Sentiment: 2.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes Negative Sentiment: 2.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes Therefore, both sentiments have the same number of sentences - 150 minutes or 30 sentences each!
Response:  We know that the original price of the book was $19.50 and it was discounted by 25%. So, we can calculate the discount amount as follows: Discount = Original Price x Discount Percentage Discount = $19.50 x 25% Discount = $4.875 Now, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original price to find out the sale price of the book: Sale Price = Original Price - Discount Sale Price = $19.50 - $4.875 Sale Price = $14.625 Therefore, the sale price of the book after a 25% discount is $14.625.
"Response:  We know that Mariam sold each chicken for $12 and each pack of eggs for $3. She also sold four apples at $1.50 each. So, let's calculate her total earnings from selling these items first:

Chickens: 5 x $12 = $60
Eggs: 5 x $3 = $15
Apples: 4 x $1.50 = $6
Total earnings: $60 + $15 + $6 = $81

Now, we need to find out how many boxes of eggs Mariam sold if each box costs $8.50. To do this, we can divide her total earnings from selling eggs ($15) by the price per box ($8.50):

$15 ÷ $8.50 = 18

So, Mariam sold 18 boxes of eggs."
"Response:  We know that Mishka bought three shirts, three pants, and three pairs of shoes. The cost of one shirt is $16.50, one pair of pants costs $22.50, and one pair of shoes costs $42. So, to calculate the total cost of all the items, we need to multiply each item's cost by the number of items she bought. 
Total Cost = (Number of Shirts x Cost per Shirt) + (Number of Pants x Cost per Pant) + (Number of Shoes x Cost per Shoe)
= (3 x $16.50) + (3 x $22.50) + (3 x $42)
= $49.50 + $67.50 + $126
= $243
Therefore, Mishka spent $243 on her new clothes."
"Response:  We know that the cost of one serving of ice cream is $4.00 and Aisha will buy 15 servings every day for 60 days. So, the total amount she spends on ice cream in 60 days is:

$4.00 x 15 = $60.00 per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount she spends on ice cream in 60 days:

$60.00 x 60 = $3,600.00

So, Aisha will spend $3,600.00 on ice cream in 60 days."
"Response: 

Step 1: Henry had 60 miles to travel in his bike trip.

Step 2: He traveled for 20 miles and then took a break.

Step 3: After the break, he continued his journey and traveled another 15 miles.

Now, let's calculate how much distance Henry covered in total:

Total distance = Distance traveled before the break + Distance traveled after the break
= 20 miles + 15 miles
= 35 miles

So, Henry covered a total of 35 miles in his bike trip."
"Response:  We know that the price of one unit of glorious juice is $33 and we want to find out how much will be the total cost of buying 5 units of glorious juice if the price of each unit decreases by 10%. So, first, let's calculate the new price of one unit after a 10% discount:

New Price = Old Price x (1 - 0.1)
= $33 x (1 - 0.1)
= $33 x 0.9
= $29.70

Now, we need to find out the total cost of buying 5 units of glorious juice at the new price:

Total Cost = Number of Units x New Price per Unit
= 5 x $29.70
= $148.50

So, the total cost of buying 5 units of glorious juice after a 10% discount would be $148.50."
"Response:  We know that Darrel and Allen are currently 71 years old, and their combined age is 162 years. So we can say that:

Darrel's age = (162 - 71) / 2 = 91 years
Allen's age = (162 - 71) / 2 = 91 years

Now, if we want to find out how many years ago Allen was born, we can subtract his current age from his total age:

Allen's age 10 years ago = 91 - 10 = 81 years ago

So, Allen was born 81 years ago."
Response:  We know that Guntur has 80 friends and he is sure about 20 of them. So, there are 80 - 20 = 60 uncertain friends. Now, we need to find out how many of these uncertain friends are from Prithomjohn's group. We know that 25% of Prithomjohn's group are uncertain friends, so we can say that 25% of 60 = 15 uncertain friends are from Prithomjohn's group. Therefore, the total number of uncertain friends from all groups is 60 + 15 = 75.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 cups of rice to be cooked and each cup takes 5 hours to cook. So, we need to calculate how many hours it will take to cook all 10 cups of rice together. To do this, we can use multiplication.

10 x 5 = 50 hours

Therefore, it will take 50 hours to cook all 10 cups of rice together."
"Response:  We know that there are 110 mudras in all and 30 of them are sworn to be from Raupya Mudra. So, we can calculate the number of Swarnamudras as follows:

Number of Swarnamudras = Total number of mudras - Number of Raupya Mudras
= 110 - 30
= 80

Therefore, there are 80 Swarnamudras in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 2 less than 40 in 37. So we can write: 
37 - 2 =? 
We get: 
37 - 2 = 35 
Now we need to find out how many times 5 goes into 35. To do this, we divide 35 by 5: 
35 ÷ 5 =? 
We get: 
35 ÷ 5 = 7 
So, there are 7 times 5 or 35 in 37. Therefore, there are 35 - 2 = 33 ratnas in Sivahan's case."
Response:  We know that in the first 20 minutes, Tinu scored 4 goals. So, he scored 4/60 = 1/15 of his total score in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than what he scored in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, he scored (1/15) x 1.25 = 1/8 of his total score in the last 20 minutes. Since there are two halves of equal duration, we can say that Tinu scored a total of 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 of his total score. Now, we need to find out how many goals Tinu scored in total. We know that he scored 4 goals in the first 20 minutes and 25% more than that in the second half. So, if he scored x goals in total, then he scored 4 + (x / 4) = 4 + (x / 4) goals in the first 20 minutes and 25% more than that in the second half. Therefore, the total number of goals scored by Tinu is 4 + (x / 4) + (x / 4) \* 1.25 = 4 + (x / 2). Solving for x, we get x = 8. Therefore, Tinu scored a total of 8 goals in the match.
Response:  We know that there are two yogurt brands available in the market and each costs $5.00 per unit. The total cost of one day's supply is 4 x $5.00 = $20.00. Since we need to buy for 30 days, so the total amount spent on yogurt will be $20.00 x 30 = $600.00.
"Response:  We know that John has 13 pieces of luggage and each piece costs $15 to ship. So, the total cost of shipping all 13 pieces would be:

13 x $15 = $195

We also know that John wants to sell his old video games for $20 per game. He has 8 games in total, so if he sells all 8 games, he will earn:

8 x $20 = $160

Now, let's calculate how much money John needs to make up for the difference between what he spent on shipping ($195) and what he earned from selling his video games ($160). To do this, we subtract the amount he earned from the amount he spent:

$195 - $160 = $35

So, John needs an additional $35 to break even. However, since he only sold 7 games and not all 8, he actually made less than $160. Let's calculate how much he made by selling 7 games instead:

7 x $20 = $140

Now, we can compare the amount John made ($140) with the amount he needed to break even ($35):

$140 > $35 (true)

Therefore, John made enough money from selling his video games to cover the cost of shipping his luggage."
"Response:  We know that John works for 3 days and each day he works for 3 hours (9 am to 12 pm). So, in total, he works for 3 x 3 = 9 hours per week. Now, we need to calculate how many minutes he works in a week. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

9 hours/week x 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes/week

Therefore, John works for 540 minutes per week."
"Response:  We know that Dan has to travel 3 miles in 1 hour and he is using his horse to do so. Now, we need to find out how many miles the horse can cover in an hour. To do this, we will use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed of the horse is given as 2 times the distance traveled per hour (i.e., 2x). So, if Dan wants to travel 3 miles in 1 hour, the horse must be able to cover:

Distance = 3 miles
Speed = 2x
Time = 1 hour

Now, we can solve for x:

x = Distance / Speed
= 3 miles / 2x
= 3/2x

Since we are looking for whole numbers, let's round up x to the nearest integer. This gives us:

x = 4

So, the horse can cover 4 miles in 1 hour. Therefore, Dan needs to walk 3 miles to reach his destination."
"Response:  If Suzi's iPhone is one year old and Brandan's iPhone is two years older than Suzi's, then Brandan's iPhone will be:

2 years + 1 year = 3 years older than Suzi's iPhone.

So, if Suzi's iPhone is one year old, Brandan's iPhone will be three years old."
"Response:  We know that the dragon is 1000 feet away from Mount Farvor, and we also know that the distance between two points on the surface of the Earth (such as Mount Farvor and the dragon) can be calculated using the formula d = r \* cos(θ), where d is the distance between the two points, r is the radius of the Earth (which is approximately 6371 kilometers or 3959 miles), and θ is the angle between the two points measured in radians.

Since we are dealing with large distances here, let's use the approximate value of the radius of the Earth to be 6371 kilometers or 3959 miles. Now, we need to find out what angle θ is between Mount Farvor and the dragon. To do this, we can use the fact that the angle between two lines that intersect each other is equal to the angle between their corresponding projections onto a common plane. In this case, the common plane is the surface of the Earth.

Let's draw a line connecting Mount Farvor to the dragon, and another line perpendicular to it passing through the center of the Earth. The angle θ between these two lines will give us the angle between Mount Farvor and the dragon. Using trigonometry, we can show that this angle is given by tan(θ) = h / r, where h is the height of Mount Farvor above sea level (let's assume it's around 2000 meters or 6562 feet) and r is the radius of the Earth.

Substituting the values, we get tan(θ) = 2000 / 6371 ≈ 0.315 or θ ≈ 58.3 degrees. So, the angle between Mount Farvor and the dragon is approximately 58.3 degrees. Now, we can use the formula d = r \* cos(θ) to calculate the distance between Mount Farvor and the dragon. Substituting the values, we get d = 6371 \* cos(58.3) ≈ 3959 \* 0.855 = approximately 3362 kilometers or 2088 miles.

"
Response:  We know that Jonas had 5 apples and he gave 2 to each of his friends (8 in total). So, Jonas has 5 - 8 = 7 apples left. Now, we need to find out how many apples each friend got. Since there are 8 friends, and each friend got 2 apples, so each friend got 2/8 = 1/4 of Jonas' remaining apples. Therefore, each friend got 7/4 = 1 and 3/4 apples.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 servings in each bag of chips and each serving contains 30 grams of calories. So, to calculate how many bags of chips you can buy with your daily calorie intake of 2000 calories, we need to divide 2000 by 30.

2000 / 30 = 66.67 (rounded off to the nearest whole number)

So, you can buy 67 bags of chips with your daily calorie intake of 2000 calories."
"Response:  We know that each pound of mangoes costs $2. So if Charlie sells 20 pounds of mangoes at $2 per pound, his total revenue will be:

20 x $2 = $40

Now, let's calculate his profit. He spent $10 on packaging materials and transportation, so his profit is:

$40 - $10 = $30

So, Charlie will make a profit of $30 from selling 20 pounds of mangoes at $2 per pound."
Response:  We know that Meredith has been blogging for four hours every day and writing five articles per day during the past week. That means she has written 5 x 7 = 35 articles in total. Now, we need to calculate how much time she spends on each article. Since she writes two-thirds of an article on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and one-third on Tuesday and Thursday, let's assume that the average time spent on each article is (2/3 + 1/3) / 2 = 5/6. Therefore, the time spent on each article is 5/6 hour or 50 minutes. So, Meredith spends approximately 50 minutes on each article.
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 posts in her Instagram account before she went to Paris. She posted 220 photos of herself and her friends during her trip, which means she has 300 posts in total (80 + 220). If we subtract the number of posts she had before going to Paris from the total number of posts she has now, we get: 
300 - 80 = 220
So, Candice has 220 posts in her Instagram account now."
Response:  We know that Neil has bought 100 units of blue paint at $40 per unit and sold them for $80 each. So he made a profit of $40 per unit or $40 x 100 = $4000 in total. Now we are asked to find out how much profit he would have made if he had sold the same quantity of red paint instead. To do this, we need to know what percentage discount he gave on the price of red paint compared to the original price of blue paint. The problem states that the discount was 50%. This means that the selling price of red paint is 50% less than the original price of blue paint. So let's calculate the selling price of red paint first. If the original price of blue paint is $40 per unit, then the selling price of red paint will be $40 x (1 - 0.5) = $40 x 0.5 = $20 per unit. Since Neil sold 100 units of red paint, his total revenue from selling red paint would be $20 x 100 = $2000. Now we can compare this with the profit he made from selling blue paint to see how much more profit he could have made if he had sold red paint instead. Profit from selling blue paint = $4000 Revenue from selling red paint = $2000 So the difference between the two amounts is the profit Neil could have made if he had sold red paint instead of blue paint: Difference = $4000 - $2000 = $2000 Therefore, Neil could have made an additional profit of $2000 if he had sold red paint instead of blue paint.
Response:  We know that Trisha bagged 4 futuristic projects worth Tk 1 crore each. So, she got a total of 4 x Tk 1 crore = Tk 4 crores. Now, we need to find out how much money she spent in total for all the 6 items. Since each item cost Tk 1 lakh, she spent 6 x Tk 1 lakh = Tk 6 lakhs. Therefore, Trisha spent Tk 4 crores - Tk 6 lakhs = Tk 3.40 crores.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 units in each floor and 3/4 of the building is occupied. So we can start by finding out how many floors are not fully occupied.

Number of floors not fully occupied = Total number of floors - Number of floors with full occupancy
= 15 - (8 x 3/4)
= 15 - 6
= 9

Now, we need to find out how many units are not fully occupied in each of these floors. Since there are 8 units in each floor, we can multiply the number of floors not fully occupied by 8 to get the total number of unoccupied units.

Total number of unoccupied units = Number of floors not fully occupied x Number of units per floor
= 9 x 8
= 72

Therefore, there are 72 unoccupied units in the building."
"Response:  We know that the farmer sells 252 eggs per day at $2 each, which means he earns $504 daily (252 x $2). To calculate his weekly income, we need to multiply this amount by 7 days. So, his weekly income is:

$504 x 7 = $3,528

Therefore, the farmer earns $3,528 per week."
"Response:  We know that Tomer has traveled for 10 miles and then returned back home. So his total distance traveled is 20 miles (10 miles x 2). Now we need to find out how much he spent on fuel during his return journey from 4 pm to 6 pm. Since he spent $3 per gallon of fuel, we can calculate as follows:

Total distance = 20 miles
Fuel consumed = Total distance / Gallons per mile
= 20 miles / 3 gallons/mile
= 6.67 gallons (approximately)

Therefore, Tomer spent approximately $6.67 x $3/gallon = $20 on fuel during his return journey."
"Response:  We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and there are 30 comic books in total. So, the total weight of all the comic books is:

30 x 1/4 = 7 1/2 pounds

Now, if we want to calculate how much more weight the helmet will add to the package, we need to subtract the weight of the comics from the total weight of the package. So, the difference between the two weights would be:

Total weight - Weight of comics =?

We can fill in the blank with our calculation:

Total weight - Weight of comics = 7 1/2 pounds - 30 x 1/4 pounds
= 7 1/2 pounds - 7 1/2 pounds / 4
= 7 1/2 pounds - 1 3/4 pounds
= 5 3/4 pounds

Therefore, the helmet will add approximately 5 3/4 pounds to the package."
Response:  We know that the mechanic has worked for 6 days (Monday to Saturday) and has repaired 6 cars and 4 bikes. So, in total, he has done 6 x $60 = $360 worth of work for cars and 4 x $40 = $160 worth of work for bikes, which adds up to a total of $520. Now, we need to find out how much profit he made from each car and bike repair. To do this, we can subtract the cost of parts from the total amount earned. For cars, the cost of parts is $60 per car, so if he did 6 car repairs, his total cost of parts would be 6 x $60 = $360. His profit from car repairs would be $520 - $360 = $160 per car. Similarly, for bikes, his total cost of parts is $40 per bike, so his profit from bike repairs would be $160 - $40 = $120 per bike. Therefore, the mechanic has made a total profit of $160 + $120 = $280 from all the repairs he did during those 6 days.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 cows in total, and each cow has given birth to 2 calves. So, we can start by finding out how many calves there are in total.

Total number of calves = Number of cows x Number of calves per cow
= 7 x 2
= 14

Now, we know that there are 14 calves in total. But we also know that some of these calves have been sold. The question asks us to find out how many calves are left with their mothers. To do this, we need to subtract the number of calves that have been sold from the total number of calves.

Number of calves left with their mothers = Total number of calves - Number of calves sold
= 14 - 3
= 11

So, there are 11 calves left with their mothers."
Response:  We know that there are 30 lollipops in total and 2 lollipops have been eaten already. So, we have 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left. Now, if each bag contains 2 lollipops, then we can fill 28 / 2 = 14 bags with lollipops. Therefore, Jinn can buy 14 bags of lollipops.
"Response:  We know that Peter has $7 in his pocket and he wants to watch a movie that costs $42. So, first we need to calculate how many times Peter can watch a movie with his current money. To do this, we divide $7 by $42:

$7 ÷ $42 =?

Solution:

$7 ÷ $42 = 0.167 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, Peter can watch the movie 167 times with his current money. However, since he only has $7, he cannot watch the entire movie. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Peter can watch the movie 167/3 = 59 times."
"Response:  We know that the weight of the car is 3755 pounds (1700 kg), and we want to calculate how much weight can be carried by the cables supporting the bridge. The maximum weight that the cables can carry is given as 5000 pounds (2268 kg). So, we need to find out how much weight can be carried by each cable.

Let's assume there are n cables supporting the bridge, and each cable has a capacity of x pounds (where x is a positive number). Then, the total weight supported by all the cables would be:

x \* n = 5000... (1)

We also know that the weight of the car is 3755 pounds, so if we divide both sides of equation (1) by this value, we get:

n = 3755 / x... (2)

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and n). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 2268... (3)

n = 17... (4)

So, there are 17 cables supporting the bridge, and each cable has a capacity of 2268 pounds. Therefore, the total weight that can be carried by the cables is:

2268 \* 17 = 39,396 pounds... (5)

This means that the cables can support a total weight of approximately 39,396 pounds or about 17 tons."
"Response:  We know that Stiefen sold his product to a wholesaler for $40.00 and the wholesaler added a profit of 25% and $3.00 delivery charge. So, the total amount received by Stefen is:

$40.00 x (1 + 0.25) = $40.00 x 1.25 = $50.00

Adding the delivery charge of $3.00, we get:

$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

So, Stefen received $53.00 from the sale of his product."
"Response:  We know that there are 6 types of rasgullas and each type has 20 pieces. So, in total, there are 6 x 20 = 120 rasgullas. Now, we need to find out how many packets of 67 pieces each will be required to make 120 rasgullas. To do this, we can divide 120 by 67, which gives us:

120 / 67 = 1.84

So, we need 1 packet of 67 pieces to make 120 rasgullas. Therefore, the maximum number of rasgullas that can be made is 120."
Response:  We know that there are 25 packets of compressed rice in total, and each packet weighs 1 kg. So, the total weight of all the packets is 25 x 1 = 25 kg. Now, we know that 20% of the weight is 25 x 0.2 = 5 kg. Since 2 packets have been damaged, we need to subtract their weight from the total weight. Therefore, the weight of good quality rice is 25 - 5 = 20 kg.
"Response:  We know that Tina gave Jenet $500 as a gift for her mother's birthday and spent another $800 on gifts for her friends. So, in total, she spent $500 + $800 = $1300. And then, she returned 10% of the amount to Jenet.

So, the amount Tina returned to Jenet is:
$1300 x 10% = $130

Therefore, Tina gave Jenet $130 as a return gift."
"Response:  We know that Mars has been working for 40 years and earns $50,000 per year. If we calculate his annual salary for 30 years, it will be:

$50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000

Now, if we calculate his pension based on 5% of his total salary, it will be:

$1,500,000 x 5% = $75,000

So, Mars's annual pension after 30 years of service will be $75,000."
"Response:  The total cost of the streaming service for one month is $140. If the company reduces its price by 10% every year, then after one year, the price will be:

$140 x (1 - 0.1) = $126

So, after one year, the price of the streaming service will be $126 per month. Now, if we calculate the total amount that Elina has to pay for the entire year, it would be:

$126 x 12 = $1512

Therefore, Elina has to pay a total of $1512 for the entire year for the streaming service."
"Response:  We know that Sofiya traveled 100 miles in her car after refueling it with 4 gallons of gasoline. So, we can calculate how much distance she could cover with one gallon of gasoline.

Distance = Total Distance / Number of Gallons Used
= 100 miles / 4 gallons
= 25 miles per gallon

Now, we need to find out how many miles Sofiya could cover with one gallon of gasoline if she had filled up her tank with 12 gallons instead of 4 gallons.

Distance = Total Distance / Number of Gallons Used
= (Total Distance) x (Number of Gallons Used / 4)
= (100 miles) x (12 gallons / 4)
= 100 miles x 3
= 300 miles

Therefore, Sofiya could have covered 300 miles with one gallon of gasoline if she had filled up her tank with 12 gallons instead of 4 gallons."
Response:  We know that Jim has been watching TV for 3 hours and then he will go to bed at 10 PM. So, if we subtract 3 hours from 10 PM, we get 7 PM as the time when Jim will start watching TV. Therefore, Jim will watch TV for 4 hours (from 7 PM to 11 PM).
Response:  We know that there are three schools participating in the tournament, and each school has two teams with five players each. So, the total number of players from all three schools is 3 x 2 = 6 players per school. Since there is one coach for each team, the total number of people from all three schools is 6 x 3 = 18 people.
"Response:  We know that there are 175 high-quality rubies in total, and each of them has two smaller rubies attached to it. So, we need to find out how many small rubies are there in total.

We can start by finding out how many pairs of small rubies there are. Since each high-quality ruby has two small rubies attached to it, there will be twice as many pairs of small rubies as there are high-quality rubies. Therefore, the number of pairs of small rubies is 2 x 175 = 350.

Now, since each pair of small rubies consists of two small rubies, the total number of small rubies is 350 x 2 = 700.

So, there were 700 small rubies in total, along with 175 high-quality rubies."
"Response:  We know that there are 60 students and each teacher teaches 5 students. So, we can start by finding out how many teachers are required to teach all the students. To do this, we need to divide the total number of students (60) by the number of students each teacher teaches (5).

60 ÷ 5 =?

The result is:

60 ÷ 5 = 12

So, there would be 12 teachers required to teach all the students if each teacher teaches 5 students."
Response:  We know that Beili has $5 at the beginning of 8 weeks and spends $1 per week on a saptahik bhata (a weekly allowance). So after 8 weeks, she will have spent $8 on the bhata. If she has $100 left, then she must have had $92 left ($100 - $8) after spending $8 on the bhata. Therefore, Beili started with $92.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and 5 classes per day, so there will be 5 x 7 = 35 classes in a month. If each student pays $15 per class, then the total amount earned from all students in a month is 35 x $15 = $525.
Response:  We have to prepare 20 dishes for 10 guests. So we need to make 20/10 = 2 dishes per guest. Since there are two types of dishes, we need to make 2 x 2 = 4 dishes in total.
"Response:  We know that each broiler costs $3 and each chick costs $4. So if Tomi wants to buy 43 broilers and 23 chicks, he will have to spend:

$3 x 43 = $130 for broilers
$4 x 23 = $86 for chicks
Total cost = $130 + $86 = $216

So Tomi has spent $216 on buying 43 broilers and 23 chicks."
"Response:  We know that the cost of each phone is $150 and there are three phones in total. So, the total cost is:

$150 x 3 = $450

Now, we need to calculate the amount of profit made after selling all three phones. The profit percentage is given as 2%. To find the profit amount, we can use the formula:

Profit = (Cost x Profit Percentage) / 100

In this case, the cost is $450, and the profit percentage is 2%, so:

Profit = ($450 x 2%) / 100
= ($9 x 100) / 100
= $9

So, the total profit made from selling all three phones for $450 each would be $9. Now, let's calculate the price per month. We know that the total cost is $450, and we want to divide it into three equal parts for three months. So:

Price per month = Total Cost / Number of Months
= $450 / 3
= $150 per month

Therefore, if Shila wants to sell her three smartphones over three months, she should charge $150 per month for each phone to make a profit of $9 overall."
"Response:  We know that Arti bought 12 bottles of ghee, 9 bottles of peanut oil, and 17 bottles of vegetable oil at prices of $2.74, $1.87, and $2.12 per bottle respectively. So she spent a total amount of:

$2.74 x 12 = $33.08 + $1.87 x 9 = $16.83 + $2.12 x 17 = $35.94

Therefore, Arti will have to pay a total of $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.94 = $85.85 for all the items she purchased."
"Response:  We know that each floor of Balir Durge has 4 rooms, and the total area of all four floors is 16 burgh feet (16 x 4 = 64). Now we need to find out how much space one room takes up. Since there are three walls in each room, let's assume that two walls share a common boundary with the adjacent room. So, we can calculate the area of one room as follows:

Area of one room = Length of one wall + Length of another wall + Length of the third wall
= Total perimeter of the room / 2

Since each wall has a length of 8 burgh feet, the total perimeter of the room is:

Total perimeter = 3 x 8 = 24 burgh feet

Now, divide the total area of all four floors (64) by the area of one room (24):

64 / 24 = 2

So, one room takes up an area of 24 burgh feet."
Response:  We know that Sisiliya will give 1 cup of milk to her calf every day for the first 180 days. Then she will increase the amount to 2 cups per day. So, in total, Sisiliya will give 180 x 1 = 180 cups of milk to her calf in the first year. If there are 110 calves in the herd and each calf consumes 1 cup of milk per day, then the total number of cups of milk consumed by all the calves in one year is 180 x 110 = 19800 cups.
"Response:  We know that Remy and David have $400 each in their savings accounts. They want to invest this money together so they can earn more interest. 
Firstly, we need to calculate how much interest they will earn individually if they keep their money in their respective savings accounts for one year at an annual interest rate of 5%.
For Remy, the calculation is:
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $400 x 5% x 1
= $20
So Remy will earn $20 in interest after one year.
For David, the calculation is:
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $400 x 5% x 1
= $20
So David will also earn $20 in interest after one year.
Now, let's assume they pool their funds together and invest them in a joint account with an annual interest rate of 5%. How much interest will they earn collectively? To find out, we need to add up the individual interests they would have earned separately. So the total interest they will earn together is:
Total Interest = Remy's Interest + David's Interest
= $20 + $20
= $40
Therefore, if Remy and David pool their funds together and invest them in a joint account with an annual interest rate of 5%, they will earn a total interest of $40 after one year."
Response:  We know that each full pack of pens costs $1 and there are 3 such packs in the offer, so the total cost of full packs is $3. Now, we need to find out how many reams of paper can be bought with the remaining amount of money after buying the full packs. Since each ream costs $2.50, we can buy 18 reams with the remaining amount of $2.50 x 18 = $45. So, the total cost of all the items will be $3 + $45 = $48.
Response:  We know that John gave $100 to Groupon as payment for his new customer referral program. As per the terms of the program, Groupon offered him 30% discount on his next purchase. So, we need to calculate how much discount John received on his next purchase using the amount he paid ($100) and the percentage discount (30%). To do this, we can use the formula: Discount = Amount x Percentage / 100. In this case, Discount = $100 x 30/100 = $30. Therefore, John received a discount of $30 on his next purchase.
"Response:  We know that two women can fill up 24 liters of water in 1 hour and 6 men can fill up 6 liters of water in 1 hour. So we need to find out how much time it will take for one man to fill up 6 liters of water.

We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so if 2 women can fill up 24 liters of water in 1 hour, then each woman can fill up 24/2 = 12 liters per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much time it will take for one man to fill up 6 liters of water. We know that 12 liters / 6 liters = 2 hours.

So, one man will take 2 hours to fill up 6 liters of water. Therefore, the total amount of water filled up by all the men in 2 hours is 6 x 2 = 12 liters."
"Response:  We know that Charlie has 10 sticks and he gave 9 sticks to Bonk as gifts. So, Charlie has 10 - 9 = 1 stick left with him. Now, we need to find out how many more sticks will be available for grinding at the card shop. To do this, we need to add up all the sticks that are available for grinding.

Let's start by adding up the number of sticks that Bonk received from Charlie:

9 + 9 = 18

Now, let's add up all the other sticks that are available for grinding:

18 + 23 = 41

So, there will be 41 sticks available for grinding at the card shop."
"Response:  We know that the weight of grass is 125 pounds and the weight of Alex's four goons is 2 pounds less than half of the weight of the grass. So we can write an equation based on this information:

Weight of Alex's four goons = (125 - 2) pounds
= 123 pounds

Now we need to find out how much the total weight of Alex and his four goons is. To do this, we add the weight of Alex's four goons to their own weight:

Total weight of Alex and his four goons = Weight of Alex's four goons + Alex's own weight
= 123 + 80
= 203 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of Alex and his four goons is 203 pounds."
"Response:  We know that each golap has 8 kartas (cards) and there are 3 such golaps in total. So, we can calculate the total number of cards as follows:

Total number of cards = 3 x 8 = 24

Therefore, the maximum number of cards that have been cut is 24."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 players in the football team and they have won 8 matches out of 10 matches played so far. So, we can say that the number of matches they have lost is 2 (10 - 8 = 2). Now, let's calculate their winning percentage. To do this, we need to divide the number of wins by the total number of matches played. In this case, it would be:

Winning Percentage = (Number of Wins / Total Number of Matches) x 100
= (8 / 10) x 100
= 80%
Therefore, the football team has a winning percentage of 80%."
"Response:  We know that Taro has $34$ weeks of work experience and he worked for three companies - XYZ, ABC, and DEF. He spent $18$ weeks at XYZ, $6$ weeks at ABC, and $9$ weeks at DEF. So, we can calculate his total work experience as follows:

$$\text{Total Work Experience} = \text{Work Experience at XYZ} + \text{Work Experience at ABC} + \text{Work Experience at DEF}$$

Substituting the values, we get:

$$\text{Total Work Experience} = 18 + 6 + 9 = 33$$

So, Taro has $33$ weeks of total work experience."
"Response:  We know that the total number of days in the month is 30. The first day of the month was Tuesday (T), and the second day was Wednesday (W). So far so good! Now we need to find out how many times each letter appears in the word ""GREGORY"". To do this, we can use the fact that each letter appears once in its own name. For example, G appears only once in ""Gregory"", R twice, E three times, and so on. Using this information, let's count up the number of times each letter appears in the word ""GREGORY"": G (1), R (2), E (3), G (1), O (2), R (2), Y (2). Add them all up and you get 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 9. Therefore, there are nine letters in the word ""GREGORY""."
"Response:  We know that the company pays its employees an annual salary of $600 and has a policy to provide a 10% raise every year for those who have been with the company for more than five years. If Silvia has worked at the company for eight years, how much will her annual salary be after three more years?

Step 1: Calculate the current annual salary of Silvia. Since she has worked at the company for eight years, she is eligible for a 10% raise. So, her current annual salary can be calculated as follows:

Current Annual Salary = $600 x (1 + 0.10) ^ 8
= $600 x 1.10^8
= $600 x 1.10^8
= $729.44

Step 2: Calculate the future annual salary of Silvia after three more years. As she has already worked for eight years, she will continue to receive the same 10% raise for the next three years. Therefore, her future annual salary can be calculated as follows:

Future Annual Salary = Current Annual Salary x (1 + 0.10) ^ 3
= $729.44 x 1.10^3
= $729.44 x 1.331
= $963.32

Therefore, Silvia's annual salary after three more years will be $963.32."
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 copies of her book for $88,000. So, if we divide $88,000 by 10, we get the price per copy as follows:

$88,000 ÷ 10 = $8,800 per copy

Now, we need to find out how many copies Harland sold. Since Harland sold 88,000 - 10 = 87,990 copies less than Marilyn, we can calculate the number of copies Harland sold as follows:

87,990 - 10 = 87,980 copies

Therefore, Harland sold 87,980 copies of his book at $8,800 each, resulting in total revenue of:

87,980 x $8,800 = $763,440"
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all gifts. We know that there are 75 gifts in total and each gift costs $2. So, the total cost is:

Total Cost = Number of Gifts x Price per Gift
= 75 x $2
= $150

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Christina needs to pay for the party. We know that she has invited 16 friends and each friend will receive one-quarter of the total number of gifts. So, the number of gifts each friend will receive is:

Number of Gifts per Friend = Total Number of Gifts / Number of Friends
= 75 / 16
= 4

Therefore, the amount of money Christina needs to pay for the party is:

Amount = Total Cost x Number of Gifts per Friend
= $150 x 4
= $600"
"Response:  We know that each packet of chips contains 10 alu (potato) puffs and weighs 40 grams. So if we want to calculate how many packets of chips Pikniker will need for 20 people, we can start by dividing 20 by 10 (since there are 10 puffs in each packet). This gives us:

20 / 10 = 2

So Pikniker will need 2 x 40 = 80 grams of potato puffs for 20 people. Since each packet weighs 40 grams, Pikniker will need 80/40 = 2 packets of chips for 20 people."
"Response:  We know that there are three types of pots in Marx's house - big, medium and small. The big pot can hold 8 liters of water, the medium pot can hold 6 liters of water, and the small pot can hold 4 liters of water. Now we need to find out how many pots of each type Marx has based on the information given in the problem statement. From the problem statement, we know that Marx has twice as many small pots as he has medium pots. So, if Marx has x medium pots, he will have 2x small pots. Since the total number of pots is 3, we can write an equation:

x + 2x = 3... (1)

Solving for x, we get:

3x = 9... (2)

Now, we know that the total amount of water that Marx can store in all his pots is 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 liters. So, we can set up another equation:

8 + 6 + 4 = 18... (3)

Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get:

8 + 6 + 4 = 18

Simplifying, we get:

18 = 3x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6

So, Marx has 6 medium pots and 12 small pots in total."
Response:  We know that James is 10 years old and he is younger than Jack by 1 year. So, Jack must be 11 years old now (10 + 1 = 11). Now we know that Amy is older than Jack by 5 years, so she must be 16 years old now (11 + 5 = 16). Finally, we know that Cori is younger than Amy by 2 years, so she must be 14 years old now (16 - 2 = 14). Therefore, the ages of the four siblings are: James (10), Jack (11), Amy (16), and Cori (14).
"Response:  We know that Jerryald has been eating 400 ml of hard gelatin for 38 seconds and Li has been eating 400 ml of soft gelatin for 40 seconds. Now we need to find out how much time it will take for Jerryald to eat 400 ml of soft gelatin at the same rate as Li.

First, let's calculate the rate at which Li is eating soft gelatin:

Rate = Amount / Time
= 400 ml / 40 sec
= 10 ml/sec

Now, let's calculate the time it would take Jerryald to eat 400 ml of soft gelatin at the same rate as Li:

Time = Amount / Rate
= 400 ml / 10 ml/sec
= 40 sec

Therefore, Jerryald would take 40 seconds to eat 400 ml of soft gelatin if he were to eat at the same rate as Li."
Response:  We know that there are 60 cups of milk and each cup contains 2 liters of milk. So, we have a total of 60 x 2 = 120 liters of milk. Now, if we divide this amount of milk into two parts, one part will be 60/2 = 30 liters. Therefore, there are 30 liters of milk in each part.
Response:  We know that there are 200 students in total and 2/5 of them are boys. So, we can find out how many boys there are by multiplying 200 by 2/5, which is equal to 40 (2 x 200 / 5). Now, we need to find out how many girls there are. To do this, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students, which gives us 200 - 40 = 160. Therefore, there are 160 girls in the class.
"Response:  We know that Harry played for 9 hours and his friend James played for 2/3 of that time. So, we can start by finding out how many hours James played.

We know that 2/3 of 9 is equal to 6. Therefore, James played for 6 hours. Now, we need to find out how much longer Harry played than James.

Since Harry played for 9 hours and James played for 6 hours, Harry played for an additional 3 hours (9 - 6 = 3). So, Harry played for a total of 3 + 6 = 9 hours."
Response:  We know that there are 16 ounces in a pound and 32 ounces in a quart. So if Freda made 32 ounces of tomato sauce using 16 ounces of tomatoes, she must have used 16/32 = 1/2 or half a pint of tomatoes.
"Response:  We know that there were 30 cars at the beginning of the motorway, and after 15 minutes, 20 cars had passed through the toll gate. So, the number of cars left on the motorway is:

30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 cars left on the motorway after 15 minutes."
"Response:  We know that Meri has 18 new charcoal stoves and she wants to distribute them among her friends and family members. She already has 40 old charcoal stoves in her store. So, if we subtract the number of old stoves from the total number of stoves, we get:

18 (new stoves) - 40 (old stoves) = 22

Therefore, Meri will have 22 charcoal stoves left after distributing the new ones among her friends and family members."
"Response:  We know that the total amount of money spent by all four friends is $20 \times 20 = 400$.
We also know that the first friend spent $20$ times as much as the second friend, so the second friend spent $\frac{20}{4} = 5$ dollars less than the first friend.
The third friend spent $10$ dollars more than the second friend, so the third friend spent $\frac{10}{5} = 2$ dollars more than the second friend.
Finally, we know that the fourth friend spent $60$ dollars, and since there are $4$ friends in total, each friend spent $\frac{60}{4} = 15$ dollars.
So, the total amount of money spent by each friend is $5 + 2 + 15 = 22$ dollars."
"Response:  We know that Solok has studied for 15 days and has covered 4 topics from science textbooks, 20 pages from social studies textbooks, 7 topics from history textbooks, and 8 topics from Bengali textbooks. If he spends another 4 days studying at the same rate, how many more pages will he cover in each subject?

Let's start with science textbooks. He has already covered 4 topics, so if he spends another 4 days, he will cover 4 x 4 = 16 more topics. Since each topic takes 20 pages on average, he will cover 16 x 20 = 320 more pages in science textbooks.

Next, let's look at social studies textbooks. He has already covered 20 pages, so if he spends another 4 days, he will cover 20 x 4 = 80 more pages.

For history textbooks, he has already covered 7 topics, so if he spends another 4 days, he will cover 7 x 4 = 28 more topics. Since each topic takes 10 pages on average, he will cover 28 x 10 = 280 more pages in history textbooks.

Finally, for Bengali textbooks, he has already covered 8 topics, so if he spends another 4 days, he will cover 8 x 4 = 32 more topics. Since each topic takes 12 pages on average, he will cover 32 x 12 = 384 more pages in Bengali textbooks.

In total, Solok will cover 320 + 80 + 280 + 384 = 984 more pages if he spends another 4 days studying at the same rate."
Response:  We know that John drinks 3 glasses of water per day and he wants to reduce his water intake gradually over the next month. So, in one week, he will drink 3 x 7 = 21 glasses of water. Now, let's calculate how many glasses of water John will drink in one month. One month has 4 weeks, so: 21 x 4 = 84 glasses of water. Therefore, John will drink 84 glasses of water in one month.
Response:  We know that the distance between the two points (A and B) is 42 miles. The speed of the boat is given as 3 miles per hour. So we can calculate the time taken to travel from point A to point B as follows: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 42 miles / 3 miles/hour Time = 14 hours Now, we need to find out how much time it will take for the water to rise 3 miles if the sea level rises at a rate of 1 mile every 10 minutes. To do this, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate Time = 3 miles / 1 mile/10 minutes Time = 30 minutes Therefore, it will take 30 minutes for the water to rise 3 miles if the sea level rises at a rate of 1 mile every 10 minutes.
"Response:  We know that Papi has 1000 rupees and he wants to buy a board worth 300 rupees. So after buying the board, how much money will be left with him?

We can calculate this as follows:

1000 - 300 =?

The answer is 700 rupees. Therefore, Papi will have 700 rupees left with him after buying the board."
"Response:  We know that Amir has 5 cups of rice and each cup can hold 3 eggs. So, we can calculate how many eggs Amir has in total as follows:

5 cups x 3 eggs/cup = 15 eggs

Therefore, Amir has 15 eggs in total."
"Response:  We know that each box has 5 inches of width and 6 inches of height. So, to find out the total area of all three boxes, we need to multiply the number of boxes with their individual areas.

Total Area = Number of Boxes x Area per Box
= 3 x (5 x 6)
= 3 x 30
= 90 square inches

Therefore, the total area of all three boxes is 90 square inches."
"Response:  We know that Frankie watched TV for 7 hours in total over four days (Wednesday to Saturday). On Wednesday and Monday, he watched for 1 hour each day, and on Thursday and Friday, he watched for 2 hours each day. So, if we add up all the time he spent watching TV, we get:

1 hour x 4 days = 4 hours
2 hours x 2 days = 4 hours
Total time watched TV = 4 + 4 = 8 hours

Therefore, if Frankie watched TV for 7 hours in total over four days, he watched for 8 hours per day."
Response:  We know that Henry has 15 packets of cookies and each packet contains 10 cookies. So, he has a total of 15 x 10 = 150 cookies. Now, we are told that he gave away 5 packets of cookies to his friends, which means he has 15 - 5 = 10 packets of cookies left. Each packet contains 10 cookies, so he has 10 x 10 = 100 cookies left. Therefore, Henry gave away 50 cookies (150 - 100) last year.
Response:  We know that the cost of one gallon of gas is $3.00 and the company gives a cashback of $0.20 for every gallon purchased. So if someone buys 10 gallons of gas, they will get a total cashback of $2.00 (10 x $0.20). Therefore, the net price they pay for 10 gallons of gas would be $3.00 - $2.00 = $1.00.
"Response:  We know that Marsell has 3 roles and 14 role-ups. If we subtract the number of role-ups from the total number of roles, we get:

3 (roles) - 14 (role-ups) = 11

So, Marsell had 11 unfulfilled roles."
"Response:  We know that Julie poured water into the bottle at a rate of 1 liter per 10 seconds. So, in 1 minute (60 seconds), she poured 6 liters of water into the bottle. Now, we need to find out how much water was left in the bottle after 2 hours and 30 minutes.

To do this, we can use the formula:

Water left = Initial amount + Amount added over time

In this case, the initial amount is 6 liters (since Julie started pouring water into the bottle at t=0). The amount added over time is:

Amount added = Rate x Time
= 1 liter/10 seconds x 60 minutes
= 6 liters

So, the total amount of water in the bottle after 2 hours and 30 minutes is:

Total amount = Initial amount + Amount added over time
= 6 liters + 6 liters
= 12 liters

Therefore, there were 12 liters of water left in the bottle after 2 hours and 30 minutes."
Response:  We know that each teacher has to prepare 2 lesson plans per day and there are 4 teachers in total. So, in total, they have to prepare 8 lesson plans per day (2 x 4). Now, let's consider how many days they can use the same set of materials before they need to change them. Since they can only reuse the materials for 3 times (according to the problem), we need to find out how many days they can use the materials without repeating any of the lessons. To do this, we will divide the number of lesson plans by the number of unique lessons they can create using the materials. In other words, we will divide 8 by 3. The result is 2.67 days or approximately 3 days. Therefore, the teachers can use the same set of materials for 3 days before they need to change them.
"Response:  We know that Raihan has two full bags of rice and each bag contains 5 kg of rice. So, in total, he has 2 x 5 = 10 kg of rice. Now, if he sells 5 bags of rice at a price of Tk 30 per kg, how much money will he get?

Money received = Total weight of rice x Price per kg
= 10 kg x Tk 30/kg
= Tk 300

So, Raihan will receive Tk 300 for selling 5 bags of rice."
"Response:  We know that Jamal has 1800 photos in his phone and he wants to send them all to Brittany's phone. Now, we need to find out how many photos Brittany will receive if she can only hold 50 at a time. So, let's divide 1800 by 50:

1800 ÷ 50 = 36

So, Brittany will receive 36 batches of photos from Jamal's phone. Each batch will contain 50 photos."
"Response:  We know that Tina has 20 boards of each size (2x4x10, 4x4x10) and she wants to sell them at a profit of 50%. So, first, we need to find out how much money she spent on buying these boards.

We know that the cost price of one board is $10, so the total cost price of all the boards would be:

20 x $10 = $200

Now, let's calculate the selling price of each board. Since Tina wants to make a profit of 50%, she will increase the cost price by half of it:

$200 / 2 = $100

So, the selling price of each board will be $100. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Tina will get from selling all the boards:

20 x $100 = $2,000

Therefore, Tina will get $2,000 from selling all the boards."
"Response:  We know that 1 kg of rice requires 7 liters of water for cooking. So, to calculate how much water is required for 120 portions of rice, we need to multiply 7 liters by 120. Therefore, the total amount of water required for 120 portions of rice is:

7 liters x 120 = 840 liters

So, to prepare 120 portions of rice, you will need 840 liters of water."
"Response:  We know that each of John's three children wants to buy two toys at $60 each. So we can start by calculating how much money they will spend in total.

Total amount spent = (Number of toys x Price per toy) for each child
= (2 x $60) x 3
= 6 x $60
= $360

So, John needs to pay $360 in total for his three children to buy two toys each."
Response:  We know that there are 10 containers in total and each container has 5 cars. So, the total number of cars is 10 x 5 = 50 cars. Now, we need to find out how many cars are left after selling 2 cars from each container. To do this, we can subtract 2 from each container's car count. So, for the first container, we have 5 - 2 = 3 cars left, for the second container, we have 5 - 2 = 3 cars left, and so on. In total, there will be 3 x 10 = 30 cars left after selling 2 cars from each container.
"Response:  We know that Adrian received 30% of the total amount as his share, and he spent 40% of that amount on something. So, first, we need to find out how much money Adrian had after spending 40% of it.

We can start with the fact that Adrian received $12,000 (30% of $40,000) as his share. If he spent 40% of this amount, then he spent:

$12,000 x 40% = $4800

So, Adrian had $12,000 - $4800 = $7200 left after spending 40% of his share. Now, we need to find out how much money Adrian would have had if he had not spent any money. To do this, we subtract the amount he spent from his original share:

$12,000 - $4800 = $7200

Therefore, Adrian would have had $7200 more if he had not spent any money. This means that Adrian had a total of:

$7200 + $40,000 = $47,200

If Adrian had not spent any money, he would have had $47,200. However, since he did spend some money, he actually had $7200 less than that amount."
Response:  We know that Michael uses two pads of paper for one week. So, if he uses 30 sheets of paper per pad, then in total, he will use 60 sheets of paper (2 x 30) per week. Now, we need to find out how many pages he will use per month. Since there are four weeks in a month, Michael will use 4 x 60 = 240 sheets of paper (4 x 60) per month.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 apples and 8 oranges in Mariset's basket. If we assume that each apple costs Tk. 10 and each orange costs Tk. 20, then the total cost of the fruits in Mariset's basket would be:

5 apples x Tk. 10 = Tk. 50
8 oranges x Tk. 20 = Tk. 160
Total cost = Tk. 50 + Tk. 160 = Tk. 210

So, the total value of the fruits in Mariset's basket is Tk. 210."
Response:  We know that Soma has worked for 8 hours on Saturday and 2 hours less each of the next two days, so he has worked for a total of 8 + (2 x 2) = 8 + 4 = 12 hours. Now, if he had worked for one more hour each day, he would have worked for a total of 12 + (3 x 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours Soma has worked in the week is 15.
"Response:  We know that Rozi can give 10 milk bottles per hour and then she gives 5 milk bottles per hour. So, if she works for 7 hours, we need to calculate how many milk bottles she will give in total.

Total number of milk bottles = 10 x 1 hour + 5 x 6 hours (since she works for 6 hours after giving 10 bottles)
= 10 + 30
= 40 milk bottles
Therefore, Rozi will give 40 milk bottles in total if she works for 7 hours."
"Response:  We know that Jenny has 60 chits in total and she has already won 30 chits. So, the number of chits left with her is:

60 - 30 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 chits left with Jenny."
"Response:  We know that Julie had 12 chambers in her package when she started selling them. She sold each chamber for Tk 500, so she made a total of Tk 6000 from each sale (12 x Tk 500). Now, let's see how many chambers she had to sell to reach her goal of Tk 1 lakh.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

Total Sales = Goal Amount

Substituting the values we know, we get:

6000 = 100000

Solving for the number of sales, we find that Julie needed to make:

6000 / 500 = 12 sales

So, Julie needed to sell 12 packages of chambers to reach her goal of Tk 1 lakh."
"Response:  We know that Dilan had 38 chickens and 6 fish. If he sold all his chickens at Tk. 500 each (as mentioned in the problem), then he would have earned:

38 x Tk. 500 = Tk. 19,000

Now, let's calculate how much money he made from selling the fish. If he sold each fish for Tk. 200, then he would have earned:

6 x Tk. 200 = Tk. 1,200

So, in total, Dilan would have earned:

Tk. 19,000 + Tk. 1,200 = Tk. 20,200

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Tk. 20,200"
"Response:  We know that Amir has 50 friends and Lili has 20 friends. So, if we combine their friendships, how many friends will they have in total?

Step 1: Add the number of friends Amir and Lili have separately.
50 (Amir) + 20 (Lili) =?

Step 2: Find out how many more friends Amir has than Lili.
50 - 20 =?

Step 3: Subtract the difference from Step 2 from the sum in Step 1 to find the total number of friends they have together.
50 + 20 - 30 =?

Therefore, the total number of friends Amir and Lili have together is:
50 + 20 - 30 = 40."
Response:  We know that the cost of one kilogram of tomatoes is $3, and the cost of one kilogram of marich (a type of leafy green vegetable) is $15. We also know that the cost of one kilogram of komalalebu (a type of dry fish) is $5 less than the cost of one kilogram of tomatoes. So, if we buy 4 kilograms of tomatoes, 20 kilograms of marich, and 10 kilograms of komalalebu, how much will it cost in total? First, let's calculate the cost of the tomatoes: 4 x $3 = $12 Now, let's calculate the cost of the marich: 20 x $15 = $300 Finally, let's calculate the cost of the komalalebu: 10 x ($3 - $5) = $10 Since the cost of the komalalebu is $5 less than the cost of the tomatoes, we can subtract $5 from the cost of the tomatoes to get the cost of the komalalebu: $12 - $5 = $7 Therefore, the total cost of buying 4 kilograms of tomatoes, 20 kilograms of marich, and 10 kilograms of komalalebu would be: $12 + $300 + $7 = $319
"Response:  We know that there are 500 patients in the hospital and each patient spends $200 per day. So, the total daily expenditure of the hospital is:

500 patients x $200 per patient = $100,000 per day

Now, we need to calculate how much money the hospital earns from each doctor's visit. Since each doctor visits 24 patients per hour, and there are 8 hours in a day (considering 8-hour shifts), the number of patients visited by one doctor per day is:

24 patients/hr x 8 hrs/day = 192 patients per day

So, the total amount earned by the hospital from each doctor's visit is:

192 patients x $150 per patient = $31,200 per day

Therefore, the total daily income of the hospital is:

$100,000 (daily expenditure) - $31,200 (doctor's fees) = $68,800 per day

To find out how much the hospital earns in a year, we can multiply the daily income by 365 days (assuming a full year of operation):

$68,800 per day x 365 days = $24,712,000 per year

So, the hospital earns approximately $24.7 million per year."
"Response:  We know that there are 60 workers in total and 10 of them will be selected for the training program. So, we can start by finding out how many times 10 goes into 60.

10 x 6 = 60 (6 times 10 is equal to 60)

So, there are 6 groups of 10 workers each who will be selected for the training program. Now, let's find out how many workers are left after selecting the first group of 10.

60 - 10 = 50 (50 workers are left after selecting the first group of 10)

We can repeat this process to find out how many workers are left after selecting each subsequent group of 10.

50 - 10 = 40 (40 workers are left after selecting the second group of 10)
40 - 10 = 30 (30 workers are left after selecting the third group of 10)
30 - 10 = 20 (20 workers are left after selecting the fourth group of 10)
20 - 10 = 10 (10 workers are left after selecting the fifth group of 10)

Therefore, there are 10 workers left after selecting all five groups of 10. So, the answer is 10."
"Response:  We know that Joseph had $500 in May and his expenses were $60 less than before. So, we can calculate his expenses in June as follows:

May Expenses = $500 - $60 = $440

Now, let's find out how much he spent in total for both months:

Total Expenses = May Expenses + June Expenses
= $440 + (June Expenses)

We don't have information about June expenses directly, but we do know that it is $60 less than May expenses. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

June Expenses = May Expenses - $60
= $440 - $60
= $380

Now, we can calculate the total expenses for both months:

Total Expenses = $440 + $380
= $820

So, Joseph's total expenses for both May and June were $820."
Response:  We know that Pam and Fred had 8 rolls of costly carpet each, which they wanted to sell at Tk. 100 per roll. So, together they had 8 x 8 = 64 rolls of carpet for sale. Now, if we assume that each customer buys only one roll of carpet, then they can serve 64 customers in total (64 / 1 = 64). But since each customer needs two tickets, they will actually serve 32 customers (64 / 2 = 32). Therefore, the number of tickets they need is 32 x 2 = 64 tickets.
"Response:  We know that Somwar started walking at 8 AM and walked for 6 hours. So, he finished his walk at 2 PM (8 + 6 = 2). Now, we need to find out how far he walked from 2 PM to 5 PM (when Budhwar started). Since he walked for 4 hours after lunch, let's calculate it as follows:

Distance traveled between 2 PM and 5 PM = Distance traveled per hour x Number of hours
= 41 miles/hour x 4 hours
= 164 miles

Therefore, Somwar walked 164 miles from 2 PM to 5 PM."
"Response:  We know that Tom has four cars and each car costs $15 per day. So, if he rents out all his cars for one year (365 days), how much revenue will he generate?

First, let's calculate the total number of days in one year:

365 days x 4 cars = 1460 days

Now, we can multiply the daily rent by the total number of days to get the annual revenue:

15 dollars/day x 1460 days = $21,900

So, Tom would earn $21,900 in one year if he rented out all his cars at $15 per day."
Response:  We know that there are 3 friends of Brian (Babli, Bapi, and Bubly) who have less than 5 videos each in their galleries. If Brian has 20 videos in his gallery but only 5 of them are from Babli, Bapi, and Bubly, then we can conclude that the total number of videos in the galleries of these three friends is 5 x 4 = 20. So, there are 20 videos in the combined galleries of Babli, Bapi, and Bubly.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorn companies in the world and two of them have female founders. So, we can say that approximately (27 x 0.08) = 2.16% of all unicorn companies have female founders.
"Response:  We know that Roori will give two sandwiches for $7.50 and two chips for $1.50. So, if we buy one of each, the total cost would be:

$7.50 (for sandwiches) + $1.50 (for chips) = $9.00

Now, if we add the delivery charge of $1.00, the total cost becomes:

$9.00 + $1.00 = $10.00

However, since there is a 20% discount on all orders over $5.00, the final amount Roori needs to collect from us is:

$10.00 x 80% = $8.00

So, Roori's delivery order value is $8.00."
"Response:  We know that Mark took 8 hours to complete the first exam and 6 hours to complete the second exam. So, in total, he spent 8 + 6 = 14 hours taking both exams. Now, we need to find out how many questions he answered correctly in each exam. Since there were 75 questions in the first exam and 100 questions in the second exam, we can calculate as follows:

For the first exam:
Mark scored (75 x 8) / 14 = 30 correct answers

For the second exam:
Mark scored (100 x 6) / 14 = 40 correct answers

Therefore, Mark scored a total of 30 + 40 = 70 correct answers out of 275 questions."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 excess balls in total and 12 blue balls. So, we can start by subtracting the number of blue balls from the total number of balls to find out how many green balls there are:

22 - 12 =?

Do you want to try solving this yourself or would you like me to give you the answer?"
"Response:  We know that there are 20 cars in total, and among them, 12 are automatic, 4 are manual, and the rest are semi-automatic or automatic. So we can start by finding out how many semi-automatic or automatic cars there are.

We know that there are 4 semi-automatic cars and 8 automatic cars (since 12 is greater than 4). Therefore, the total number of semi-automatic or automatic cars is:

4 + 8 = 12

Now, let's find out how many manual cars there are. There are 4 manual cars.

So, the total number of cars is:

12 (semi-automatic or automatic) + 4 (manual) = 16

Therefore, there are 16 cars in total, including both semi-automatic or automatic and manual ones."
Response:  We know that there are 700 children and each child has two toys. So, in total, there will be 2 x 700 = 1400 toys. Now, we need to find out how many of these toys belong to the carpenter's son and how many belong to the queen's daughter. We know that the carpenter's son has half of the number of toys that the queen's daughter has. So, if the queen's daughter has x toys, then the carpenter's son will have half of x, which is 0.5x toys. Therefore, the number of toys belonging to the carpenter's son is 0.5x. To find out what x is, we can set up the equation: 0.5x + 0.5x = 1400. Simplifying this equation, we get: x + 0.5x = 1400. Combining like terms, we get: 1.5x = 1400. Dividing both sides by 1.5, we get: x = 933.33. So, the queen's daughter has 933.33 toys, and the carpenter's son has half of that, which is 466.67 toys.
"Response:  We know that Jordan spends $10 per hour playing video games and he plays for 2 hours a day. So, his daily expenditure on video games is:

$10/hour x 2 hours = $20 per day

Now, if he works for 7 days in a week (assuming he doesn't work on Sundays), his weekly earnings from part-time job would be:

$20/day x 7 days = $140 per week

So, if Jordan wants to save $100 per month, his monthly earnings from the part-time job should be at least:

$140/week x 4 weeks/month = $560 per month"
"Response:  We know that there are 5 items in total - rice, dal, dim, light balloon, and cap. The cost of each item is given as follows:

* Rice: 3 dollars per pound
* Dal: 2 dollars per pound
* Dim: 3 dollars per piece
* Light Balloon: 3 dollars per piece
* Cap: 4 dollars per unit

We also know that 10% discount will be applied to all these items. So, we need to calculate the original price of each item before applying the discount.

Let's start with rice. Original price of 1 pound of rice = 3 x 1 = 3 dollars

Next, let's consider dal. Original price of 1 pound of dal = 2 x 1 = 2 dollars

Now, let's move on to dim. Original price of 1 piece of dim = 3 x 1 = 3 dollars

For light balloon, original price of 1 piece = 3 x 1 = 3 dollars

Finally, for cap, original price of 1 unit = 4 x 1 = 4 dollars

Total original price of all items = 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 16 dollars

After applying 10% discount, new price of all items = (16 / 0.9) x 0.9 = 17.78 dollars

So, the total cost of all items after applying 10% discount would be approximately 17.78 dollars."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of each product. The price of each bottle is $2 and the price of each packet of chips is $5. So, the total cost of one set (one bottle and one packet of chips) will be:

$2 + $5 = $7

Now, let's calculate the monthly sales of Kim's products. As per the information given in the problem statement, Kim has three regular customers who buy her products every week. Each customer buys one set of products (i.e., one bottle and one packet of chips) every week, so the total number of sets sold per month will be:

3 x 4 weeks/month = 12 sets/month

The total revenue generated from these sales will be:

12 sets/month x $7/set = $84/month

So, Kim's monthly sales are $84. Now, let's calculate the profit margin. We know that the cost price of each set is $7, so the profit margin will be:

Profit Margin = ($84 - $7) / $7 = 16%

Finally, we can calculate the approximate daily sales by dividing the monthly sales by the number of days in a month:

Approximate Daily Sales = $84/month / 30 days/month ≈ $2.80/day

Therefore, the approximate daily sales of Kim's homemade snacks and drinks are around $2.80 per day."
Response:  We know that there are 10 hectares of land and each hectare has 100 anars (a type of fruit). So, in total, there are 10 x 100 = 1000 anars per hectare. Since the farmer wants to harvest the anars every three months, he will harvest 1000 / 3 = 333 anars per month.
Response:  We know that Jony has 500 units of stock in his box and he sold 3 guns for every 4 blocks of stock. So, if Jony had 500 units of stock, then he would have sold 3 x 500 = 1500 guns.
Response:  We know that Debra has 30 maunds of paddy to sell and she sells it in two batches of 6 hours each. In the first batch, she sold 15 maunds at Rs 100 per maund, which is Rs 1500. In the second batch, she sold 15 maunds at Rs 120 per maund, which is Rs 1800. So, the total amount she received for both batches is Rs 1500 + Rs 1800 = Rs 3300. Now, we need to find out how much she sold in each batch. Since she sold 15 maunds in the first batch, there are 15 - 6 = 9 maunds left with her after the first batch. She then sells these 9 maunds in the second batch at Rs 120 per maund, so she receives Rs 9 x 120 = Rs 1080. Therefore, the total amount she received for both batches is Rs 3300 + Rs 1080 = Rs 4380.
Response:  We know that Brittany and her mother went to the cashier together. The total cost of their purchases was $12 + $10 = $22. If Brittany paid $8 for her own purchase, then she must have given $14 ($22 - $8) to her mother as change.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and James has three times as many friends as Charlie. So, if Charlie has 12 friends, James will have 3 x 12 = 36 friends on Facebook.
"Response:  We know that Stevie and Tim are both traveling at different speeds from their respective schools. Stevie is traveling at a speed of 3 miles per hour, while Tim is traveling at a speed of 2 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take for them to reach each other, we need to calculate their time of arrival using their individual speeds.

First, let's calculate Stevie's time of arrival:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 3 miles / 3 miles/hour
= 1 hour

Now, let's calculate Tim's time of arrival:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 2 miles / 2 miles/hour
= 1 hour

Since both Stevie and Tim are traveling at constant speeds, they will cover equal distances in equal times. Therefore, they will meet each other after one hour.

To determine how far apart they will be when they meet, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

For Stevie:

Distance = 3 miles/hour x 1 hour
= 3 miles

For Tim:

Distance = 2 miles/hour x 1 hour
= 2 miles

Therefore, when they meet, Stevie will be 3 miles away from Tim."
"Response:  We know that there were five people in total who went to buy biscuits from the market. Three of them bought biscuits from the same store, and one person bought biscuits from another store. So, we can start by finding out how many biscuits each group of three people bought.

Let x be the number of biscuits bought by each group of three people. Since they all bought different amounts, we can write an equation for the total amount spent by each group:

x + 3x + 4x = 25 (since there are four groups of three people)

Simplifying the equation:

7x = 25

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 3

So, each group of three people bought 3 packets of biscuits. Now, let's find out how much the remaining person spent. Since they bought biscuits from another store, we don't have information about the price per packet. But we do know that they spent ৳10 more than the other four people combined.

Total amount spent by the other four people = 3x + 3(3)x = 3x + 9x = 12x = 25

Total amount spent by the remaining person = ৳10 more than the above amount
= ৳10 + 25 = ৳35

Therefore, the remaining person spent ৳35 on biscuits."
"Response:  If Carl sells each pack of cookies for $0.10 and he has 10 packs in total, then his total earnings from selling all the packs would be:

$0.10 x 10 = $1.00

Now, if Carl spends $10 on buying more ingredients to make more cookies, then he will have to sell the additional cookies at the same price of $0.10 per pack to break even. So, the number of packets he needs to sell to break even is:

$10 / $0.10 = 100 packets

Therefore, Carl needs to sell 100 packets of cookies to break even."
"Response:  There were three friends - Dev, Farhan, and Rony. They had to share the cost of their lunch equally among themselves. So they divided the total cost into three parts. Each part represents one-third of the total cost.

Let's assume the total cost of their lunch was Tk 100. Then each friend paid Tk 33 (one-third of Tk 100) as their share.

Now, let's come to the freebies. Dev gave two free meals to his friends. So, he paid only for one meal (Tk 33). His two friends got two free meals, so they didn't pay anything. In total, Dev spent Tk 33, while his two friends spent nothing.

So, the total amount spent by all three friends was Tk 33 + Tk 33 + Tk 0 = Tk 69."
"Response:  We know that there are three days of classes in a week - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Each day has two periods of 45 minutes each, so there are six periods in total per week. Now, we need to calculate how many hours Kimoko spends in class per week.

Therefore, the number of hours Kimoko spends in class per week is:

6 periods x 45 minutes/period = 6 x 45 = 270 minutes/week

Since there are 16 semesters in a year, we can multiply the number of minutes per week by 16 to get the total number of minutes spent in class per year:

270 minutes/week x 16 semesters = 4320 minutes/year

Now, let's convert this to hours:

4320 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 72 hours/year

So, Kimoko spends approximately 72 hours in class per year."
"Response:  We know that each roll has 4 inches of fabric and we need to calculate how many feet of fabric will be required for all the rolls together. So, let's start with calculating the total number of inches of fabric required for all the rolls.

Total number of inches = Number of rolls x Length of each roll (inches)
= 300 x 4
= 1200 inches

Now, we need to convert these inches into feet. There are 12 inches in one foot, so:

Total number of feet = Total number of inches / 12
= 1200 / 12
= 100 feet

Therefore, if Bill makes all the beaks according to his usual method, he will require approximately 100 feet of fabric."
"Response:  We know that there are 3 types of fruits - grapes, bananas, and oranges. The number of each type of fruit is given as follows:

Grapes: 200 per month
Bananas: 400 per month
Oranges: 100 per month

We want to find out how many kilograms of each fruit will be required for 2 months. So, we need to multiply the number of fruits by 2.

Grapes: 200 x 2 = 400 kg
Bananas: 400 x 2 = 800 kg
Oranges: 100 x 2 = 200 kg

Therefore, the total weight of fruits required for 2 months is:
400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 kg"
"Response:  We know that Blick has 15 bars of chocolate and Kelie has 40 bars of chocolate. They both want to share the chocolates equally among themselves. So, if they divide it equally, each one will get 15 + 40 = 55 bars of chocolate. But wait! There is a catch here. Kelie wants to keep all the chocolates for herself, so she only gives Blick 34 bars of chocolate. Now, let's calculate how much more chocolate Kelie has than Blick. To do this, we need to subtract the number of bars of chocolate that Blick got from the total number of bars of chocolate that Kelie has. In other words, we can write an equation as follows:

Kelie's excess chocolate = Total number of bars of chocolate - Number of bars of chocolate given to Blick
= 40 - 34
= 6
So, Kelie has 6 more bars of chocolate than Blick."
"Response:  We know that Rafi bought four items - three notebooks and one rim bond paper. The prices of these items are given as follows:

* Three notebooks at $4 each = $12
* One rim bond paper at $20

Total cost = $12 + $20 = $32

So, Rafi spent $32 in total."
Response:  We know that there are 11 birds in the tree and Fin has eaten 6 of them. So, there are 11 - 6 = 5 birds left in the tree. Now, Fin has to eat 2 more birds to finish all the birds in the tree. Therefore, the total number of birds Fin can eat is 5 + 2 = 7.
"Response:  We know that on Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water and on Wednesday, it had 7 more feet of water than on Monday. So, if we let X be the number of feet of water in the tank on Wednesday, then we can set up the equation:

X = 17 + 7

Simplifying the equation, we get:

X = 24

So, there were 24 feet of water in the tank on Wednesday."
"Response:  We know that Anakin and Lakshmi have 10 tarama each, 6 sinthu ghoti each, and 3 clounmach each. Now we need to find out how many maz they can make in total.

Firstly, let's calculate the number of tarama they have:
10 x 2 = 20

Now, let's calculate the number of sinthu ghoti they have:
6 x 2 = 12

And finally, let's calculate the number of clounmach they have:
3 x 2 = 6

Total number of maz they have:
20 + 12 + 6 = 48

Therefore, Anakin and Lakshmi together have 48 maz."
"Response:  We know that the cost price of one unit is $20 and there is a discount of 20%. So, we can calculate the selling price as follows:
Selling Price = Cost Price x (1 - Discount Percentage)
= $20 x (1 - 0.20)
= $20 x 0.80
= $16
So, after 36 months, the total amount earned from selling 100 units at $16 each will be:
Total Amount Earned = Number of Units x Selling Price
= 100 x $16
= $1,600"
Response:  We know that there are five red cars and three action figures in total. The price of one action figure is $5, so the total cost of all three action figures would be $5 x 3 = $15. Now we need to add the cost of the red cars and the action figures together to find the total cost of everything. Since each red car costs $4, the total cost of all five red cars would be $4 x 5 = $20. Therefore, the total cost of everything is $15 + $20 = $35.
Response:  If Jack can do the job in 3 hours for $35 per hour, then he will charge $105 (3 x $35) for the entire task. As the freelancer has done the work in 2 hours and charged $90, there is a difference of $15 ($105 - $90). So, the client will have to pay an additional $15 to the freelancer.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of the computer and its accessories. We know that the cost of the computer is €1090, and the cost of the screen, keyboard, mouse, scanner, and printer is €157 + €74 + €102 = €333. So, the total cost of the computer and its accessories is €1090 + €333 = €1423. Now, let's calculate the amount of money Elvira needs for her birthday party. She wants to spend €1500 on the party, so she needs €1500 - €1423 = €77 more to cover all the expenses. Therefore, the answer is €77.
Response:  We know that Sandra has 9 dimers and each dime is worth $10. So, she has a total of $90. Now, if she spends $30 on three Spanish flan bananas, she will be left with $60. If she wants to buy 15 Spanish flan bananas, she will need to spend $30 x 15 = $450. Therefore, the amount of change Sandra will receive for buying 15 Spanish flan bananas is $450 - $60 = $390.
Response:  We know that Seetha is 2 years older than Brooke. So, if Brooke is 28 years old now, Seetha will be 28 + 2 = 30 years old.
"Response:  We know that Jimir has $2 and he spends $8 on something. So, how much money does he have left? To find out, we can subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount of money: $2 - $8 =? 
Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that Pancho has 20 milk cans in one day and he sells each can for Tk. 10. So, his total earning from selling milk cans is:

20 x Tk. 10 = Tk. 200

Now, we are asked to find out how much milk he will sell in one week if he sells 10 milk cans per day. To do this, we need to multiply his daily earning by the number of days in a week:

Tk. 200 x 7 (days) = Tk. 1400

So, Pancho will sell Tk. 1400 worth of milk in one week if he sells 10 milk cans per day."
"Response:  We know that the cost of tuition is $25 and the jacket costs three times as much as the tuition. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

Jacket price = 3 x Tuition price

We also know that the total cost of both items is equal to the price of the panther. So, we can set up another equation:

Total cost = Jacket price + Tuition price

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (the jacket price and the total cost). Can you use these equations to find out the price of the jacket and the total cost?"
Response:  We know that Jack has 8 pairs of socks and each pair contains 2 socks. So, he has a total of 8 x 2 = 16 socks. Additionally, we know that he has 6 pairs of pants and each pair contains 2 pants. So, he has a total of 6 x 2 = 12 pants. Finally, we know that he has 10 pairs of underwear and each pair contains 3 underwears. So, he has a total of 10 x 3 = 30 underwears. Therefore, Jack has a total of 16 + 12 + 30 = 58 items in his bag.
"Response:  We know that Salli has been working at Granny's Redder for three years and her salary is Tk. 15000 per month. If she works for eight more years, her total earnings from Granny's Redder will be:

Tk. 15000 x 96 (months) = Tk. 1440000

Now, if we add the amount she earned from Sylvi's Thrift Store for four years, her total earnings would be:

Tk. 1440000 + Tk. 720000 (from Sylvi's Thrift Store) = Tk. 2160000

Therefore, the total amount of money Salli will have earned in 13 years is Tk. 2160000."
"Response:  Jessica has three sources of income - student loan, credit card, and bonus from her employer. We need to calculate how much she will have after paying off each source of income. 
1. Student Loan: At $300 per month, Jessica will have paid $3600 in one year (12 x $300). 
2. Credit Card: At $200 per month, Jessica will have paid $2400 in one year (12 x $200). 
3. Bonus: If Jessica gets a $500 bonus once a year, she will have received $500 that year. Total amount paid = $3600 + $2400 + $500 = $6500. 
Now let's calculate how much Jessica will have saved if she saves 50% of her income. 
Savings = Income x 0.5 = $6500 x 0.5 = $3250."
"Response:  We know that Billi will have to spend 60 minutes in total for both activities (1 hour x 2 activities). Since each activity takes half of the time spent, we can say that Billi will spend 30 minutes on each activity. Now, let's calculate how much time Billi will take to complete each activity. For cooking, there are 5 steps, and each step takes approximately 3 minutes (based on our previous assumption), so the total time required for cooking is:

3 minutes/step x 5 steps = 15 minutes

For cleaning, there are also 5 steps, and each step takes approximately 3 minutes as well, so the total time required for cleaning is:

3 minutes/step x 5 steps = 15 minutes

Therefore, Billi will spend a total of 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes on both activities."
"Response:  We know that Carlos and Juyan sell lemonade for $3 per glass and $2 per cup, respectively. They also have to pay $0.50 per glass for the cups they use. If they sell 20 glasses of lemonade each, they will earn:

Carlos: 20 x $3 = $60
Juyan: 20 x $2 = $40

They both need to spend $10 on cups (20 x $0.50), so their total earnings are:

Carlos: $60 - $10 = $50
Juyan: $40 - $10 = $30

If they together make $25 in profit, then the amount of money they made from selling lemonade is:

$25 / ($50 + $30) = $25 / $80 = 0.3125 or 31.25%

So, if they sold 20 glasses of lemonade each, they would have made 31.25% profit."
"Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total, and among them, 80 are Japanese, 60 are Chinese, and the rest (100) are from other countries. So, if we subtract the number of Japanese and Chinese people from the total number, we get:  

240 - 80 = 160 (remaining after subtracting Japanese)  
160 - 60 = 100 (remaining after subtracting Chinese)  
Therefore, there were 100 people from other countries."
"Response:  We know that Jebin spends $200 per month on his wife and children, and he has to pay $700 per month for his house rent. So, in total, he spends $900 per month. Now, if he earns $6000 per month, then his savings would be:

$$ \text{Savings} = \text{Income} - \text{Expenses} $$

$$ = 6000 - 900 $$

$$ = 5100 $$

So, Jebin will have $5100 as his savings at the end of each month, assuming he doesn't spend anything else other than what is mentioned in the problem statement."
Response:  We know that there are 12 apples in Ranir's basket and 4 apples in Monik's basket. If we add 4 apples from Boyer's basket to Monik's basket, then there will be 4 + 4 = 8 apples in Monik's basket. So, the total number of apples in Monik's basket is 8.
"Response:  We know that Tina spent $10 in total and she spent 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. So we can calculate her spending per hour as follows:

Total Spent = $10
Hours Worked (Week 1) = 5 hours
Hourly Wage (Week 1) = Total Spent / Hours Worked = $10 / 5 = $2/hour

Hours Worked (Week 2) = 8 hours
Hourly Wage (Week 2) = Total Spent / Hours Worked = $10 / 8 = $1.25/hour

Now, let's find out how much Tina spent in each week:

Week 1 Spending = Hourly Wage x Hours Worked = $2/hour x 5 hours = $10
Week 2 Spending = Hourly Wage x Hours Worked = $1.25/hour x 8 hours = $10

So, Tina spent $10 in both weeks, for a total of $20."
"Response:  We know that there are two classes with 3/4 and 1/4 of the total students in each class, respectively. So, if we can find out how many students are in each class, we can calculate the number of students who passed the examination.
Let x be the number of students in the larger class (i.e., the class with 3/4 of the students). Since 3/4 of the students are in this class, we can write:
x = 3/4(80) = 60
Now, let y be the number of students in the smaller class (i.e., the class with 1/4 of the students). Since 1/4 of the students are in this class, we can write:
y = 1/4(80) = 20
So, there are 60 students in the larger class and 20 students in the smaller class. Now, we need to find out how many students passed the examination.
We know that 80% of the students passed the examination. Therefore, we can calculate the number of passed students as follows:
Passed students = 0.8 x 60 + 0.8 x 20
= 48 + 16
Therefore, 64 students passed the examination."
"Response:  We know that Sandra has 200 bottles of red wine and she wants to sell them at $5 each. So, if we calculate the total amount she will receive from selling all the bottles, it would be:

200 bottles x $5 per bottle = $1,000

Now, let's assume that only 5% of the bottles are defective (i.e., 10 bottles). If Sandra sells these defective bottles at $5 each, she will receive:

10 bottles x $5 per bottle = $50

So, the total amount Sandra will receive from selling all the bottles minus the amount she will receive from selling the defective bottles is:

$1,000 - $50 = $950

Therefore, if 5% of the bottles are defective, Sandra will receive $950 from selling all the bottles."
"Response:  We know that Jinn's age is twice that of Mark's current age. So if Mark is currently x years old, then Jinn is 2x years old. Now we are given that Mark will be 5 years older than Jinn after 5 years. Therefore, in 5 years, Mark will become x + 5 years old and Jinn will become 2x + 5 years old. After 5 years, the difference between their ages will be:

Jinn's age - Mark's age = (2x + 5) - (x + 5) = 2x - x = x + 5

So, Jinn's age will be 5 years more than Mark's age after 5 years. Since Jinn's current age is twice that of Mark's current age, we can say that Jinn's current age is 2x years old. Therefore, Jinn's age after 5 years will be:

Jinn's age after 5 years = 2x + 5 = 30

Since Jinn's age after 5 years is 30 years old, we can find out Mark's current age as follows:

Mark's current age = Jinn's current age / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, Mark is currently 15 years old, and Jinn is twice that age, or 30 years old."
Response:  We know that each player in the first team will score an average of 55 seconds and their total score is 400 meters. So, if there are x players in the first team, then the total time they will take to cover 400 meters will be 55x seconds. Now, we need to find out how many seconds the second team will take to cover 400 meters. According to the problem statement, the second team will start running after every 3 seconds of the first team's run. So, for every 3 seconds of the first team, the second team will cover 1 second. Therefore, the total time the second team will take to cover 400 meters will be (400/3) = 133.33 seconds. Since the second team starts running after every 3 seconds of the first team, they will have covered only 133.33 - 3 = 130.33 meters when the first team covers 400 meters. Hence, the difference between the distance covered by the two teams will be 400 - 130.33 = 269.67 meters.
"Response:  We know that Jere has 3 apples and gives 2 to his friend. So, Jere has 3 - 2 = 1 apple left. Now, we need to find out how many times Jere can give 1 apple to his friend.

Let X be the number of times Jere can give 1 apple to his friend. Then, we have:

X × 1 = 1 (since Jere has only 1 apple left)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 1

So, Jere can give 1 apple to his friend once. Therefore, the total number of apples Jere will have given to his friend is:

3 (apples Jere had initially) + 1 (apple Jere gave to his friend) = 4

Therefore, the correct answer is: 4"
Response:  We know that Jenna and her mother have 20 apples in total. If we divide this number equally among themselves, they will each get 10 apples. So, Jenna has 10 apples with her.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 hammers and each hammer has 6 nails. So, in total, there are 10 x 6 = 60 nails. Now, we need to find out how many nails are left after using 160 nails for renovation. To do this, we can subtract 160 from 60, which gives us:

60 - 160 = -100

So, there will be no nails left after using 160 nails for renovation!"
Response:  We know that Mandi has $100 and she spends 2% of her monthly salary on entertainment. So, if she earns $X per month, she will spend $X \* 0.02 = $0.2X on entertainment. Now, we need to find out how much money Mandi will have after 3 months if she continues to spend $0.2X on entertainment. After 3 months, Mandi will have spent $0.2X \* 3 = $0.6X on entertainment. So, the amount left with Mandi after 3 months is $100 - $0.6X. To find out how much money Mandi will have after 3 months, we need to solve for X in the equation $100 - $0.6X = $0.6X. Simplifying the equation, we get $100 - $0.6X = $0.6X. Solving for X, we get X = $166.67. Therefore, Mandi will have $166.67 after 3 months if she continues to spend $0.2X on entertainment.
"Response:  We know that the cost price of each item is $20 and the selling price is $30. So, if the businessman sold x items, his total revenue would be 30x dollars. However, he spent $2 per unit on transportation, so his total expenses would be 2x dollars. Therefore, his profit (revenue - expenses) would be 30x - 2x = 28x dollars. Now we need to find out how many items the businessman sold to earn $400 in profit. We can set up an equation based on this information:  

28x = 400... (1)

Now, let's solve for x. To do this, we can divide both sides of equation (1) by 28:  

x = 400/28... (2)

Simplifying, we get:  

x = 14... (3)

So, the businessman sold 14 units of goods to earn a profit of $400."
Response:  Firstly, they spent $20.25 on three tickets. That means each ticket cost $6.75 (20.25 ÷ 3). Now, they got two rides for free, which means they saved $4.50 per ride (6.75 x 2 = 13.50 - 4.50). So, if they had to pay for each ride separately, it would have cost them $13.50 in total (13.50 x 2 = 27). Therefore, their actual savings are $27 - $20.25 = $6.75.
"Response:  We know that Tinu has 3 hours to spend and he wants to spend 2 minutes on each picnic spot. So, if we divide 3 hours into equal parts of 2 minutes each, we get:

3 hours = 6 x 2 minutes = 12 minutes

Therefore, Tinu can visit 12 different picnic spots in 3 hours."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 heads in every batch of 3.5 pounds of pound cake mix. So if we want to calculate how much powdered sugar is needed for one batch of pound cake, we need to divide the weight of the batch by the number of heads in each batch. In this case, we can do:

3.5 pounds / 10 heads = 0.35 pounds per head

So, if you have 10 heads of pound cake, you will need 10 x 0.35 pounds = 3.5 pounds of powdered sugar."
"Response:  We know that Tom planted 10 trees per year for 10 years and felled 2 trees every year. So he has planted a total of 10 x 10 = 100 trees in 10 years.

Now, we know that after 10 years, 30% of the trees have died, so the number of dead trees is 30% of 100, which is 30 trees.

So, the number of alive trees is 100 - 30 = 70 trees."
Response:  We know that there were initially 18 plastic bottles in the bag. On Sunday morning, they added 3 more empty plastic bottles to the bag, making it a total of 21 plastic bottles. Then, on Monday morning, they removed 3 empty plastic bottles from the bag, leaving them with 18 plastic bottles again. So, the number of plastic bottles that were left in the bag after all the activities was 18.
"Response:  We know that there are five different types of cream available for $20, and each type costs $2. So, if we want to find out how much profit the seller will make from selling one unit of each type of cream, we need to calculate the cost price of each unit first.

Cost Price = Selling Price / Number of Units

For Type-1 Cream:
Cost Price = $20 / 5 units = $4 per unit

For Type-2 Cream:
Cost Price = $20 / 5 units = $4 per unit

For Type-3 Cream:
Cost Price = $20 / 5 units = $4 per unit

For Type-4 Cream:
Cost Price = $20 / 5 units = $4 per unit

For Type-5 Cream:
Cost Price = $20 / 5 units = $4 per unit

Now, let's calculate the total profit made by the seller from selling one unit of each type of cream:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

For Type-1 Cream:
Profit = $2 x 4 = $8

For Type-2 Cream:
Profit = $2 x 4 = $8

For Type-3 Cream:
Profit = $2 x 4 = $8

For Type-4 Cream:
Profit = $2 x 4 = $8

For Type-5 Cream:
Profit = $2 x 4 = $8

So, the total profit made by the seller from selling one unit of each type of cream is $8. Therefore, the answer is $8."
Response:  We know that each pen costs $1.20 and each eraser costs $0.30. To find out how much 8 pens and 8 erasers would cost in total, we need to multiply the number of pens and erasers by their respective prices. So, for 8 pens, we multiply $1.20 by 8 to get $9.60. For 8 erasers, we multiply $0.30 by 8 to get $2.40. Therefore, the total cost of 8 pens and 8 erasers is $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00.
"Response:  We know that there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant needs 2 pounds of rice. So, we can calculate how much rice is needed in total as follows:

Total amount of rice needed = Number of restaurants x Amount of rice per restaurant
= 40 x 2
= 80 pounds

Therefore, 80 pounds of rice will be used in total among all the 40 restaurants."
"Response:  We know that there are 23786 people living in Sodha village and among them, 8417 men and 9092 women are literate. So, we can calculate the number of illiterate people as follows: Total population - Literate population = Illiterate population.

So, the number of illiterate people in Sodha village is:
23786 - (8417 + 9092) = 23786 - 17509 = 6277.
Therefore, there are 6277 illiterate people in Sodha village."
Response:  We know that Elena had 20 cards in her hand at first. In the second month, she lost half of them (10). So, after the second month, she had 20 - 10 = 10 cards left. In the third month, she lost another half of what was left (5), so now she has 10 - 5 = 5 cards left. Therefore, there are 5 pokemon cards left in Elena's hand.
"Response:  We know that Mark earns $1000 per month and spends $500 on food. So, he has $500 left after paying for food. Now, we need to find out how many sentences he can write in one week. To do this, we divide the amount of money he has left ($500) by the price of each sentence ($5). This gives us:

$500 ÷ $5 = 100 sentences

So, Mark can write 100 sentences in one week."
Response:  We know that Baldu has to fill up 5 buckets of water every day and each bucket contains 3 liters of water. So, he needs to fill up 5 x 3 = 15 liters of water every day. If he fills up 5 liters less than usual one day, then he will have to fill up only 15 - 5 = 10 liters of water that day.
"Response:  We know that John has earned $5000 in one year and his monthly salary is $416.70 (i.e., $5000 / 12). Now, we need to find out how much he spent on the first day of the year.

First Day Spending = Monthly Salary x Number of Days Worked
= $416.70 x 365 days (assuming John worked all 365 days)
= $158,935

So, John spent $158,935 on the first day of the year."
Response:  We know that JOSI has 10 cows and each cow gives 5 liters of milk per day. So in one day, Josi gets 10 x 5 = 50 liters of milk from her cows. Now, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be produced from this amount of milk. Since each liter of milk produces 2 bottles of wine (as given in the problem), we have: 50 liters x 2 bottles/liter = 100 bottles of wine. Therefore, in one year, Josi can produce 100 bottles x 365 days = 36,500 bottles of wine.
Response:  Carl has eaten 8 chickens in total over the past week. He has consumed 2 chickens per day on average during that period. So, he must have eaten 4 chickens each day for three days straight to reach his total of 8 chickens.
"Response:  We know that there are 22 green balls and 10 blue balls in total. Now, we have to find out how many balls of each color are left after removing 6 yellow balls from the bag.

Firstly, let's calculate the number of yellow balls removed from the bag:

6 x 3 = 18 (since each yellow ball has 3 spots)

Now, let's subtract the number of yellow balls removed from the total number of balls:

22 + 10 - 18 =?

Simplify the calculation:

32 - 18 = 14

Therefore, there are 14 green balls left in the bag after removing 6 yellow balls. Similarly, we can calculate the number of blue balls left:

10 - 6 = 4

So, there are 4 blue balls left in the bag after removing 6 yellow balls."
"Response:  We know that Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, and 100 in her previous four semesters, respectively. To calculate her overall score, we need to add up all these scores. So, her total score will be:

89 + 71 + 92 + 100 = 452

Now, let's move on to the final exam. If Brinley scores 93 in the final exam, what would be her overall score out of 500?

452 + 93 = 545

Therefore, Brinley's overall score out of 500 would be 545 if she scores 93 in the final exam."
Response:  We know that Michael biked for 5 hours each day and covered 25 kilometers per hour. So, he traveled 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers daily. Since he spent three days in total, his overall distance traveled is 125 km/day x 3 days = 375 kilometers.
Response:  We know that Jo has 25 chocolate bars and each bar weighs 40 grams. So, in total, Jo has 25 x 40 = 1000 grams of chocolate. Now, if we divide this amount by 80 (the number of candies), we get: 1000 / 80 = 12.5 grams per candy. Therefore, the weight of one candy is approximately 12.5 grams.
"Response:  We know that Ros bought 3 packets of chips on Monday and 4 packets on Wednesday. On Tuesday, she did not buy any chips. So, in total, Ros bought 3 + 4 = 7 packets of chips.

Now, we need to find out how many chips were left after each day. On Monday, she had 7 - 3 = 4 packets of chips left. On Wednesday, she had 7 - 4 = 3 packets of chips left. And on Tuesday, she did not buy any chips, so there was no change in her chip stock.

Therefore, the number of chips Ros had left at the end of each day was:

Monday: 4 packets
Wednesday: 3 packets
Tuesday: 0 packets (no change)"
Response:  We know that the cost price of each platter is $6000 and we want to find out how many platters we need to sell to earn $1200. So, first, let's calculate the selling price per platter. To do this, we will subtract the desired profit ($1200) from the cost price per platter ($6000): Selling Price per Platter = Cost Price per Platter - Desired Profit Selling Price per Platter = $6000 - $1200 Selling Price per Platter = $4800 Now, we can calculate how many platters we need to sell to earn $1200: Number of Platters to be Sold = Total Amount Earned / Selling Price per Platter Number of Platters to be Sold = $1200 / $4800 Number of Platters to be Sold = 25 Therefore, you would need to sell 25 platters at $4800 each to earn $1200.
"Response:  We know that Sara wants to buy a jacket and two pairs of shoes. The price of each item is as follows:
Jacket - $30
Shoes (pair) - $20
Total cost = Jacket + Shoes (pair) x 2
= $30 + $20 x 2
= $30 + $40
= $70

Now, we need to calculate how much money Sara will have to spend if she buys the items at a discount of 40% off the original price. To do this, we first find out what the discounted price would be for each item:
Discounted price of jacket = Original price x Discount percentage / 100
= $30 x 40 / 100
= $12
Discounted price of shoes (pair) = Original price x Discount percentage / 100
= $20 x 40 / 100
= $8

So, the total discounted price of all three items would be:
Total discounted price = Discounted price of jacket + Discounted price of shoes (pair) x 2
= $12 + ($8 x 2)
= $12 + $16
= $28

Therefore, Sara will have to spend $28 to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes at a discount of 40% off the original price."
"Response:  We know that there are 3 lal murigi (red chickens) and 5 sadha murigi (white chickens) in Jerey's farm. Each lal murigi gives 3 eggs per day, and each sadha murigi gives 5 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs produced by all the chickens in Jerey's farm is:

3 x 3 = 9 (from the 3 red chickens) + 5 x 5 = 25 (from the 5 white chickens) = 34 eggs per day.

Now, we need to find out how many lal murigi are left in Jerey's farm if he has 42 eggs in his fridge. To do this, we can subtract the number of eggs produced by all the chickens from the total number of eggs Jerey has in his fridge:

42 - 34 = 8

So, there are 8 lal murigi left in Jerey's farm."
"Response:  We know that the garage has a length of 1.5 miles and a width of 6 miles. If we want to cover it with a fence, we need to calculate how many feet of fencing material we will need. To do this, we first need to convert the measurements from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so:

Length (in feet) = 1.5 miles x 5280 feet/mile = 7920 feet
Width (in feet) = 6 miles x 5280 feet/mile = 31200 feet

Now we can calculate the total area of the garage in square feet:

Area = Length x Width = 7920 x 31200 = 2491200 square feet

Finally, if we want to enclose the garage with a fence that is 3 miles long, we can calculate how much of the fencing material we will need as follows:

Fencing material needed = Area of garage / Length of fence = 2491200 square feet / 3 miles = 830400 feet

So, we will need approximately 830400 feet of fencing material to enclose the garage with a fence that is 3 miles long."
"Response:  We know that in the first day, 100 customers visited the store and each customer bought an average of $x$ items. So, the total revenue of the store on the first day is:

$$\text{Revenue} = \numberofcustomers \times \averagepurchaseamount = 100 \times x$$

We also know that on the second day, there were 50% more customers than the previous day, so the number of customers on the second day is:

$$\numberofcustomers_2 = 100 + (100/2) = 150$$

Since the average purchase amount remains the same, the total revenue of the store on the second day is:

$$\text{Revenue} = \numberofcustomers_2 \times \averagepurchaseamount = 150 \times x$$

Now, we want to find out how many customers would have visited the store on the third day if the total number of customers for the first two days was 500. To do this, we can set up the following equation:

$$\numberofcustomers_3 + \numberofcustomers_2 = 500$$

Solving for $\numberofcustomers_3$, we get:

$$\numberofcustomers_3 = 500 - \numberofcustomers_2 = 500 - 150 = 350$$

So, if the total number of customers for the first two days was 500, then 350 customers would have visited the store on the third day."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 4 gallons of water in the larger jug and 2 gallons of water in the smaller jug. Then, 2 gallons of water from the larger jug were poured into the smaller jug. So, after pouring, how much water is left in the larger jug?

Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x represent the number of gallons of water left in the larger jug after pouring. Since 2 gallons were poured from the larger jug into the smaller jug, we can write an equation based on this information:

x - 2 = 4 (since there were originally 4 gallons in the larger jug)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6 (There are 6 gallons of water left in the larger jug after pouring.)

Now, let's find out how much water is in the smaller jug. We know that 2 gallons were poured from the larger jug into the smaller jug, so the amount of water in the smaller jug is:

2 + 2 = 4 (Since there were originally 2 gallons in the smaller jug, and 2 more gallons were added when the larger jug was emptied into it.)

So, there are 4 gallons of water in the smaller jug."
Response:  We know that the cost of one unit of the product is $32.00 and the part-time worker's wage per hour is $8.00. So, if we want to calculate how many hours the worker needs to work to earn $320.00, we can use the following formula: Total Hours Worked = Total Cost / Wage Per Hour. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total Hours Worked = $320.00 / $8.00 = 40 hours. Therefore, the worker needs to work for 40 hours to earn $320.00.
"Response:  We know that Jenith has invested $2000 and earned $165 per month for 12 months, which is equal to $2000 x 12 = $24,000. Now we need to find out how much profit she will make after deducting 10% of her total earnings as commission. To do this, we can calculate 10% of $24,000, which is:

$24,000 x 0.10 = $2,400

So, Jenith will have to pay $2,400 as commission, leaving her with:

$24,000 - $2,400 = $21,600

Therefore, after deducting the commission, Jenith will be left with $21,600."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 balls in the bag and each ball has 7 holes. So, if we multiply 4 (the number of balls) by 7 (the number of holes per ball), we get:

4 x 7 = 28

So, there are 28 holes in total in the bag of 4 balls."
"Response:  We know that Adrian is 21 years old now and Jack is three years younger than Adrian. So, we can write an equation based on their ages:

Adrian's age = 21
Jack's age = Adrian's age - 3

Now, we need to find out how many years ago Jack was born compared to Adrian. To do this, we subtract Adrian's current age from Jack's age:

Years between Jack's birth and Adrian's birth = Jack's age - Adrian's age
= (Adrian's age - 3) - Adrian's age
= (21 - 3) - 21
= 18 - 21
= -3

So, Jack was born 3 years before Adrian. Therefore, if Adrian is currently 21 years old, then Jack is 18 years old."
Response:  We know that Jojo has 251 pets in total and he gave away 68 pets to his friends. So, he has 251 - 68 = 183 pets left with him. Now, we are told that Brianne gave him 10 more pets, so Jojo now has 183 + 10 = 193 pets. Finally, we are told that Braxton took away 17 pets from Jojo, leaving him with 193 - 17 = 176 pets. Therefore, Jojo has 176 pets left with him after all the transactions.
"Response:  We know that Carmen can speak for 10 minutes and Sudoku for 5 minutes. So, if we add both times together, we get:

10 + 5 = 15 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spoke for 15 minutes in total, while Sudoku spoke for 5 minutes."
"Response:  We know that initially there were 120 liters of water in the tank and Silin drained 90 liters of water from it. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:

120 - 90 = 30 liters

Now, we need to find out how much water will be left in the tank after the additional 40 liters are added. To do this, we can add the amount of water left in the tank (30 liters) to the additional amount of water (40 liters):

30 + 40 = 70 liters

Therefore, after adding the additional 40 liters of water, there will be 70 liters of water left in the tank."
"Response:  We know that Andy has 90 pills and he takes 40 of them to reduce his fever. So, how many pills does Andy have left after taking 40 pills? To find out, we need to subtract the number of pills taken (40) from the total number of pills (90). Here's the calculation:

90 - 40 =?

The result is:

90 - 40 = 50

So, Andy has 50 pills left after taking 40 pills to reduce his fever."
"Response:  We know that the company spent $15,000 for advertising in one year and then spent another $15,000 for advertising in the next year. So, if we add these two amounts together, we get:

$15,000 + $15,000 = $30,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company spent on advertising over two years is $30,000."
Response:  We know that Carlos and Benji spent $30 and $18 respectively on their lunches. If they had eaten at the same restaurant, they would have paid a total of $48 ($30 + $18). However, since they ate at different restaurants, they each paid half of what they would have paid if they had eaten together. Therefore, Carlos paid $20 (half of $48) for his lunch, and Benji paid $9 (half of $48) for his lunch. So, the total amount they spent on lunch is $29 ($20 + $9).
"Response: 

1. From New York to Chicago, it takes 6 hours and 30 minutes by car (according to Google Maps).
2. If Andrew starts driving from New York at 9 am, he will reach Chicago at 3:30 pm (6 hours and 30 minutes later).
3. Since Andrew wants to rest for 6 days in Chicago, he will start driving back to New York after 6 days (on the 7th day).
4. To calculate how many days Andrew needs to stay in Chicago, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends traveling from the total number of days he wants to rest. In this case, we subtract 6 hours and 30 minutes from 6 days, which gives us:

6 days - 6 hours and 30 minutes = 5 days and 30 minutes

Therefore, Andrew needs to stay in Chicago for 5 days and 30 minutes before starting his drive back to New York."
"Response:  We know that James has 30 fair cards and 20 grass cards in his deck. If he loses 8 water cards and gains 14 grass cards, then we can calculate how many watermelon cards are left in his deck as follows:

First, let's find out how many watermelon cards James had initially:

30 (fair cards) + 20 (grass cards) = 50 total cards

Now, if he loses 8 water cards, we need to subtract 8 from the total number of cards:

50 - 8 = 42

So, James had 42 watermelon cards initially.

Next, we know that he gained 14 grass cards:

14 (gained grass cards) + 42 (initial watermelon cards) =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost price of each item in the bill.

$6.50 (cost price) x 2 (number of items) = $13.00

Now let's calculate the total cost of all the items without any discount.

$13.00 + $2.00 (additional amount for chips and drinks) = $15.00

Next, we will subtract the discount amount from the total cost.

$15.00 - $3.00 (discount) = $12.00

Finally, we can calculate the final amount that Tinu needs to pay after applying the discount.

$12.00 + $2.00 (gift card value) = $14.00

So, Tinu needs to pay $14.00 after applying the discount."
Response:  We know that Kalindi can swim at a rate of 360 degrees per minute. So in one hour (which is equal to 60 minutes), she can swim 360 x 60 = 21,600 degrees. Now we need to find out how many times she can swim around her mother in one hour. To do this, we need to divide the distance between Kalindi and her mother by the number of degrees she can swim in one hour. The distance between them is 4 meters (since each meter is equal to 100 centimeters). Therefore, we have: 4 meters / 21,600 degrees = 0.00185 kilometers/degree. So Kalindi can swim around her mother 21,600 / 0.00185 = approximately 11,794 times in one hour.
"Response:  We know that Ashal has sold 120 units of his product at a price of Tk 100 per unit. After two months, he found out that 30% of the products were defective and had to be returned. So, if 30% of the products were defective, then the number of defective products can be calculated as follows:

Defective products = Total products x Defective rate
= 120 x 0.3
= 36

Now, we need to find out how much money Ashal lost due to the defective products. Since he received Tk 100 per unit for each sale, the amount of money he lost can be calculated as follows:

Loss = Number of defective products x Price per unit
= 36 x Tk 100
= Tk 3,600

So, after two months, Ashal lost Tk 3,600 due to the defective products."
"Response:  We know that Mark has purchased 12 cars for his company at a cost of $20,000 each. So, the total cost of all the cars is:

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Mark has paid 10% commission to the dealer, which is:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

So, the net amount Mark has spent on all the cars is:

$240,000 - $24,000 = $216,000

Therefore, Mark has spent $216,000 on all the cars."
Response:  We know that Somwar (Sunday) Robi and Kaili both have 20 units of rice each. On Monday, Kaili gave 5 units of rice to Robi as a gift. So, now Robi has 20 + 5 = 25 units of rice. Now, we need to find out how many units of rice Kaili has after giving 5 units to Robi. To do this, we can subtract the number of units given to Robi from Kaili's total units. So, Kaili has 20 - 5 = 15 units of rice left. Therefore, the answer is 15.
"Response:  We know that Daksha had 50 pots of rice and each pot contained an average of x liters of water. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

x = (50 x) / 10 (since there are 10 liters in a pot)

Now, we need to find out how much water Daksha had in total. To do this, we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

10x = 500 (since there are 50 pots)

So, Daksha had 500 liters of water in total."
"Response:  We know that there are 36 penguins in total and they have to divide themselves into groups of 12 each. So, we can start by dividing 36 by 12, which gives us:

36 ÷ 12 = 3

So, there will be 3 groups of 12 penguins each. Now, let's see how many penguins are left over after forming these groups. To do this, we can subtract the number of penguins in each group from the total number of penguins:

36 - (3 x 12) = 36 - 36 = 0

Therefore, all 36 penguins are accounted for, and none are left over!"
"Response: 

1. The number of tomatoes that Stevie can eat in one sitting is 6.
2. If he eats 3 tomatoes per day, then he will have eaten 3 x 6 = 18 tomatoes per week.
3. So, if he wants to eat 30 tomatoes in a week, he will need to eat an additional 30 - 18 = 12 tomatoes beyond his usual daily intake of 3 tomatoes.
4. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Stevie needs to buy is 12 + 18 = 30 tomatoes."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend will get 4 packets of chips. So, the total number of packets of chips to be distributed is:

20 friends x 4 packets per friend = 80 packets

Now, we need to find out how many bags of chips John can buy with $8. Since each bag contains 8 packets of chips, we can calculate as follows:

$8 / $1 per bag (assuming each bag costs $1) = 8 bags

So, John can buy 8 bags of chips with $8. Each bag contains 8 packets of chips, so John will have a total of:

8 bags x 8 packets per bag = 64 packets of chips

Therefore, John has 64 packets of chips in total."
"Response:  We know that Ram has 25 eggs and he wants to make new egg cartons using those eggs. He will use 1 egg to make each carton. So, how many cartons can he make with 25 eggs?

To find out, we need to divide 25 (the number of eggs) by 1 (the number of eggs needed for one carton).

25 ÷ 1 = 25

So, Ram can make 25 cartons with his 25 eggs!"
"Response:  We know that Jony had $20 and he spent $10 to buy something from Sathi. So, now he has $20 - $10 = $10 left with him. After one year, if he invests this money at an interest rate of x%, then he will have $10 x% more than the initial amount. Therefore, his total amount after one year will be:

$10 + (x% of $10) = $10 + x% of $10

Since we are given that the investment was for one year, we can set up the equation as follows:

$10 + x% of $10 = $10 + ($10 x 100%)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$10 + x% of $10 = $10 + $10 x 100%

$10 + x% of $10 = $10 + $1000%

$10 + x% of $10 = $1100

Now, we need to find out what is the value of x%. To do so, we can divide both sides of the equation by $10:

$1100 / $10 = $110

So, x% is equal to 11%. Therefore, Jony's total amount after one year is:

$10 + ($10 x 11%) = $10 + $110

= $110

Therefore, Jony's total amount after one year is $110."
"Response:  We know that Mary is 2 years older than Jessica and Jessica is 5 years younger than her mother. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Mary's age = Jessica's age + 2
Jessica's age = Mother's age - 5
Now we are given that Mary's age is 30 and Jessica's age is 20. We can substitute these values into the first equation to get:
30 = 20 + 2
So Mary is 2 years older than Jessica, which means Jessica is 20 + 2 = 22 years old.
Now we can substitute this value into the second equation to get:
22 = Mother's age - 5
So the mother's age is 22 + 5 = 27 years old."
"Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in the school and three doors (A, B, and C) through which they can exit. If 30% of the students use door A, then the number of students who use door A is 30% of 1000, or 300 students.  
Now, if we assume that 2/5 of the remaining students use door B, then the number of students who use door B is 2/5 x (1000 - 300), or 400 students. Finally, if we assume that the rest of the students use door C, then the number of students who use door C is 1000 - 300 - 400 = 300 students. 
So, the total number of students who use each door is:
Door A: 300 students
Door B: 400 students
Door C: 300 students"
Response:  We know that there are 6 candies in James' bag and 2 more bags of candy for each person. So if there are x people, then they will have 2x bags of candy. Each bag contains 54 candies, so the total number of candies for all the people is 2x \* 54 = 2x\*54. Now we need to find out what value of x gives us the desired result. To do this, let's divide both sides of the equation by 6 (the number of candies in one bag): 2x\*54 / 6 =? The result is x = 9. Therefore, there are 9 people.
"Response:  We know that Pandora has 5 boxes and Dali has 2 boxes. If they both put their boxes together, how many boxes will they have in total?

Pandora has 5 boxes, so if we add her boxes to Dali's 2 boxes, we get:

5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, if Pandora and Dali put their boxes together, they will have 7 boxes in total."
"Response: 

1. The total number of words in each paragraph is 5 x 7 = 35 words.
2. Each paragraph has two sentences, so there are 2 x 5 = 10 sentences in total.
3. Each sentence contains an average of 8-9 words (as mentioned in the problem), so the total number of words in each sentence is 8-9 words.
4. Therefore, the total time taken to read one paragraph is 10 sentences x 8-9 words per sentence = 80-90 seconds.
5. Since there are five paragraphs, the total time taken to read all five paragraphs is 5 x 80-90 seconds = 400-450 seconds or approximately 6-7 minutes."
"Response:  We know that Jasim has to make 1000 calls of 15 minutes each in a month (30 days). So, he will have to make 1000 x 15 = 15,000 minutes of calls in total. Now, we need to find out how many extra minutes he needs for other people's calls. As per the problem statement, he needs 300 minutes extra for this purpose. Therefore, the total number of minutes Jasim needs to make calls in a month is:

15,000 + 300 = 15,300 minutes."
Response:  We know that Ginjar gave 5 francs to Kail and took back 3 francs from him. So, if we subtract 3 from 5, we get 2. Now, we need to find out how many times Ginjar can give 2 francs to Kail so that he has 27 francs in total. To do this, we divide 27 by 2, which gives us 13. Therefore, Ginjar gave 13 times 2 francs to Kail, i.e., 26 francs in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 shamuks in one akoryiam and 32 shamuks in another akoryiam. So, if we have x shamuks in one akoryiam, then there will be 4x shamuks in total. Now, we need to find out how many of those shamuks belong to the second akoryiam. To do this, we can divide the total number of shamuks (4x) by the number of shamuks in the second akoryiam (32). This gives us:

4x / 32 =?

Can you solve for x?"
"Response: 

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of making the movie (in USD).
Total Cost = (6 hours x $250 per hour) + (4 hours x $250 per hour) + (5 hours x $250 per hour) = ($250 x 6) + ($250 x 4) + ($250 x 5) = $1,500 + $1,000 + $1,250 = $3,750

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of profit for the makeup artist based on the total cost.
Profit Percentage = (10% of $3,750) / $3,750 x 100 = ($375) / $3,750 x 100 = 10%

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money the makeup artist will receive as payment.
Payment Amount = Total Cost x Profit Percentage = $3,750 x 10% = $375

Therefore, the makeup artist will receive $375 as payment for their work in the movie."
"Response:  We know that Ismail spent $12 on his own birthday party and $43 on his mother's birthday party. He also spent $15 on gifts for his friends and family members, and $4 on incidental expenses. Finally, he spent $22 on decorations for the party. Therefore, the total amount of money that Ismail spent on his birthday party is:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

So, Ismail spent $96 on his birthday party."
Response:  We know that each pound of rice costs $1.50. So if Rashedunness bought 50 pounds of rice, he would have paid $1.50 x 50 = $75.
Response:  We know that Su has 4 bags of sugar on Sunday and 2 bags more on Monday, so she has a total of 4 + 2 = 6 bags of sugar. Each bag contains 200 calories, so Su has a total of 6 x 200 = 1200 calories.
