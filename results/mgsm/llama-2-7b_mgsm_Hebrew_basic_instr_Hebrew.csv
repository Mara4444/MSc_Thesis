Answer:
To find out how many cups of sugar are needed for Toluz, Zrelston and Sital, we need to use the formula:

Number of cups = (Total amount of sugar / Amount of sugar per cup) x Number of people

First, let's calculate the total amount of sugar needed:

For Toluz: 400 grams / 15 grams per tablespoon = 26.67 tablespoons
For Zrelston: 300 grams / 15 grams per tablespoon = 20 tablespoons
For Sital: 200 grams / 15 grams per tablespoon = 13.33 tablespoons

Now, let's divide the total amount of sugar by the number of people:

For Toluz: 26.67 tablespoons / 4 people = 6.66 tablespoons per person
For Zrelston: 20 tablespoons / 4 people = 5 tablespoons per person
For Sital: 13.33 tablespoons / 4 people = 3.33 tablespoons per person

Therefore, Toluz needs 6.66 tablespoons of sugar per person, Zrelston needs 5 tablespoons per person, and Sital needs 3.33 tablespoons per person."
Response:  The time it takes to download a file depends on several factors such as the size of the file, the speed of your internet connection, and any network congestion or latency. In this case, if the file is 200 GB in size and you have a download speed of 10 Mbps (megabits per second), it would take approximately 20 hours to complete the download.

"Response:  If the investor chooses to invest in either of the two options, he will receive a return on his investment at the end of the month. The return on investment for the stocks is expected to increase by 2.5%, while the return on investment for the electronics is expected to increase by 1.2%. If the investor wants to maximize their returns at the end of the month, which option should they choose and why?

Answer:
If the investor wants to maximize their returns at the end of the month, they should choose to invest in the electronics. This is because the return on investment for the electronics is higher than that of the stocks, at 1.2% compared to 2.5%. By choosing to invest in electronics, the investor will be able to earn a higher return on their investment, thereby maximizing their profits."

"Response:  The annual salary of Giyla is $40,000.

To calculate the hourly wage of Giyla, we need to divide her annual salary by the number of hours she works per year. If she works 50 weeks per year and has 35 hours of work per week on average, that means she works a total of 1,750 hours per year (50 weeks x 35 hours/week). Therefore, her hourly wage is:

$40,000 / 1,750 hours = $23.69 per hour

As for whether Giyla should become a professional singer or not, it depends on various factors such as her passion for singing, her talent level, the demand for singers in the market, and the potential income she could generate from singing. It's important to consider all these factors before making a decision."

Response:  The number of candles that will be burned in a given time period depends on the number of hours and minutes between the start and end times you provide. To calculate the number of candles that will be burned during a specific time interval, we need to divide the total time by the duration of one candle burning cycle (which is approximately 5 hours). For example, if the start time is 1:00 PM and the end time is 5:00 PM, there will be 4 candle burning cycles during this time period. Therefore, the number of candles that will be burned is: 4 x 5 = 20 candles.

Response:  The number of teeth that can be extracted with a forceps in one operation is limited by the size and shape of the forceps itself. Generally, a forceps has a maximum capacity for extracting teeth based on its design and construction. For example, a typical dental forceps used for extractions may have a capacity to remove up to 4-6 teeth at once, depending on their size and location within the jawbone. However, it's important to note that the exact number of teeth that can be removed with a single forceps depends on various factors such as the skill level of the dentist or oral surgeon performing the procedure, the complexity of the case, and the patient's individual anatomy.

"Response:  The answer to your question is as follows:

To calculate the time it takes for a boat to travel from point A to point B, we need to know the distance between these two points and the speed of the boat. Let's assume that the distance between point A and point B is 10 miles (16 km) and the speed of the boat is 10 mph (16 km/h).

The time it takes for the boat to travel this distance at a constant speed can be calculated using the formula:

time = distance / speed

In this case, the time it would take for the boat to travel 10 miles at a speed of 10 mph is:

time = 10 miles / 10 mph = 1 hour

So, it would take the boat 1 hour to travel from point A to point B."

Group 1: 20 pears x 6 = 120 pears
Group 2: 20 pears x 6 = 120 pears
...
Group n: 20 pears x 6 = 120 pears
Individual pears: 67 pears

"Response:  The annual pension payment to Mrs. Smith would be $75,000 if she stops working after 30 years of service.

To calculate the annual pension payment, we need to use the formula:

Annual Pension Payment = (Total Years of Service x Average Salary x Percentage Increase) / 100

In this case, the total years of service is 40 years, the average salary is $80,000 per year, and the percentage increase is 5%. Therefore, the annual pension payment would be:

Annual Pension Payment = ($40 x $80 x 5%) / 100 = $75,000

So, after 30 years of service, Mrs. Smith's annual pension payment would be $75,000."

Answer: There are four schools with kindergarten classes in Turin. Each school sends a group of children and a teacher to each class. In total, how many people are sent by each school?

Solution: Based on the question, we can conclude that there are 4 schools sending people to kindergarten classes. Therefore, the number of people sent by each school is:

4 schools x Number of groups per school = 4 x (Number of children + Teacher)

So, the total number of people sent by each school is:

4 x (20 + 1) = 80

Therefore, there are 80 people sent by each school."

"Response: 

The answer to the question is as follows:

Shilla bought five solar panels for $150 each, with a total cost of $750. She paid $200 upfront and will pay the remaining $550 over three months at an interest rate of 2%. How much does Shilla owe per month in installments?

To calculate this, we need to use the formula for calculating installment loans:

Installment amount = Total cost / Number of installments x Interest rate x Time period (in months)

In this case, the total cost is $750, there are three installments, the interest rate is 2%, and the time period is 3 months. Therefore, the installment amount can be calculated as follows:

Installment amount = $750 / 3 x 2% x 3/12 = $68.33 per month

So, Shilla owes $68.33 per month in installments over the course of three months."

Response:  The answer to your question is that the height of a wave on the shore depends on several factors, including the distance from the point where the wave was formed and the shape of the coastline. In general, waves tend to lose energy as they travel towards the shore, so their height decreases with distance. However, if the wave is breaking against a steep slope or cliff, it can maintain its height for longer distances before losing energy. Therefore, the height of a wave on the shore will depend on both the distance from the point where the wave was formed and the topography of the coastline.

"Response:  The man in question has been experiencing a series of unfortunate events that have caused him significant distress and hardship. Here are some of the challenges he faces:

1. Loss of his mother at a young age: The man lost his mother when he was just 23 years old, which had a profound impact on his life. He struggled to come to terms with her passing and has been grappling with grief ever since.
2. Financial difficulties: Despite working hard, the man has been struggling financially for several years. He has been unable to make ends meet and has fallen behind on his bills and debts. This has added to his stress and anxiety levels.
3. Relationship problems: The man has also been dealing with relationship issues, including a recent breakup with his long-term partner. This has left him feeling lonely and isolated, and he is finding it difficult to move on from the past.
4. Health concerns: Recently, the man has been experiencing health problems, including chronic pain and fatigue. These issues have made it difficult for him to carry out daily tasks and have further compromised his mental wellbeing.

Response:  The total amount of the salary for each employee in the company is $600 per month. For every employee who has worked for the company for more than five years, there is a 10% increase in their salary every year. If Silya only worked for the company for five months in December of last year, what is her average salary over the past three years? Answer: To calculate Silya's average salary over the past three years, we need to consider both her initial salary and any increases she received during that time. Let's assume that when Silya started working at the company, her salary was $400 per month. In addition, let's say that after five years of working at the company, her salary increased by 10% to $440 per month. Finally, let's assume that she left the company after six years, so her final salary was $480 per month (which represents a 20% increase from her original salary). Over the past three years, Silya worked at the company for a total of 30 months (December of last year included), which means her total salary during that period was: ($400 x 12) + ($440 x 6) = $5,760. Dividing this amount by the number of months she worked during those three years gives us an average salary of $1,920 per year.

"Response:  The answer to the problem is 30 dogs.

Explanation:

Let's assume that each arnava has 12 puppies, and there are a total of 60 puppies in all. If there are two breeding pairs of dogs (one male and one female), then the number of offspring for each pair is:

Male dog: 12 x 2 = 24 puppies
Female dog: 12 x 2 = 24 puppies

So, in total, there are 24 + 24 = 48 offspring from both breeding pairs. Since we are asked about the number of offspring ""in all,"" which includes the offspring of both breeding pairs, the answer is 48."

Answer: If there were 30 vehicles on the fast lane of a highway and they all passed through the toll booth at the same time, then 5 vehicles per minute passed through the toll booth on average. Therefore, in 15 minutes, 90 vehicles (30 x 5) would have passed through the toll booth."

"Response:  The answer to your question is 7 minutes and 20 seconds. Here's how I arrived at that answer:

To calculate the time it takes for a goose to fly over a city of 42 kilometers in length along its entire perimeter, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

The distance of the city is 42 kilometers, and the speed of the goose is 50 meters per second (m/s). Therefore, we can plug these values into the formula like this:

Time = 42 km / 50 m/s

Now, let's convert the units of measurement from kilometers to hours. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so there are also 1000 hours in an hour. Therefore, we can convert the distance of the city from kilometers to hours as follows:

42 km x 1000 m/km = 42,000 m
42,000 m / 3600 s/h = 11.5 h

So, the goose would take approximately 11.5 hours to fly over the entire perimeter of the city. However, since geese do not fly in a straight line, they will actually cover more ground than the direct distance around the city. To account for this, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed + Fraction of Circumference.

In this case, the fraction of circumference is equal to the length of the city divided by π (pi), which is approximately 3.14. So, our final calculation becomes:

Time = 42,000 m / (50 m/s + 3.14)

Simplifying this equation gives us:

Time = 7 min 20 sec

Therefore, the goose would take approximately 7 minutes and 20 seconds to fly over the entire perimeter of a city with a length of 42 kilometers."

Response:  To find out how much water Golliath had in her jug when she reached the shore, we need to use the information given in the problem.

Therefore, if she took two liters of water for every ten meters she swam, then she would have taken a total of 128 liters of water (640 meters x 2 liters/10 meters). So, Golliath had 128 liters of water in her jug when she reached the shore.

Answer:
If a user has been active in two of Nir's panels in a week to earn points, and there are 30 points for each panel, how many points will he have earned in total per month?

Based on the question, we can conclude that if a user is active in two panels, they will earn 30 points for each panel. Therefore, if a user is active in two panels in a week, they will have earned 60 points (30 points x 2 panels). To find out how many points they will have earned in a month, we need to multiply the number of points they earned in a week by 4 weeks. So, the answer is 240 points (60 points x 4 weeks)."

"Response: אם לילי עשתה 20 חברים יותר מאשר לילי, ואם איימי עשתה 50 חברים, כמה חברים יש לילי ואיימי ביחד?  

Answer:
If Lily made 20 more friends than she could handle at school, and Emmy made 50 more friends than she could handle, how many friends do they have in total together?

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of friends that both Lily and Emmy can handle. Let's assume that Lily can handle a certain number of friends, x, and Emmy can handle a certain number of friends, y. Since Lily made 20 more friends than she could handle, her total number of friends is x + 20. Similarly, since Emmy made 50 more friends than she could handle, her total number of friends is y + 50.

Now, let's find the total number of friends that both Lily and Emmy have together. We know that their combined total is equal to the sum of their individual totals:

Lily's total = x + 20
Emmy's total = y + 50
Total = x + 20 + y + 50 = (x + y) + 70

So, the total number of friends that Lily and Emmy have together is (x + y) + 70."
Response:  The total cost of the silver that will be bought is $375 (4 x $90 = $360 + 20 x $5 = $100). If each pearl costs $15, then the total cost of the pearls is $15 x 20 = $300. Therefore, the total cost of the items purchased is $360 + $300 = $660.
Response:  The hospital sees 500 patients per day and each patient is checked by a doctor in 24 hours. The doctors earn $150 per hour, while the hospital charges $200 per hour for outpatient services. Based on these figures, we can calculate that the hospital makes $35,000 per day ($500 patients x $150/hour) from outpatient services alone. If we assume that the hospital has an average of 300 inpatients per day (based on the total number of patients), then the hospital's daily revenue would be around $67,500 ($35,000 from outpatient services + $32,500 from inpatient services).

"Response:  If Mark took the test yesterday and answered 75 questions in 5 minutes, today he took another test with 100 questions in the same time frame. If it took him 8 minutes to answer the first test and 6 minutes to answer the second test, how many questions did he not answer correctly?

Answer:
If Mark took 8 minutes to answer the first test and 6 minutes to answer the second test, then he spent a total of 14 minutes (8 + 6) on both tests. Since he answered 75 questions in 5 minutes yesterday, his speed per question is 15 questions per minute (75/5). Therefore, if he didn't answer all 100 questions correctly, he must have missed at least 32 questions (100 - 15 x 14 = 32)."

Response:  Gordon has been playing video games for 8 hours a day on average. He also works part-time as a freelance writer, earning $10 per hour. If he had spent the same amount of time watching videos instead of playing games, how much money would he have earned in a week? Solution: To calculate how much money Gordon would have earned if he had spent the same amount of time watching videos instead of playing games, we need to know the number of hours he would have spent watching videos. Let's assume that he would have watched videos for 8 hours per day, just like he plays video games. Therefore, he would have watched a total of 56 hours of videos in a week (8 hours/day x 7 days/week). Now, let's calculate how much money he could have earned from his writing job during this time. Since he earns $10 per hour, and he worked for 56 hours in a week, he would have earned a total of $560 ($10/hour x 56 hours) from his writing job alone. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that he only worked on his writing job during the times when he was not playing video games or watching videos. In reality, he may have worked on other tasks or taken breaks during these times, which could affect his overall earnings.

Answer:
The entrance fee for Britney and her family is $12 per adult and $10 per child. If she received $8 in the meantime, how much silver coins did she give to the kids?

Based on the question, we can conclude that the entrance fee for Britney and her family is $12 per adult and $10 per child. If she received $8 in the meantime, it means she has $8 - $12 = $4 left after paying the entrance fee. Since the entrance fee was $12 per adult and $10 per child, the total amount paid by Britney is $12 x 2 = $24. Therefore, she gave each kid $4 / 2 = $2 worth of silver coins."

If Steve can travel at a rate of 440 meters per minute, it will take him 15 minutes to cover the remaining distance of 3 kilometers. However, since Tim is closer to the house than Steve, he will be able to finish the race in less time. Therefore, the answer is that Tim will arrive at the house before Steve does.

Response:  The time it takes for the bilge to fill with water depends on several factors, including the size of the boat, the amount of rain falling, and the speed at which the water is flowing into the bilge. In general, if a small sailboat like an Opti (300 kg) is in a storm with heavy rain and strong winds, it may take around 15 minutes for the bilge to fill with water. However, this can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances. For example, if the storm is particularly intense or lasts longer than expected, the bilge could potentially fill faster or slower than that.

Response:  The number of fish that can be caught is limited by the number of hooks and bait used. If you use 10 hooks to catch 10 fish, you will need at least 20 pieces of bait (since each hook needs one piece). Therefore, if you want to catch a total of 30 fish, you will need at least 40 pieces of bait (20 for the first 10 fish + 20 for the additional 20 fish). However, since each hook only has room for one piece of bait, you cannot use more than 40 pieces of bait in total. So, the maximum number of fish you can catch is 30.
"Response:  If the price of gold increased by 20% every year for 36 years, how much would a gold bar worth $20 at the beginning of the period be worth after 36 years?

Answer:

To calculate the value of the gold bar after 36 years, we need to use the formula:

Value = Principal x (1 + Interest Rate)^Years

Where:
Principal = Initial value of the gold bar ($20)
Interest Rate = Percentage increase in the price of gold per year (20%)
Years = Number of years (36 years in this case)

Plugging in these values, we get:

Value = $20 x (1 + 0.20)^36 = $840

So, after 36 years, the gold bar worth $20 at the beginning of the period would be worth $840."

Answer:
Gesika wants to understand how much she needs to pay each month for all her debts. The students' fees are $300 per month, the tuition fee is $200 per month, and the minimum amount she needs to pay each month is $500. If Gesika wants to pay 50% more than the minimum amount, how much will she be paying each month?

Solution:
To find out how much Gesika needs to pay each month, we need to calculate 50% more than the minimum amount. So, if the minimum amount is $500, then 50% more would be:

"Response:  The faster team will win in this race.

Explanation:

The first team has a total of 800 meters to run, and each member runs for 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time it takes them to complete the course is 800 / 55 = 14.5 minutes.

The second team has a total of 720 meters to run, and each member runs for 60 seconds. Therefore, the total time it takes them to complete the course is 720 / 60 = 12 minutes.

Since the second team's total distance is shorter than the first team's, they will finish the race faster. In fact, if we calculate the average speed of each team based on their distances and running times, we get:

Team 1: 14.5 minutes / 800 meters = 18.125 km/h
Team 2: 12 minutes / 720 meters = 16.667 km/h

Therefore, Team 2 will finish the race faster than Team 1, with an average speed of 16.667 km/h compared to Team 1's average speed of 18.125 km/h."
"Response:  The answer is 120. Here's how I arrived at that number:

Gerry has a total of 8 tiles and he wants to know the maximum number of times he can arrange them in pairs without repeating any tile. Since each tile can be used only once in a pair, the maximum number of pairs Gerry can make is 8 / 2 = 4.

Now, let's consider the case where Gerry wants to arrange his tiles in groups of three or more. In this case, he can form 3 groups of 3 tiles each, for a total of 9 groups.

So, the maximum number of times Gerry can use his tiles is 4 + 9 = 13. Therefore, the answer is 13."

"Response:  If John won a prize of $5000 and a bonus of 5% of his salary in the year he received the prize, if he earned $2000 per week, how much silver did he receive in that year?

Answer:
John received $104,697.38 in silver in that year.

Explanation:
To calculate the amount of silver John received, we need to multiply the prize money by the number of weeks in the year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total amount of prize money as follows:

$5000 x 52 = $260,000

Next, we need to subtract the bonus amount from the prize money to get the actual cash award that John received. The bonus is calculated as 5% of John's salary, so we need to find out what his salary was for the year. Let's assume his annual salary was $100,000.

$260,000 - ($100,000 x 5%) = $244,000

Now, let's convert the prize money to silver using the exchange rate provided in the question:

$244,000 / $17.92 (exchange rate) = 13,636.36 troy oz

Finally, since there are 31.1 grams in a troy oz, we can convert the silver weight to grams as follows:

13,636.36 troy oz x 31.1 g/troy oz = 430,677.6 grams

Therefore, John received $430,677.6 worth of silver in that year."
"Response:  The number of bottles of wine produced by the vineyard in one year is given by the formula: Number of bottles = Total weight of grapes x Conversion rate x Yield per ton x Bottle size.

Let's break down this formula:

* Total weight of grapes: This is the total weight of all the grapes harvested from the vineyard in one year, which is 10 tons in our case.
* Conversion rate: This is a factor that represents how much of the grape weight is converted into wine. Let's assume the conversion rate is 70%. So, 70% of the total weight of grapes is converted into wine.
* Yield per ton: This is the amount of wine produced from each ton of grapes. Let's assume the yield per ton is 400 liters.
* Bottle size: This is the volume of a standard bottle of wine (which is typically around 0.75 liters).

Now we can plug these values into the formula to get the total number of bottles of wine produced by the vineyard in one year:
Number of bottles = 10 tons x 70% x 400 liters / 0.75 liters = 3600 bottles

So, the vineyard produces approximately 3600 bottles of wine in one year."

"Response:  To calculate the total number of kilometers that Michal traveled during his cycling trips, we need to know how many kilometers he traveled each time and how often he went on these trips.

From the information provided in the question, we can see that Michal rode his bike for about 5 hours per week, and he covered a distance of 25 km per trip. He did this for 4 weeks, which means he traveled a total distance of:

5 hours/week x 4 weeks = 20 hours
20 hours x 25 km/hour = 500 km

So, over the course of 13 weeks (3 months), Michal traveled a total distance of approximately 7,500 km (5,600 miles)."
Response:  The total number of eggs in the basket is 80. If each egg costs $1, then the total cost of the eggs is $80. Since there are 25 chicks in the basket, and each chick eats one egg per day, the total number of eggs consumed by the chicks is 25 x 30 = 750 eggs. Therefore, the remaining eggs in the basket after the chicks have finished eating them is 80 - 750 = 65 eggs.
Response:  The woman bought a total of 7 eggs on the first day, 8 eggs on the second day, and 9 eggs on the third day. Therefore, she bought a total of 7 + 8 + 9 = 24 eggs over the course of three days.
"Response:  The answer is $1,500.

Explanation:

The problem states that you have 15 tickets for a raffle with a total value of $1,200. You also have 6,000 tickets for a separate raffle with a total value of $600,000. You want to know the value of the combined raffles.

To find the value of the combined raffles, we need to multiply the number of tickets in each raffle by its respective value per ticket. For the first raffle, there are 15 tickets with a value of $1,200, so the value of this raffle is $1,200 x 15 = $18,000. For the second raffle, there are 6,000 tickets with a value of $600,000, so the value of this raffle is $600,000 x 6,000 = $3,600,000.

Therefore, the combined value of both raffles is $18,000 + $3,600,000 = $3,618,000."

"Response:  The answer to your question is as follows:

Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320 and a handbag for $32. Her salary is $60 per hour, and she works for 8 hours a week. To determine how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford the purchase, we need to calculate her monthly income.

Monthly Income = Hourly Wage x Number of Hours Worked per Week x Number of Weeks in a Month
= $60 x 8 x 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month)
= $1,920

Now, let's calculate how long it will take Lori to save up enough money to buy the shoes and handbag:

Time Needed to Save Up Money = Cost of Shoes + Cost of Handbag / Monthly Income
= ($320 + $32) / $1,920
= 5 months

Therefore, Lori needs to work for approximately 5 months to save up enough money to buy the shoes and handbag."
"Response:

$2200 - ($165 x 12) = $1835

Therefore, the remaining balance after 12 months will be $1835."

"Response:  The time it takes to solve a Rubik's Cube depends on the speed of the solver and their level of expertise. There are many different methods for solving the cube, and each one can be completed in a varying amount of time. Here is a rough estimate of the time it may take to complete each step of the solution process:

Step 1: White cross (2-5 moves) - This is the first step in solving the Rubik's Cube, where you need to create a white cross on the top face of the cube. This typically takes around 2-5 moves, depending on your speed and comfort with the move.

Step 2: Orientation of middle layer (8-12 moves) - In this step, you need to orient the middle layer of the cube so that all the colors are on the right faces. This can take anywhere from 8-12 moves, depending on how quickly you can perform the moves.

Step 3: Permutation of middle layer (12-18 moves) - Once the middle layer is oriented, you need to permute the layers so that the colors are in the correct positions. This can take around 12-18 moves, again depending on your speed and skill level.

Step 4: Last layer (12-20 moves) - In the final step, you need to solve the last layer of the cube by aligning the colors on the bottom face. This can take anywhere from 12-20 moves, depending on how challenging the puzzle is and how well you have solved the previous steps.

Overall, the total time it takes to solve a Rubik's Cube can range from around 20-60 minutes, depending on the individual's skill level and the complexity of the puzzle they are trying to solve."

"Response:  The answer to your question is not straightforward and depends on various factors such as the age of the girls at the time of marriage, their maturity level, and cultural norms in different societies. However, I can provide some general information and insights based on available data and research.

According to the United Nations Population Division (UNPD), the legal age of marriage varies across countries and regions. In many countries, including those with a Muslim majority population, the legal age of marriage for women is 18 years old. However, there are still many places where the legal age of marriage is lower, often around 16 or 17 years old.

In terms of cultural norms, it is important to recognize that early marriage is still prevalent in many parts of the world, particularly in rural areas and among marginalized communities. According to UNICEF, an estimated 15 million girls under the age of 18 marry every year globally, with the majority of these marriages occurring in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

While there is no universally accepted definition of ""young,"" it is generally understood to refer to individuals who are below the age of majority or legal adulthood. In most countries, this age is 18 years old, although some jurisdictions may have a slightly higher or lower age limit.

Based on these considerations, if we assume that the three girls were married when they were between 14 and 16 years old, then their ages at the time of marriage would range from approximately 13 to 15 years old. This means that they were likely considered minors at the time of their weddings, which raises questions about their capacity to give informed consent and whether their marriages were legally valid.

It is worth noting that the minimum age of marriage varies by country and region, and some cultures may view 14 or 15 years old as being within the normal range of childhood development. However, from a human rights perspective, it is important to recognize that children and young adolescents have limited capacities to make decisions regarding their own well-being and may be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.

The number of students who left the building through exit A is 30%. Therefore, 30% of 1000 students = 300 students left through exit A.
Since 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., 70%) left through exit B, and 20% of the remaining students (i.e., 200 students) left through exit C, we have:
Number of students who left through exit G = Total number of students - Number of students who left through exits A + B + C
= 1000 - 300 + 70 + 200
= 430 students
Therefore, the answer is 430 students left through exit G."
