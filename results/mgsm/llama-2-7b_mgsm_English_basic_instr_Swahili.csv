Answer: 24 years
Explanation: To calculate how long it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to subtract the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) from the total revenue generated by the tree over its lifetime ($630). This gives us a profit of $540. Since this amount is greater than the annual cost of caring for the tree ($3), it means that Carlos will start earning money after 24 years."

"Response:  Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles.  For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles.  One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.   If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles? 
Answer:  To find out how much money Charlie will make from selling 20 candles, we need to first calculate how many candles he can make with one pound of beeswax. Since he can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax, he can make 20 candles (10 x 2) with one pound of beeswax. Next, we subtract the cost of the supplies (the beeswax and wicks) from the amount he will receive for selling the candles. In this case, the total cost of the supplies is $10.00 ($10.00 + $10.00), so he will have a net profit of $40.00 ($20.00 - $10.00). Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $40.00."

"Response:  Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back?

Answer:
To find the time it takes for Tom to return, we need to use the formula:
Time = Distance / Rate

First, let's find the distance traveled by Tom during his trip:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x (4 hours - 1 hour)
Distance = 20 miles

Now, let's find the time it takes Tom to return:
Time = Distance / Rate
Time = 20 miles / 6 miles/hour
Time = 3.33 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom approximately 3.33 hours to get back."

"Response: 380.  Nzuri!  Now, let's calculate how much money the mechanic earned from each type of tire he repaired.
For truck tires: 6 x $60 = $360
For car tires: 4 x $40 = $160
So, in total, the mechanic earned $520 from both types of tires.
Now, let's compare this amount to the revenue generated by the number of tires repaired on each day:
On Thursday, the mechanic earned $520 / 10 (number of tires repaired) = $52 per tire
On Friday, the mechanic earned $520 / 16 (number of tires repaired) = $32 per tire
As you can see, the mechanic earned more money per tire on Friday than on Thursday. So, the answer to your question is $32 - $52 = $20 more revenue earned on Friday compared to Thursday."

Explanation: To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide his total amount of money by the cost of one movie ticket and popcorn. Since the cost is $7 per person, we can calculate it as follows:

Since there are 6 times that Peter can go to the movies with the money he has, the answer is 3."

"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it. We can do this by using the following formula:
distance = (gas left / miles driven) x 12
In this case, the gas left in Sophia's tank is 8 gallons (12 - 4), and she has driven 100 miles since last filling it. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:
distance = (8 / 100) x 12 = 960 miles
Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 960 miles on a single tank of gas."

Response:  Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, which means that in one minute, he covers 440 feet. Since Tim's distance is only half of what Steve has (2 miles), it takes him less time to cover that distance. So if Tim rides his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, he will take half as much time to cover the same distance as Steve did on his bike. Therefore, Tim will finish the race in half the time it took Steve to complete it. To find out exactly how long this is, we need to divide the distance by the speed at which Tim is traveling: 2 miles / 264 feet/minute = 7.5 minutes. This means that the winner will wait 7.5 minutes for the loser to finish the race.
"Response:  $1.75
Answer: $1.75
Explanation:
On the first day, 5 people brought their bicycles for tire inflation. Since each tire cost 25 cents to inflate, Shawnda made $1.25 from those customers ($0.25 x 5 tires).
Then, 3 people came with their tricycles for tire inflation. Tricycles have 3 tires, so again, Shawnda made $0.75 from those customers ($0.25 x 3 tires).
Finally, one person came on a unicycle. Unicycles only have one tire, so Shawnda made $0.25 from that customer ($0.25 x 1 tire).
Adding up all these amounts gives us a total of $1.75 in revenue for Shawnda's bike inflation service on its first day."

Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull took them. The seagull ate half of what Dave had eaten, which is 7 fries (half of 14). Three pigeons then bullied the seagull away from the fries, and each pigeon ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 9 fries (3 x 3 = 9). A raccoon later stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is equal to 4 fries (2/3 x 7 = 4). Finally, ants carried off one fry, leaving 5 fries behind. Therefore, the answer is 60 fries."

Explanation: If Carl ate a sandwich with 2 slices of cheese every day for lunch, then he used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch. Since he also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 times, he used an additional 3 x 2 = 6 slices of cheese for breakfast. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used was 14 + 6 = 20 slices. Finally, since he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that would last him several dinners, he used 8 slices of cheese in that dish. So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used throughout the week was 20 + 8 = 28 slices."

Answer: 50

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the passage:

* After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which means 30% of 120 = 36 watermelons were ready.
* Two weeks later, when Ashlyn came back, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which means 3/4 × 36 = 27 watermelons were ready.
* So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 36 - 27 = 9 watermelons.

Therefore, the answer is 9."

Answer: Let's assume that the number of bugs is x. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, the ratio of bugs to ants is 1:2 or 1/2. So, we can set up a proportion:

Now, we know that the number of ants is 50, so we can substitute this value into the proportion:

Bugs = 50 / 2 = 25

Therefore, there are 25 bugs in the garden."
