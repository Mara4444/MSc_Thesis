Josh has an investment of $80,000 in a business that he expects to generate profits of $50,000 per year for the next 5 years. If the profit is increased by 150%, what will be the total value of the investment after 5 years?
Total Value = Initial Investment + Profit x (1 + Percentage Increase) x Number of Years
= $80,000 + ($50,000 x 150%) x 5
= $80,000 + $750,000
= $830,000"

Explanation:
To calculate Pira's weekly income, we need to multiply her total working hours by her hourly wage rate. Her total working hours for the given week are 45 x 6 = 270 hours. Therefore, her weekly income can be calculated as follows:

Weekly Income = Total Working Hours x Hourly Wage Rate
= 270 hours x $10/hour
= $2,700

Since Eliza deducts $1,200 from Pira's paycheck, Pira's take-home pay is:

Take-Home Pay = Weekly Income - Deductible Amount
= $2,700 - $1,200
= $1,500

Therefore, Pira's weekly income is $1,500."

The peddler should choose to sell the jewelry because it has a higher profit margin than electronics. The profit margin for jewelry is 2.5%, while that of electronics is 1.2%. Therefore, if the peddler sells jewelry worth $5,000, they will make a profit of $125 ($5,000 x 2.5%). If they sell electronics worth $8,000, they will only make a profit of $96 ($8,000 x 1.2%). So, in this case, choosing to sell jewelry would be more profitable for the peddler."

To calculate the number of calories in 300 grams of crackers (Duwe), we need to know its nutritional information. Let's assume that one serving size is 30 grams and contains approximately 160 calories. Therefore, 300 grams of crackers would contain around 480 calories (300 x 160).
Now, let's calculate how many servings are in 300 grams of crackers based on their nutritional content per serving. If there are 480 calories in one serving, then there will be approximately 9 servings (480 / 30 = 9) in 300 grams of crackers.
As for your second question, if you consume 5 portions of crackers (300 grams each) with a total caloric intake of 1800 calories, it means you have consumed 9 x 5 = 45 servings of crackers (based on their nutritional content per serving). This translates to approximately 7600 calories from crackers alone (45 x 160 = 7600).
Therefore, by consuming 5 portions of crackers with a total caloric intake of 1800 calories, you have exceeded your daily recommended calorie intake by approximately 7600 - 1800 = 5800 calories."

Explanation: To calculate the number of tickets sold for Wayang Minggu Iki, we need to multiply the price of each ticket by the total number of shows per week. Based on the information provided in the question, there are 3 shows per week, and each show costs $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn. Therefore, the total revenue from ticket sales alone is $7 x 3 = $21 per week. If we assume that half of the audience buys popcorn (which costs an additional $7), then the total revenue from ticket and popcorn sales would be $21 + $7 = $28 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total revenue from ticket and popcorn sales over a month is $28 x 4 = $112. However, if we subtract the cost of producing one show ($42), then the profit from ticket and popcorn sales over a month would be $112 - $42 = $70."

Cats: 60 x 0.5 = 30 kg/day
Dogs: 60 x 1 = 60 kg/day
Total: 90 kg/day

Since the question asks for the combined weight of the feces from both cats and dogs, we add their individual weights to get a total of 120 kg/day."

Explanation: To calculate the total amount of money that will be paid by Dillon at the local market, we need to multiply the number of each item he bought by its price and then add them up. For semangka, Dillon bought 4 pieces at $1.5 per piece, so the cost is $6. For mrica, he bought 20 pieces at $1 per piece, so the cost is $20. For jeruk, he bought 10 pieces at $5 per piece, so the cost is $50. Therefore, the total amount of money that Dillon will pay is $6 + $20 + $50 = $86. Since there are 15 $ in one Indonesian rupiah (IDR), we can convert the total amount to IDR by dividing it by 15, which gives us 570,000 IDR ($=57 x 10^6)."

Calculation:
Total cost of 2 sandwiches = $7.50 x 2 = $15.00
Total cost of 2 packets of crackers = $1.50 x 2 = $3.00
Total cost of 2 cookies = $1.00 x 2 = $2.00
Total shipping cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Discount for 20% shipping discount = $20.00 x 20% = $4.00
Final shipping cost = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
Tips = $5.00
Total cost of shipping = $16.00 + $5.00 = $21.00"

Explanation:
To calculate the amount of bonus that John will receive, we need to use the formula: Bonus = Gross Salary x Percentage Increase.
Given:
* Gross Salary = $5000 (as mentioned in the question)
* Percentage Increase = 5% (also mentioned in the question)
So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:
Bonus = $5000 x 5% = $250
Since John has worked for 20 weeks, he will receive a bonus of $250 for each week worked, which is equal to $50 per week. Therefore, his total bonus for the year will be:
Bonus = $50 x 26 weeks = $1300
However, since the question mentions that there will be a 5% increase in salary every year, we need to adjust the gross salary and bonus amounts accordingly. So, for the next year, John's gross salary will be:
New Gross Salary = Old Gross Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase) = $5000 x (1 + 0.05) = $5250
And his bonus for the next year will be:
Bonus = New Gross Salary x Percentage Increase = $5250 x 5% = $262.50
Repeating this process for each subsequent year, we can see that John's bonus will increase by $262.50 each year, until it reaches its maximum value of $18750 after 10 years."

The total amount of revenue for the company from advertising on social media platforms can be calculated as follows:
Total revenue = Total number of views x CPM (Cost Per Mille)
CPM is the cost per 1,000 impressions and it varies depending on the platform, ad format, target audience, and other factors. Let's assume that the average CPM for social media advertising in Indonesia is around IDR 200,000 (USD 14).
Assuming the company has 3 million views on its social media channels, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:
Total revenue = 3,000,000 x IDR 200,000 = IDR 600,000,000 (USD 42,800)
Therefore, the total amount of revenue for the company from advertising on social media platforms is approximately IDR 600,000,000 (USD 42,800)."

The probability of selecting at least 8 cards from the deck that are not in the hand is approximately 75%. To calculate this, we can use the binomial distribution formula:

P(X >= 8) = (n choose x) \* (1 - p)^x \* p^((n-x))

where:

* X is the number of cards selected from the deck that are not in the hand
* n is the total number of cards in the deck (30 in this case)
* x is the number of cards already in the hand (20 in this case)
* p is the probability of drawing a card that is not in the hand (which is equal to 1 - the probability of drawing a card that is in the hand)

Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:

P(X >= 8) = (30 choose 20) \* (1 - 0.6)^20 \* 0.6^(30-20)
= approximately 0.75

So, the probability of selecting at least 8 cards from the deck that are not in the hand is approximately 75%."
