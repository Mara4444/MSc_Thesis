"Response: 
Raţele lui Janet depun 16 ouă per day. She sells them at the farmers market for $2 each. So she makes $32 in revenue from her eggs every day ($2 x 16).
Now let's calculate how much money she makes from brioches. Since she gives three to her friends every morning and makes four brioches per day, she has 7 brioches left over after giving away three (3 + 4 = 7). And since each brioch costs $5, she makes $35 in revenue from brioches every day ($5 x 7).
So, in total, Janet makes $67 in revenue every day ($32 + $35) from both her eggs and brioches."
Response:  We know that o haină has two types of fibers: blue and white. The ratio between these two types is given as 2/3 for blue fibers and 1/3 for white fibers. So, we need to find out how many şuruburi (or threads) there are in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of blue fibers by their proportion, which gives us 2 x 2/3 = 4 şuruburi of blue fiber. Then, we add the number of white fibers (which is half of what remains), which gives us 4 + (1/3) = 6 şuruburi of white fiber. Therefore, the total number of şuruburi needed is 4 + 6 = 10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and then he spent $50,000 for repairs. So, the total amount of money invested in the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Now, if the value of the house increased by 150%, then the new value of the house would be $130,000 x 150% = $195,000. Therefore, the profit made by Josh is $195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that James will run 3 sprints per week and each sprint is 3 times a week. So, he will run 3 x 3 = 9 sprints in one week. Then, we are given that he runs 60 meters for each sprint. Therefore, he will cover a total distance of 60 x 9 = 540 meters in one week.
Response:  We know that Wendi feeds her chickens with three types of food mixed together for each meal to keep them healthy. She divides the food into three meals and gives each chicken 15 portions in the morning. After lunch, she adds another 25 portions of food for each chicken. If Wendi has 20 chickens, how many portions of food will she need to give them altogether per day?  Solution: To find out how many portions of food Wendi needs to give her chickens per day, we can use multiplication. Since there are 3 meals per day, and Wendi gives each chicken 15 portions in the morning, she needs to give a total of 3 x 15 = 45 portions of food per day. Then, after lunch, she adds another 25 portions, so the total number of portions of food Wendi needs to give her chickens per day is 45 + 25 = 70 portions.
Response:  If one glass costs $5 and each glass of two times costs only 60% of its original price, then we can write an equation as follows: Glass = $5 x (1 + 0.6) = $5 x 1.6 = $8 The total number of glasses that Kyler wants to buy is 16, so he will have to pay for 16 \* $8 = $128. Therefore, Kyler must pay $128 for his 16 glasses of water.
"Response:  We know that Toulouse have twice as many sheep as Charleston and Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we can write:
Toulouse - 2 x Charleston = Seattle
or, in numerical terms:
16 (Toulouse) - 8 (Charleston) = 4 (Seattle)
Now, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then we can add this value to both sides of the equation:
16 - 8 + 20 =?
Solving for the unknown quantity, we get:
8 + 20 = 38
So, there are 38 sheep in total among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute, so it will take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the file. However, due to the forced restart caused by Windows updates, she needs to start over from the beginning, which means she has lost 40% of the progress made so far. Therefore, the total time required for Carla to download the file is (100 x 1.4) = 140 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, John spent 3 hours driving at a speed of 60 miles per hour and then realized that he had forgotten something very important back home. He tried to reach home in 4 hours but got stuck in traffic for 2 hours. After that, he drove for half an hour at a speed of 30 miles per hour, and then he had 4 hours left to drive to his destination. So, the distance from John's current location to his home is equal to the total time taken to cover that distance divided by the average speed at which he was able to drive during those 4 hours. Therefore, we can calculate this as follows: Distance = Time x Speed = (4 hours) x (80 miles/hour) = 320 miles away from his starting point.
Response:  If Eliza works for 40 hours at $10 per hour, she will earn $400. Then if she works additional 5 hours at $1.2 times the regular rate, she will earn an extra $6 (since $1.2 \* 1.2 = $1.44). Therefore, her total weekly earnings are $406 ($400 + $6).
Response:  In the first month (luna), the program had 60 downloads.  In the second month (luna), the number of downloads was three times that of the first month, so it was 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.  In the third month (luna), the number of downloads decreased by 30%, so it was 180 / 0.7 = 252 downloads. Therefore, in total, the program had 60 + 180 + 252 = 492 downloads over the three months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Toula bought 3 duzini (or 3 x 12 = 36) of gogoşi which cost $68 for each duzină, so the total cost of gogoşi is: $68 x 36 = $2472. Similarly, she bought 2 duzini (or 2 x 12 = 24) of mini-cupcakes which cost $80 for each duzină, so the total cost of mini-cupcakes is: $80 x 24 = $1920. Lastly, she bought 6 duzini (or 6 x 12 = 72) of mini-cheesecakes which cost $55 for each duzină, so the total cost of mini-cheesecakes is: $55 x 72 = $3960. Therefore, the total cost of all the items Toula bought at the bakery is: $2472 + $1920 + $3960 = $8352.
Response:  First year:  The tree will cost $90 to plant and there are 7 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $10.50 in revenue.  Second year:  There are now 14 leaves (7 from first year + 7 new ones) that can be sold for $1.5 each = $21 in revenue. Third year:  There are now 21 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $32.50 in revenue. Fourth year:  There are now 28 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $42 in revenue. Fifth year:  There are now 35 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $52.50 in revenue. Sixth year:  There are now 42 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $63 in revenue. Seventh year:  There are now 49 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $73.50 in revenue. Eighth year:  There are now 56 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $84 in revenue. Ninth year:  There are now 63 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $94.50 in revenue. Tenth year:  There are now 70 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $105 in revenue. Eleventh year:  There are now 77 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $112.50 in revenue. Twelfth year:  There are now 84 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $123 in revenue. Thirteenth year:  There are now 91 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $136.50 in revenue. Fourteenth year:  There are now 98 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $150 in revenue. Fifteenth year:  There are now 105 leaves that can be sold for $1.5 each = $162.50 in re
Response:  We know that Melanie has sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at Green House, 2/3 at Red House, and half of what remains at Yellow House. So far, she has sold 1/3 + 2/3 = 4/3 vacuum cleaners in total. Now, we need to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie still has left. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners in total, and she has already sold 4/3, then she must have 1/3 left, which is equal to 1 vacuum cleaner. Therefore, Melanie started with 1 vacuum cleaner.
Response:  We know that in a class of 20 students, 20% have signed up for contemporary dance, which means 4 students (20% x 20) have signed up for this type of dance.  Now we need to find out how many students have signed up for each of the other two types of dance.  From the information given, we know that 25% of the remaining students have signed up for jazz dance, so the number of students who signed up for jazz dance is equal to 25% of the total number of students minus the number of students who signed up for contemporary dance, which is 4. Therefore, the number of students who signed up for jazz dance is 25% x (total number of students - 4), or 25% x 16 = 4. So there are 4 students who signed up for jazz dance.  Finally, we need to find out how many students have signed up for hip-hop dance. Since the remaining 55% of the students did not sign up for any of the three dances mentioned, all of them must have signed up for hip-hop dance. Therefore, the number of students who signed up for hip-hop dance is 55% x 16 = 8. So there are 8 students who signed up for hip-hop dance.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the present value of each option using the given information. The present value of an option is calculated as follows: PV = CF x (1 + r)^n Where: PV = Present Value C F = Future Value in dollars n = Number of periods until maturity In this case, let's assume that the commercial has enough money to buy both options and wants to know which one will give him more profit at the end of the month. So, we can use the formula above to calculate the present value of each option: For the jewelry option: PV = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025)^(number of days) = $5,375 For the electronic device option: PV = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012)^(number of days) = $8,464 Now, since the commercial cannot afford to buy both options simultaneously, he needs to make a choice based on his preference for risk tolerance and investment horizon. If he chooses to invest in jewelry, he will have a higher return than if he invests in electronic devices. However, there are risks associated with investing in jewelry such as market volatility, liquidity issues, etc., whereas investing in electronic devices may be less risky but also offer lower returns. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors before making a decision. Ultimately, the commercial should choose the option that best aligns with his financial goals and risk tolerance.
Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 80 miles, so each train covers a distance of 80 miles.  On day two, Train B travels north and covers 150 miles, while Train A travels west again and covers another 80 miles. Therefore, the total distance covered by Train A is 160 miles (80 + 80), and the total distance covered by Train B is 230 miles (150 + 80).
Response:  As a teacher, she works 35 hours per week and is paid $20 per hour, so her weekly income as a teacher is: $20 x 35 = $700 per week. Since there are 50 weeks in a year, her annual income as a teacher would be: $700 x 50 = $35,000 per year. Now let's consider her work as a dance instructor. She works 15 hours per week at $30 per hour, so her weekly income as an instructor is: $30 x 15 = $450 per week. Again, since there are 50 weeks in a year, her annual income as an instructor would be: $450 x 50 = $22,500 per year. Therefore, her total annual salary is: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500 per year.
"Response:  If Claire has an egg omelette with 3 eggs in each breakfast every day for 4 weeks, then she will have:

1. Number of days = 4 weeks x 7 days/week = 28 days
2. Total number of egg omelettes = 28 days x 3 eggs/omelette = 84 omelettes
3. Total number of eggs used = 84 omelettes x 3 eggs/omelette = 252 eggs

Therefore, Claire will use 252 eggs in 4 weeks."
Response:  We know that Marissa has run for 12 miles so far and it took her one hour to cover the first four miles. Therefore, she ran at a pace of 4 miles per hour during the first hour. To find out how fast she needs to run the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the time left is 8 hours (since she has already run for one hour). So, if she wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour throughout, she will need to run at a pace of 5 miles per hour during the last 8 hours (Answer: 5 miles/hour).
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange drink that is composed of two-thirds water and one-third orange juice. If we add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is composed of three-fifths water and two-fifths pineapple juice, we get a total volume of 27 liters (10 + 15). Now, if we turn the mixture and pour out one liter, we are left with 26 liters (27 - 1). So, there are 26 liters of liquid remaining after turning the mixture.
Response:  We know that Raymon... (read more)
Response:  We know that the first three customers bought one each, so they bought 3 DVDs in total. The next two customers bought 2 each, so they bought 4 more DVDs (for a total of 7). Finally, the last three customers did not buy any DVDs, so Billy sold 0 DVDs to them. Therefore, the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Monday is: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs.
Response:  At 1:00 pm, the lamppost is already 2 cm shorter than its original height (since it shrinks by 2 cm every hour). So at 1:00 pm, the lamppost is 2 cm shorter = 68 cm tall. Now let's find out how much taller/shorter it will be after 5 hours: Time taken for each hour = 5 hours / 4 hours per day = 1.25 days Time passed from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm = 1.25 days x 4 hours/day = 5 hours Therefore, after 5 hours, the lamppost will have shrunk another 2 cm = 66 cm tall. Conclusion: After 5 hours, the lamppost will be 66 cm tall.
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book last year and there was a discount of 25% off the original price. So we can write the equation:

$19.50 = x \* (1 - 0.25)

Where x is the original price of the book. Solving for x, we get:

x = $75

So the original price of the book was $75."
Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of her groceries. If she bought x cutlets of pizza and each cutlet costs $8.50, then the total amount Marie paid for pizza is $x \* $8.50 = $85. So, if Marie bought x cutlets of pizza, then she must have also bought $50 - $85 = $35 worth of other groceries (including the chicken, milk, apples, and pizza sauce). Since there are 4 mere in a pound, Marie must have bought at least 3 pounds of meat ($35 / $9 per pound) or more likely 4 pounds of meat since she only spent $35. Therefore, Marie bought 4 cutlets of pizza.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Mishka has bought 3 pairs of shorts, which means he has spent $16.5 x 3 = $49.5 for shorts. Secondly, he has also bought 3 pairs of pants, and each pair costs $22.5 x 3 = $67.5. Finally, he has purchased 3 pairs of shoes, and each pair costs $42 x 3 = $126. Therefore, in total, Mishka has spent $49.5 + $67.5 + $126 = $233 dollars on all his clothes.
"Response: 
Cynthia buys 15 portions of ice cream per night at $4 per portion. Therefore, she spends $60 per night on ice cream ($4 x 15).
Since there are 60 days in total, Cynthia will spend a total of $60 x 60 = $3600 on ice cream over those 60 days."
Response:  We know that Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike ride. He stopped after 20 miles and again at 15 miles before the end of the trip. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = Total distance - (Distance to first stop + Distance to second stop) Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: Distance = 60 miles - (20 miles + 15 miles) Distance = 45 miles Therefore, Henry parked his bike for 45 miles between the first and second stops.
Response:  We know that Gloria is looking for shoes that fit her budget of $50. She finds two pairs of high heels that cost less than $50 together. However, she has to choose between these two pairs and a pair of sneakers that costs $50 more than one of them. So, if we let x be the price of the first pair of high heels, then we can write the equation: 3x + 2(50) = 100... (1) Now, we are given that the second pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so we can write: 2x = 2 \* 50 = 100... (2) Solving both equations simultaneously, we get: x = 33... Therefore, the price of the first pair of high heels is $33.
Response:  We know that Darrell is 7 years older than Allen. So, if Allen is x years old, then Darrell is 7x years old. The sum of their ages is given as 162. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 7x + x = 162. Simplifying this equation, we get: 8x = 162. Dividing both sides by 8, we find that Allen is 20 years old (since he is younger than Darrell). So, the answer to the question is:  Allen is 20 years old over 10 years.
Response:  Firstly, we have Gunter who thinks there are 80 candies in the jar. Then, one of his friends says that they estimate there to be 20 more than half of what Gunter said (which is 40). Another friend estimates that there are 25% more candies than the first friend's estimation (which is 50). So, their combined estimate is 90. Therefore, the median estimate of Gunter and his friends is 90.
"Response:  Since there are 10 dogs and each dog needs 0.5 hours per day to walk and take care of its business, we can calculate the total time spent on taking care of the dogs as follows:
Total time = Number of dogs x Time required per dog/Day
= 10 x 0.5/24 (since there are 24 hours in a day)
= 20 hours/day
So, John spends 20 hours per day taking care of his 10 dogs."
Response:  We know that there are 110 coins in total and 30 of them are gold coins. So, we can write an equation as follows: Gold coins = Total coins - Silver coins (Gold coins / Silver coins) x Total coins Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Gold coins = 110 - 30 / 2 = 110 / 2 = 55 Gold coins Therefore, Gretchen has 55 gold coins.
"Response:  We know that Aaron has 2 fewer beads than Siobhan and Aaron has 5 more beads than half of Raymond's beads. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Siobhan - 2 = Aaron
Aaron + 5 = (Half of Raymond) x 2
Now let's solve for Siobhan's number of beads:
Siobhan = Aaron - 2 = 38 - 2 = 36
So Siobhan has 36 beads."
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. This means he averaged 0.2 points per minute (4/20).  Then in the next 20 minutes, he scored 3 times as many points as before, which is 6 points (or 0.12 points per minute). So, his total score after 40 minutes is: 0.2 + 0.12 = 0.32 points per minute x 40 minutes = 12.8 points. Therefore, Mike scored 12.8 points in total.
"Response:  If Terry eats 2 iaurturi per day and there are currently 4 iaurturi for sale at $5 each, then he spends:

$$ Number of days = 30 $$

$$ Total number of iaurturi consumed = 2 \times 30 = 60 $$

So, Terry spends:

$$ Cost = 60 \times 5 = 300 $$

Therefore, Terry spends $300 on iaurturi over 30 days."
Response:  Firstly, John sold all his Lego sets and got $15 x 13 = $195 from that. Then he used this money to buy video games for which he paid $20 x 8 = $160. So now he has $195 - $160 = $35 left with him. Therefore, John still has 13 sets of Lego.
Response:  First day: He ran for 3 hours + 30 minutes = 3.5 hours. Second and third days he ran for 2 hours each day. So total time running in three days is: 2 x 2 = 4 hours. Total distance covered in three days is: 3.5 + 4 = 7.5 miles per week. Therefore, John runs at a speed of approximately 7.5 miles/week.
Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than she can walk and can jump with half the speed of running, then we know that her walking speed is x miles per hour. Since she can run four times faster than she can walk, her running speed is 4x miles per hour. Therefore, her total distance traveled in 6 hours is: Distance = Speed x Time = (4x) x (6) = 24x miles. So, if Dana spends one-third of her time running and two- thirds of her time walking, her total distance traveled in 6 hours is: Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance = 24x - x = 23x miles.
"Response:  We know that:
Ben's phone is twice as old as Suzy's phone.
Brandon's phone is four times older than Ben's phone.
So, we can write:
Suzy's age = x (where x is the age of her phone)
Ben's age = 2x (since his phone is twice as old)
Brandon's age = 4(2x) = 8x (since his phone is four times older)
Now, we have three equations and three variables. Solving them simultaneously, we get:
x = 1
2x = 2
8x = 32
Therefore, the age of Suzy's phone is 1 year, Ben's phone is 2 years old, and Brandon's phone is 32 - 2 = 30 years old."
Response:  First, we know that when Polly holds the precious stone, she can throw her golden arrow three times farther than usual. So if she throws it from a distance of 120 meters without holding the stone, it will travel 360 meters (3 x 120). Now, let's calculate how far the fireball thrown by the dragon is from the mountain peak. We are told that the dragon is located at a height of 300 meters above the mountain peak. Therefore, the distance between the mountain peak and the point where the fireball hits the ground is equal to the height of the dragon minus the height of the mountain peak. In this case, the distance would be 300 - 30 = 270 meters. Finally, we need to subtract the distance traveled by the arrow from the total distance to find out how far Polly needs to stand from the mountain peak to hit the dragon with her arrow. So, in this case, Polly needs to stand at least 270 + 360 = 630 meters away from the mountain peak to hit the dragon with her arrow.
Response:  We know that Bunica Jones made 5 plates of doughnuts for the firefighters and cut each plate into 8 pieces. So, she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of doughnuts in total. Then, after everyone had taken their share, there were 14 remaining pieces of doughnuts. Therefore, the number of pieces of doughnuts that each person took is 14 / 5 = 2.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece of doughnut, let's round up to 3 pieces per person.
Response:  If one serving of carrots has 250 calories and there is a bag of 300g with 5 servings, then we can calculate how many grams of carrots you can eat per day based on your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories and the number of calories you have already consumed (1800). To do this, we will use the following formula: Number of grams of carrots = Total number of calories / Number of calories per serving x Number of servings So, if we plug in the values given in the question, we get: Number of grams of carrots = 2000 / 250 x 5 = 80 grams Therefore, you can eat up to 80 grams of carrots per day based on the information provided.
Response:  If he sells each candle for $2, and he makes 20 candles, then his total revenue is: 20 x $2 = $40. Now, let's calculate his profit: Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40 - ($10 x 20) = $40 - $200 = -$160. So, his net profit is $-160.
Response:  We know that last week she wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2 more than on Tuesday, so she wrote 7 articles in total on those two days. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as on Tuesday, which means she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles last week is:  Total hours = Number of articles written on Monday + Number of articles written on Tuesday + Number of articles written on Wednesday = 7 + 14 + x = 28 hours Where x is the number of articles written on Thursday. Since we are told that she writes an article every day, we can conclude that x = 3, meaning she spent 28 + 3 = 31 hours writing articles last week.
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 tickets in her purse before she left for work at the coffee shop. Then, she stopped at the store and bought a pack of Post-it notes with x number of stickers. At work, she put one sticker on each of the 220 cups of coffee. So, if she had more than 23 Post-it notes in her pack, we can deduce that the number of stickers in the pack is equal to 220 - 23 = 197. Therefore, there were 197 stickers in the pack that Candice bought.
Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red ties as blue ones. So he bought $2 \times 2 = 4$ blue ties and $2 \times 3 = 6$ red ties. The price of each red tie is $50\%$ more than the price of each blue tie, so the price of each red tie is $\frac{1 + 0.5}{2} = 75\%$ more than the price of each blue tie. Therefore, the total cost of the blue ties is $\boxed{\$4 \times 40 = \$160}$, and the total cost of the red ties is $\boxed{\$6 \times (75\%) = \$45}$. So, in total, John spent $\boxed{\$160 + \$45 = \$205}$ on ties.
"Response:  We know that Tracy has used a meter and a half of twine to support the rose plantations in the garden. The twine was cut into pieces of 15 cm each. To find out how many pieces of twine Tracy obtained, we can divide the length of the twine (meter and a half) by the length of each piece (15 cm):

Number of pieces = Length of twine / Length of each piece
= 1.5 m / 0.15 m
= 10 pieces
Therefore, Tracy obtained 10 pieces of twine."
Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units. So, the total number of units in the building is: 15 x 8 = 120 units. Now, we are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that 3/4 of 120 = 90 units are occupied. Therefore, the number of free units in the building is: 120 - 90 = 30 units.
Response:  If Lloyd produces 252 eggs per day and sells them for $2 per dozen, then he makes $2 x 252 = $504 per day from egg sales alone. Since there are 7 days in a week, Lloyd makes $504 x 7 = $3,530 per week from egg sales.
Response:  We know that Tom can travel at a rate of 10 miles per hour and he starts his journey from 1 to 4 pm. So, in total, he will have traveled for 5 hours (from 1 to 4 pm). Now, we need to find out how far he has traveled during these 5 hours. To do this, we multiply the distance he can travel per hour by the number of hours he has traveled: Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 5 hours = 50 miles. Now, we are given that after traveling for 5 hours, he turns back with a speed of 6 km/h. To find out how long it takes him to return, we need to divide the distance he needs to cover by his speed: Time = Distance / Speed = 50 miles / 6 km/h = 8.33 hours. Therefore, it will take Tom approximately 8.33 hours to return.
Response:  If Uriah has to reduce his bag of comics by 5 kg and each comic book weighs 1/4 kg, then he needs to remove 5 x 4 = 20 comic books. Similarly, if each toy weighs 1/2 kg, then he needs to remove 20 / 2 = 10 toys. Therefore, if he removes 30 comic books and 10 toys, he will have reduced his bag by 5 kg.
Response:  On Wednesday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires for trucks and 4 tires for cars, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 + $4 x 4 = $16 = $52 in total.  On Thursday, the mechanic did not repair any tires for trucks but repaired 12 tires for cars, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480. Therefore, the difference between the two days is $480 - $52 = $428.
Response:  When Mrs. Doubtfire returned home with 7 adopted kittens from the local animal shelter, she was informed that their two household cats had only produced 2 kittens each. Therefore, the total number of kittens in the Doubtfire family is: 3 x 3 = 9 + 12 = 21 kittens.

Response:  If he spends $7 for the ticket and $7 for the popcorn, then his total cost is $14. So if he has $42 in his pocket, he can go to the movies $\boxed{5}$ times.
Response:  We know that the maximum weight of the wooden bridge is 5000 pounds (or 2268 kg). A box weighing 15 pounds (or 6.8 kg) costs £15. Therefore, if we have n boxes, their total weight will be: W = n x 15 pounds/box = n x 6.8 kg. Since the driver and the truck are worth 3755 pounds (or 1699 kg), we can subtract this amount from the total weight to find out how many boxes can fit on the truck without overloading the bridge: W - D = n x 6.8 kg - 3755 pounds = n x 6.8 kg - 1699 kg = n / 2.4 kg. So, the number of boxes that can fit on the truck without overloading the bridge is: n / 2.4 kg = 20 boxes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his groceries online. Then, there was an additional 25% charge added to the total amount, which is equal to $10 (since 25% of $40 is $10). So, the new total cost became $50 ($40 + $10). Next, they charged him $3 for delivery fees, making the total cost even higher at $53 ($50 + $3). Finally, he added a tip of $4, bringing the total cost to $57 ($53 + $4). Therefore, the final price of the groceries for Stephen was $57.
"Response:  We have:

* 6 groups of 20 fruits each = 120 fruits in total (grouped)
* + 67 individual fruits = 67 additional fruits

So, in total, we have 187 fruits."
Response:  We have 25 portocales in total and we know that: * 1 is bad (rejected) * 20% are immature (not good to eat yet) So, there are 25 - 1 = 24 portocales left. * 2 are sour (acidic) * Rest are good (beneath). Now let's calculate how many good portocales are left: Total number of good portocales = Number of portocales left after rejecting the bad one + Number of portocales left after rejecting the immature ones Good portocales = Total number of good portocales / Total number of portocales = 24 / 25 = 96% or 9/10 Good portocales are left. Therefore, 9/10 of the portocales are good.
Response:  Firstly, she paid $500 for materials to make the brooch. Then, she paid an additional $800 for the jewelry making process. Finally, she paid 10% of that amount which is $80 (since 10% of $800 is $80). So in total, she paid $660 ($500 + $800 - $80)
Response:  If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and receives a yearly pension of $50,000 per year starting from age 60, then her annual pension at age 70 would be:  Pensioana sa anuala la vârsta de 70 de ani este de $50,000 x (1 + 5%) ^ 30 = $87,500. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of working would be $87,500.
Response:  First half of year (January to June): Initial payment = $140 x 6 months = $840 Total first half payment = $840 Second half of year (July to December): Discounted price = $140 x 6 months = $840 Total second half payment = $840 + $840 = $1680 Total annual payment = $840 + $1680 = $2520 Therefore, the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service until the end of the year is $2520.
Response:  We know that Sophia has traveled 160 kilometers since she last filled her tank and had to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill it. The manual for her car states that its fuel tank holds 12 gallons of gasoline. To find out how far Sophia can drive on one tank of gas, we need to divide the distance she has traveled (160 km) by the amount of gasoline left in her tank (12 gallons): Distance = 160 km / 12 gal = x miles Where x is the number of miles Sophia can drive on one tank of gas. Since x is a whole number, we can simplify the equation as follows: x = 133 miles Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, Sophia can drive approximately 133 miles on one tank of gas.
Response:  Firstly, Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to take a nap and read for half an hour. This happens three times a week. So, in one week, he will spend 2 x 3 = 6 hours watching TV and reading. In four weeks, he will spend 6 x 4 = 24 hours watching TV and reading.
Response:  There are four schools competing in the basketball tournament. Each school has sent one girls' team and one boys' team, with each team consisting of 5 players. Therefore, there are 20 players (10 from the girls' teams and 10 from the boys' teams) who have been sent by all the schools. Additionally, each school has also sent one coach for each team, so there are 4 coaches in total. Thus, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 20 + 4 = 24.
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies in total. Since there are more smaralds than rubies, we can say that the number of smaralds is greater than 35. So, the total number of pietres precioase in the chest is: 175 + (greater than 35) = 209. Therefore, there are 209 pietre precioase in the chest.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls at school Dr. Wertz. So if there are x girls, there are 2x boys. If there are 60 girls and 5 students per teacher, then there must be 60/5 = 12 teachers. Therefore, there are 2 \* 12 = 24 professors at school Dr. Wertz.
Response:  Bailey started with $X dollars and received weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, if he has a total of $100, then we can write the equation: X + (5 x 8) = 100. Solving for X, we get: X = 75. So Bailey started with $75.
Response:  If Judy teaches 5 classes per day and each class has 15 students, then she teaches a total of 75 students (5 x 15 = 75) in one week if she teaches every day of the week. And if she earns $15 per student, then her total income for one week is $1125 ($75 x $15).
"Response:  We know that there are two recipes for making food, one with 20 instructions and another with twice as many instructions as the first. So we need to find out how many instructions Kelian needs to read in total to prepare both dishes.
Let's start with the second recipe, which has twice as many instructions as the first. Therefore, if there were x instructions in the first recipe, there would be 2x instructions in the second recipe.
So, the total number of instructions Kelian needs to read is x + (2x) = 3x.
Now, let's move on to the first recipe. Since it has 20 instructions, we can say that Kelian needs to read 20 instructions to make this dish.
Therefore, the total number of instructions Kelian needs to read to prepare both dishes is 3x + 20 = 3(2x) + 20.
Solving for x, we get x = 6. So, Kelian needs to read 6 instructions to prepare the first dish and 12 instructions to prepare the second dish."
Response:  If Tommy sells 43 brownies and each brownie costs $3, then he will make $3 x 43 = $132 from selling brownies alone. Similarly, if he sells 23 cheesecakes and each cheesecake costs $4, then he will make $4 x 23 = $92 from selling cheesecakes. Therefore, in total, Tommy will make $132 + $92 = $224.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Sheila paid for each phone. Since she bought five phones and the price per phone is $150, then the total cost of all phones is:  $150 x 5 = $750. Now, let's find out how much Sheila will pay in each month for three months:  Total amount paid = Cost of phones + Dobroş + Taxes = $750 + (2% of $750) + (State tax rate of 8%) So, if the state tax rate is 8%, then the total amount paid by Sheila in each month would be: $750 + ($750 x 2%) + (8% of $750) = $750 + $150 + $60 = $960 per month. Therefore, Sheila will pay $960 per month for three months.
"Response:  If we take into account that Artie does not have any transactions today and he wants to round up all his prices to the nearest dollar, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Calendula flowers. Since Artie sells 12 ghivece (gallons) of Calendula for $2.74 each, the total cost is:

$2.74 x 12 = $32.96

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of Petunia flowers. Since Artie sells 9 ghivece (gallons) of Petunia for $1.87 each, the total cost is:

$1.87 x 9 = $16.53

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of Begonia flowers. Since Artie sells 17 ghivece (gallons) of Begonia for $2.12 each, the total cost is:

$2.12 x 17 = $35.04

Step 4: Add the costs of all three types of flowers together to get the total revenue:

Total Revenue = $32.96 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $88.53

Therefore, if Artie sells 12 ghivece of Calendula, 9 ghivece of Petunia, and 17 ghivece of Begonia, he will make a total of $88.53 in revenue."
Response:  If Luke builds a sandcastle with 4 levels and each level has half the area of the previous level, then we can write an equation to represent this relationship: Level i has an area of Ai = (1/2)^(i-1) \* Area(level 0), where level 0 is the base or foundation of the castle. Now, if the top level has an area of 16 square meters, we know that the bottom level must have an area of at least 16 / (1/2)^3 = 8 square meters. So, the median area of a single level in the sandcastle is 8 square meters.
Response:  First year (first 180 days):  The doctor said that Cecilia must feed her puppy with a bowl of dog food every day for the first 180 days. So, in the first year, she will need: 180 x 365 = 64,700 ceşti of dog food.  Second year (remaining life): After the first year, the doctor recommended giving the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day until it dies. Since we don't know how long the puppy will live, let's assume it lives for another 5 years (which is a reasonable estimate). Therefore, in the second year, Cecilia will need: 5 x 365 = 1,825 cups of dog food. In total, Cecilia will need: 64,700 + 1,825 = 66,525 ceşti of dog food over two years.
"Response:  We know that:
Raymond spends half as much time as Sarah does (so he spends 1/2 x 400 = 200 £).
Sarah spends 4 times more than David (so she spends 4 x 400 = 1600 £).
Therefore, the difference between the amount of money spent by Raymond and David is:
Raymond - David = 200 - 160 = 40 £."
Response:  If Vince buys flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or packages of 2 for $1, he will save money if he buys 18 flowers at a better price. So we need to find out how much cheaper it is to buy 18 flowers than to buy them individually. To do this, we can divide the cost of buying 18 flowers (whatever that may be) by the cost of buying one flower individually. For example, if buying 18 flowers costs $4.50 and buying one flower costs $2.50, then buying 18 flowers saves $2 ($4.50 - $2.50). Therefore, the answer is $2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John adopted a dog and took it to the groomer who charged $100. Then, the owner offered a discount of 30% for being a new customer. So, we need to calculate how much the grooming would cost after applying the discount. We can do this by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage: $100 x 30% = $30. Therefore, the total cost of grooming would be $100 - $30 = $70.
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water each, so together they received 2 x 1/6 = 3 liters of water. Then, the boy received 6 liters of water, leaving 3 + 6 = 9 liters of water remaining.

Response:  We know that Grace weighs 45 kg and Alex weighs less than her by 1.5 kg. So, if we subtract 1.5 kg from 45 kg, we get... (do the calculation)...which equals 43.5 kg! Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 43.5 kg.
Response:  We know that there are three tuffles of roses and each tuffle has 25 roses. So, in total, we have 3 x 25 = 75 roses. Now, each rose has 8 spines, so the total number of spines is 75 x 8 = 600 spines. Therefore, the answer is 600 spines.
Response:  We know that the team played 22 matches and won 8 more than they lost. So, we can write an equation as follows: Won = Lost + X Where X is the number of wins. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Won = 22 - 14 + X = 8 Solving for X, we find that the team won 4 matches. Therefore, the answer to the question is 4.
"Response: 
Gene has been going on vacation for 14 years (4 x 3 = 12). Each year she makes a new scarf using yarn from each previous vacation. Therefore, she has 12 scarves in total. Since each scarf is made of blocks from one year, and there are 12 scarves, then each block represents one year of vacations. So, Gene has 12 x 1 = 12 blocks of yarn from her vacations."
Response:  First time it sounded = 4 times Second time it sounded = 3x + 1 = 9 Third time it sounded = (2/3) x 9 = 6 So, the alarm sounded 4 times the first time, 9 times the second time and 6 times the third time.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each employee is paid $600 per month. Then, after three years of service, the company will give a raise of 10% of the initial salary to those who have remained in the company for at least five years. So, if Sylvie has been working for the company for five years as of December, her annual salary after three years of service would be calculated as follows: Annual Salary = Monthly Salary x Number of Years of Service + (Initial Salary x Percentage Increase) Initial Salary = $600 x 3 = $1800 Percentage Increase = 10% of $1800 = $180 Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three years of service is $1980 ($1800 + $180).
"Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more albums than Harald. So if Marilyn sold 88,000 albums, then Harald sold:

$$ \therefore Harald = \frac{88,000}{10} = 8,800 $$

Therefore, Harald sold 8,800 albums."
Response:  We know that Christina has invited 16 friends to her party and she needs 75 gifts for each of them (since not all guests will come). So, in total, she needs 16 x 75 = 1200 gifts. Since each gift costs $2, then the total cost of gifts is 1200 x $2 = $2400.
Response:  Adults will eat 10 kg of salad per person and children will eat half that amount (5 kg). So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, the total amount of salad needed is: 20 x 10 = 200 kg + 5 x 5 = 25 kg = 225 kg. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 kg of salad to the picnic.
"Response:  We know that:
Marcia has more than two pets.
Cindy has four pets.
Jan has three pets.
So, we can conclude that:
Marcia has x pets.
Cindy has y pets, where y > x.
Jan has z pets, where z < x + y.
Now, let's substitute these values in the equation:
x + (y - x) = 3(z - (x + y))
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 2
Therefore, Marcia has 2 pets."
Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write: Age of Amy = 5 + (Age of Jackson - 2) = 5 + x Where x is the age of Jackson. Now, we know that James is one year younger than Corey, so we can write: Age of James = Age of Corey - 1 = x + 1 Therefore, the age of Jackson is 7 years old.
Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters with hurdles in 38 seconds, and he improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet, then we know that his new running time is 352 seconds (400 x 0.9 = 352). Now, if Gerald wants to find out how many seconds it would take him to run 400 meters with hurdles at his improved speed, we need to divide his old running time by 1.1 (the percentage increase in Gerald's speed): 352 / 1.1 = 318 seconds. Therefore, Gerald could run 400 meters with hurdles in approximately 318 seconds.
Response:  We know that there are fewer dogs than cats and birds in the neighborhood. So, if there are x dogs, then there are (x + 12) cats and (x + 12) birds. Since there are two birds for every dog, we can write: x = 60 / (2 \* 12) = 30. Therefore, there are 30 dogs, 96 cats, and 96 birds in the neighborhood.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in class 5, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in kindergarten. To find out how many girls are not in kindergarten, we can multiply the number of girls in kindergarten by the fraction of girls who are not in kindergarten. So, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night and his friend James slept for less than him. So, we can write an equation: 9 - x = 7 (where x is the number of hours that James slept) Now, we are told that James slept for 2/3 of the time that Harry did. This means that James slept for 2/3 × 9 = 6 hours. Substituting this value into our original equation, we get: 9 - 6 = 3 So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.
Response:  We know that each can of preserved red peppers contains three red peppers and that the last batch of sauce made by Freda contained 32 ounces (uncia). So we can set up the following equation: Number of red peppers = Volume of sauce / Volume per can. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Number of red peppers = 32 ounces / 12 ounces/can = 2.67 cans. Since you cannot have a fraction of a can, we round this value to 2 cans. Therefore, Freda used 2 cans of red peppers to make her last batch of sauce.
Response:  At first, there were 30 cars on the highway. In the first 15 minutes of the blockage, some cars passed through the blockage and 5 cars took an exit to avoid passing through the blockage. So, after 15 minutes, there are 30 - 5 = 25 cars left on the highway. Then, in the next 15 minutes, another 20 cars pass through the blockage. Therefore, after 30 minutes (15 + 15), there are 25 + 20 = 45 cars on the highway.
Response:  Mary already has two plants in each of the 40 windowsills in her large country house. She wants to give one plant away to each friend and family member she meets tomorrow. So, if she gives one plant away for every person she meets, how many plants will she have left after giving them all away?  We can calculate this as follows:  Number of plants Mary has = Total number of plants (18) - Number of plants she will give away (x), where x is the number of people she meets tomorrow.  Since Mary wants to give one plant away to each person she meets, we can set up an equation like this:  Number of plants Mary has = 18 - x, where x is the number of people she meets tomorrow.  Now, let's solve for x. If Mary meets 5 people tomorrow, then the number of plants she will have left is:  Number of plants Mary has = 18 - 5 = 13.  Therefore, Mary will have 13 plants left after giving them all away.
Response:  We know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, the total number of presses made by all four friends is:  First friend - 20 Second friend - x Third friend - y Fourth friend - 60 Total = 20 + x + y + 60 Where x and y are some numbers that we need to find out. Now, we know that the second friend pressed the button more than the first friend, so x > 0. Also, we know that the third friend pressed the button less than the fourth friend, so y < 60. Therefore, we can write: x > 0 and y < 60 Substituting these values in the equation above, we get: 20 + x + y + 60 = 120 Solving for x and y, we get: x = 30 y = 30 So, the total number of presses made by all four friends is 20 + 30 + 30 + 60 = 150.
Response:  If he has already read 15 pages in one day, then if he wants to finish reading all of them within 4 days, he will have to read an average of 37.5 pages per day (15 pages / 4 days).
Response:  John drinks water at breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, so he drinks 3 x 3 = 9 glasses of water per day. In addition, he also drinks one more glass before going to bed on weekends, making it 10 glasses of water per week. Therefore, John drinks 10 glasses of water per week.
Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover each of the 3 miles from the shore to the opposite side of the city. So, if we divide the distance between the shore and the opposite side of the city (which is 42 miles) by 3, we get: Time = Distance / Speed = 42 miles / 10 min/mile = 4.2 hours Therefore, it will take approximately 4.2 hours for the iceberg to completely cover the entire city.
Response:  If Poppy has solved 25% of the puzzle (which is equal to 25/100), then she has placed 25 pieces on the board.  Now, her mother places another third of the remaining pieces, which means she places 33 more pieces (since there are 75 - 25 = 50 pieces left). So, in total, Poppy and her mother have placed 58 pieces (25 + 33) on the board. Therefore, there are 42 pieces (100 - 58) left to solve the puzzle.
"Response:  If Cody eats three times more than Amir, that means Amir eats x pralines. Since Amir eats 5 pralines in total, we can set up the equation:
Cody eats 3x pralines = 5 (total number of pralines)
Solving for x, we get:
3x = 5
x = 1
So, Amir eats 1 praline and Cody eats 3 times as many, which is 3 \* 1 = 3 pralines. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  First, we need to find out the volume of each box separately. The dimensions given in the question are: Length = 5 inches, Width = 6 inches, Height = 4 inches, and Thickness = 1 cm. To calculate the volume of each box, we can use the formula: Volume = Length x Width x Height. So, for the first box: Volume = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches (since there are 1728 cubic inches in a cubic foot). For the second box: Volume = 6 x 6 x 4 = 1440 cubic inches. And for the third box: Volume = 5 x 4 x 4 = 800 cubic inches. Now, we add up the volumes of all three boxes to get the total volume: Total Volume = 120 + 1440 + 800 = 2560 cubic inches. Since there are 28.3 cubic feet in a cubic inch, we can convert this volume to cubic feet as follows: Total Volume (in cubic feet) = 2560 / 28.3 = approximately 90.3 cubic feet. Therefore, the total volume of the 3 boxes is approximately 90.3 cubic feet.
Response:  We know that Frankie watched TV for 7 hours in total. On Monday and Wednesday, he watched an hour-long show each night. Therefore, he watched a total of 2 hours (1 x 2 = 2) of hour-long shows. On Thursday, he watched a 30-minute show followed by another hour-long show, so he watched a total of 3 hours (1 x 30 + 1 x 60 = 3). Finally, on Friday, he watched two hour-long shows, so he watched a total of 4 hours (2 x 60 = 4) of hour-long shows. Thus, if we add up all the time Frankie spent watching TV on these days, we get:  Total time spent watching TV = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 hours.
Response:  Last year, Henry wanted to make twice as many pastries as he did the previous year. So, if he made x pastries last year, he wants to make 2x this year. When he finishes baking, he realizes that he has made 15 more pastries than he intended. This means that he actually made (2x + 15) pastries. Since he threw away 5 pastries while taking them out of the oven, he now has a total of 110 pastries. Therefore, the number of pastries Henry made last year is equal to 110 - 5 = 105.
Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at $3 per gallon, they will pay $30 for the gasoline itself (10 x $3 = $30). Now, if we consider the $20 cashback offered by the company, it means that the total cost to the customer will be reduced by $20, resulting in a net cost of $10 ($30 - $20 = $10) for the gasoline. So, after applying the cashback, the person will have paid $10 for 10 gallons of gasoline.
Response:  We know that Beatrice had 24 rulouri in length and 3 rulouri in width, so her total surface area is: 24 x 3 = 72 square rulouri. Similarly, we know that Marcell had 14 rulouri in length and 2 rulouri in width, so his total surface area is: 14 x 2 = 28 square rulouri. Now, let's find out how much fruit each of them could eat: Beatrice can eat 72 / 2 = 36 square rulouri of fruit, while Marcell can eat 28 / 2 = 14 square rulouri of fruit. So, if they both ate all the fruit they could, Beatrice would eat 36/2 = 18 square rulouri more than Marcell.
Response:  We know that: * The distance between the two points is 20 meters (given). * Julia took 16 seconds to cover this distance (given). * The boat takes 2 liters of water for every 10 meters it moves backward (given). To find out how much water the boat took in total, we can use the formula: Water taken = Distance x Speed / Boat's speed. Substituting the given values, we get: Water taken = 20 m x 16 s / 2 L/10 m = 80 liters In conclusion, the boat took 80 liters of water until Julia reached the shore.
"Response:  If the table is cleaned 3 times per hour, and there are 4 periods (lessons) in a day, then we can calculate how many times the table will be cleaned in a day as follows:

1. First period (morning): 4 professors x 2 lessons = 8 uses of the table
2. Second period (noon): 8 - 3 = 5 uses of the table
3. Third period (afternoon): 5 - 3 = 2 uses of the table
4. Fourth period (evening): 2 - 3 = 0 uses of the table (since it has already been cleaned 3 times that hour)

Therefore, the table will be cleaned 8 + 5 + 2 + 0 = 15 times in a day."
Response:  After 15 days, if Ryan has placed 2 flowers per day in his garden, then he will have a total of 30 flowers (2 x 15 = 30). If 5 of them did not grow, then the remaining 25 flowers will be left (30 - 5 = 25). Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan will have 25 flowers in his garden.
"Response:  We know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 5 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's picture with birds from the zoo. So if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, then the number of birds in his picture with birds from the zoo is:

$$ \frac{1800}{5} = 360 $$

So there are 360 birds in Jamal's picture with birds from the zoo."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has 15 pieces of wood (10 + 5). Each piece costs her $10 and $16 respectively. So, she spent in total $150 on all the wood ($10 x 10 + $16 x 5 = $150). Now, let's find out how much she sold each piece for. She sold 10 pieces at $10 each, so she made $100 from those pieces ($10 x 10 = $100). And she sold 5 pieces at $16 each, so she made $80 from those pieces ($16 x 5 = $80). Therefore, her total profit is $180 ($100 + $80 = $180).

Response:  We know that John bought 3 pairs of shoes for his three children. So, he paid $3 x 2 = 60 dollars for all the shoes together. Therefore, John paid $60 for the shoes.
Response:  On day one, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles was 10 (2 x 5).  If more containers arrived on the second day, then the total number of vehicles in the port would have increased to 30. So, the number of containers imported on the second day is:  30 - 10 = 20 new containers.
Response:  We know that Adrian's salary was $80,000 four years ago and it increased by 30%. So his current salary is: $$ \boxed{A = 80000 + (30\%) = 104000} $$ Now we need to find out how much money Lylah made four years ago. According to the problem, her salary was $60,000 less than Adrian's. Therefore, her salary four years ago was: $$ \boxed{L = A - (60\%) = 104000 - (60\%) = 67200} $$ Four years later, both of their salaries have increased. Let's assume that Adrian's new salary is $120,000 and Lylah's new salary is $95,000. The increase in Adrian's salary is 40%, so he gained $48,000 ($120,000 x 40%). Similarly, the increase in Lylah's salary is also 40%, which means she gained $38,000 ($95,000 x 40%). Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money they earned together over these four years: $$ \boxed{\text {Total income}} = \text {Adrian's income} + \text {Lylah's income} = 120000 + 95000 = 215000 } $$
Response:  If Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week for drawing, then he will use 2 x 4 = 8 sheets of paper in one month (30 days). Therefore, he will use 8 / 30 = 1/4 sheet of paper per day.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 more and 8 more than Kael. So, in total, Morisette brought 13 (5 + 8) fruits.
Response:  In one day, Sadie sleeps for 8 hours.  If she has two days off from work, then in those two days she will sleep for 2 hours less than usual, since she needs to finish some tasks. So, in those two days she sleeps for 6 hours each (8 - 2 = 6).  Now, let's calculate how many hours she sleeps in total during the week:  Total hours of sleep = Number of days x Hours of sleep per day + Number of days with reduced sleep x Reduced hours of sleep per day  Total hours of sleep = 7 x 8 + 2 x 6  Total hours of sleep = 56 + 12 = 68 hours  Therefore, Sadie sleeps for 68 hours in total throughout the week.
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles in one hour, then she can run 30 miles (10 x 3) in three hours. After that, if she runs 5 miles per hour for another four hours, she will have covered a total distance of 20 miles (5 x 4). Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles (30 + 20) in seven hours.
Response:  When Jennie started helping her mother, there were 60 letters that needed stamps and another 30 already stamped. So, in total, there were 90 letters (60 + 30).
Response:  Julia had 3 linguries left after she used them for tasting the tocanà. Then her husband bought her another pack of 5 linguries. So in total, Julia had 8 linguries (3 + 5).
Response:  We know that Dylan bought more than 38 chicken crackers and fewer than 44 chicken crackers. So, if we subtract 38 from the total number of crackers he bought, we get: Total number of crackers = x Number of chicken crackers = 38 - x Now, we are also given that Dylan bought fewer than 44 chicken crackers. Therefore, the maximum value of x is 44. So, the total number of crackers Dylan bought is between 38 and 44 inclusive. Thus, the answer is (38, 44].
Response:  If Amy made 20 new friends after transferring to a new school and Lily made 50 friends in total, then we can say that Lily has x number of friends more than Amy. So, if Amy has y friends, then Lily has x + y friends. Therefore, the answer is (x + y).
Response:  We know that one pepene costs $15, and we also know that one piper costs $15/3 = $5. So, if Dillon wants to buy 4 pepene, he will have to pay $4 \times 4 = $16 for them. Similarly, if he wants to buy 20 ardei, he will have to pay $20 \times 2 = $40 for them. And finally, if he wants to buy 10 portocale, he will have to pay $10 \times 1 = $10 for them. Therefore, the total amount that Dillon will have to pay is $16 + $40 + $10 = $66.
Response:  The total number of patients seen per day is 500. Since each patient takes an average of 24 minutes to be seen, the total time taken for all patients = Total number of patients x Average time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Now, we need to calculate how much money the hospital makes from these visits. For this, we will use the formula given in the question: Hospital profit = Number of patients seen x Price charged per patient + Time spent on each patient x Price charged per hour. Substituting values, we get: Profit = (500 x 150) + (12,000 x 200) = $75,000 + $240,000 = $315,000 So, the profit made by the hospital is $315,000 per day.
Response:  First, 60 elves are hired to play with children in Santa's village. Then, one third of them (20) quit after the children throw up on them. Next, 10 more elves quit after the children hit their shins. So, there are 50 elves left.
Response:  In May, Joe spent $500.  In June, he spent $440 less than in May, so he spent $500 - $44 = $456 in June. Therefore, the total cost for those two months is $500 + $456 = $956.
Response:  Pam went on the roller coaster twice and then decided to go on the log ride twice as well. Therefore, she used 2 + 2 = 4 billets in total. Similarly, Fred went on the roller coaster four times and then decided to go on the log ride twice, so he used 4 + 2 = 6 billets in total.
"Response:  We know that:
Lunedi - 6 km
Martii - 6 times more than luned (so 6 x 6 = 36 km)
Total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles
So we can write:
Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday = Total distance traveled
= 6 km + 36 km + 6 km
= 58 km
Therefore, Walt walked 58 kilometers during those three days."
"Response:  If there are 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then...

Answer: The total number of dollars spent on car washes in a year is 4 x 12 = 48. So, the car washer will spend $48 in a year."
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 games and he lost 5 before making the comparison with Bobby. So, Brian has 15 games left (20 - 5 = 15). Now, we need to find out how many games Bobby has. According to the question, Bobby has 5 times fewer games than Brian, which means he has 5/5 = 1 game. Therefore, Bobby has 1 game.
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in total and two-thirds of them are from Scotland (which means 19 unicorns). Since three-quarters of female unicorns are in Scotland (which means 15 females), we can conclude that there are 15 females among the 19 Scottish unicorns. Therefore, there are 15 + 4 = 19 female unicorns in total.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately:
Supe - 2 x 7,50 = 15,00$
Chipsuri - 2 x 1,50 = 3,00$
Prăjituri - 2 x 1,00 = 2,00$
Total cost for items = 15,00 + 3,00 + 2,00 = 20,00$
Now, let's add the delivery charge which is 20% of total cost:
Delivery charge = 20% x 20,00 = 4,00$
So, the final cost of the order including delivery charge will be:
Final cost = Total cost for items + Delivery charge = 20,00 + 4,00 = 24,00$"
"Response:  If Mark completed 75 questions in 1 hour (which is equal to 75/1 = 75 minutes), then he completed 75 x 2 = 150 minutes in total for both tests. Since he had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second test, we can calculate the number of minutes left over as follows:

For the first test: 8 hours - 150 minutes = 450 minutes
For the second test: 6 hours - 150 minutes = 350 minutes
Therefore, Mark left 450 + 350 = 800 minutes worth of questions incomplete."
Response:  We know that there are 22 biles of gum in total and they are either red or blue. If there are x red balls, then there are 4x blue balls. Since there are 12 blue balls, we can set up the equation: 22 = 4x + 12. Solving for x, we get: x = 5. So, there are 5 red balls.
Response:  We have 20 cars available for rent and we know that 12 of them are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remaining 4 are semi-automatic. So, to find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we can use the formula: (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) x 100%. Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: (4/20) x 100% = 20%. Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.
Response:  We know that there are more worker bees than queen bees and more queens than larvae. So, if we have 700 bees in the hive, let's assume that half of them are workers (350) and half are drones (350). Now, since there are twice as many worker bees as queen bees, we can say that there are 350 x 2 = 700 queen bees. Finally, since there are twice as many pups as queen bees, there are 700 x 2 = 1400 larvae in the hive. Therefore, the number of worker bees is 350.
"Response:  If Jordan spends two hours playing video games per day and earns $10 per hour at his job, he would make:

2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week spent gaming
$10/hour x 14 hours/week = $140/week earned from gaming

So, in one week, Jordan would earn $140 from gaming."
"Response:  First, let's calculate how much money John spent on each item:
Lapte - $2 x 2 = $4
Ouă - $3 x 3 = $9
Becuri - $3 x 3 = $9
Pahare - $3 x 3 = $9
Carcane pentru gândaci - $4 x 4 = $16
Total amount of money spent by John = $4 + $9 + $9 + $9 + $16 = $56
Now, let's find out what percentage of the total amount is the tax:
Tax rate = Total amount of money spent by John / $56 x 100 = 18%
So, the tax amount = $56 x 18% = $9.72"
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 8 clients in total (3 existing and 5 potential). Secondly, each client needs 2 bottles of decolorant and one package of cleaning supplies. Thirdly, each bottle of decolorant costs $2, and each package of cleaning supplies costs $5. Fourthly, Lucas calculates his total weekly income to be $92. Finally, to find out how much profit he will make per week, we need to subtract his total expenses from his total income. Therefore, the profit made by Lucas per week is: $92 - ($2 x 8) = $92 - $16 = $76. So, Lucas makes a profit of $76 per week.
Response:  We know that there are 10 hectares of land used for growing pineapples and each hectare has 100 pineapple plants. So, in total, there are 1000 pineapple plants (10 x 100 = 1000). Since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, he will be able to harvest them 4 times in one year (4 x 3 = 12). Therefore, John can collect 4000 pineapples in one year (1000 x 4 = 4000).
"Response:  If we assume that each set of Legos has 500 pieces, then the total number of pieces in all three sets is:

Set 1: 500 pieces
Set 2: 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces
Set 3: 1/4 x 1500 = 375 pieces

So, altogether, Johnny has picked up 2375 pieces of Legos (500 + 1500 + 375). Therefore, he has raised 2375 blocks if he has picked up all the Legos."
"Response:  We know that:

* In the first 6 hours of the day, Debra saw 30 bees leaving the hive (assuming there are no bees returning to the hive during this time).
* After the first 6 hours, half of the remaining bees left the hive and did not return within the next 6 hours (this is based on the fact that each time Debra observed more bees leaving than returned).
* Each bee that left before Debra started observing had a 50% chance of returning to the hive within the next 6 hours.

Now we need to calculate how many bees Debra would have seen returning to the hive over the last 6 hours of the day. Since she saw twice as many bees leave as returned, if x bees left the hive during the last 6 hours, then 2x bees returned. Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw returning to the hive over the last 6 hours was 2x.

So, to summarize:

Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours + 2(half of the remaining bees) = 48 bees leave the hive over the entire day."
Response:  We know that the cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. So if Brittany's mother paid for two tickets, one for her and one for Brittany, then she paid a total of $12 + $10 = $22. If she received $8 in change, then she gave the cashier $22 - $8 = $14.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Charlie has more friends than Dorothy on Facebook. So, if Charlie has x friends on Facebook, then Dorothy has less than x friends.  Next, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, if Dorothy has y friends on Facebook, then James has 4y friends.  Finally, we know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so he must have at least 12 + (4y - x) friends in total. Since Charlie cannot have fewer than 0 friends, the minimum number of friends Charlie can have is 12 + (4y - x).  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  x = 3, y = 4, and z = 12. Solving for z, we find that James has 56 friends on Facebook.
Response:  First, we need to find out how long it takes for Steve to get home from school using his bike. We know that he lives 3 miles away and can ride at 440 feet per minute. Therefore, it will take him 3 miles / 440 feet/minute = 7 minutes to get home. Now, let's find out how long it will take Tim to get home from school using his skateboard. We know that he lives 3 kilometers away and can ride at 264 feet per minute. Therefore, it will take him 3 kilometers / 264 feet/minute = 11.5 minutes to get home. Since Steve gets home faster than Tim, Tim will lose the race. So, the answer is 7 - 11.5 = 4.5 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, in the first day, 5 people came to inflate both tires of their bicycles. So, the total cost for them is $125 (5 x $25).  Next, three people came to inflate all four tires of their tricycles. The total cost for them is $75 ($25 x 3). Finally, one person came on a unicycle and did not need any tire inflation, so they didn't pay anything. Therefore, the total amount earned that day is $200 ($125 + $75 - $0).
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of cookies and each package contains six cookies inside, then he will buy a total of 60 cookies (10 x 6 = 60). Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl will pay a total of $6 for all the cookies ($60 / 0.10 = 60). So, if he pays with a $10 bill, he will receive $4 in change ($10 - $6 = $4).
Response:  We know that Dave had 20 (not 14) potatoes before the bird stole them. Then, three pigeons took turns eating three potatoes each, leaving five potatoes remaining. Finally, a rat stole two thirds of the remaining potatoes, which is equal to 5/3 = 16/3 = 5 potatoes. Therefore, when Dave bought the package of potatoes, there were initially 20 - 5 = 15 potatoes in it.
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, Kimo has three hours of classes per day. Therefore, he spends 3 x 4 = 12 hours per week in class. In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, Kimo spends 12 hours/week x 16 weeks = 192 hours in class during a semester.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many meters of dough Bill has in total. We know that he makes 300 pieces of bread, each piece is 15 cm long, so the total length of all pieces is: 300 x 15 = 4500 cm. Next, we have to add the length of the croissants and muffins. For the croissants, there are 120 pieces, each one is 20 cm long, so the total length of all croissants is: 120 x 20 = 2400 cm. Finally, for the muffins, there are 60 pieces, each one is 1 meter long, so the total length of all muffins is: 60 x 1 = 60 cm. Therefore, the total length of all products made by Bill is: 4500 + 2400 + 60 = 7660 cm. Since Bill places everything end to end, the distance between two consecutive items will be equal to their length. So, if we divide the total length by the distance between two consecutive items (which is also the length of an item), we get: 7660 / 15 = 510 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Paznicul has to command all the bananas from the farm every two months. So, in one month he commands x bananas. Since there are three types of animals (maimutes, gorillas and baboons), each type needs a different number of bananas per month. We can write this as:

x = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700

Now, since Paznicul has to command these bananas for two months, he will need twice the amount of bananas:

x × 2 = 1400

So, Paznicul has to command 1400 bananas every two months to feed all the animals in the zoo."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Blake ran back and forth along the full length of the football field (100 meters) 15 times, which means he covered a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters.  Next, we learn that Kelly also ran back and forth once along the same distance, covering a distance of 100 meters. However, she then decided to run towards the end line (which is 40 yards away from the starting point), and then back again, doing this 34 times in total. So, how far did each runner go in total? For Blake, it was 1500 meters + 100 meters (for the last run) = 1600 meters. For Kelly, it was 100 meters + 34 x 40 yards = 1340 meters. Therefore, the winner (Kelly) went further than the loser (Blake) by a distance of 1340 - 1600 = -260 meters!
Response:  Raphael bought 4 stencils that cost $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on those ($1.5 x 4 = $6). He also bought 2 notebooks that cost $4 each, so he spent $8 on those ($4 x 2 = $8). Finally, he bought a margin of paper that cost $20. Therefore, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 on all the materials for school.
"Response:  We know that initially, Finn sees 11 ducks swimming in the pond. Then, he sees 6 of them emerging from hiding under a willow tree. Finally, he sees 2 more ducks hiding under a stone. Therefore, the total number of ducks that Finn can see in the pond now is:  Initially, there were 11 ducks; then, 6 more came out of hiding, making it 17 ducks; and finally, 2 more are hiding, bringing the total to 19 ducks. So, the answer is 19."
Response:  On Monday (marți), the water level was higher than usual, so we can say that the depth of the water in the reservoir was more than 17 feet.  On Wednesday (miercuri), the water level decreased to two-thirds of its original height, which means that the depth of the water in the reservoir became less than half of what it was on Monday. So, if the depth of the water in the reservoir on Monday was x feet, then the depth of the water on Wednesday would be 2/3x feet. Therefore, the depth of the water in the reservoir on Wednesday is 2/3 \* 17 = 11.33 feet.
"Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 stars of the sea, 6 fish of the sea more than Locsin and 3 clownfish more than Locsin. So, if we subtract the number of fish that Anakin caught from the total number of fish that both of them caught, we get:  
Total number of fish = Number of fish caught by Locsin + Number of fish caught by Anakin - Number of fish caught by Anakin
= 5 (stars) + 10 (fish) - 3 (peşti-clown)
= 18 fish
Therefore, Locsin caught 18 fish at the beach today."
Response:  After 12 months (3 lunii), the price of the bag will increase by 20%. So, the new price of the bag after 12 months is: $20 x 1.2 = $24. Then, after another 24 months (36 luneri), the price of the bag will increase again by 20%. So, the new price of the bag after 24 months is: $24 x 1.2 = $28. Therefore, after 36 months, the price of the bag will be: $28 x 1.2 = $33.60.  Thus, the answer to the question is $33.60.
Response:  We know that: * The penguin costs as much as 3 action figures. * A red machine costs $4. So, if we have x action figures and y machines, then the total value of all the toys is: Value = x \* 3 + y \* 4 =?... (1) Now, we are given that there are 5 red machines in the room. Therefore, we can substitute this value into equation (1): Value = 5 \* 3 + x \* 4 =?... (2) Substituting x = 3 from equation (1), we get: Value = 15 + 3x =?... (3) Now, we are also given that there are 3 figurines in the room. Therefore, we can substitute this value into equation (3): Value = 15 + 3(3) =?... (4) Simplifying equation (4), we get: Value = 15 + 9 = 24. So, the total value of all the toys in the room is $24.
Response:  If she does her own taxes, she will save $35 per hour in lost income (since she would work 3 hours less). So, if she works 40 hours at $25/hour, her total earnings for those 40 hours are: 40 x $25 = $1000. Now, let's calculate how much she would pay to the accountant: $90 + ($1000 x 0.07) = $63. So, if she hires an accountant, she will have $37 left over after paying the accountant.
Response:  Firstly, Elvira paid $1090 for the new laptop. Then she bought a scanner for $157, a CD-burner for $74, and an printer for $102, totaling $343. So far, Elvira has spent $1433. Now let's subtract the amount she had left from her budget of $1500: $1500 - $1433 = $67. Therefore, Elvira will have $67 left over for clothes.
"Response:  IfVecina Sandreia gives a basket of eggs to Sandra every time she takes care of her grandchildren (daughters), and for each flan Spanish sandra needs 3 eggs, then we can calculate how many times Sandra has to take care of her daughters as follows:

Number of eggs needed = Number of flans required x Number of eggs per flan
= 15 x 3
= 45

So, Sandra has to take care of her daughters 45 times in order to make 15 flans Spanish for the school fundraiser."
Response:  We know that Seth is two times older than Brooke. So, if Brooke is x years old, then Seth is 2x years old. In two years, their combined age will be 2(x + 2) = 48 years. Therefore, Seth is 20 years old (since he is twice as old as Brooke).
Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy is $2 more than Ethel, then Jimmy has...$8 + $2 = $10. So, Jimmy has $10.
Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho merges 30 kilometers per day. Since he walks 10 miles per day on weekends, we need to subtract that from his total daily distance traveled during the week. So, if he travels 30 km/day Monday through Friday, and then walks 10 mi/day on Saturday and Sunday, his total weekly distance traveled is: 30 km/day x 5 days = 150 km/week + 10 mi/day x 2 days = 20 mi/week = 170 miles/week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each hat costs $25. Then, we are told that each jacket costs three times more than the hat, so each jacket costs $25 x 3 = $75. Finally, we are given that each pair of pants costs half as much as the sum of the cost of the hat and the jacket, so each pair of pants costs ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50. Therefore, in total, each uniform costs $25 (for the hat), plus $75 (for the jacket), plus $50 (for the pants), for a grand total of $140 per uniform.
Response:  We know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so the total number of legs for these spiders is 8 x 80 = 640 legs. Then we have 90 insects with 6 legs each, giving us 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, we have 3 invertebrates with 10 legs each, which gives us 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs seen by Jake is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
"Response:  We know that:
Sally 1 = Bunica Roşie (the oldest)
Sally 2 = Sally 3 + 3 years (older than Sally 1)
Sally 3 = Sally 2 - 2 years (younger than Sally 2)
Sally 4 = Sally 3 + 8 years (younger than Sally 3)
Now we can use these equations to find the total age of all four birds:
Sally 1 = 80 years old (oldest bird)
Sally 2 = 83 years old (older than Sally 1 by 3 years)
Sally 3 = 75 years old (younger than Sally 2 by 2 years)
Sally 4 = 63 years old (younger than Sally 3 by 8 years)
Total age of all four birds = Sally 1 + Sally 2 + Sally 3 + Sally 4 = 80 + 83 + 75 + 63 = 391 years old"
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica pays for her minimum payments each month. For her student loans, she needs to pay at least $300 per month. For her credit card, it is $200 per month, and for her mortgage, it is $500 per month. Therefore, her total minimum payment each month is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000. Now, if Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum amount in one year, let's assume that she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum amount. So, she will have to pay $1000 x 1.5 = $1500 per month. In one year, she will have paid $1500 x 12 = $18,000.
"Response:  We know that Billy has to cut and chop 60 potatoes for his family gathering. Each potato takes him approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds (1 min 30 s) to chop. Therefore, it will take him:

Time taken by Billy to chop all 60 potatoes = Number of minutes he takes to chop one potato x Number of potatoes he has to chop
= 1 min 30 s x 60
= 75 minutes

So, it will take Billy 75 minutes to finish chopping all the potatoes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Juan and his brother Carlos sell lemonade for $3 per gallon (gal). Then, they charge $2 per gallon of sugar. Now, let's calculate how much money they make from each pitcher (pahar): They sell each pitcher for $0.50, so they make $0.50 x 20 = $10 per liter. Since they sold 25 dollars in profit, it means they spent $25 / 10 = $2.50 on lime juice. Therefore, they spent $2.50 on lime juice.
Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Asians (not including Japanese) is 240 - 80 = 160. Now, we know that 60 of these 160 are boys from China. Therefore, the number of girls from China is 160 - 60 = 100.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends one-fourth of his income on rent and another one-fourth on fuel for his car. So he has 1/4 x 6000 = 1500 left after these expenses. Then, he gives away half of this amount (1500 / 2 = 750) to charity. Therefore, Zaid is left with 1500 - 750 = 750 dollars after all his expenses and donations.
Response:  We know that: * Rani has 12 more crabs than Monica. So, if Monica has x crabs, Rani has x + 12 = 13x crabs. * Bo has 4 fewer crabs than Monica. So, if Monica has x crabs, Bo has x - 4 = x - 4 crabs. Now we can calculate the total number of crabs for all three together: Total = Monica’s crabs + Rani’s crabs + Bo’s crabs = x + (13x) + (x - 4) = 17x + 8 The answer is 17x + 8.
Response:  In the first week, Lloyd had 5 hours of tutoring and earned $10 per hour, so he earned $50.  In the second week, he had 8 hours of tutoring and also earned $10 per hour, so he earned an additional $80. Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $130 in the first two weeks.
"Response:  We know that there are 80 students in the class and they voted for their representative. If the winner received $3/4$ of the votes, then the number of votes he received is equal to $\frac{3}{4}$ times the total number of votes cast, which is $80$. So we can write:

$$\text{Number of votes } \times \frac{3}{4} = 80$$

Now, since the loser received $1 - \frac{3}{4}$ of the votes, we can write:

$$\text{Number of votes } \times (1 - \frac{3}{4}) = 80 - \frac{3}{4} \times 80$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$\boxed{\text{Number of votes } = 20}$$

Therefore, the number of votes received by the candidate who lost is $20$."
Response:  We know that Sandra ordered 4 times more red roses than white lilies and 200 more calla lilies than white ones. So, if she ordered x red roses, then she ordered 4x white lilies and 200 + x calla lilies. Since she is unhappy with the incomplete delivery, we need to find out how many red roses Fred should deliver until 5 PM to satisfy Sandra. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 4x = (200 + x) - x. Solving for x, we get: x = 160. So, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses until 5 PM to make Sandra happy.
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then 2 years ago, Mark was 5 + (30/2) = 10 years older than half of Jan's age. Therefore, Jean is currently 10 - 5 = 5 years older than Mark.
Response:  The faster team has four members who can run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds each. Therefore, their total time for one lap (4 x 55 = 220 seconds).  Now, let's consider the slower team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds to complete 400 meters, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner completes 400 meters in 57 seconds, the third runner in 54 seconds, and the fourth runner in 51 seconds. Since they have four members, their total time for one lap is also 4 x 51 = 204 seconds.  To find out how much time the faster team wins, we need to subtract the slower team's time from their own time: 220 - 204 = 16 seconds. Therefore, the faster team will win by 16 seconds.
"Response:  If Jerry throws six-faced dice and gets a 3 as his result, then he has thrown three numbers less than 6. So, the probability of him throwing more than 3 is:

Probability = (Number of ways to get more than 3) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
= (6 - 3) / 6
= 2/6
= 1/3
So, the probability that Jerry will throw a larger number than 3 is 1/3 or 33%."
Response:  Jenna has cules half of the apples her mother received from the farm. So if Jenna's mother received x apples, then Jenna has cules x/2 apples.  Since both Jenna and her mother have cules apples, we can write:  x + (x/2) = 20...(1) Now solve for x:  Subtracting x from both sides gives us:  (x/2) = 10...(2) Divide both sides by x to get: 2 = 10...(3) Therefore, there are 20 apples in total.
Response:  We know that there are 3 groups of hamsters and each group has 4 hamsters ( since we were given that there are 10 cups with hamsters). So, in total, there are 3 x 4 = 12 hamsters. Now, let's find out how many shrews are in each cup. Since we have 10 cups for shrews and each cup contains 6 shrews, then the total number of shrews is 10 x 6 = 60 shrews. Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of food distributed among all animals. For the hamsters, we have 12 x 5 = 60 pieces of food. For the shrews, we have 60 x 6 = 360 pieces of food. Finally, we subtract the number of pieces of food used in other parts of the store from the total number of pieces of food distributed to get the number of pieces of food left over after distribution. If 160 pieces of food were distributed between the small rodents, then the number of pieces of food left over would be 360 - 160 = 200 pieces of food. Therefore, there must be 20 shrews in each cup.
"Response:  If Mandy pays $100 after 3 months and there is a monthly interest of 2%, then we can calculate the total amount that Mandy owes to Benedict as follows:
Total Amount = Initial Amount x (Interest Rate / Number of Months) + Initial Amount
= $100 x (2%/3) + $100
= $100 x 0.67 + $100
= $67 + $100
= $167
Therefore, Benedict should receive $167 from Mandy."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer sold x sa... (read more)

Answer:  Let's think step by step.  Firstly, we know that the farmer sold x sacks of grain to the merchant at $20 per sack. Therefore, the total amount of money earned by the farmer is $x \times 20 = 2x dollars.

Secondly, we know that the transportation cost for each sack from the farm to the depot was $2. So, the total transportation cost for all x sacks is $2x.

Thirdly, we are given that the merchant made a total profit of $400 after selling all the sacks at $30 per sack. Therefore, the number of sacks sold by the merchant is $\frac{400}{30} = 13$.

So, the answer is $x = 13$."
Response:  Firstly, they spent $20.25 each for three tickets, so one person paid $60.75 ($20.25 x 3). Secondly, they spent less than $4.50 per person on food, so let's say they spent $4.30 per person ($13.20 / 3 people). Thirdly, they went on two different hikes that cost $33 each, so they paid a total of $66 ($33 + $33). Therefore, each person paid $20.90 in total ($60.75 + $4.30 + $66).
Response:  If John collects piersici for 3 hours, then he collected piersici in total for 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes. So, if he can collect two piersici per minute, then he collected 2 x 180 = 360 piersici in total.
Response:  If one rat needs to eat 3.5 kg of insects per week, then in one day it would need to eat 0.35 kg (division). Since there are ten rats, each will need to eat 0.35 kg / 10 = 0.035 kg of insects per day.
Response:  After 10 years, 30% of the original 50 trees will have died, which is equal to 15 trees (since 30% means that 15 out of 50 are dead). So, after 10 years, Tom has 35 trees left (50 - 15 = 35).
Response:  On Friday morning, there were 18 flamingos in red plastic. Then, on Saturday morning, neighbors took away one third of them and painted them white. So, at that time, there were 12 flamingos in white (3/4 of the original number). Finally, on Sunday morning, they added back another 18 flamingos in red plastic. Therefore, at lunchtime on Sunday, there were more than 12 flamingos in total - exactly 30 flamingos (12 + 18).
Response:  We know that Violetta needs to buy new pencils in 5 different colors and has budgeted $20 for this purchase. Since each pencil costs $2, we can calculate how many pencils she will be able to buy with her budget as follows: Number of pencils = Budget / Cost per pencil = $20 / $2 = 10 pencils Therefore, Violetta will receive $10 from the store.
"Response:  We know that one pencil costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30. So, if we buy 8 of them together, their total cost will be:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60 (for 8 pencils) + $0.30 x 8 = $2.40 (for 8 erasers) = Total Cost = $12.00
Therefore, 8 styluses cost $12.00."
Response:  We have to distribute 200 kg of potatoes among 40 restaurants in a certain city. Each restaurant will receive 2 kg of potatoes. To find out how many kilograms of potatoes will not be used, we need to subtract the total amount distributed from the total amount available. So, the number of kilograms of potatoes that will not be used is: 200 kg - (40 x 2 kg) = 160 kg. Therefore, 160 kg of potatoes will not be used.
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 people in the city of Soda. Among them, there are 8417 men and 9092 women. So, we can write: Men = 8417 Women = 9092 Now, let's find out how many children there are in Soda: Children = Total population - (Men + Women) = 23786 - (8417 + 9092) = 23786 - 17538 = 6248 Therefore, there are 6248 children in the city of Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 books of Pokémon. Then she collected three times more than before, so she got 60 books (3 x 20 = 60).  In the second month, she collected fewer books than in the first month, so she had 40 books left (60 - 20 = 40). And in the third month, she collected twice as many books as in the previous two months combined, so she got 80 books (40 + 2 x 20 = 80). Therefore, Elaine has 80 books of Pokémon now.
Response:  In one week, Mark edits x number of propositions for Editor A and y number of propositions for Editor B. Since Editor B pays twice as much as Editor A, Editor B pays Mark $x \times 2 = 2y$ per proposition. Therefore, Mark earns $x \times 0.05 = y \times 0.05$ per proposition from Editor A. So in one week, Mark earns a total of $\boxed{x + y}$ centi.
Response:  In each day, he gets 5 galleons of water in the morning and 6 galleons of water in the afternoon. So, in total, he gets 5 + 6 = 11 galleons of water per day. Since each galleon contains 5 liters of water, he gets 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water per day.
Response:  If John wins $5000 as a prize and gets a 5% raise in his salary, that means he will earn $100 more per week than before. So, if he earned $2000 per week before, now he will earn $2100 per week. Now, let's calculate how much money John made in a year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, John made $104,200 ($2100 x 52) in a year. Therefore, John made $104,200 + $5000 = $109,200 in a year.
Response:  If Josie has 10 acres of land and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then she will have 50 tons of grapes (10 acres x 5 tons/acre) per year. Since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, Josie will produce 100 barrels of wine (50 tons x 2 barrels/ton) per year. Therefore, her farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.
Response:  Firstly, Carl has eaten one sandwich per day for lunch and used two slices of cheese on each sandwich. Therefore, he has used 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for lunch. Secondly, he has made three omelets with cheese and eggs for breakfast every day, using more cheese than bread. So, he has used 3 x (2 + 1) = 6 slices of cheese for breakfast. Thirdly, he has made a large batch of macarons with cheese to feed many people over several days, and he has used 8 slices of cheese in that batch. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl has used is 14 + 6 + 8 = 30 slices of cheese.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Janet had 22 pens of different colors and 10 gold ones. Then she bought 6 bags of white pixels and 2 bags of red pixels. Each bag of white pixels contained 9 pens, and each bag of red pixels contained 6 pens. So, how many pens does Janet have now? We can calculate it as follows: Total number of pens = Number of pens in original collection + Number of pens bought = 22 + (6 x 9) + (2 x 6) = 43 + 54 = 97 pens. Therefore, Janet has 97 pens in total.
Response:  If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 for the first five tests, then his total score is 542 (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86). To get an average of 93 in the sixth test, he needs to have a score that is greater than or equal to 542 / 6 = 90. So, Brinley needs to get at least a 90 on the sixth test to achieve a median of 93.
"Response:  We know that Michael went cycling at least 5 times per week and covered 25 kilometers each time for 4 weeks. Then he reduced his frequency to twice a week but increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time for another 3 weeks. So, in total, Michael covered:

Week 1-4: 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers
Week 5-8: 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers
Total distance traveled by Michael = 125 + 120 = 245 kilometers"
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 apples in Joe's bag. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as an apple, so each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams x 2 = 80 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the chocolate bars is 25 x 80 = 2000 grams. Since Joe has 2000 grams of chocolate bars, and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as an apple, then the total weight of all the apples must be half of the total weight of the chocolate bars, which is 2000 grams / 2 = 1000 grams. So, the weight of each apple is 1000 grams / 80 = 12.5 grams per apple.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 pastries at one store and then went to another store and bought 3 more times as many pastries. So she bought 12 pastries on Monday.  On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought 5 times as many pastries as she did on Monday. So she bought 60 pastries on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of pastries that Rose bought is 72 (12 + 60).
Response:  We know that two dozen mugs of $ 1.200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $ 6,000 each. So we can write an equation as follows: Cost = Total cost - (Cost per plate x Number of plates) Now let's fill in the values given in the problem: Cost = $ 1,200 - ($ 6,000 / 2) = $ 1,200 - $ 3,000 = $ 1,800 Therefore, the cost of buying one mug is $ 1,800.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sarah wants to buy a new jacket and two pairs of shoes which costs $30 + ($2 x 2) = $60. Secondly, she earns $5 for each time she takes care of her neighbor's kids, so in total, she has earned $5 x 4 = $20. Thirdly, her parents pay her $4 per time she cuts their grass, so in total, she has earned $4 x 2 = $8. Finally, if she had already saved $10 before starting to take care of her neighbors', then she needs to cut their grass twice before she can afford the jacket and shoes. Therefore, the answer is $8 / 2 = 4 times.
Response:  If we have 3 red hens producing 3 eggs per day and 5 white hens producing 5 eggs per day, then in total we have 3 + 5 = 8 eggs per day.  Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, he must have at least 42 / 8 = 5 red hens and 17 white hens.
Response:  If he walks at a speed of 5 km/h and the park is an equilateral triangle with sides of length 1.5 miles (which means it has a perimeter of 30 miles), then...
Response:  On day 1, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. On day 2, she counted 50 more customers than on day 1, so she counted 150 customers (100 + 50). Therefore, on day 3, she counted 350 customers (500 - 150).
Response:  We know that initially, both pools had equal water flow rates of 4 gallons per minute. So, after 4 minutes, the larger pool would have twice as much water as the smaller pool, since it has a higher flow rate. Now, we are told that the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool. Therefore, the amount of water in the larger pool is currently 4 x 2 = 8 times the initial volume of water in the smaller pool. Since the initial volume of water in the smaller pool was 100 gallons (as given in the problem), we can calculate the current volume of water in the larger pool as follows: Volume of larger pool = 8 x 100 = 800 gallons.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lori will make in one hour of work: $8/hour x 1 hour = $8. Then, we can divide this amount by the price of the shoes to find out how many hours she needs to work to afford them: $8 / $320 = 25 hours. So, Lori needs to work for 25 hours before she can afford the shoes and the curtain.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% interest. So, the total amount she needs to pay is: $2000 + (10% of $2000) = $2200. Now, if she pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining debt will be: $2200 - ($165 x 12) = $1835. Therefore, the final amount left to pay by Janeth is $1835.
Response:  We know that there are 4 tulips in bloom and 7 daffodils more than tulips in bloom. So, if we add both numbers together, we get: 4 + 7 = 11. Therefore, there are 11 flowers in bloom in total.
"Response:  We know that:
Adrian is 3 years older than Harriet.
Harriet is half as old as Zack.
So we can write:
Age of Harriet = (Zack's age / 2) - 3
Now let's assume that in 3 years, Harriet will be x years old. So her new age would be:
x + 3 = (zack's age/2) - 3
We also know that zack's age is 25 years now. So substituting this value, we get:
x + 3 = 25 - 3
x = 22
Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet and Zack after 3 years is 22 years."
Response:  We know that Patru elevi have obtained a total of 251 points in a game of cards. Naomi has scored 68 points. Yuri has scored 10 more points than Naomi and Brianna has scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, Jojo must have scored...
Response:  Firstly, she spent 10 minutes solving the rebus and 5 minutes solving the Sudoku, so in total 15 minutes were spent on these two activities. Then, she solved 3 crosswords in 2 hours (or 60 minutes), which means she spent 30 minutes solving them. Finally, she spent 8 hours (or 480 minutes) solving the Sudoku puzzles. Therefore, the total time spent playing games was: 15 + 30 + 480 = 525 minutes.
Response:  We know that initially there were 120 liters of water in the tank. Then, Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is: 120 - 90 = 30 liters. Now, we are told that Celine was able to collect twice as much rainwater as she used from the tank. Therefore, the total amount of water collected by Celine is: 2 x 90 = 180 liters. Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial quantity to find the remaining water in the tank: 180 - 120 = 60 liters. So, there are 60 liters of water left in the tank now.
Response:  We know that Andy planted 90 geraniums and fewer petunias than geraniums. So, if he planted x petunias, then the total number of flowers is:  Number of geraniums = 90  Number of petunias = x - 40  Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias = 90 + (x - 40) = 130  Therefore, Andy planted 130 flowers in total.
Response:  In year 1, the company spends $15,000 on advertising. Then in year 2, it spends one third of that amount, which is $5,000 (since one third of $15,000 is $5,000). So, in total, the company has spent $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000 on advertising over the two years.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much time each of them spent using their respective boats/canoes.  Carlos spent 3 hours using the boat, and Benji spent 5 hours using the canoe.  Next, we need to calculate how much they paid for each hour of usage.  For Carlos, he paid $30 per hour, and for Benji, he paid $18 per hour.  Now, let's multiply the number of hours used by each person with the cost per hour:  Carlos - $30 x 3 = $90  Benji - $18 x 5 = $90  Therefore, in total, both Carlos and Benji will pay $90 for the boat rental.
Response:  First, we know that it takes half a day to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car (jumătate din zi). Then, we have 6 days for the entire trip (6 zile). So, if he wants to go to Rochester by bus and then come back with his own car, he will spend 3 days traveling by bus (3 zile) and 3 days driving back (3 zile). Therefore, the total number of days he will spend on this trip is 6 + 3 = 9 days.
Response:  We know that initially, there are 40 books of type water out of a total of 90 books. If he loses 8 books of type water, then the number of books of type water will be reduced to 32. Now, if he buys 14 books of type fire, then the total number of books of type fire will increase to 56 (30 + 14 = 56). So, the probability of an randomly chosen book being of type water is now 32/90 or 35.5% rounded to the nearest integer.
Response:  Firstly, he bought the basic burrito for $6.50. Then, he added meat for $2, cheese for $1, avocado for $1, and two sauces for $0.25 each, so the total price of his meal is: $6.50 + $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.25 x 2 = $9.75. Since he used a gift card worth $5, he paid only $4.75. Therefore, he owes $4.75.
"Response:  If Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can place half of the total number of pieces per minute, then they will finish the puzzle in different times. We need to find out how many minutes it will take for each of them to complete their part of the puzzle.

Kalinda needs to add 360 pieces to the puzzle, so she will take 360/4 = 90 minutes to do her part.
Her mother needs to place half of the total number of pieces, which is 180 pieces (since there are 360 pieces in total). So, her mother will take 180/2 = 90 minutes to do her part as well.
Therefore, it will take a total of 90 + 90 = 180 minutes to finish the puzzle."
Response:  After two months, 30% of the peppers were ready for harvest, so Ashlyn took home 30/100 = 3 peppers. Then, after another two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining peppers were ready, so she collected 3/4 x 30 = 21 peppers. Therefore, there were 21 - 3 = 18 peppers that were not yet ready for harvest after two weeks.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Mark will pay for each car. Since he is buying 12 cars and each car costs $20,000, then the total cost of all the cars is:

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

Next, we are asked to find out how much tax Mark has to pay on each car. The tax rate is 10%, so the amount of tax paid on each car is:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

Now, let's add the amount of tax paid to the total cost of each car to get the final price that Mark pays for each one:

$240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000

Finally, since Mark needs to register each car, he has to pay an additional fee of $1,000 per car. So, the total amount that Mark pays for all 12 cars is:

$264,000 + (12 x $1,000) = $378,000

Therefore, the answer to the question is $378,000."
Response:  On Monday (Marți), Kylie collected twice as many cartridges as she did on Sunday (Luni). So, if she collected 5 cartridges on Sunday, she collected 10 cartridges on Monday (since she doubled her collection). Now, let's find out how many cartridges Robert collected on Monday. Since he collected 20 cartridges less than Kylie, he collected 30 cartridges on Monday (20 - 10 = 30). Therefore, Kylie collected 10 cartridges more than Robert on Monday.
"Response:  If there are 50 ants in the garden and they collect half of them, then there will be 25 ants left in the garden. Now, if we add this number to the initial amount of insects (which is 50), we get the final number of insects in the garden:

Insects = Initial amount + Amount collected
= 50 + 25
= 75

Therefore, there are 75 insects in the garden."
Response:  Firstly, we know that 36 penguins are bathing in sunlight. Then, one third of them (12 penguins) jump into water and swim in the ocean. Another third of them (12 penguins) enter the cave to eat their dinner. So, there are 12 penguins left at the beach. Therefore, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  If Steve eats twice as much red pepper as his friend and he eats 6 pieces per day, then he eats a total of 12 pieces per day (twice as much as his friend).  If one vine can produce 3 red peppers per week, how many vines will Steve need to have in order to produce enough red peppers for him to eat 12 pieces per day?  We know that one vine produces 3 red peppers per week, so we can divide the number of red peppers Steve needs per day by the number of red peppers produced per week: 12 / 3 = 4 vines. Therefore, Steve will need 4 vines to produce enough red peppers for him to eat 12 pieces per day.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend wants to have 4 slices of pizza. Since the pizza is sold only cut into 8 pieces, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to order: 20 / 8 = 5 pizzas. So, John needs to order 5 pizzas.
Response:  If he can mix 5 empty brushes to make one full brush, then he will have 5/1 = 5 full brushes left after using them all up.  Now, if he buys 25 brushes and uses them alternately as before, he will use up 5 of them at first (since there are only 5 full brushes), leaving him with 20 - 5 = 15 brushes left. So, in total, he will have 15 + 5 = 20 brushes.
Response:  After one year, if he had $20 and added another $10, then he has a total of $30. If it tripled in one year, then after one year he would have $90 ($30 x 3). So, after one year, John had $90.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Mary = Joan - 2
Joan = Jessa + 5
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
Mary = (Jessa + 5) - 2
Now we have to solve for ""Mary"". Can you do it?"
Response:  We know that after the meeting, 30% of the students left through entrance A, so the number of students who left through entrances B and C is equal to 70%. Now, we need to find out what percentage of the remaining students left through each entrance. So, let's calculate it as follows:  Percentage of students leaving through entrance B = (3/5) x 100% = 60%  Percentage of students leaving through entrance C = (1 - 60%) x 100% = 40%  Therefore, the number of students who left through entrance C is: Number of students leaving through entrance C = Total number of students x Percentage of students leaving through entrance C = 1000 x 40% = 400 students
Response:  We know that James has more than Robert and John has twice as many bombones as Robert. So if John has 54 bombones, he must have at least 2 x 3 = 6 more bombones than Robert. Therefore, John has 54 + 6 = 60 bombones in total.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they have 3 books.  If both of them read each other's books as well as their own, then the total number of books that will be read is 6 (2 + 1 + 2). Therefore, the answer is 6.
"Response: 
Mike is friends with 5 people through correspondence and he stops being friends with two of them. Each person sends him 2 letters per week, and Mike responds in kind. He can write one page every 6 minutes.
Let's assume that there are exactly 14 days in the week (Sunday to Saturday).

Day 1-7: Mike receives 14 letters from his 5 friends (2 letters/day x 7 days) = 28 letters total.
He spends 28 \* 6 min/page = 168 minutes writing replies to these letters.

Day 8-14: Mike receives 7 letters from his remaining 3 friends (2 letters/day x 7 days) = 14 letters total.
He spends 14 \* 6 min/page = 84 minutes writing replies to these letters.

Total time spent writing replies = 168 + 84 = 252 minutes.
Therefore, Mike spends approximately 252 minutes writing replies to his friends each week."
Response:  We know that in one month (which has 30 days), Jason makes an average of 1 call per day with his boss for 15 minutes each. So he spends 45 minutes talking to his boss every day. In addition, he spent 300 extra minutes talking to other people during this month. Therefore, Jason's total talk time is: Total talk time = Daily talk time x Number of days = 45 minutes/day x 30 days = 1350 minutes/month Now we need to convert it to minutes per year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the number of minutes per month by 12: Total talk time per year = Total talk time per month x Number of months/year = 1350 minutes/month x 12 months/year = 16200 minutes/year So, Jason talks for approximately 16,200 minutes or 278 hours per year.
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 carrots at first and then he lost some to Kyle (who took 5). So, after this, Griffin had X carrots left. Then, Billy took twice as many carrots as Kyle, so he took 10 more carrots than Kyle. Therefore, Griffin lost an additional Y carrots to Billy. Finally, Ginger gave him Z carrots. Since we want to find out how many carrots Griffin had in total at the end, we can set up the equation: X + Y = Z. Solving for X, we get: X = 24 - 5 - 10 + Z = 24 - 15 + Z. Now, we are asked that if Griffin had 27 carrots at the end, so Z = 3. Substituting this value back into our equation, we get: 24 - 15 + 3 = 27. Simplifying, we get: 9 = 27, which means that Ginger gave Griffin 18 carrots.
Response:  In Acvariu 1, there are 4 fish and in Acvariu 2, there are 32 fish. If we subtract the number of fish in Acvariu 1 from the number of fish in Acvariu 2, we get: 32 - 4 = 28. So, there are 28 fish in total between both aquariums. Since the difference between the number of fish in each aquarium is twice the number of fish in that aquarium, we can conclude that there are 14 fish in Acvariu 1 and 14 fish in Acvariu 2. Therefore, the answer is (14, 14).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Jean pays $250 per hour for Machiaj's work. Therefore, if he needs to pay him for 6 hours every day (which is 48 hours per week), his total cost would be:

$250/hour x 48 hours = $12,000 per week

Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks, Jean will have paid a total of:

$12,000 x 5 weeks = $60,000

Now, since Machiaj gives Jean a discount of 10%, he will actually end up paying:

$60,000 x (1 - 0.10) = $54,000

Therefore, Jean will have paid a total of $54,000 for Machiaj's services throughout the entire production process."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on gifts for her younger sister's birthday, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on gift bags for the guests. She divided these costs equally among her parents, so each parent paid $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total amount. Therefore, each parent paid $\$10 + \$10 = \$20$.
Response:  The number of pungi of cabbage = 4. Each sack weighs 50 pounds = 22680 grams (since 1 pound = 453.59 g). So, the total weight of all cabbages = 4 x 22680 grams = 89,520 grams. Now, let's calculate how much each kilogram of cabbage costs: $1.5 per kilogram = $1.5 x 1000 grams/kilogram = $1500 per ton. Since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, we can convert the weight to tons as follows: $1500 / 1000 grams/ton = $1.5 per ton. Therefore, the total amount spent by the butcher = Total weight of cabbage x Cost per ton = 89520 grams x $1.5 = $13,170.
"Response:  We know that Sue has eaten more than her sister in total over four days. So, let's write down what we know about each day:
Day 1 (Lunedì): Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. This means she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.
Day 2 (Martedi): Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. This means she ate 2 x 5 = 10 cookies.
Day 3 (Mercoledì): Sue ate fewer cookies than her sister. But how many fewer? Well, if she ate 5 cookies and her sister ate 13, then Sue ate 13 - 5 = 8 fewer cookies.
Day 4 (Giovedì): Sue ate fewer cookies than her sister again. If she ate 2 cookies and her sister ate 5, then Sue ate 5 - 2 = 3 fewer cookies.
Now, let's add up all the cookies that Sue ate: 20 + 10 + 8 + 3 = 41 cookies.
So, Sue ate 41 cookies more than her sister over the course of the week. Since one cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 41 x 200 = 8,200 calories more than her sister."
