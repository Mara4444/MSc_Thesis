"Response:  The question is asking about the number of ways to arrange 5 objects in a row such that no two adjacent objects are the same.

1. There are 5 different objects to choose from, so there are 5! = 5 √ó 4 √ó 3 √ó 2 √ó 1 = 120 possible combinations for the first object.
2. For the second object, there are only 11 options left since one of the objects has already been used. So, there are 11! = 11 √ó 10 √ó 9 √ó 8 √ó 7 = 3640 possible combinations for the second object.
3. For the third object, there are only 10 options left since two objects have already been used. So, there are 10! = 10 √ó 9 √ó 8 √ó 7 √ó 6 = 362880 possible combinations for the third object.
4. Similarly, for the fourth and fifth objects, there are 9 and 8 options left respectively. Therefore, there are 9! = 9 √ó 8 √ó 7 √ó 6 √ó 5 = 3628800 possible combinations for the fourth object and 8! = 8 √ó 7 √ó 6 √ó 5 √ó 4 = 4035360 possible combinations for the fifth object.

So, in total, there are 120 + 3640 + 362880 + 3628800 = 13629680 possible ways to arrange 5 objects in a row without repeating any pair of adjacent objects."

Response:  The percentage of people who have never used Facebook is 80%. Of that number, 20% are students. So, the total number of students who have never used Facebook is 80% x 20% = 16%. Therefore, there are approximately 16% of students in Cambodia who have never used Facebook.
"Response:  The total number of people who have been infected with COVID-19 in Cambodia is 20,874 (according to the latest update from the Ministry of Health). Now, let's calculate the percentage of people who have recovered based on the number of new cases reported each day:

New cases per day = Total number of cases / Number of days since the outbreak started
= 20,874 / 235 days
= 86.47 cases per day

Now, let's calculate the percentage of people who have recovered based on the number of new cases reported each day:

Recovered cases per day = New cases per day x Percentage of recoveries
= 86.47 x ùüìùüó%

As of today (June 22nd), there are 1,000 new cases reported in Cambodia. So, we can calculate the percentage of people who have recovered as follows:

Recovered cases per day = 1,000 x ùüìùüó%
= 100 cases per day

Therefore, based on the latest data available, approximately 100 people recover from COVID-19 every day in Cambodia."
Response:  The distance from San Rafael to Cambodia is approximately 8,507 miles (13,694 km). To calculate how many hours it takes to drive this distance at a speed of 60 mph (97 km/h), we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

"Response:  The question is asking about the percentage of people who have never been to school among those aged between 15 and 64 years old in Cambodia. To find this percentage, we need to use the data provided in the question. According to the table, out of every 100 people aged between 15 and 64 years old in Cambodia:

* 83 have attended primary school.
* 17 have attended lower secondary school.
* 9 have attended upper secondary school.
* 1 have attended tertiary education.

So, the total number of people who have attended some level of formal education is:
83 + 17 + 9 = 119 (out of 100)

Now, let's calculate the percentage of people who have never been to school:
Percentage of people who have never been to school = (Number of people who have never been to school / Total number of people aged between 15 and 64 years old) x 100
= (1 - 119 / 100) x 100
= 81%

Therefore, based on the given data, approximately 81% of people aged between 15 and 64 years old in Cambodia have never been to school."

"Response:  The question is asking about how many times an average person will have to work extra hours per week to earn enough money for their basic needs. To calculate this, we need to know what constitutes ""basic needs."" For simplicity, let's assume that basic needs include food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare.

Now, let's consider some numbers related to these expenses in Cambodia:

* Food: On average, a person in Cambodia spends around $10-20 per day on food. So, if someone works 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), they would need to work approximately 8-16 hours per week just to cover their food costs.
* Shelter: Rent prices vary depending on location and size of the house/apartment. However, on average, a one-bedroom apartment in Phnom Penh can cost between $200-$400 per month. Assuming a moderate rent price of $300 per month, someone working 5 days a week would need to work around 12-24 hours per week to pay for their housing expenses.
* Clothing: This can be difficult to estimate as it depends on personal preferences and lifestyle choices. However, let's assume that someone needs to spend around $10-20 per week on clothes. Working 5 days a week, they would need to work around 8-16 hours per week to cover their clothing costs.
* Healthcare: In Cambodia, medical care is relatively affordable compared to other countries. A consultation with a doctor can cost around $10-20, while a hospital stay can range from $500-$1,000. Assuming someone has basic health insurance coverage, they might need to spend around $50-100 per month on healthcare. Working 5 days a week, they would need to work around 8-16 hours per week to cover their healthcare costs.

Adding up all these estimates, we get:

Food: 8-16 hours per week
Shelter: 12-24 hours per week
Clothing: 8-16 hours per week
Healthcare: 8-16 hours per week
Total: 48"

Response:  We know that Jean has 30 kg of rice and he wants to distribute it equally among 4 people. So each person will get 7.5 kg of rice (30/4 = 7.5). Now let's assume that one of these people is a child who doesn't eat as much as an adult, so we need to reduce their portion accordingly. Let's say this child eats half as much as an average person, which means they will get 3.75 kg of rice (7.5 / 2 = 3.75). Therefore, the total amount of rice distributed among all 4 people is 7.5 + 3.75 = 11.25 kg.
Response:  The cost of building a house is estimated to be around $100,000. If we assume that Peter has saved $80,000 for his retirement, he will have enough money to build a small house with basic amenities but not a large one with luxurious facilities. Therefore, the answer is B - $80,000.
Response:  The question is asking about the number of people who can fit in a room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3755 square meters and a height of 10 meters. To calculate this, we need to use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is: Volume = Length x Width x Height. In this case, the length, width, and height are all equal to 10 meters, so the volume of the room is: Volume = 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 cubic meters. Now, the question asks how many people can fit in the room. We know that one person requires an average space of 0.25 cubic meters (based on the assumption that each person needs at least 0.25 cubic meters of space). So, to find out how many people can fit in the room, we divide the volume of the room by the required space per person: Number of people = Volume / Space per person = 1000 / 0.25 = 4000 people. Therefore, the answer to the question is 4000 people.
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that ·ûõ·üÑ·ûÄ Stephen has spent on his business ventures. According to the question, he has invested $160,000 in his business and has also spent $40,000 on advertising. Therefore, the total amount of money he has spent is:
$160,000 + $40,000 = $200,000
Now, let's find out how much profit he has made from his business ventures. According to the question, he has earned $300,000 in revenue and has spent $200,000 on expenses. Therefore, his profit is:
$300,000 - $200,000 = $100,000
So, the answer to the question is $100,000."
Response:  The question is asking about the number of sticks that have been used to build a house with 20 rooms and each room has 4 windows. So, we need to calculate the total number of windows in all rooms. There are 20 rooms in the house, so there will be 20 x 4 = 80 windows in total. Now, let's assume that each window requires 3 sticks to make it complete. Therefore, the total number of sticks required to make all 80 windows will be 80 x 3 = 240 sticks. Since they already have 160 sticks left over from previous projects, they now have a total of 240 + 160 = 390 sticks available for this project.
Response:  The question is asking about the percentage of people who have never used Facebook in Cambodia. According to the survey result provided, out of every 100 people, 86 people (86%) have never used Facebook. So, the answer is 86%.
Response:  The question is asking about the percentage of money that a woman named Janet earned from her business ventures in Cambodia. According to the information provided, Janet earned $30,000 from her businesses and invested $20,000 in real estate. So, we can calculate the profit as follows: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses In this case, total revenue is $30,000, and total expenses are $20,000, so the profit is $10,000 ($30,000 - $20,000). Now, let's convert the profit into percentages. To do this, we divide the profit by the total investment (which is also equal to the total revenue): Percentage of profit = Profit / Total Investment = $10,000 / $50,000 = 0.2 or 20% This means that Janet earned 20% of her total investment back from her business ventures in Cambodia.
Response:  The question is asking about the percentage of employees who have been working for more than 10 years at a company. We are given that there are 400 employees in total and 30 employees who have worked for more than 10 years. So, we can calculate the percentage as follows: Percentage = (Number of employees who have worked for more than 10 years / Total number of employees) x 100 = (30 / 400) x 100 = 7.5% Therefore, according to the question, 7.5% of the employees at the company have been working for more than 10 years.
Response:  The question is asking about the percentage of people who have watched at least one episode of a TV show or movie on streaming platforms in the past month. To calculate this percentage, we need to know how many people have used streaming platforms in the past month. According to the survey, 74% of respondents reported using streaming platforms in the past month. So, if we multiply 74% by 100%, we get the total number of people who have used streaming platforms in the past month, which is 74%. Now, let's find out what percentage of these users have watched at least one episode of a TV show or movie on streaming platforms. To do this, we divide the number of people who have watched at least one episode (which we will estimate later) by the total number of people who have used streaming platforms in the past month. If we assume that 10% of the total number of users have watched at least one episode of a TV show or movie on streaming platforms, then we can calculate the percentage as follows: (10% of 74%) x 100% = 7.4%. Therefore, based on the given information, approximately 7.4% of people have watched at least one episode of a TV show or movie on streaming platforms in the past month.
Response:  The question is asking about how many times Sophia has been to school since she was born. To find out, we need to know when Sophia was born and how old she is now.

Response:  The question is asking about the number of people who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia as of March 2023. To find this number, we need to consider several factors such as the total population of Cambodia and the percentage of infected individuals among them. As of March 2023, the estimated population of Cambodia was around 16 million people. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the country had reported over 5,000 cases of COVID-19 as of that date, which means that approximately 0.03% of the total population had been infected. Therefore, the number of people affected by the pandemic in Cambodia as of March 2023 can be calculated as follows: Number of people affected = Total population x Percentage of infected individuals Total population = 16,000,000 Percentage of infected individuals = 0.03 x 16,000,000 = 48,000 So, based on these calculations, there were approximately 48,000 people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambodia as of March 2023.
"Response: 
The number of people who have not received any vaccine is 186 (Option A).

"Response:  We know that Artie has 12 marigolds, 9 petunias, and 17 begonias in total. So, we can calculate the number of each type of flower as follows:

* Marigolds: 12 / Total number of flowers = Number of marigolds
Number of marigolds = 12
* Petunias: 9 / Total number of flowers = Number of petunias
Number of petunias = 9
* Begonias: 17 / Total number of flowers = Number of begonias
Number of begonias = 17
Therefore, the answer is:
Artie has 12 marigolds, 9 petunias, and 17 begonias in total."

"Response:  
1. If Cecilia has 30 years old and she is currently working as an accountant in a company, then her salary will be around $2500-$3000 per month (assuming she is earning a decent salary for someone with her experience).
2. Based on the cost of living in Cambodia, it's estimated that a single person needs at least $800-$1000 per month to cover basic expenses such as food, transportation, housing, and other necessities. So, after deducting her monthly expenses from her income, we can estimate that Cecilia has around $1700-$2000 left over each month.
3. Now, let's assume that Cecilia wants to save up for retirement. A common rule of thumb for retirement savings is to aim to save at least 10%-15% of one's income each month. So, if Cecilia wants to save $1700-$2000 per month for retirement, she should aim to set aside around $170-$200 out of every $1000 she earns.
4. Therefore, based on these calculations, Cecilia could potentially save around $170-$200 per month towards her retirement goal. However, this is just an estimate and actual savings may vary depending on various factors such as changes in income or expenses, investment returns, etc."

"Response:  The question is asking about the percentage of people who have been to Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. We are given that there are 10 million tourists visiting Cambodia each year. So, we can calculate the number of tourists who visited Phnom Penh and Siem Reap as follows:

Number of tourists visiting Phnom Penh = Total number of tourists x Percentage of tourists visiting Phnom Penh
= 10,000,000 x 30%
= 3,000,000

Similarly, we can calculate the number of tourists visiting Siem Reap as follows:

Number of tourists visiting Siem Reap = Total number of tourists x Percentage of tourists visiting Siem Reap
= 10,000,000 x 40%
= 4,000,000

So, in total, there are approximately 7 million tourists (3 million + 4 million) who have visited both Phnom Penh and Siem Rea"

Response:  The question is asking about how many days it takes for someone to become fluent in Khmer after studying for 3 months. To calculate this, we need to know how much time each day of study will take. Let's assume that one month has 30 days, so 3 months would be 3 x 30 = 90 days. Now, let's estimate how long it might take to become fluent in Khmer based on the amount of time spent studying. It's difficult to give an exact number without knowing more details about the individual's learning style and the quality of their instruction, but as a rough estimate, it could take around 1-2 years of consistent study to reach a high level of fluency in Khmer. So, if someone studies Khmer for 90 days (3 months), they may not yet be fully fluent, but they should make significant progress towards achieving this goal.

Response:  We know that Gerald has 400 ml of water and he wants to share it equally among 38 people in 38 rooms. So, we need to divide 400 ml by 38 people, which gives us approximately 10.5 ml per person. Now, let's assume each room requires 2 liters (or 2000 ml) of water for its daily needs. Therefore, Gerald will have to provide 2000 - 10.5 = 1990.5 ml of water to each room, or 56.7 ml per room on average.
Response:  The number of people who have never been to school is given as 100. Now, let's find out how many people have gone to school for at least one year. We know that 60% of the remaining 40% of the population has gone to school for at least one year. So, we need to calculate what percentage of the original 100 people have gone to school for at least one year. To do this, we can multiply the total number of people (100) by the percentage of people who have gone to school for at least one year (60%). This gives us 60 people. Therefore, there are 40 people who have never gone to school.

Response:  The question is asking about how many days it takes for a person to learn and master a new skill or subject after they have started practicing it consistently every day for 4 months. To calculate this, we need to know what the learning rate of the person is, which can vary from person to person depending on various factors such as their intelligence, motivation, and prior knowledge in that area. For simplicity, let's assume an average learning rate of 0.5 days per day (i.e., the person learns half of the material each day). Now, if the person starts practicing the new skill or subject consistently every day for 4 months, they will have learned 160 days worth of material (4 months x 30 days/month). So, the total time taken to learn and master the new skill or subject would be: Total Time = Number of Days Learned / Learning Rate = 160 days / 0.5 days/day = 320 days Or, in numeric form, the answer is 320 days.
Response:  The question is asking about how many days it takes for the moon to return to its original position after reaching its peak brightness. We are given that the lunar cycle lasts approximately 29.5 days. So, if we assume that the moon reaches its peak brightness at day 14 of the lunar cycle (which is roughly halfway through the cycle), then it will take around 14.75 days (or 36% of the total lunar cycle) for the moon to return to its original position after reaching its peak brightness. Therefore, the answer is 14.75 days.

"Response: 
Rosie has 10 mice in her house and she wants to give them away as gifts. She can give each mouse to at most 3 people. How many people can she give the mice to in total?
Let's use mathematical notation to represent this problem:
Let x be the number of people Rosie gives the mice to.
We know that x is less than or equal to 3 (the maximum number of people Rosie can give mice to).
So, we can write an inequality equation based on these constraints:
x ‚â§ 3
Now, let's solve for x using algebraic manipulation:
x = 3 - 2(10) / x
Simplifying the expression, we get:
x = 3 - 20 / x
Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the inequality equation. To do this, we can set up a table with values of x ranging from 1 to 5 (since 5 is the highest value that makes sense given the information provided):
| x | 3 - 20 / x |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 8 |
| 5 | 10 |
As you can see, the only solution that satisfies the inequality equation is x = 3. Therefore, Rosie can give the mice to exactly 3 people."
"Response:  
Jennie has 30 songs in her playlist and she wants to know how many of them are popular among listeners. To find out, we need to divide the number of popular songs (30) by the total number of songs in her playlist (100). So, the proportion of popular songs is 30/100 = 0.3 or 30%. Therefore, about 30% of Jennie's songs are popular among listeners."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:

1. ·ûì·û∂·ûÑ Julia has been working at the company for 5 years.
2. She is currently holding the position of Manager.
3. Her salary was increased by $5000 last year.
4. The company provides health insurance and retirement benefits to its employees.
5. Julia is single and does not have any dependents.
6. She has been saving money every month for the past 3 years.
7. She wants to buy a house worth $200,000 within the next 5 years.
8. She plans to use her savings and the increase in her salary to make the down payment on the house.
9. She estimates that she will need to save an additional $10,000 per year to reach her goal.

Now, let's calculate how much Julia needs to save each month to reach her goal of buying a $200,000 house within the next 5 years:

Year 1: Save $10,000 x 12 = $120,000
Year 2: Save $10,000 x 12 = $120,000 + ($5000 x 2 = $10,000) = $230,000
Year 3: Save $10,000 x 12 = $120,000 + ($5000 x 3 = $15,000) = $350,000
Year 4: Save $10,000 x 12 = $120,000 + ($5000 x 4 = $20,000) = $570,000
Year 5: Save $10,000 x 12 = $120,000 + ($5000 x 5 = $25,000) = $820,000

Therefore, Julia needs to save approximately $820,000 over the next 5 years to buy a $200"

"Response:  We have to find out how many unicorns are in the world and then calculate the percentage of them that live in the highlands. 
1. There is no official data on the number of unicorns in the world. However, we can estimate it based on some assumptions. Let's assume there are about 10 million horses in the world. Since unicorns are mythical creatures with magical powers, they might be rarer than horses. So, let's assume there are only 1% of horses that turn into unicorns each year (this is just an arbitrary assumption).
2. Now, let's calculate the total number of unicorns in the world using the above assumption. If there are 10 million horses and 1% of them turn into unicorns each year, then the total number of unicorns in the world after one year would be: 10,000,000 x 1% = 100,000 unicorns.
3. After two years, the number of unicorns would increase by 1% of the original number of horses, which is: 10,000,000 x 1% = 100,000 unicorns.
4. Therefore, if we continue this process for n years, the total number of unicorns in the world would be: 100,000 x (1 + 1%)^n = 100,000 x 1.1^n.
5. To find out the percentage of unicorns that live in highlands, we need to know the total area of highlands in the world. According to World Atlas, the total area of highlands in the world is approximately 75%. So, the percentage of unicorns living in highlands would be: 100,000 x 1.1^n / 75% = 100,000 x 1.1^(n/2) / 75%.
6. Finally, to find the exact number of unicorns living in highlands, we need to solve the equation above. For example, if n = 10, then"

"Response:  The question is asking about how many people have been affected by the flood in Cambodia. We are given that there were 300 houses destroyed and 150 families displaced. To calculate the total number of people affected, we need to multiply the number of households affected (300) by the average size of a household (which is not provided). So, the answer is:

Total number of people affected = Number of households affected x Average size of a household
= 300 x?

We don't know the exact value of the average size of a household, but let's assume it's around 5-6 people per household, which is a common estimate for rural areas in developing countries like Cambodia. Therefore, the estimated total number of people affected by the flood would be:

Estimated total number of people affected = Total number of people affected x 5-6
= 300 x 5-6
= 1500-2100 people

So, based on the information provided, the estimated range of people affected by the flood in Cambodia is between 1500-2100 individuals."

Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jordan has earned from his part-time job in one week. We know that he earns $10 per hour and works for 4 hours every day, so his daily income is $40 ($10/hour x 4 hours). Therefore, his weekly income is $280 ($40 x 7 days).

Next, we need to find out how much money Jordan can save each month based on his weekly income. To do this, we divide his weekly income by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month). So, his monthly savings are $70 ($280 / 4 = $70).

Finally, we need to determine how long it will take for Jordan to save $500 if he continues to work at his current rate and saves $70 per month. To do this, we divide $500 by $70 (the amount he saves per month), which gives us approximately 7 months ($500 / $70 = 7 months)."

"Response: 

Firstly, we know that there are 7 days in a week. So, if today is Monday (Day 1), then tomorrow will be Tuesday (Day 2).

Next, we know that there are 12 hours in a day. So, if it is currently 3 pm (hour 9 of the day), then the next hour will be 4 pm (hour 10 of the day).

Now, let's calculate the time difference between the current hour and the next hour:

Time difference = 4 pm - 3 pm = 1 hour

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The time difference between 3 pm today and 4 pm tomorrow is 1 hour."
"Response: 
Anakin and Locsin have a total of 10 cards each.
Anakin has won 6 rounds, and Locsin has won 4 rounds.
Therefore, the number of cards that Anakin has left is 10 - 6 = 4.
Now, let's calculate the number of cards that Locsin has left. Since he has won 4 rounds, he has taken 4 x 3 = 12 cards from Anakin. Therefore, the number of cards that Locsin has left is 10 - 12 = -2.
So, the final score is Anakin: 4 cards, Locsin: -2 cards."
"Response:  The percentage of people who have not received any vaccine is given as 80%. Now, we need to find out how many people have received at least one dose of vaccine. We can use the following formula:

Number of people who have received at least one dose = Total population - Number of people who have not received any vaccine

Now, let's plug in the values from the question into this formula:

Total population = 20 million (given)
Number of people who have not received any vaccine = 80% of 20 million = 16 million (given)

So, the number of people who have received at least one dose of vaccine is:

Number of people who have received at least one dose = 20 million - 16 million = 4 million

Therefore, approximately 40% of the total population has received at least one dose of vaccine."
"Response: 

1. The number of people who have not received any vaccine is 3 (as mentioned in the question).
2. Out of these 3 people, 2 are children under the age of 5 (as mentioned in the question).
3. Therefore, the total number of people who have not received any vaccine and are under the age of 5 is 2.
4. Now, let's calculate the percentage of people who have not received any vaccine among those under the age of 5. To do this, we need to divide the number of people who have not received any vaccine (i.e., 2) by the total number of people under the age of 5 (i.e., 4). So, the percentage of people who have not received any vaccine among those under the age of 5 is 50% (i.e., 2/4 x 100%)."

Response:  The number of people who have never been to school is given as 260 million. Now, let's find out how many people have gone to school for at least one year but not more than five years. We can do this by subtracting the number of people who have gone to school for less than one year from the total number of people who have gone to school. So, if we subtract 180 million (the number of people who have gone to school for less than one year) from 260 million (the total number of people who have gone to school), we get 80 million. Therefore, there are 80 million people who have gone to school for at least one year but not more than five years.

"Response: 
The total amount of money that Jessica has is $1000.
She wants to divide it equally among her three children, so each child will get $333.33 ($1000 / 3).
However, she also wants to give her youngest child an extra $166.67 ($500 - $333.33) because he is the youngest and needs more support.
So, the final distribution of money among Jessica's children is:
Child 1: $333.33
Child 2: $333.33
Child 3: $500 (plus $166.67 for the youngest child) = $666.67
Therefore, the percentage of money that Jessica's youngest child receives is 66.67% ($666.67 / $1000)."

Response:  The question asks about the number of people who have been to school and are now working in various fields. To find this number, we need to consider several factors such as age range, education level, and field of work. Based on these factors, I estimate that there are approximately 400,000 people aged between 25-39 years old who have completed high school or higher education and are currently working in different fields. This is based on the assumption that the total population of Cambodia is around 17 million, with an estimated 80% of the population aged between 15-64 years old (according to World Bank data). Therefore, if we assume that 40% of the working-age population has completed high school or higher education, then the number of people who have gone to school and are now working would be around 400,000. However, it is important to note that this is only an estimate and may not reflect the actual number of people involved.

Response:  The question is asking about the number of times an elephant can lift something that weighs 20 kilograms (or 44 pounds). To find out how many times an elephant can lift this weight, we need to know its lifting capacity. According to various sources, the average lifting capacity of an adult male African elephant is around 7 tons or 14,000 kilograms (or 30,865 pounds). So, if we divide the weight of the object (20 kg) by the lifting capacity of the elephant (14,000 kg), we get the number of times the elephant can lift it: 20/14,000 = 0.014 or approximately 1.4 times. Therefore, the answer to the question is 1.4.

We are given that the person was sick for 30 days before being treated, and that they were treated using both traditional medicine and herbal remedies. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of days that the person spent feeling unwell as follows:
Day 1-30: Sick (untreated)
Day 31-45: Treated with traditional medicine
Day 46-60: Treated with herbal remedies
So, the total number of days that the person spent feeling unwell is: 30 + 45 + 60 = 135 days."

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in each group. There are 4 students in each group (5 x 4 = 20), so the total number of students in all groups is 20 x 4 = 80. Therefore, the answer is 80.
"Response:  The question is asking about the number of flamingos that can fit in a small boat. To solve this problem, we need to know the size of the boat and the size of a flamingo.
A flamingo is approximately 3 feet (0.9 meters) tall and 4-5 feet (1.2-1.5 meters) long. A small boat can hold a maximum of 8 people comfortably, but it depends on how they are seated.
So, let's assume that the small boat can hold 6 people comfortably, with two people sitting side by side.
Now, let's calculate the volume of the small boat:
Volume of small boat = Length x Width x Height = 6 x 3 x 2 = 36 cubic feet (or 1.06 cubic meters)
Next, we need to calculate the volume of one flamingo:
Volume of one flamingo = Length x Width x Height = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 cubic inches (or 0.017 cubic meters)
Now, we can divide the volume of the small boat by the volume of one flamingo to get an estimate of how many flamingos can fit in the boat:
Number of flamingos that can fit in the boat = Volume of small boat / Volume of one flamingo = 36 / 6 = 6
Therefore, based on these calculations, six flamingos can fit in a small boat."
"Response: 
Violetta earned $20 for each of the 5 paintings she sold. Therefore, her total earnings from selling those paintings are:
$20 x 5 = $100
Now, let's calculate how much money she spent on materials for each painting:
Material cost per painting = $8
So, the total amount of money she spent on materials is:
$8 x 5 = $40
Now, let's subtract the amount she spent on materials from the total amount she earned:
$100 - $40 = $60
Therefore, Violetta has $60 left after buying materials for all 5 paintings."

Response:  The question is asking about how many days it takes for water to flow through a pipe that is 10 meters long if the water flows at a rate of 5 liters per minute. To find out, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate. In this case, the distance is 10 meters and the rate is 5 liters/minute. So, we can plug these values into the formula like this: Time = 10 m / 5 l/min = 2 minutes. Therefore, it takes 2 minutes for water to flow through a pipe that is 10 meters long if the water flows at a rate of 5 liters per minute.

= 21.25%

Therefore, Sara's score is approximately 21.25% of the total scores."
"Response: 

1. Jerry has 3 days off per week (Monday to Wednesday).
2. He works for 8 hours per day.
3. Therefore, he works for a total of 24 hours per week (3 days x 8 hours/day).
4. If he takes 1 day off every 2 weeks, then he will have 2 days off in a month (assuming a month has 4 weeks).
5. So, in a year, Jerry will have 26 days off (2 days/month x 12 months).
6. Now, let's calculate how many working days Jerry has in a year:
7. A year has 365 days (ignoring leap years), and Jerry works for 24 hours/week, so he works for a total of 8,760 hours/year (365 days x 24 hours/day).
8. Finally, we can calculate the number of working days Jerry has in a year by subtracting the number of days off from the total number of working hours: 8,760 hours - 26 days = 8,734 working days/year.
Therefore, the answer is 8,734 working days/year."

Response:  The total amount of money that Lori has is $320.00 and she spends $32.00 for her personal expenses. So, the remaining amount of money that she has after paying her bills is $320.00 - $32.00 = $288.00. Now, let's calculate how much time it takes for Lori to save $288.00 if she works part-time for 16 hours per week at an hourly wage of $15.00. To do this, we can use the formula: Time = Total Amount / Hourly Wage. Plugging in the values, we get: Time = $288.00 / $15.00 = 19.2 hours. Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, Lori can save $288.00 in 19.2 hours working part-time at an hourly wage of $15.00.
"Response: 
Janeth has $2000 to invest and she wants to earn an interest of 10%. To calculate the total amount of money she will have after one year, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P x (1 + r)^n, where:
A = Total amount after one year ($2000)
P = Principal amount ($2000)
r = Interest rate (10%) / 100
n = Number of years (one year)
So, A = $2000 x (1 + 0.10)^1 = $2300.
Therefore, after one year, Janeth will have $2300 in her account."
Response:  We know that there are four options for the number of cards in each deck: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we have already eliminated option 1 (there is no card), we can choose one of the remaining three options: 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the probability of drawing exactly 4 cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards is $\frac{3}{52}$.
"Response:  We know that Harriet has 21 years old and she will be 40 years old in 2050. So, the difference between her current age and her future age is:

"Response:  We have to find out how many ways there are to place the numbers from 1 to 9 in each row and column of the Sudoku grid so that no number is repeated.
There are 9 rows, and for each row, we can choose one number between 1 and 9. Therefore, the total number of ways to place the numbers in each row is 9.
Similarly, there are 9 columns, and for each column, we can choose one number between 1 and 9. So, the total number of ways to place the numbers in each column is also 9.
Now, let's count the number of ways to place the numbers in each sub-grid (3x3 block) of the Sudoku grid. There are 3 blocks in each row, and for each block, we can choose 3 numbers between 1 and 9. Therefore, the total number of ways to place the numbers in each block is 3 x 9 = 27.
Finally, since there are 9 rows and 9 columns in the Sudoku grid, the total number of ways to fill the entire grid with unique numbers is 9 x 9 = 81.
So, the answer to the question is 81."

"Response:  We know that Andy has 90 days of vacation left and he wants to spend it with his family. He also mentions that they have been saving for this trip for 2 years. Therefore, we can calculate how much money they have saved so far as follows:

Money saved = Number of months x Monthly savings
= 24 months (since they started saving 2 years ago) x $500/month ($100 from each person)
= $12,000

Now, let's calculate how much money Andy and his wife can afford to spend on their trip based on their remaining vacation days:

Affordable trip cost = Remaining vacation days x Daily expenses
= 90 days x $100/day
= $9,000

So, Andy and his wife can afford to spend up to $9,000 on their trip."
"Response:  The question is asking about the number of times a certain action was taken during a specific period of time. To find this number, we need to analyze the given information carefully.
From the question, we know that the action in question involves taking a test and getting a score. We are also told that there were 160 students who took the test, and that the test was administered over a period of 3 years (or 3 x 365 = 1095 days).
Now, let's calculate the number of tests each student took during those 3 years:
Number of tests per student = Number of students / Total number of days
= 160 students / 1095 days
= 1.47 tests per student per year
Since the test was administered over 3 years, each student took approximately 4.38 tests (1.47 x 3 years)
Therefore, the answer to the question is 438."
"Response:  If Carlos pays $30 for 3 hours of work and Benji pays $50 for 5 hours of work, then we can calculate their hourly wages as follows:
Carlos's hourly wage = Total amount paid / Number of hours worked = $30 / 3 hours = $10 per hour
Benji's hourly wage = Total amount paid / Number of hours worked = $50 / 5 hours = $10 per hour
Therefore, both Carlos and Benji earn $10 per hour."
Response:  The distance between New Jersey and Rochester is approximately 350 miles (563 km). So, it would take around 6-7 hours to drive nonstop from New Jersey to Rochester depending on traffic conditions. However, if you include stops along the way or other factors such as traffic, construction, or weather, the journey could take longer. Therefore, I would say that driving from New Jersey to Rochester takes around 6-7 hours on average.
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of cards in each deck:

* In the first deck, there are 30 cards with different numbers from 1 to 30.
* In the second deck, there are 20 cards with different letters from A to T.
* In the third deck, there are 10 cards with different symbols from $ to #.

So, the total number of cards in each deck is:

Deck 1: 30 cards x 8 suits = 240 cards
Deck 2: 20 cards x 5 letters = 100 cards
Deck 3: 10 cards x 3 symbols = 30 cards

Now, let's count how many pairs of cards have the same rank and suit:

* Deck 1: 240 cards x 7 ranks x 8 suits = 16,800 pairs
* Deck 2: 100 cards x 5 ranks x 5 letters = 1,250 pairs
* Deck 3: 30 cards x 3 ranks x 3 symbols = 90 pairs

Finally, let's calculate the probability that two randomly drawn cards will have the same rank and suit:

Probability = Number of pairs / Total number of cards
= 16,800 + 1,250 + 90 / 630
= 0.27 or approximately 27%

Therefore, the probability that two randomly drawn cards will have the same rank and suit is approximately 27%."
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the burrito without any discounts or promotions. The price of the burrito is $6.50.
Next, we have two types of chips available - regular and large. The price of regular chips is $2.00 per bag, while the price of large chips is $3.00 per bag. If Chad buys one bag of each type of chips, he will pay a total of $2.00 + $3.00 = $5.00 for both bags.
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the meal including the chips. The original price of the burrito is $6.50, plus the cost of the chips ($5.00), which gives us a total cost of $11.50.
Finally, if Chad uses his loyalty card, he will get a 10% discount on his purchase, which means he will save $1.15 (10% of $11.50). So, the final cost of the meal after applying the discount is $10.35."

Response:  The percentage of students who passed the exam is 80%. Of these, 60% were able to attend school regularly and 40% were not able to attend school regularly. So, the number of students who attended school regularly is 60% x 100 = 60%, and the number of students who did not attend school regularly is 40% x 100 = 40%. Therefore, the total number of students who attended school regularly plus those who did not attend school regularly is 60 + 40 = 100%.
Response:  The total number of students in the school is 1200, and they are divided into two classes with 600 students each. Therefore, the number of students in class A is 600/2 = 300, and the number of students in class B is 600 - 300 = 300. So, there are 300 students in class B who will take the examination.

So, Jessa has earned $1 million during her 20-year work period."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who passed all subjects.
Total number of students = Number of students in group A + Number of students in group B + Number of students in group C
= 20 + 30 + 40
= 90

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of students who passed all subjects for each group.
For Group A: Percentage of students who passed all subjects = Total number of students who passed all subjects / Total number of students in group A
= (20/50) x 100
= 40%

For Group B: Percentage of students who passed all subjects = Total number of students who passed all subjects / Total number of students in group B
= (30/50) x 100
= 60%

For Group C: Percentage of students who passed all subjects = Total number of students who passed all subjects / Total number of students in group C
= (40/50) x 100
= 80%

Therefore, the answer is:
Percentage of students who passed all subjects = 40%, 60%, and 80%."

Response:  The question is asking about the percentage of reduction in the price of jeans after they have been worn for 2 years. To find this percentage, we need to know how much the price of jeans decreases over time. According to the passage, the price of jeans decreases by $10 every year. So, if we multiply $10 by 2 (the number of years), we get $20. This means that the price of jeans decreases by $20 after 2 years. Now, let's convert this amount into a percentage. To do this, we divide the decrease in price ($20) by the original price of the jeans ($80). This gives us a percentage decrease of 25%. Therefore, the answer to the question is 25%.
