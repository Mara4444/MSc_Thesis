The answer is 24 years.

Explanation:

Carlos invests $90 in planting a lemon tree, which will take 9 years to mature and produce fruit. He can sell each lemon for $1.50, so he will make $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 per year from the lemons alone. However, he also spends $3 annually on maintaining the tree, so his total annual income from the lemon tree is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5. To calculate how many years it takes for Carlos to break even on his investment, we need to divide his initial investment by his annual income: $90 / $7.5 = 24 years. Therefore, it will take Carlos 24 years to earn back his initial investment of $90 through selling lemons."

Explanation:

* The teacher works for 50 weeks in a year and teaches for 35 hours per week, so the total teaching hours is 1825 hours (50 weeks x 35 hours/week).
* The tutoring hours are 15 hours per week, so the total tutoring hours is 750 hours (15 hours/week x 50 weeks).
* Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the teacher is 1825 + 750 = 2575 hours.
* If she earns $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a tutor, her total annual income can be calculated as follows:
	+ Teaching hours: 2575 hours x $20/hour = $5150
	+ Tutoring hours: 750 hours x $30/hour = $2250
	+ Total annual income: $5150 + $2250 = $7400

To find out how much Aliya paid for the entire period, we need to calculate the following amounts:

* Total cost for the first six months = $140 x 6 = $840
* Reduced cost for the remaining six months = $140 x 6 x 9/10 = $720
* Total amount paid by Aliya = $840 + $720 = $1,560

Therefore, the total amount of money that Aliya paid for her streaming service is $1,560."

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 12 = 60

Solving for x, we get:

x = 38

Therefore, there are 38 pets in the neighborhood, including both dogs and cats."

Beatrix's amount = (24 x width) + (14 x length) = 24 x 8 + 14 x 50 = 672

Therefore, if both Marcel and Beatrix ate the same number of fruit roll-ups, Marcel would have eaten 190 rolls and Beatrix would have eaten 672 rolls."

* The distance traveled by the boat was 20 feet (or 6.2 meters).
* It took 16 seconds to travel this distance.
* The total distance traveled by the boat was 64 feet (or 20 meters).

= 128 liters

So, the boat emitted 128 liters of water during its journey."

Shasha has 10 pieces of 2x4x10 wood and 5 pieces of 4x4x10 wood. If she sells all of them, she will make a total profit of $3700.

Here's how we can calculate the profit:

* For the 2x4x10 wood, Shasha sold one piece for $10, so she made a profit of $10 - $5 = $5 per piece. Since she has 10 pieces, her total profit from these is $5 x 10 = $50.
* For the 4x4x10 wood, Shasha sold five pieces at $16 each, so she made a profit of $16 x 5 = $80.

Adding up the profits from both sets of wood, Shasha's total profit is $50 + $80 = $3700."

A) $3,750 per day
B) $6,250 per day
C) $9,375 per day

E) $18,750 per day

Answer: B) $6,250 per day

Explanation:

The hospital charges the doctors $150 per hour and the patients $200 per hour. Since there are 500 patients per day and each patient is observed for an average of 24 minutes, the total number of hours observed per day is:

500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:

Hospital revenue = Number of hours observed x Charge per hour
= 12,000 minutes/day x $200/minute
= $2,400,000 per day

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $6,250 per day."

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Jon has a set of 500 LEGO pieces that he wants to sort and count.
* He divides the pieces into three groups based on their size: small (300 pieces), medium (800 pieces), and large (400 pieces).
* The small group contains 3 times as many pieces as the large group, and the medium group contains 1/4 as many pieces as the large group.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces in each group:

Small group: 3 x 400 = 1200 pieces
Medium group: 800 / 4 = 200 pieces
Large group: 400 pieces

So, the total number of pieces is: 1200 + 200 + 400 = 2700 pieces.

Therefore, if John sorts all the LEGO pieces, he will have 2700 blocks."

"Response: 15分 48초  

Please explain how you arrived at the answer of 15 minutes and 48 seconds.

I'm happy to help! To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the question about Steve and Tom's distances from their homes to school and their speeds on their respective modes of transportation (bicycle and skateboard).

Let's start by using the distance formula to find out how far Steve has to travel to reach school:

Distance = Speed x Time

Since Steve is traveling at a speed of 3 miles per hour (which is equivalent to 4.8 kilometers per hour), and he has to travel for 3 miles (which is equal to 4.8 kilometers) to reach school, his time of travel can be calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 4.8 km / 3 mph
= 15 minutes and 24 seconds

Now, let's move on to Tom's case. Since Tom is traveling at a speed of 264 feet per minute (which is equivalent to 4.4 kilometers per hour), and he has to travel for 3 kilometers (which is equal to 1.9 miles) to reach school, his time of travel can be calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 1.9 mi / 4.4 km/h
= 440 seconds or approximately 7 minutes and 20 seconds

Now that we have the times required for both Steve and Tom to reach school, we can compare them to determine who will arrive first. As it turns out, Steve will arrive earlier than Tom by 15 minutes and 24 seconds. Therefore, the answer to the question is 15 minutes and 48 seconds."

Explanation:

The total cost of charging the tires for one day is calculated as follows:

* For the first two hours (0-2 hours), each tire costs $0.25 to charge. Therefore, the total cost for the two tires is $0.50 ($0.25 x 2).
* For the next three hours (2-5 hours), each tire costs $0.375 to charge. Therefore, the total cost for the two tires is $0.75 ($0.375 x 2).
* For the final hour (5-6 hours), each tire costs $0.50 to charge. Therefore, the total cost for the two tires is $1.00 ($0.50 x 2).

So, in total, it costs $100 to charge both tires for one day."

"Response:  The price of one pound of gold after 36 months will be $1,458.

Explanation:

The question asks about the price of one pound of gold after 36 months, assuming that its price increases by 20% every two months. We can use this information to calculate the price of one pound of gold at different time intervals.

Let's start with the initial price of one pound of gold, which is $20 per ounce (oz). Since the price increases by 20% every two months, we can calculate the new price as follows:

$20 x 1.2 = $24 per oz (after 2 months)
$24 x 1.2 = $28.80 per oz (after 4 months)
$28.80 x 1.2 = $35.76 per oz (after 6 months)
$35.76 x 1.2 = $42.92 per oz (after 8 months)
$42.92 x 1.2 = $50.32 per oz (after 10 months)
$50.32 x 1.2 = $60.41 per oz (after 12 months)
$60.41 x 1.2 = $72.52 per oz (after 14 months)
$72.52 x 1.2 = $85.63 per oz (after 16 months)
$85.63 x 1.2 = $100.75 per oz (after 18 months)
$100.75 x 1.2 = $121.04 per oz (after 20 months)
$121.04 x 1.2 = $145.80 per oz (after 22 months)
$145.80 x 1.2 = $172.24 per oz (after 24 months)
$172.24 x 1.2 = $209.76 per oz ("

"Response:  Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the information provided in your question, it seems that you walk an average of 30 kilometers per day during the week and around 10 miles (16 kilometers) on weekends. To calculate how many miles you can walk in a month, we need to divide the total distance walked by the number of days in the month. Let's assume there are 30 days in April for this calculation.

So, if you walk an average of 30 kilometers per day during the week, that means you cover a distance of:

30 km/day x 7 days/week = 210 km/week

And if you walk around 10 miles (16 kilometers) on weekends, that adds up to:

10 mi/weekend x 2 weekends/month = 20 mi/month

Now, let's add these two amounts together to get the total distance you can walk in a month:

210 km/week + 20 mi/month = 230 km/month

Therefore, based on the information provided, you can walk approximately 230 kilometers (or around 143 miles) in a month."

In this case, Zelda's total debt is $1800 (300 + 200 + 500), and she wants to pay at least 50% of it within a year. Therefore, her monthly payment would be: Total Debt / 12 months = $1800 / 12 = $150 per month. So, Zelda needs to pay $150 per month for 12 months to repay her debts completely.

To find the amount of money that Mandy owes to Benedict after three months, we need to calculate the interest on the loan. The interest rate is 2%, so we can multiply the principal (the initial amount borrowed) by the interest rate for the time period involved. In this case, the principal is $100 and the time period is 3 months, so the interest is:

$100 x 2% x 3/12 = $6

So, after three months, Mandy owes Benedict $100 + $6 = $106.

Answer: 35,742

Explanation:

To determine how many insects an ostrich needs to eat in a day, we need to consider the size of the ostrich and its metabolic rate. Let's assume that an average-sized ostrich (about 2 meters tall and 150 kg) has a metabolic rate of about 10% of its body weight per day. This means it needs to consume about 15 kg of food per day to maintain its energy requirements.

Since ostriches primarily feed on insects, let's estimate the amount of insects they can eat based on their preferred prey. According to some studies, ostriches prefer to feed on grasshoppers and crickets, which make up about 80% of their diet. Grasshoppers are typically around 1 cm long and 0.5 g in weight, while crickets are around 1.5 cm long and 0.7 g in weight.

Assuming an ostrich eats about 100 grams of insects per day (based on the above estimates), we can calculate the number of insects needed as follows:

Number of insects = Body weight / Food intake per day
= 15 kg / 100 g
= 150,000,000 insects

Therefore, an ostrich needs to eat approximately 150 million insects per day to meet its energy requirements."
