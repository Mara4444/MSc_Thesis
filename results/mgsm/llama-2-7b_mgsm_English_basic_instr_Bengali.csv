"Response: 160 hours

Answer: 160 hours

Explanation:
Jim watches TV for 2 hours per day, so in one week, he spends 14 hours (2 x 7) watching TV. Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 42 hours (14 x 3) watching TV in 4 weeks.
Similarly, since he reads for half as long as he watches TV, he spends 42/2 = 21 hours reading in 4 weeks. Therefore, the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 42 + 21 = 63 hours."

Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in the first aquarium is x. Then, the number of fish in the second aquarium is twice x, i.e., 2x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can write: 4 - 2(x) = 32. Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, there are 8 fish in the first aquarium and 16 fish in the second aquarium.
