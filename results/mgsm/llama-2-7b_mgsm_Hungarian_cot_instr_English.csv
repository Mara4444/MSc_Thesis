"Response: 
Janet has 16 eggs and eats 3 every day for breakfast. That means she has 16 x 3 = 48 eggs left after breakfast each day.
She then sells 4 of these eggs at $2 per egg, which is equal to $2 x 4 = $8. So, she makes $8 in profit from selling eggs every day.
Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes daily from selling eggs on the farmers' market is $8."
Response:  We have to add up the number of blue and white threads needed for each scarf. Since we need 2 blue threads per scarf, and there are 5 scarves in total, we need 10 blue threads (2 x 5 = 10). Similarly, since we need half as many white threads as blue threads, we need 5 white threads (10 / 2 = 5). Therefore, there are 10 + 5 = 15 threads in total required to make all 5 scarves.
Response:  The original value of the house is $80,000 and after renovation it increased to $130,000 which means that the profit made from renovating the house is $50,000 ($130,000 - $80,000). So, the return on investment (ROI) is 62.5% ($50,000 / $80,000).
Response:  If he runs three times per week and each time he runs 60 meters, then in one week he will run... (1) x 3 = 3 x 60 = 180 meters. So, he runs 180 meters per week.
"Response: 
Wendi gives three chickens 3 cups of mixed feed per day, which contains seeds, grains, and vegetables to keep them healthy. She gives each chicken 15 cups of food in the morning, 25 cups in the afternoon, and wants to know how many cups she should give them at dinner if her flock has 20 chickens.
So, we need to find out how much food each chicken needs per day.
Let's assume that the total amount of food given to all the chickens is equal to 3 x 15 + 3 x 25 = 180 cups of food per day.
Since there are 20 chickens in Wendi's flock, each chicken gets 180/20 = 9 cups of food per day.
Therefore, Wendi should give 9 cups of food to each of her 20 chickens at dinner time."
Response:  If we buy one glass for $5, then each subsequent glass will cost us (60/100) \* $5 = $3. So, if we want to buy 16 glasses, we will have to pay $3 \times 16 = $48.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many cows in Toulouse than in Charleston and four times as many cows in Charleston as in Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 cows, then Toulouse has 40 cows (twice as many). Charleston has 80 cows (four times as many as Seattle). Therefore, the total number of cows in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is: Toulouse - 40 cows + Charleston - 80 cows + Seattle - 20 cows = 120 cows.
"Response: 
Let's assume that Carla has already downloaded 100 GB of the file (out of 200 GB). So far, she has spent 5 hours downloading it (since each hour represents 2 GB / 60 = 0.03125 GB/minute).
Now, when Windows forces her to restart for updates installation, she needs to start over from the beginning and download another 100 GB in 40% of the time remaining, which is approximately 20 minutes (based on the formula: t = (remaining time) / (download speed)).
Therefore, the total time needed to download the entire file is:
Time = Total file size / Download speed + Time lost due to restarts = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute + 20 minutes = 8.33 hours."
"Response: 
John travels at a constant speed of $100 km/h$ for $3$ hours, which means he covers a distance of $\frac{3 \times 100}{60} = 50 km$.
After realizing that he has forgotten something important at home, he turns back and starts his journey again.
He spends the first $2$ hours of his return journey at a speed of $30 km/h$, covering a distance of $\frac{2 \times 30}{60} = 10 km$.
The remaining $2$ hours of his journey, he travels at a speed of $80 km/h$, covering a distance of $\frac{2 \times 80}{60} = 40 km$.
Therefore, the total distance traveled by John is:
$$ Distance = 50 km + 10 km + 40 km = 100 km $$
So, John is $100 km$ away from his home when he finishes his journey in $4$ hours."
"Response:  If Eliza works for $10/hour and she works 45 hours in one week, then her total hourly earnings are:
$10/hour x 45 hours = $450
So, Eliza's total weekly earnings are $450 + (1.2 x $450) = $630
Therefore, Eliza's weekly income is $630."
Response:  The number of downloads in the first month was 60. In the second month, there were three times as many downloads, so that is 180 (60 x 3). However, in the third month, there were 30% fewer downloads than in the second month, which means there were 126 (180 x 0.7) downloads in total. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months was 60 + 180 + 126 = 466.
"Response:  The total cost of the food is equal to the number of items multiplied by their price per unit. So, we have:
Teljes költség = (3 tucat fánk x $68) + (2 tucat mini muffin x $80) + (6 tucat mini sajtos süt x $55)
= $271
Therefore, the total cost was $271."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Carlos makes from selling citrons each year. Since he can sell 7 citrons for $1.5 per unit, his annual revenue is:

$1.5 x 7 = $10.5

Next, we need to subtract the cost of maintaining the tree (water and fertilizer) from Carlos's annual income. The cost of maintenance is $3 per year. So, after deducting this amount, Carlos's net profit becomes:

$10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Now, let's find out when Carlos will start making a profit from his citron trees. To do this, we divide the initial investment ($90) by the annual net profit ($7.5):

$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to break even on his citron trees investment."
Response:  If Melanie sold one-third of her stockpile (3/5), then she had 5 - 1 = 4 porszívók left initially. She sold 2 in the red house and 1 in the green house, so she had 4 - 2 - 1 = 1 porszívó left after selling. Therefore, Melanie used 4 porszívók initially.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students in the dance class, 2 are enrolled in contemporary dance (20/100 = 0.2), 5 are enrolled in jazz dance (20/100 = 0.5), and 13 are enrolled in hip-hop dance (20/100 = 0.6). So, the percentage of students who were enrolled in hip-hop dance is 0.6 or 60%.
"Response:  The value of the two options are as follows: Option 1: $5000 x 2.5% = $125; Option 2: $8000 x 1.2% = $96. So, if the trader chooses option 1, he will make a profit of $125."
Response:  On day one, both trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel west for 80 miles. Then they turn north and travel another 150 miles. So, in total, each train traveled 230 miles (80 + 150) during the first day. On the second day, they again travel north for 150 miles, so each train traveled a total of 380 miles (230 + 150) over the two days.
"Response: 
Jill works as a teacher for 35 hours per week and as an exercise instructor for 15 hours per week.
Teaching rate: $20/hour = $700/week (based on 35 hours)
Exercise instruction rate: $30/hour = $450/week (based on 15 hours)
Total income per week: $700 + $450 = $1,150/week
Since she works for 50 weeks in a year, her annual income is:
$1,150/week x 50 weeks = $57,500/year"
Response:  If Claire makes three eggs omelets every morning for 3 months (4 weeks), then she will make a total of 3 x 7 = 21 omelets in one month. Therefore, if she continues making 3 omelets per day for 4 months, she will have made a total of 21 x 4 = 84 omelets in 4 months. So, Claire will eat 84 toasts in 4 months.
Response:  We know that Marissa walked for 12 miles in total and it took her one hour to cover the first 6 kilometers. Therefore, she covered the remaining distance of 2 kilometers in half an hour or 30 minutes. So, her average speed during this time was 4 miles per hour. To find out how fast she had to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average speed = Total distance / Time taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken is 30 minutes, so the average speed would be: Average speed = 12 miles / 30 minutes = 0.8 miles/minute.
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice and we want to mix it with 15 liters of grapefruit juice. Since the mixture will be in a ratio of 3/4 water to 1/4 fruit juice, we can calculate that there are 7.5 liters of water (3/4 x 15) and 2.5 liters of fruit juice (1/4 x 15). Now, when I add 1 liter of orange juice to this mixture, there will be 8 liters of water left (7.5 + 0.5 = 8), so the amount of water remaining in the original 24 liters is 6 liters (24 - 8 = 6).
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, we know that:
Raymond is an uncle of Samantha (uncle and niece relationship).
Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha (given as 6 évvel korábban született).
Raymond is now 23 years old (Raymondnak 23 évesen volt fia).
Samantha is currently 31 years old (Samantha most 31 éves).
Now, let's calculate the age difference between Raymonnd and his son:
Age difference = Age of Raymond - Age of his son
= 23 -?
We are given that Raymond's son is 6 years younger than him, so:
? = 23 - 6
? = 17
Therefore, Raymond's son is 17 years old.
So, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then she must have been born when Raymond was 48 years old (31 - 17 = 24 years ago).
Hence, the answer to the question is:
Raymond's son was born 24 years ago."
Response:  The first three customers bought one DVD each, so Billy sold 1 x 3 = 3 DVDs in total. Then, the next two customers bought 2 x 2 = 4 DVDs together, and finally, the last three customers did not buy any DVDs at all. Therefore, Billy sold a total of 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs that day.
Response:  The rate of melting is given as 2 cm/hour. So, in one hour, the gyertya will melt 2 cm. Now, we are asked how much shorter the gyertya will be after 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00). To find this out, we need to multiply the rate of melting by the time period: 2 cm/hour x 4 hours = 8 cm. Therefore, the gyertya will be 8 cm shorter at 17:00 than it was at 13:00.
"Response:  The original price of the book was $19.50 and it has a 25% discount. So we can calculate the original price as follows:
$19.50 x (1 - 0.25) = $19.50 x 0.75 = $14.38
Therefore, the original price of the book was $14.38."
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for all of these items. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 

$12 + $3 + $1,50 + $8,50 = $50

Now let's solve for $x$, which is the number of boxes of pizza that Marie bought:

$12 + $3 + $1,50 + x = $50

Subtracting $3 from both sides gives us:

$1,50 + x = $47

Dividing both sides by $1,50 gives us:

x = 31

So, Marie bought 31 boxes of pizza."
Response:  The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50, and the cost of one pair of pants is $22.50. Therefore, the total cost of three pairs of shorts = $3 x $16.50 = $49.50. Similarly, the total cost of three pairs of pants = $3 x $22.50 = $67.50. Now, let's find out how much money Mishka spent on shoes. Since each pair of shoes costs $42, then the total cost of three pairs of shoes = $3 x $42 = $126. So, in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $232.50 on all the clothes and shoes.
"Response:  The number of ice cream cups that Cynthia can eat in one day is given as $15$. Since she buys $15$ ice cream cups per day, and she does this for $60$ days, then the total number of ice cream cups she eats is:
$$\text{Total number of ice cream cups} = \text{Number of ice cream cups per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 15 \times 60 = 900$$
So, after $60$ days, Cynthia will have eaten $900$ ice cream cups."
Response:  We know that Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. The first stop was after 20 miles and the second stop was before the end of the trip (which is 60 - 15 = 45 miles). So, the distance between the two stops is 45 - 20 = 25 miles. Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between the two stops.
Response:  We know that Gloria buys a pair of shoes for $50 and then finds another pair of shoes that costs half as much as the first pair. So, if the first pair cost $50, the second pair must cost $25. Now we are given two options: either the shoes cost $17 each or the shoes cost $34 each. If they cost $17 each, the total cost of both pairs would be $34 + $34 = $68, which is more than the amount Gloria has ($50). Therefore, the shoes must cost $34 each. So, the price of the shoes is $34 each, and the price of the socks is $17 each.
Response:  If Darrell is currently 49 years old and Allen is currently 59 years old, then in 10 years, Allen will be 69 years old. Therefore, Allen will be 10 years older than Darrell in 10 years.
"Response:  According to Gunter, there are 80 jelly beans in the glass. One of his friends thinks that half of them are red (i.e., 40). Another friend believes that only 20 jelly beans are red. And finally, a third friend estimates that there are 130 jelly beans in total, with 25% more than the first estimate (which is 165). So, let's calculate each estimate separately and then find their average:

Estimate 1: 80 jelly beans x 50% = 40 red jelly beans
Estimate 2: 40 jelly beans x 50% = 20 red jelly beans
Estimate 3: 165 jelly beans + 40 red jelly beans = 205 jelly beans
Average: (40 + 20 + 205) / 3 = 265 jelly beans
So, based on these estimates, the average number of red jelly beans in the glass is approximately 265."
"Response:  If each dog spends 0.5 hours per day for exercise and activities, then in one week they will spend:

* 7 days x 0.5 hours/day = 3.5 hours/week

So, the dogs spend 3.5 hours per week with their owner."
Response:  We know that Gretchen has more silver coins than gold coins. So, if she has x gold coins, then she has (x + 30) silver coins. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: x + 30 = 110. Solving for x, we get x = 80. So, Gretchen has 80 gold coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has five ekszere more than Raymon... (read more)
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he has scored a total of 4 x 20 = 80 points in this time period. Now, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more than his previous score, which means he scored (25/100) x 80 = 20 points. Therefore, Mike has scored a total of 80 + 20 = 100 points.
Response:  Terry eats two yogurts per day, so he consumes 2 x 2 = 4 yogurts in one month (30 days). Since each yogurt costs $5, Terry spends $4 x 30 = $120 on yogurt in one month.
Response:  We know that John has sold all of his games and used the money to buy video games. He had 13 Lego sets initially, each priced at $15. Since he bought 8 video games for $20, he spent $20 - $15 = $5 on them. So, he has $5 left after buying the video games. Therefore, there are still 13 - 8 = 5 Lego sets remaining with him.
"Response:  On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of 3/6 \* 100 = 50 km. On the second and third days, he runs for half as much time (since ""fele"" means ""half"") and covers distances of 25 km each. Therefore, in total, he covers a distance of 50 + 25 + 25 = 100 km. So, he runs at a speed of 100 km / 3 = 33.33 km/h."
Response:  If Dana can run twice as fast as she walks and can jump $3$ miles in $1$ hour while walking at a speed of $x$ miles per hour, then she can cover a distance of $\frac{3}{2}x$ miles in $1$ hour while running at a speed of $2x$ miles per hour. Therefore, if she spends $\frac{3}{4}$ of her time running and $\frac{1}{4}$ of her time walking, she will be able to cover a total distance of $\frac{3}{4}\times\frac{3}{2}x + \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{9}{4}x$ miles in $1$ hour. So, if she runs with a speed of $2x$ miles per hour, she will be able to cover a distance of $\frac{9}{4}x$ miles in $60$ minutes.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Ben.
Suzy's iPhone is one year old.
Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone.
From this information, we can conclude that Brandon's iPhone is eight years old (4 x 2 = 8)."
Response:  When Polly had the sapphire gemstone in her hand, she could throw the golden lance 1200 feet away from herself (400 + 800). However, when she didn't have the gemstone, she could only throw it 400 feet away (not including the distance traveled by the flames). So, if we subtract the distance traveled by the flames (which is equal to half of 400 = 200), then Polly could throw the lance 1000 feet away from herself without the gemstone.
Response:  We know that Jones had 5 big apples to slice for his guests' breakfast and he cut each apple into 8 pieces. So, in total, he had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of apple. Then, after the guests left and ate their share of the apple slices, there were 14 remaining pieces of apple. Therefore, the number of pieces of apple that the guests took was 14 - 40 = -26 pieces.
Response:  If one serving of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in total (300g / 5 = 60g per serving), then we can calculate how many calories each serving contains as follows: Calories per serving = Total number of calories / Number of servings = 250cal/serving x 60g/servicing = 15,000 calories. Now let's see if the person has already consumed their daily goal of 2000 calories or not. If they have already consumed 1800 calories, that means they still need to consume another 200 calories from other food sources to reach their target. Therefore, the person can eat an additional 4 servings of chips (4 x 60g = 240g) without exceeding their daily calorie limit.
Response:  If Charlie sells one meadowfoam seed for $10 and can make 10 candles from it, then he has made a profit of $9 ($10 - $1). So if he sells each candle for $2, his total profit will be $2 x 10 = $20. Therefore, if he makes 20 candles and sells them all at $2 each, his net profit will be $40 ($20 x 2).
"Response: 
Day 1 (Tuesday): Meredith wrote 5 articles, so she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours writing those articles.
Day 2 (Wednesday): Meredith wrote 7 articles, so she spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours writing those articles.
Day 3 (Thursday): Meredith wrote 6 articles, so she spent 6 x 4 = 24 hours writing those articles.
Total time spent writing articles in the three days = 20 + 28 + 24 = 72 hours."
"Response: 
Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her bag before she left for work.
She stopped at a store and bought another package of Post-it notes (which we will call ""the new package""). The new package contained x Post-it notes.
After stopping at the store, Candice used some of the Post-it notes from both the original bag and the new package to make 220 different cups of coffee at work. This means that after using them all up, there were y Post-it notes remaining from the original bag and z Post-it notes remaining from the new package.
We know that the total number of Post-it notes Candice had is equal to 80 + x = 230. So, we can set up the equation:
y + z = 230... (1)
Now, let's solve for x:
x = 230 - (y + z)... (2)
Substituting equation (2) into equation (1):
y + z = 230 - (y + z)
Simplifying:
2y + z = 230
Subtracting y from both sides:
z = 110
So, there were 110 Post-it notes remaining from the new package.
Therefore, the answer is 110."
Response:  We know that John bought twice as many red scarves as blue ones. So he bought $2 \times$ 2 = $4$ red scarves and $1 \times $ 40 = $40$ blue scarves. Therefore, John spent a total of $4 + $40 = $44$ dollars on scarves.
"Response:  The length of the rope is given as 4 feet (or 120 cm), and each piece of twine is 6 inches long (or 15 cm). To find out how many pieces of twine Tracy used, we can divide the total length of the rope by the length of each piece of twine:

Total length of rope = 4 ft = 120 cm
Length of each piece of twine = 6 in = 15 cm
Number of pieces of twine = Total length of rope / Length of each piece of twine
= 120 cm / 15 cm
= 8
Therefore, Tracy used 8 pieces of twine to tie the tomato plants in the garden."
Response:  The number of floors is 15 and each floor has 8 units, so the total number of units in the building is 15 x 8 = 120. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied (which means 3/4 x 120 = 90), then there are 90 - 15 = 75 empty apartments in the building. Therefore, there are 75 empty apartments in the building.
Response:  If the chickens lay 252 eggs per day and Lloyd sells each egg for $2, then he makes $2 x 252 = $504 per day from the eggs alone. So, in one week (7 days), Lloyd makes $504 x 7 = $3,530 from the eggs.
"Response: 
Tom can travel at 10 miles per hour during the daytime hours of 1-4 pm. Therefore, he will cover a distance of 10 x 4 = 40 miles in that time period.
Then, when he turns around and heads back, he will travel at a speed of 6 miles per hour. This means it will take him 6 x 4 = 24 miles to return to his starting point.
So, in total, Tom has traveled 40 + 24 = 64 miles during this time period."
Response:  If we take away 30 comics from Uriah, each of which has a weight of 1 kg, then he will have lost 30 kg. Now, if we compare this with the weight of the games, each of which has a weight of half a kilogram (0.5 kg), it means that to compensate for the loss of weight due to removing the comics, Uriah needs to remove 60 games (30/0.5 = 60). Therefore, the correct answer is 60 games.
Response:  On Thursday (csütörtök), the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 from truck tire repair and $4 x 4 = $16 from car tire repair, for a total of $52. On Friday (péntek), the mechanic repaired 12 cars but did not repair any truck tires, so he earned $4 x 12 = $48 from car tire repair. Therefore, the mechanic earned a total of $52 + $48 = $100 in revenue on those two days.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are seven kittens that were brought home by the two sisters from the local animal shelter when their mother called them to inform them that two of their housecats had just given birth to kittens. The number of kittens born to each cat is as follows:
Patchy - 3 times as many kittens as the others (so 3 x 7 = 21 kittens)
Trixie - 12 kittens
So, the total number of kittens brought home by the Doubtfire family is 21 + 12 = 33 kittens."
Response:  We know that Jean has 30 marbles and he gives two of them to his friend. So, Jean now has 28 marbles left. He wants to put these 28 marbles in a box, but he can only fit two marbles in each bag. Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with marbles (28 / 2 = 14).
Response:  If Peter can go to the movies 4 times in one week and each ticket costs $7, then he will spend $28 for all tickets ($7 x 4). Since he also spends $7 for popcorn each time, his total expenses for the week will be $35 ($28 + $7). So, if he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies 12 times ($42 / $35 = 12).
"Response:  The maximum weight of each box is 15 pounds (lb), and there are n boxes in total. Therefore, the total weight of all boxes is:

Weight of all boxes = Number of boxes x Weight of each box
= n x 15 lb

Since the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 lb, we can set up the following equation:

Total weight of driver + Total weight of empty truck = Maximum weight that the bridge can hold
= 3755 lb

Now, let's solve for n, which is the number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's capacity:

Number of boxes = Total weight of driver + Total weight of empty truck - Maximum weight that the bridge can hold
= 3755 lb - 5000 lb
= -1245 lb

So, the largest number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while staying within the bridge's capacity is:

Maximum number of boxes = -1245 lb / 15 lb per box
= -83 lb

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his groceries. Then, as it was a delivery service, they added 25% to the final amount which means an additional $10 (since $40 x 25% = $10). So, the total cost of groceries became $50 ($40 + $10). Next, they subtracted $3 for shipping costs, leaving $47 ($50 - $3). Finally, he gave $4 in tips, bringing the total cost to $51 ($47 + $4). Therefore, the final price of groceries for Stephen was $51.
Response:  We know that there are 6 groups of malnuts and each group has 20 fruits in total. So, the number of malnuts is 6 x 20 = 120. Additionally, we have 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the tree, so the total number of malnuts including those is also 120. Therefore, there are 120 malnuts in total.
Response:  We know that there are 25 oranges in total and we want to find out how many of them are good (i.e., not rotten). From the problem statement, we can conclude that 1 orange is rotten, so we have 24 good oranges left. Now, let's calculate the percentage of good oranges: 24/25 = 96%. So, 96% of the oranges are good. Finally, since we were asked for an exact number, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 97 good oranges.
"Response: 
Janet pays $500 for the material and gives $800 to the jeweler to make it into an earring. So far, she has spent $1,300 ($500 + $800). Then, she donates 10% of that amount, which is $130 (10% of $1,300), to charity. Therefore, Janet has spent a total of $1,430 ($1,300 + $130) on the earring."
Response:  If he works for 40 years at the same company and gets an annual pension of $50,000, then his total work experience is 40 x 50 = $2,000,000. After 20 years, the pension will increase by 5%, so it will be $100,000 per year (20 x $5000). When he retires after 30 years, his annual pension will be $100,000 / 1.05^30 = $678,947.
"Response:  The company pays $140 per month for the streaming service in the first half of the year and then reduces it by 10% to $126 per month in the second half of the year. So, the total amount paid for the entire year is:

First half (Jan - Jun): $140 x 6 = $840
Second half (Jul - Dec): $126 x 6 = $732
Total: $840 + $732 = $1572
Therefore, the person will pay a total of $1572 for the entire year."
Response:  We know that Sophia traveled 160 km since her last fill-up and used 4 gallons of gasoline to refill her tank. Since she had 12 gallons of gasoline in total (according to the car's manual), we can calculate how much distance she could travel with one gallon of gasoline as follows: Distance = Total fuel / Fuel consumption per unit distance = 12 gal / 4 gal/160 km = 375 km Therefore, Sophia could travel approximately 375 km with one gallon of gasoline.
"Response: 
Jim watches TV for two hours and then takes a nap of unknown duration. He spends half an hour reading after waking up.
To find out how many hours he spends watching TV and reading in total, we can multiply the number of times he does this per week by the number of weeks. So, if he does it three times a week, that means he spends 3 x 4 = 12 hours/week watching TV and reading.
Now, let's calculate the total time spent over four weeks:
Total time = Time/week x Number of weeks = 12 hours/week x 4 weeks = 48 hours
So, Jim spends 48 hours watching TV and reading over four weeks."
Response:  Each school has to send at least one boy and one girl player, so there are 2 players from each school. Then we have 4 schools participating, so in total, we need 8 players (2 x 4 = 8). Additionally, each school also sent an coach, so the total number of people sent by all schools is 9 (8 players + 1 coach). Therefore, the answer is 9.
Response:  We know that there are more diamonds than rubies in the chest. So, if we have x diamonds and y rubies, then x > y (since there are more diamonds). Also, we know that there are 175 gemstones in total, so x + y = 175 (since each stone is either a diamond or a ruby). Now, we can solve for x and y using these two equations simultaneously. Solving them gives us x = 120 and y = 55. Therefore, there were 120 diamonds and 55 rubies in the treasure chest.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in Dr. Wertz's school. So, if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys. Since every teacher has 60 students, including both boys and girls, we can say that the number of teachers is also equal to 60. Therefore, we have the equation: 2x = 60. Solving for x, we get: x = 30. So, there are 30 teachers in Dr. Wertz's school.
Response:  If Bailey starts with $x dollars and gets $5 every week for 8 weeks, then after 8 weeks he will have $5 \times 8 = 40$ additional dollars, so his total amount of money is now $x + 40$. Since he has $100$ dollars at the end of 8 weeks, we can set up the equation: $x + 40 = 100$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 60$. So, Bailey started with $60$ dollars.
"Response: 
Judy teaches dance for 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), and each class lasts for 2 hours. Therefore, she teaches a total of 10 classes per week (5 days x 2 hours/day).
Since there are 15 students in each class, Judy earns $15 x 15 = $225 per day from teaching dance.
Now, let's calculate how much money Judy earns in a week:
$225 per day x 7 days/week = $1,625 per week
Therefore, Judy earns $1,625 per week from teaching dance."
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second one has twice as many instructions as the first (which is 40). So, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions in total to prepare both dishes.
"Response:  If Tommy collects $3 for each of his 43 slices of bread and $4 for each of his 23 pieces of sausage bread, he will have collected a total of:

$3 x 43 = $129 for the bread
$4 x 23 = $92 for the sausage bread
Total amount collected = $129 + $92 = $221
Therefore, Tommy has collected $221 in total."
Response:  The total cost of the phone is $150. She will pay for it in three installments with a 2% interest rate per month. So, she will pay $150 x 3 = $450 over three months. Therefore, she will pay $450 / 3 = $150 per month.
"Response:  If we multiply the number of each type of flower that Artie sells by its price per unit, we get:

* Aranykoptuka (gold coins): 12 x $2.74 = $32.88
* Petunia: 9 x $1.87 = $16.53
* Begonia: 17 x $2.12 = $35.84

So, if Artie sells 12 edible gold coins, 9 edible petunias, and 17 edible begonias, he will make a total of $32.88 + $16.53 + $35.84 = $84.25."
Response:  If we have $n$ layers of sandcastle with height $h$, then the volume of each layer is $\frac{1}{n} \times h^2$. Since there are $4$ layers in total, the total volume of the castle is $\frac{1}{4} \times h^2$. Now, let's find out how much area each layer has. The area of each layer is given by $A = \frac{1}{n} \times h^2$. So, if we want to know the average area per layer, we can divide the total area by the number of layers: $\text{average area} = \frac{Total Area}{Number of Layers} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \times h^2}{4} = \frac{h^2}{4}$. Therefore, the average area of one layer is $\boxed{h^2/4}$.
Response:  The first year of the cat's life, the veterinarian recommends giving it 1 cup (csésze) of food every day for the first 180 days, which is equivalent to 6 months. Then, from the age of 4 months to 1 year old, the cat should be given 2 cups (csésze) of food per day. Therefore, if Cecilia wants to feed her new kitten throughout its entire lifetime, she will need 110 zsaks (bags) of cat food, since there are 110 cups in each zsak. So, the answer is 110 zsaks of cat food.
Response:  We know that Ha Raymond has twice as many clothes as Sarah and Sarah has four times as many clothes as David. So, if Sarah has 400 pounds of clothes, then Raymond has 2 x 400 = 800 pounds of clothes. Therefore, the difference between the amount of clothes Raymond and David have is 800 - 160 = 640 pounds.
Response:  If Vincent can buy three bunches of flowers for $2.50 or two bunches for $1, then one bunch costs half that amount, which is $1.25 per bunch. Therefore, if he takes 18 bunches at the cheaper price of $1 each, he will save $16 ($18 x $1 = $16). So, in total, Vincent saves $16 by taking 18 bunches instead of just 3 bunches.
Response:  The cost of grooming is $100 and the discount offered is 30%. So, the new price after applying the discount would be: $100 x (1 - 0.3) = $70. Therefore, the cost of grooming would be $70.
Response:  The two girls received 1/6 of a liter of water each, so they have 2/6 liters of water in total (since there are 2 girls). Then, the boy got 6 liters of water, which means that he has 6 + 2 = 8 liters of water in total (since there is one boy). So, there are 8 - 2 = 6 liters of water left after the boys drank their share.
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 matrices initially. Then he gave 9 to his sister and took back 2 from her, so he had 10 - 9 + 2 = 7 matrices left. After that, he got 23 for his birthday, so now he has 7 + 23 = 30 matrices in total.
Response:  The weight of Grace is 80 kg and Alex weighs twice as much as Grace, which means his weight is 160 kg (2 x 80). Therefore, the combined weight of both in pounds is: $80 + 160 = 240$ pounds.
Response:  If Dan has 3 rose bushes and each bush contains 25 roses, then the total number of roses is 3 x 25 = 75. Since each rose has 8 petals, the total number of petals is 75 x 8 = 600. Therefore, there are 600 petals in total.
Response:  If they won more games than they lost, then their win-loss record is positive. So, we can write W = number of wins and L = number of losses. We know that W > L, so W - L = number of times they won more than they lost. Therefore, the answer is (W - L) = 8.
"Response:  We know that Gene has been going on vacation every year since he was 23 years old (which is now 34). So, in total, he has gone on vacation for...

1. Age 23: 0 vacations
2. Age 24: 1 vacation
3. Age 25: 2 vacations
4. Age 26: 3 vacations
5. Age 27: 4 vacations
6. Age 28: 5 vacations

9. Age 31: 8 vacations
10. Age 32: 9 vacations
11. Age 33: 10 vacations
12. Age 34: 11 vacations

So, the number of decorative blocks Gene has collected is 11."
Response:  The alarm went off four times in total. On the first occasion, it sounded for three times (as stated in the problem). On the second occasion, it sounded for six times (three times as much as the first occasion). And on the third occasion, it sounded for half of the time it took to sound on the second occasion. So, the number of times the alarm went off is: 4 + 3 = 7.
Response:  If Sylvie has been working for five years at the company and her salary was $600 per month initially, then after five years it will be $600 x (1 + 0.1) = $720 per month. Now, according to the policy, every year the company increases the salary of its employees by 10%. So, in the next three years, Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% each year, resulting in an annual salary of $720 x (1 + 0.1) = $849 after three years. Therefore, Sylvie's current annual salary is $849.
"Response:  We know that Marilyn's first album sold 10 times more copies than Harald's. So if Marilyn sold $x$ copies, Harald sold $\frac{x}{10}$ copies. Since they both sold a total of $88,000$ copies, we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{x}{10} + \frac{x}{10} = 88,000$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$2x = 880,000$$

Now, dividing both sides by $2$, we get:

$$x = 440,000$$

So, Marilyn sold $440,000$ copies of her first album and Harald sold $\frac{440,000}{10} = 44,000$ copies of his album."
Response:  The number of guests invited is 16 and each guest needs 75 gift bags, so we need to make 75 x 16 = $1,200 worth of gift bags.
Response:  If one adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of crunchy salad and one child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, then how many pounds will each child eat? So, if there are 5 children at the picnic, they will together eat 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 pounds of crunchy salad. Now, let's calculate how much total weight of crunchy salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic: Total weight of crunchy salad needed = Number of adults + Number of children x Amount of food each child will eat Total weight of crunchy salad needed = 20 + 5 x 0.5 = 40 pounds. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 40 pounds of crunchy salad to the picnic.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Jan has three times as many pets at home as Maria does.
Maria has two pets at home.
Cindy has four pets at home.
So, if we combine all of these statements, we can conclude that:
Jan has 3 x 2 = 6 pets at home (since he has three times as many pets as Maria).
Maria has 2 pets at home.
Cindy has 4 pets at home.
In total, then, there are 6 + 2 + 4 = 12 pets at home."
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Age of Amy = Age of Jackson + 5
Age of Amy = Age of Corey - 2
Now, we are given that James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey. So, we can write another equation as follows:
Age of James = Age of Corey - 1
Substituting the value of Age of Corey from the first equation, we get:
Age of James = (Age of Amy) - 1
= (5) - 1
= 4
So, Jackson is 4 years old."
Response:  We know that Lee ran 400 meters in 38 seconds without changing his diet. If he had run it in 36 seconds (which is 2% faster than before), then he would have run it in 38 - 36 = 2 seconds slower than before. So if Gerald runs it in 38 seconds with a 10% improvement in speed due to his new diet, then he will run it in 38 + (10% of 38) = 38 + 3.8 = 41.8 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters in 41.8 seconds.
Response:  According to the problem statement, there are 12 fewer domestic animals in the area than dogs and cats combined. So, if there are x dogs and x cats, then the total number of domestic animals is: x + (x \* 2) = 60 - 12 = 48. Therefore, there are 48 domestic animals in the area.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls. So, the number of boys is 40 (2/5 x 200). Now, we need to find out how many girls are not in the scout group. Since 2/3 of the remaining students are girls, the number of girls who are not in the scout group is 60 (2/3 x 160). Therefore, there are 60 girls who are not in the scout group.
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James only slept for half of that (i.e., 4.5 hours), then we can calculate how much longer Harry slept as follows:

Harry slept for 9 hours = 9 x 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes
James slept for 4.5 hours = 4.5 x 60 minutes/hour = 270 minutes

So, Harry slept for 270 more minutes than James. In other words, Harry slept for 540 - 270 = 270 minutes more than James."
Response:  We know that when Freda cooked the soup with parsley, the volume of the soup decreased by half. So, if we assume that the original volume of the soup was 100 uncia (since there were 16 uncia of parsley), then the volume of the soup after Freda added it would be 50 uncia. Now, since each serving size of the soup contained 32 uncia, and Freda used up her last serving of parsley, which had a volume of 32 uncia, then we can conclude that Freda used up 3/4 of the total volume of the soup, or 50/4 = 12 1/2 uncia of parsley. Therefore, Freda used 12 1/2 uncia of parsley to make her soup.
"Response:  The total number of cars initially on the highway is 30. In the first 15 minutes, some cars passed through the traffic jam (but we don't know how many). Then, in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars passed through the traffic jam. Finally, 5 cars left the line to avoid passing through the traffic jam. So, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is:

Total cars = Initial cars + Cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 min
= 30 + (Some cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 min)

We are asked to find out how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, so we need to solve for ""Some cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 min"". We can do this by using the information given in the question:

Some cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 min = Total cars - Number of cars that left the line to avoid passing through the traffic jam
= 30 - 5
= 25

So, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25."
"Response: 
Mary received 18 new plants from her favorite plant nursery yesterday. Of these, she already has two potted plants in her big country house with 40 window panes. Since she wants to share each of them equally among her friends and family, she will give away half of the remaining 16 plants (16/2 = 8). So, Mary will have 8 plants left after sharing them."
Response:  The first friend pressed the bell 20 times before Jerome opened it, so the second friend pressed it $5\times$more than the first friend. Therefore, the second friend pressed it $30$ times ($5\times(20)$). Now, we know that the third friend pressed it $10\times$more than the second friend, so he pressed it $30+10=40$ times more than the second friend. Finally, if the fourth friend pressed it $60$ times, then the total number of times all four friends pressed the bell is $40+30+20+60=170$. So, there were $170$ rings at the doorbell.
"Response:  We know that there are 36 pages in total to read from the four textbooks (Science = 4 + Társadalomtudományok = 2 + History = 7 + Geography = 8). If we divide this number by the number of days left to finish reading (7), we get an average number of pages per day:
Average pages per day = Total pages / Number of days remaining = 36 / 7 = 5 pages per day."
Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), John drinks one glass of water before each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Therefore, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day (1 glass/meal x 3 meals/day). Since there are 7 days in a week, John drinks 21 glasses of water per week (3 glasses/day x 7 days/week). Now, let's calculate how many glasses of water John drinks during the weekends (Saturday and Sunday): He doesn't drink any water during these days as he prefers to rest and relax instead. So, John drinks 0 glasses of water on Saturday and Sunday combined. Therefore, the total number of glasses of water that John drinks in a week is 21 + 0 = 21 glasses.
Response:  The city is 42 miles wide from the oceanfront to the other side of town. If it takes 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, then the distance between the two sides of town must be equal to 10/60 \* 42 = 7.33 miles. So in 10 minutes, the fog bank will cover an area of approximately 7.33 miles x 42 miles = 305.84 square miles.
Response:  If Poppy has placed 1000 pieces of candy in the box initially, and she has put 25% (or 250) of them on the table, then there are 750 pieces left in the box (1000 - 250 = 750). Now, if Poppy's mother takes out another third (or 250 pieces), then there will be 500 pieces left in the box (750 - 250 = 500). So, there are still 500 pieces of candy left in the box after Poppy's mother took some out.
Response:  If Cody eats three times as much bread as Amir, then for every bread that Amir eats, Cody will eat three of them. So if Amir eats 5 pieces of bread, Cody will eat 15 pieces (3 x 5 = 15).
"Response:  The volume of each box is given as follows:

* Smallest box (5 cubic units): V = 5
* Middle-sized box (6 cubic units): V = 6
* Largest box (4 cubic units): V = 4

So, the total volume of all three boxes together is:

Vtotal = V1 + V2 + V3 = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 cubic units

Therefore, the total internal volume of the three boxes is 15 cubic units."
Response:  We know that Frankie watched TV for 7 hours in total. On Monday and Wednesday, he watched an hour-long episode each night. So, he watched 2 x 1 = 2 hour-long episodes on those days. On Tuesday, he watched a 30-minute show in the evening. Therefore, he watched 1 x 30 = 30 minutes of TV on Tuesday. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched another hour-long episode. So, he watched 1 x 60 = 60 minutes of TV on Thursday. Finally, on Friday, he watched two hour-long episodes until late in the day. Therefore, he watched 2 x 60 = 120 minutes of TV on Friday. In summary, Frankie watched a total of 2 + 30 + 60 + 120 = 210 minutes of TV. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours as follows: 210 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3.5 hours. So, Frankie watched 3.5 hours of 30-minute shows on Saturday.
Response:  Last year, Henry wanted to sell $2x$ sürtemények for the local bake-off competition. When he finished sütét, he realized that he had sütött $2x + 15 = 35$ more than he intended. Now, after dropping $5$, he has $110 - 5 = 105$ sürtemény left. So last year, Henry sütött $105 / 2 = 52$ sürteményt.
"Response:  If you buy $3 worth of gas at the local gas station and get a $20 refund per gallon, how much will you pay for 10 gallons of gas in total?

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3/gallon = $30

Step 2: Subtract the $20 refund per gallon from the total cost = $10 (since you are getting a $20 refund per gallon)

Therefore, after using the app to get the $20 refund, you will pay $10 for 10 gallons of gas."
Response:  If we assume that both Marcell and Beatrice eat equally, then...
Response:  The boat took in two liters of water every ten seconds it traveled through the water. Since Julia traveled for sixteen seconds before reaching shore, she absorbed two liters x 16 = 32 liters of water during that time. So, when she reached shore, there were 32 - 20 (the amount of water the boat could hold) = 12 liters of water left in the boat. Therefore, Julia's boat had 12 liters of water remaining when she reached shore.
"Response:  The number of times the table is cleaned per day = Number of hours each teacher uses the room / Total number of hours available in a day. So, if we assume that there are 8 hours in a day (since it's not specified otherwise), then...
Number of times the table is cleaned per day = 2 hours/teacher x 4 teachers = 8 times per day."
Response:  If Ryan planted two flowers and 5 of them did not grow, then after 15 days there will be 2 + 5 = 7 flowers in total. So, the answer is 7.
Response:  We know that Brittany can take 50 times more photos than Jamal. So if Jamal takes 1800 photos, then Brittany takes 50 x 1800 = 90,000 photos. Now we need to find out how many crows are in Jamal's photo among all these photos taken by Brittany. Since there are as many crows in Jamal's photo as there are photos taken by Brittany, the number of crows in Jamal's photo is equal to the total number of photos taken by Brittany divided by the number of crows in Jamal's photo. Therefore, the number of crows in Jamal's photo is 90,000 / (number of crows in Jamal's photo). Since Jamal's photo has 36 crows, we have 90,000 / 36 = 2500. So there are 2500 crows in Jamal's photo among the 90,000 photos taken by Brittany.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha bought one small piece of wood for $10 and then he decided to sell all the remaining pieces. So, there are ten 2x4x10 tables left, each priced at $10, which means they have a total value of $100. Additionally, there are five 4x4x10 tables that were purchased for $16 each, so their total value is $80. Therefore, the total value of all the pieces Sasha has is $180. Since he spent $100 on them, his profit will be $80.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Katy used 7:13 = 56/8 of cocoa and 1/8 of water. So she used 56/8 \* 120 = 672 grams of cocoa and 1/8 \* 120 = 15 grams of water in total. Therefore, Katy used 672 grams / 7 = 96 grams of cocoa per cup of tea.
Response:  If John buys 2 pairs of shoes for $60, then he paid half that amount for each pair. So, he paid $30 per pair.
Response:  On day one, there were two containers with 5 cars each, so in total there were 10 cars (5 x 2 = 10). On the second day, new containers arrived and there were 30 cars in total (not including the ones from the previous day). Therefore, the number of cars brought in on the second day is 20 (30 - 10 = 20).
"Response:  We know that Adrien's salary increased by 30%, and four years later it increased again by 40%. So, if Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago, then his current salary is:
$40,000 x (1 + 0.3) = $52,800
Now we need to find out how much Lyla's salary has increased over the same period of time. If her salary was $30,000 four years ago, then her current salary is:
$30,000 x (1 + 0.4) = $42,000
So, the total combined salary of Adrien and Lyla four years later is:
$52,800 + $42,000 = $94,800"
Response:  If Miguel uses two pieces of paper for each drawing and there are 30 sheets of paper per month, then he will use 60 pieces of paper (2 x 30 = 60) every month to make his drawings.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so together they have 13 fruit (5 + 8 = 13). Kael brought twice as many apples and half as many oranges as Morisette, so he brought 10 apples (2 x 5 = 10) and 4 oranges (half of 8 = 4). In total, Morisette had 13 fruit, and Kael had 14 (10 + 4 = 14), for a combined total of 27 fruit (13 + 14 = 27).
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Sadie slept for 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours in total. If she sleeps more than that each of the remaining days of the week, then her total sleep time for the week is: Total sleep time = Number of days x Sleep time per day So, if she sleeps more than 1 hour each day, her total sleep time would be: Total sleep time = 7 days x 1 hour/day = 7 hours If she sleeps more than 2 hours each day, her total sleep time would be: Total sleep time = 7 days x 2 hours/day = 14 hours And so on... Therefore, we can conclude that Sadie slept for at least 7 hours during the week.
Response:  Rosie can run for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, which means she covers a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles in that time. Then, after a break, she runs at a speed of 8 km/h for 7 hours, covering a distance of 7 x 8 = 56 kilometers. So, in total, Rosie can cover a distance of 30 + 56 = 86 kilometers (or 53 miles) in 7 hours.
"Response:  When Jennie started working in her mother's office, there were 60 unstamped letters that needed to be stamped and 10 already stamped letters. So, the total number of letters was 70 (60 + 10). Now, if 30 of these letters have been already stamped, then the remaining letters are 40 (70 - 30). Therefore, when Jennie started working, there were 40 letters in the ""already stamped"" pile."
Response:  Julia had 5 new cans and her husband gave her 3 more cans, so together they have 8 cans. Later, when Julia was cooking the stew, she used 4 of those cans. Therefore, there were 8 - 4 = 4 cans left after she finished cooking.
Response:  We know that Dylan took more than 38 chicken skewers and fewer than 44 chicken skewers. So, he must have taken exactly 40 chicken skewers. Now let's consider the number of fish skewers. Since we are told that Dylan took more than 6 fish skewers and fewer than 7 fish skewers, he must have taken exactly 6 fish skewers as well. Therefore, Dylan took a total of 40 + 6 = 46 skewers to the party.
Response:  If Amy has 20 friends and Lily has 50 friends, then together they have 70 friends (Amy + Lily = 70). So, Lily has 30 more friends than Amy (Lily - Amy = 30). Therefore, Lily has 80 friends (Lily = 80)
Response:  If one greek dinny costs $3, then three greek dinnies will cost $9. Similarly, if one paprika costs $15, then two paprikas will cost $30. Finally, if one orange costs $5, then ten oranges will cost $50. So, in total, Dillon will have to pay $9 + $30 + $50 = $95 for the goods he wants to buy.
Response:  The hospital sees 500 patients every day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent at the hospital is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes per day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours as follows: 12,000 min / 60 min/hr = 200 hours per day. Now, let's calculate how much money the doctors make from these visits. If they charge $150 per hour, then their daily earnings would be 200 hours x $150/hour = $30,000 per day. As for the hospital, if it charges $200 per hour from patients, its daily revenue would be 200 hours x $200/hour = $40,000 per day. So, the total amount of money made by both parties combined is $70,000 per day ($30,000 + $40,000).
Response:  We know that Nissa has hired 60 seasonal workers to play as elves in her store in the village of Mikulásfalu. Of these, one-third (3/60) have left after being pushed around by the children, leaving 20 elves. Then, out of the remaining 40 elves, ten more have been injured and cannot continue playing, so there are only 30 elves left. Therefore, the final number of elves is 30.
Response:  In May, Joseph had $500 in expenses. In June, he had $440 in expenses, which is $60 less than his May amount. So, the total cost for both months combined would be: $500 + $440 = $940.
"Response: 
Pam went twice to the roller coaster and Fred went four times. So together they made 6 trips (2 + 4 = 6). If each trip requires 6 tickets, then in total they used 6 x 6 = 36 tickets that day."
Response:  We know that Walt walked 6 km on Monday and 3 times as much as he walked on Monday (Monday = 6 km). So, if we multiply 6 km by 3, we get 18 km for Tuesday. Now, we add up all the distances to find out how far Walt walked from Monday to Saturday: 6 + 18 +... + 41 = 120 km. Therefore, Walt walked 120 km from Monday to Saturday.
Response:  If Tom has to do four car washes and each car wash costs $15, then he will have to pay $60 for all four car washes ($15 x 4 = $60). So, in one year, Tom will have to pay $60.
Response:  If Brian has 20 video games and he lost 5 of them before comparing with Bobby, then Brian had 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Since Bobby does not have any of the lost 5 video games, Bobby has 0 + 15 = 15 video games. Therefore, Bobby has 15 video games.
Response:  We know that there is only one male Scottish deer left in the world and it is located in the Scottish mountains. Therefore, we can say that the number of female Scottish deer is equal to the total number of Scottish deer minus the number of males. According to the question, there are 3 female Scottish deer for every 2 male Scottish deer. So, if there are 27 Scottish deer (including both males and females), then the number of female Scottish deer is: 27 - 14 = 13. Therefore, there are 13 female Scottish deer in the world.
Response:  The total cost of two sandwiches at $7.50 each = $15.00. Two bags of chips at $1.50 each = $3.00. Two slices of pizza at $1.00 each = $2.00. Total food cost = $20.00. Then, there is a shipping fee of 20%, which is calculated as follows: $20.00 x 20% = $4.00 (shipping fee). So, the total amount to be paid for the delivery order is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.
"Response: 
Mark took 75 questions in total for both tests. He completed 5 questions per hour, so he spent:

Total time = Number of questions / Number of questions per hour
= 75 / 5
= 15 hours

Since Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second test, we can calculate how many questions he answered correctly as follows:

Correct answers = Total time / Time taken to complete each test
= 15 hours / (8 + 6)
= 15 hours / 14
= 10.71 hours

So, Mark left approximately 4.29 hours worth of questions unanswered."
Response:  If there are 22 pink marbles and 4 times as many red marbles as blue ones, then there are 22 x 4 = 88 red marbles in total. Since there are 12 blue marbles, we can deduce that there are 88 - 12 = 76 red marbles left. Therefore, there are 76 rózsaszín (pink) marbles.
Response:  The total number of cars is 20. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. This means that the number of manual cars is 4/20 = 0.2 or 20%. Therefore, 80% (or 16) of the cars are automatic.
"Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and we have to find out how many workers, nurses, and queen bees there are. According to the problem statement:

* The number of worker bees is twice the number of nurse bees, which means the number of worker bees = 2 × number of nurse bees.
* The number of nurse bees is equal to half the number of all bees (including workers, nurses, and queens), so the number of nurse bees = (350 / 2) = 175.
* Therefore, the number of worker bees = 2 × 175 = 350.

So, there are 350 worker bees in the hive."
"Response: 
Jordan spends two hours playing video games per day and works part-time for $10 per hour. To calculate how much money he earns in a week, we need to multiply his daily time spent gaming by the number of days in a week (7) and then multiply that result by his hourly wage from work. So, Jordan earns:
2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
$10/hour x 14 hours/week = $140/week
Therefore, Jordan earns $140 per week playing video games and working part-time."
Response:  The total cost of all goods is $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $17. If there is a 10% tax on non-food items, then the tax amount is $17 x 0.10 = $1.70. So, the total amount paid for all goods including taxes is $17 + $1.70 = $18.70.
"Response: 
Kim has three customers so far and five potential customers. Each customer will need two bottles of bleach (worth $2 each) and one package of cleaning cloths (worth $5 each). So, in total, she will have $30 worth of sales per week from her existing customers ($6 x 2 = $12 for each customer x 3 customers = $36), plus $15 worth of sales from the potential customers ($5 x 5 = $25). Therefore, her total weekly sales are $51 ($36 + $25).
Now, let's calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS): $30 (bleach) + $15 (cleaning cloths) = $45.
So, her gross profit is $51 - $45 = $6 per week.
Finally, we can calculate her daily profit as follows: $6 / 7 days = $0.86 per day."
"Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land where he grows bananas and there are 100 bananas per hectare. He can harvest them every 3 months. So in one year, how many times can he harvest his bananas?

Yearly Harvests = Number of Months / Time Between Harvests
= 12 (months) / 3 (time between harvests)
= 4

So John can harvest his bananas 4 times in a year. Therefore, he can taker approximately 400 bananas (4 x 100 bananas/hectare)."
"Response: 
1. The first box contains 500 LEGO bricks.
2. The second box has three times as many bricks as the first box, so it contains 3 x 500 = 1500 bricks.
3. The third box has half as many bricks as the second box, so it contains 1500 / 2 = 750 bricks.
4. In total, Johnny has collected 500 + 1500 + 750 = 2850 bricks."
"Response: 
Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours and then saw half of them return in the next 6 hours. This means that 15 bees returned to the hive. Since there were originally 30 bees, and half of them returned, the number of bees that did not return is 15 - 15 = 0. Therefore, no bees returned to the hive during the last 6 hours of the day."
Response:  The cost of entry for adults is $12 and for children is $10. If Brittany and her mother go to the museum together, they will have to pay $12 + $10 = $22 in total. So, if Brittany's mother gives the cashier $8, then she has given $22 - $8 = $14 more than what she needed to pay for their entrance tickets.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if Dorothy has x friends, then Charlie has 3x friends and James has 4x friends. Now we are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, James has 4x = 16 friends.
Response:  We know that Steve is farther away from school than Tim, so he will take longer to get home. Specifically, Steve takes 3 miles / 440 lb/min = 6.8 minutes to bike home. Since Tim is only 2 miles away from school, it takes him less time to bike home - let's say it takes him 4 minutes. So, if they start at the same time (which we assume), Tim will finish the race before Steve does. In fact, Tim will finish in 4 minutes + 1 minute for each mile left to go = 5 minutes after starting. Therefore, Steve will arrive at his house 6.8 minutes after Tim arrives there.
"Response: 
Day 1: 5 people came with bicycles to inflate the tires. Each person needed 25 cents for each tire, so total cost = 5 x 25 = $1.25.
Day 2: 3 people came with three-wheeled bicycles to inflate their tires. Each person needed 25 cents for each tire, so total cost = 3 x 25 = $0.75.
Total cost for both days = $1.95."
Response:  If Carl takes 10 packages of candy (tíz csomag), then he will take 10 x 6 = 60 pieces of candy in total. Since each piece of candy costs $0.10, Carl will pay a total of 60 x $0.10 = $6. Since Carl pays with $10 dollars, he will get $10 - $6 = $4 in change. Therefore, Carl will receive $4 in change.
Response:  We know that Dave ate 14 of the 20 (or 100) krumples before the bird stole the bag from him. Then, three birds ate three each, leaving five krumples. Later, a mole took half of what was left, which is two and a half krumples. Finally, ants took one krumple, leaving none. So, when Dave bought the bag, there were 5 krumples in it.
Response:  We know that Kimo has three one-hour classes per day from Monday to Friday, and two two-hour classes per day on Wednesday and Thursday. Therefore, in total, he attends 3 + 2 x 2 = 9 hours of class per week. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 9 x 16 = 144 hours in class per semester.
"Response:  We know that Bill has 300 tekercsek, 120 croissants, and 60 baguettes to sell. Each tekercs is 15 cm long, each croissant is 15 cm long, and each baguette is 60 cm long. If Bill arranges them in a row, how many rows will he need?
Let's calculate the length of each row:
Row length = Total number of items / Number of items per row
= 300 tekercsek + 120 croissants + 60 baguettes / Row length
= 300 + 120 + 60 / Row length
Now we need to find out what the value of Row length is. Let's assume that Bill wants to arrange the items in rows of equal length. In this case, the row length will be half the total length of all the items. So, the row length will be:
Row length = (Total length of all items) / 2
= (300 + 120 + 60) / 2
= 480 / 2
= 240 cm
Therefore, Bill will need 240 rows to arrange all the items."
"Response:  The total number of bananas needed for two months is:

For the monkeys: 200 + (2 x 200) = 800 banans
For the gorillas: 400 banans
For the pumas: 100 banans per month x 2 months = 200 banans
Total number of bananas needed = 800 + 400 + 200 = 1400 banans
Therefore, there are 1400 banans needed to last for two months."
"Response: 
Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he covers a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters.
Kelly runs once from one end of the field to the other (40 yards), then turns around and runs back, covering a distance of 40 + 40 = 80 yards.
So, in total, Kelly covers a distance of 80 yards.
Therefore, the difference in distance between the winner and the loser is 1500 - 80 = 1420 meters."
"Response: 
Raphael bought 4 pens that cost $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on pens.
He also bought 2 notebooks that cost $4 each, so he spent $8 on notebooks.
Finally, he bought a piece of paper that cost $20. Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 on teacher supplies."
Response:  We know that there are six fish swimming in the lake and one of them comes out of a lotus flower. Then we see two of them hiding under a rock. So, the total number of fish left in the water is four (6 - 1 = 4). Therefore, Finn sees 4 fish swimming in the lake.
Response:  On Monday (Kedden), the water level was 7 meters deep in the tank. On Tuesday (Szerda), the water level decreased to 5 meters deep. So, the difference between the two days is -2 meters (-7 - 5 = -2). Therefore, the water level on Thursday (Hétfő) would be 5 meters deep.
Response:  We know that Anakin caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea horses, and 3 octopuses. Locsin caught fewer than 5 sea stars, fewer than 3 sea horses, and more than 2 octopuses than Anakin. So, we can conclude that Locsin caught 7 sea stars, 4 sea horses, and 5 octopuses.
"Response:  The initial price of one bottle of whiskey is $20. Every two months, the price increases by 20%. So after 2 months, the new price will be: $20 x (1 + 0.2) = $24. After another 2 months, the price will increase again by 20%, so the new price will be: $24 x (1 + 0.2) = $28. And so on...
After 36 months, the price will have increased by 36 times, or: $20 x (1 + 0.2)^36 = $795. Therefore, after 36 months, one bottle of whiskey will cost approximately $795."
Response:  The total value of all the toys is $10 (5 red cars + 3 action figures + baby). If one action figure costs $5, then the three action figures together cost $15 ($5 x 3 = $15). So, if the baby gives up one action figure and a red car worth $4, then the baby has gained $9 ($15 - $6 = $9). Therefore, each action figure costs $5.
Response:  If Jackie pays $35 per hour for taxes and has 3 hours of free time, he will save $105 ($35 x 3) if he hires a bookkeeper. However, he must pay the bookkeeper $90 per hour, so his total cost will be $19 ($105 - $90). Therefore, there will be $19 left over after hiring a bookkeeper.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira has €1500 to spend on her birthday gift. Then she goes to a computer store and buys a new laptop for €1090. So far, she has spent €1090 + €1500 = €2590. Next, she purchases additional accessories such as a scanner (€157), a CD player (€74), and a printer (€102). Therefore, the total amount of money Elvira spends comes out to be €2590 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €2823. Finally, since she still wants to buy a dress with some remaining money, let's assume she spends €2823 - €102 = €2721 on the dress. So, there will be €2721 left over after buying the dress.
Response:  If Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanyol Flan, and she has 9 eggs from her neighbor, then she can make 9 / 3 = 3 Spanyol Flans. Therefore, Sandra needs to baby sit 3 times for her neighbor.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Seth is currently two years younger than Brooke. So, if Brooke is x years old now, then Seth is x - 2 years old. In three years, their combined age will be 2x + 6 = 30. Therefore, Seth is currently 14 years old (since he is 2 years younger than Brooke).
Response:  We know that Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel and Ethel has twice as many dollars as Jimmy. So, if Jimmy has x dollars, then Ethel has 2x dollars. Since Ethel has 8 dollars, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 8. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 8. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 2. Therefore, Jimmy has $2 more than Ethel, who has $2 \* 2 = $4 more than him.
"Response:  We know that Pancho walks 30 kilometers in one week and 10 miles (or 16.1 kilometers) during the weekends. So, we can calculate his average daily distance as follows:
Average daily distance = Total distance / Number of days
= 30 km + 10 mi / 7 days + 10 mi / 2 days
= 45.8 km/day (approximately)
Therefore, Pancho walks approximately 45.8 kilometers per day."
Response:  The band ordered $X$ shirts at a price of $Y$. Each shirt costs three times as much as the hat ($H$), so the cost of each shirt is $3Y$. Since the band also bought $Z$ pairs of pants, which cost half as much as the shirts ($2Y$), the total cost of all the clothes is $3Y + 2(2Y) = 7Y$. Therefore, the total cost of all the clothes is $7Y$.
Response:  We know that there are 80 pókok and each has 8 legs, so we have 8 x 8 = 64 legs from the spiders. Then, there are 90 rovarok and each has 6 legs, so we have 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. Finally, there are 3 rare mutant creatures with 10 legs each, so we have 3 x 10 = 30 legs from these creatures. In total, Jake sees 64 + 540 + 30 = 634 legs.
Response:  We know that there are four birds in the caboose and Sally is twice as old as Red. So, if Red is 3 years old, then Sally is 6 years old (twice 3). Now we need to find out how old each bird is. According to the problem statement, Sally is 32 years old, which means she was born when she was 31 + 3 = 34 years old. Therefore, the total age of all four birds is 34 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 50 years.
Response:  The total amount of money that Jessica has to pay each month is equal to the sum of her three debts. So, if she pays more than the minimum payment for each debt, she will have to pay less in total each month. For example, if she pays $100 more than the minimum payment for her student loan, she will only have to pay $400 per month instead of $500 (the minimum). If she pays $100 more than the minimum payment for her credit card bill, she will only have to pay $300 per month instead of $400 (the minimum). And if she pays $100 more than the minimum payment for her car loan, she will only have to pay $300 per month instead of $400 (the minimum). Therefore, if Jessica wants to pay off all of her debts within one year, she needs to calculate how much she can afford to pay each month and then make sure she pays at least that amount every month.
"Response: 
1. Time taken to pick up the cucumber = 1.5 minutes (as mentioned in the question)
2. Time taken to cut the cucumber = 5 seconds (as mentioned in the question)
3. Total time taken for both tasks = 1.5 + 5 = 6.5 minutes
Therefore, it takes Billy 6.5 minutes to complete both tasks."
Response:  If they sold 20 liters of lemonade and got $2 per liter, then they earned $40 from selling lemonade ($2 x 20 liters). Since they paid $3 for each liter of lemonade, their total cost for making 20 liters of lemonade is $60 ($3 x 20 liters). So, their profit from selling lemonade is $40 - $60 = -$20. Therefore, they did not make any profit from selling lemonade.
Response:  We know that there were 240 Asian athletes in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Asian athletes who are not Japanese is 240 - 80 = 160. Since we also know that there were 60 boys from China, we can conclude that there were 160 - 60 = 100 girls from China. Therefore, there were 100 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Zaid spends $1/4 of his income on rent, which is $1500 (since he makes $6000). Secondly, he spends $1/3 of his income on fuel for his car, which is $2000 (since he makes $6000). Thirdly, he donates $200 to the charity and $700 to his wife, so their total amount spent is $900 ($200 + $700). Finally, after all these expenses, he has $5400 left ($6000 - $1500 - $2000 - $900 = $5400). Therefore, Zaid has $5400 remaining after paying all his bills and making donations.
"Response:  We know that Rani has ten tumors and Monica has fewer than five tumors. So, if we add up all their tumors, it would be:
Rani - 10 =? + Monica - 5 =?
= 15 + 0 = 15
So, together they have 15 tumors."
Response:  In the first week, Lloyd taught for 5 hours, so he earned $5 x 5 = $25. In the second week, he taught for 8 hours, so he earned $8 x 2 = $16. Therefore, in total, Lloyd earned $25 + $16 = $41.
Response:  The total number of votes = Total number of voters x Number of candidates running for office. In this case, there are two candidates running for office and 80 students in the class, so the total number of votes = 2 x 80 = 160 votes. If the winner received 3/4 of the votes (which is equal to 120 votes), then the loser received 160 - 120 = 40 votes.
Response:  We know that Sandra has ordered 4 times more red roses than white carnations. So, if she has ordered x white carnations, then she has ordered 4x red roses. Since there are 200 calla liliums in total and they were 5 times more than the number of white carnations, we can say that there are 100 calla liliums (5x) for every 4x white carnations. Therefore, to deliver all the orders before 5 pm, Fred needs to deliver 25 white carnations per hour (100/4).
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than Jan. So, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then two years ago, he was 25 years old (since he has aged one year). Now, we can calculate how old Jean is: Jean is five years younger than Mark, who is two years older than Jan. Therefore, Jean is 17 years old (2 + 5 - 2 = 17).
"Response:  The faster team has four runners who each complete their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. Therefore, they finish the race in 2200 seconds (55 s x 4 runners).
The slower team also has four runners, but their times are not equally spaced. The first runner takes 60 seconds to complete his 400 meters, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner completes the distance in 57 seconds (60 - 3 = 57), the third runner completes it in 54 seconds (57 - 3 = 54), and the fourth runner completes it in 51 seconds (54 - 3 = 51). In total, the slower team takes 2280 seconds (51 + 57 + 54 + 60) to complete the race.
Since both teams have the same number of runners and the faster team completes the race in fewer seconds, we can conclude that the faster team wins the race."
"Response:  If Jerry throws a six-sided die, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We want to find the probability that he will get a number greater than 3 after throwing two pairs of numbers consecutively.
Let A be the event where Jerry gets a number greater than 3 in his first throw, and B be the event where he gets a pair in his second throw. Since the die is fair, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of A given B: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A)/P(B).
Now, let's calculate the probabilities involved:
P(A) = 1/6 (the chance of getting a number greater than 3 in one throw)
P(B) = 5/6 (the chance of not getting a pair in one throw)
P(B|A) = 1/3 (the chance of getting a pair in the next throw if you got a number greater than 3 in the previous throw)
P(A|B) = 2/3 (the chance of getting a number greater than 3 in the next throw if you got a pair in the previous throw)
Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(greater than 3 | consecutive pairs) = 2/3 \* (1/6) / (5/6) = 80%
So, the probability that Jerry will get a number greater than 3 after throwing two pairs of numbers consecutively is 80%."
"Response:  If Jenna and her mother went to pick apples from their farm together, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then... (1 mark)
If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, how many did Jenna pick? (2 marks)
Therefore, the total number of apples they picked together is equal to the number of apples Jenna picked plus the number of apples her mother picked. (3 marks)"
Response:  We know that there are three cages with equal number of mice in each cage (since they are grouped equally). So, we have 3 x 6 = 18 mice in total who receive 6 pieces of cheese each. Now, let's consider the hamsters. There are 10 hamster cages, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of cheese. Therefore, the total number of hamsters receiving cheese is 10 x 5 = 50. Finally, we have 20 pieces of cheese for the rabbits, which means there are 20 / 4 = 5 rabbits per cage. Since there are 4 cages, the total number of rabbits is 5 x 4 = 20. So, the final answer is: Mice - 18 Hamsters - 50 Rabbits - 20.
Response:  The initial amount is $100, and they agreed to pay 2% interest per year. So after one year, the total amount will be $100 + (2% of $100) = $100 + $2 = $102. After two years, it will be $102 + (2% of $102) = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04. And so on. Therefore, if Mandy paid after 3 months, the amount she could have given to Benedict would be $104.04 - $30 = $74.04.
Response:  The total cost of transporting all the sacks from the field to the warehouse is $80 (2$ dollars per sack x 40 sacks). Since the trader made a profit of $400 - $80 = $320, he must have sold at least 320 / $3 = 106 sacks. Therefore, the trader sold 106 sacks of wheat.
Response:  The total cost of the three tickets and two trips is $69 + (3 x $4.50) = $78. Since they agreed to split the costs equally, each person paid $\frac{78}{3} = 26$ dollars.
Response:  If John can collect two baracks in one minute, then he will be able to collect $3 \times 2 = 6$ baracks in three minutes. So, John will gather $\boxed{6}$ baracks in total.
Response:  We know that each kitten needs to eat 1.5 kg of insects per day to survive. If there are ten cats in total, we need to calculate how much food they will need altogether. So, if one cat needs 1.5 kg of insects per day, then ten cats will need 15 kg (10 x 1.5) of insects per day.
"Response: 
Year 1: Tom plants 50 trees.
Year 2 to Year 10: Every year, Tom cuts down 2 trees.
After 10 years, there are 50 - 20 = 30 trees left.
So, there are 30 trees left after 10 years."
Response:  On Friday morning, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos placed in Sue's yard. Then, on Saturday morning, half of them (9) were returned and painted white. Therefore, at Sunday morning, there would be 9 + 18 = 27 flamingos in total. So, there were 27 pink and white plastic flamingos in Sue's yard on Sunday afternoon.
"Response:  We know that Violetta wants to buy 5 different colored pencils and she has $20 for this purpose. Each pencil costs $2, so we can calculate how many pencils she can buy as follows:

Number of pencils = Total amount / Price of each pencil
= $20 / $2
= 10 pencils

Therefore, Violetta will get 10 pencils in total."
Response:  If one toll costs $1.20 and one pencil costs $0.30, then 8 tolls would cost 8 x $1.20 = $9.60. So, 8 tolls would cost $9.60.
Response:  We have to divide 200 font of garlic among 40 restaurants in a certain city. Each restaurant gets 2 fonts of garlic. To find out how much garlic will be left unused, we need to subtract the total amount given to each restaurant from the total amount available. So, the number of pounds of garlic not used = Total amount - (Number of restaurants x Amount per restaurant). In this case, the total amount is 200 pounds, and the amount per restaurant is 2 pounds. Therefore, the number of pounds of garlic not used = 200 - (40 x 2) = 160 pounds.
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 people living in the city. Of these, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. So, we have to find out how many children (i.e., minors) there are in total. To do this, we need to subtract the number of adults from the total population. Therefore, the number of children in the city is:

Total population = 23786
Adults = 8417 + 9092 = 17509
Children = Total population - Adults = 23786 - 17509 = 6277
So, there are approximately 6277 children living in the city."
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. If she collected three times as much money in the second month, then she had 60 Pokémon cards (3 x 20 = 60). However, since there are fewer than 20 Pokémon cards in the third month, we can deduce that Elaine collected twice as many Pokémon cards in the third month compared to the first two months combined (60 - 20 = 40). Therefore, the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has is 60 + 40 = 100.
"Response: 
Mark earns $0.05 per word from A Kiado and $0.10 per word from B Kiado. Since he works for both companies every week, we can calculate his total income as follows:
Total income = Number of words x Price per word
= 200 (words/week) x $0.05 (A Kiado) + 80 (words/week) x $0.10 (B Kiado)
= $10 (A Kiado) + $8 (B Kiado)
= $18 ($10 + $8)
So, Mark earns $18 per week."
Response:  If Baldur takes 5 liters of water every morning and 6 liters every afternoon, then he takes a total of 5 + 6 = 11 liters of water per day. So, he gets 11 liters of water per day.
Response:  If John gets $2000 per week and he receives the bonus every month, then he will get $8000 in one year (52 weeks x $2000). Since the bonus is worth $5000, that means John will receive a total of $13000 ($8000 + $5000) in one year.
Response:  We know that Josie has a 10-hectare farm and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year. So, in total, she has 50 tons (10 ha x 5 ton/ha) of grapes per year. Since every ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate how many barrels of wine Josie produces annually as follows: 50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year. Therefore, Josie produces 100 barrels of wine per year on her 10-hectare farm.
"Response: 
Carl eats breakfast every day with two slices of bread and one slice of cheese. So he uses three slices of cheese per day.
He also makes an omelette thrice a week, which requires more than one slice of cheese. Let's assume it takes 1.5 slices of cheese to make an omelette.
Now, let's calculate how much cheese Carl uses in total:
3 breakfasts x 2 slices/breakfast = 6 slices/day
+ 3 omelettes x 1.5 slices/omelette = 4.5 slices/week
Total cheese used per week = 6 + 4.5 = 10.5 slices
So, Carl uses approximately 10.5 slices of cheese per week."
Response:  We know that Janettnek originally had 22 green and 10 yellow feathers. Then she took 6 bottles of blue feathers and 2 bottles of red feathers. If we find 9 blue feathers in each blue bottle and 6 red feathers in each red bottle, then...
Response:  If Brinley has an average of 93 points after five tests, he needs to get at least 93 - 5 = 48 points in the sixth test to maintain his average. Since he scored 86 points in the fifth test, he needs to score at least 48 - 86 = 12 points more than his previous score to keep his average at 93. Therefore, Brinley needs to score at least 96 points in the sixth test.
"Response: 
Michael rode his bike for four weeks (4 weeks x 7 days/week = 28 days). During each of these 28 days, he rode an average distance of 25 km per day, so in total he covered:

28 days \* 25 km/day = 700 km

Then, after four weeks, he decided to ride only twice a week instead of every day. For three weeks, he rode 60 km per session, which means he covered a total distance of:

3 weeks \* 60 km/session = 180 km

In total, Michael covered a distance of:

700 km + 180 km = 880 km

Therefore, Michael traveled a total distance of 880 kilometers during the period mentioned in the question."
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candies in total. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candy, so each chocolate bar weighs 80/2 = 40 grams. Therefore, Joe's bag contains 25 x 40 = 1000 grams of chocolate.
Response:  On Monday, Rose went to the store and bought 4 pastries. On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought three times as many pastries as she bought on Monday, so she bought 12 pastries (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought five times as many pastries as she bought on Tuesday, so she bought 60 pastries (5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, in total, Rose bought 78 pastries over the course of the three days (4 + 12 + 60 = 78).
Response:  We know that there are 30 baskets and each basket costs $1200 less than half a basket. So, if we divide the total cost of all 30 baskets by 30, we get the price per basket: $6000 / 30 = $200 per basket.
Response:  If Sara has already saved $10, then she needs to work for 40 hours (since each time she works, she earns $5) to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. So, after working for 40 hours, she will have saved $200 ($5 x 40 = $200). Therefore, she can afford to buy the jacket and shoes, which cost a total of $50 ($30 + $20), leaving her with $150 left over ($200 - $50 = $150).
Response:  If there are x white chickens and y red chickens, then the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42x + 3y. Since each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by all white chickens in one day is 5x. Similarly, since each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by all red chickens in one day is 3y. Therefore, we can write the equation: 42x + 3y = (5x) + (3y). Solving for y, we get y = 16. So, there are 16 red chickens. Now, if two more white chickens than red chickens exist, then the ratio of white chickens to red chickens is 2:1, or 2/3. Therefore, there are 2/3 times as many white chickens as red chickens, which means that there are 2/3 \* 16 = 10 red chickens.
"Response:  The distance traveled in one hour is given as $3 \text{ miles}/\text{hour} = 0.003 \text{ miles}/\text{minute}$. Since there are $\text{6 minutes}$ in $\text{1 hour}$, we have:

$$\text{Distance traveled} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{(\text{Time})} = \frac{0.003 \text{ miles}}{\text{6 minutes}} = 0.0005 \text{ miles}/\text{minute}$$

Now, since Gary likes to walk along the local park windward, which is a square with sides of length $1.5 \text{ miles}$ and $6 \text{ miles}$, respectively, we can calculate the time taken to walk around it as follows:

$$\text{Time taken} = \int_{0}^{1.5 \text{ miles}} \frac{dx}{x^2 + (6 - x)^2} = \int_{0}^{\text{1.5 miles}} \frac{dx}{\left(x^2 + \left(\frac{6}{x}\right)^2\right)})$$

Using integration, we get:

$$\text{Time taken} = \int_{0}^{\text{1.5 miles}} \frac{dx}{\left(x^2 + \left(\frac{6}{x}\right)^2\right)} = \arctan\left(\frac{6}{x}\right) \biggr|_0^{1.5 \text{ miles}} = \arctan\left(\frac{6}{1.5}\right) = \pi / 4$$

Therefore, Gary will take $\pi / 4$ hours ($= 90^\circ$) to walk around the local park windward if he walks at a speed of $3 \text{ miles}/\text{hour}$."
Response:  On day one, Sloane had 100 customers and gained 50 more than that, so he had 150 customers in total (100 + 50 = 150). On the second day, he had 150 customers plus 50 new customers, for a total of 200 customers (150 + 50 = 200). Therefore, on the third day, he had 200 customers plus 50 new customers, for a total of 250 customers (200 + 50 = 250).
Response:  We know that there are two pools and both have flow rate of 4 gallons per minute. Also, we know that there was twice as much water in the big pool than in the small one 4 minutes ago. And now, we also know that there is 4 times as much water in the big pool as in the small one. So, if there were x gallons of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, then there would be 4x gallons of water in it now. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is 4x gallons.
Response:  The cost of the shoes is $320 and she wants to buy it with an accessory that costs $32. So, in total, she needs to work for 10 hours (320/32 = 10).
"Response:  If Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10%, then her remaining debt after 12 months will be:

$2000 x (1 + 0.10) = $2200

So, Janeth's remaining debt after 12 months will be $2200."
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the basket and seven more daisies than roses in the basket. So, if there are x roses in the basket, then there would be 7 + x daisies in the basket as well. Therefore, we can write an equation: 4x = 7 + x. Solving for x gives us x = 3. So, there are three flowers in total in the basket - two roses and one daisy.
"Response: 
Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, which means that Adrian is 3H years old, where H is Harriet's age.
Harriet is half as old as Zack, which means that Harriet is (Z - H)/2 years old.
Now we have two equations:
3H = Adrian's age
(Z - H)/2 = Harriet's age + 3
We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of Adrian and Harriet's ages at present.
Solving for H, we get:
H = Z/2 - 3
Substituting this value into the first equation, we get:
Adrian's age = 3(Z/2 - 3) = 3Z/6 - 9
Similarly, substituting H = Z/2 - 3 into the second equation, we get:
Harriet's age + 3 = (Z - H)/2 = (Z/2 - 3) + 3 = Z/2 + 3
So, Adrian is currently 3Z/6 - 9 years old, and Harriet is currently Z/2 + 3 years old.
Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Adrian is 3Z/6 - 9 years old, and Harriet is Z/2 + 3 years old."
Response:  We know that four students in total scored 251 points. So, if we divide the total score among the four students, each student got an average of 63 points (251/4). Now, let's see how many points Jojo scored. If Jojo scored x points and Naomi scored 68 points, then their ratio is 68:x. Since Brianna scored more than Naomi, Brianna's score must be greater than or equal to 68. Therefore, we can write: 68 ≤ x < 251. Solving for x gives us x = 193. So, Jojo scored 193 points.
"Response: 
Carmen took 10 minutes to complete one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete one Sudoku puzzle.
She spent 3 hours (72 minutes) solving crossword puzzles during the weekend.
So, she spent 3 x 72 = 216 minutes solving crossword puzzles.
And she spent 5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving Sudoku puzzles.
Therefore, in total, Carmen spent 216 + 40 = 256 minutes playing crosswords and Sudoku over the weekend."
Response:  The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters. Celine used 90 liters to irrigate her garden, leaving 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30) in the tank. After that, she collected twice as much rainwater as was left in the tank, which means she collected 60 liters (30 x 2 = 60). So now there are 90 liters (30 + 60 = 90) of water in the tank.
Response:  We know that Andy has 90 geraniums and he has fewer petunias than geraniums. So, let's assume that Andy has x number of petunias. Since we know that the total number of flowers is equal to the sum of the number of geraniums and petunias, we can write an equation as follows: Number of geraniums + Number of petunias = Total number of flowers Now, we are given that Andy has 90 geraniums, so we can substitute this value in the above equation: Number of geraniums + Number of petunias = 90 + x Where 'x' represents the number of petunias Andy has. Now, we need to find out what 'x' could be. Based on the information provided, we know that Andy has fewer petunias than geraniums, which means that 'x' must be less than or equal to 90. Therefore, the possible values for 'x' are between 0 and 90 inclusive. Now, we have two equations: Number of geraniums + Number of petunias = 90 + x And Number of geraniums = 90 Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of 'x'. Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: Number of petunias = 90 - Number of geraniums Now, substituting the value of 'Number of geraniums' from the second equation (i.e., 90), we get: Number of petunias = 90 - 90 = 0 Which means that Andy has no petunias! Therefore, the answer is 0.
Response:  The company spends $15,000 per year for advertising, and two-third of that amount is spent in one year. So, if the company spends $2/3 \times 15,000 = 10,000$ dollars in one year, then it means that the remaining $\frac{1}{3} \times 15,000 = 5,000$ dollars are spent in the other year. Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising by the company over the last two years is $10,000 + 5,000 = 15,000$.
"Response:  If Carlos pays $30 per hour for the boat and Benji pays $18 per hour for the canoe, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many hours each person will use the boat or canoe.
Carlos will use the boat for 3 hours, so he will pay $30 x 3 = $90 in total.
Benji will use the canoe for 5 hours, so he will pay $18 x 5 = $90 in total.

Therefore, both Carlos and Benji will have to pay $90 for their respective rentals."
"Response:  If it takes 5 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and 2 days to travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by car, then the total time taken for the trip is:

Day 1 (bus journey): 5 days
Day 2 (car journey): 2 days
Total time = Day 1 + Day 2 = 7 days
Therefore, if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will take 7 days for the entire trip."
Response:  The probability of getting a water-type card is 8/30 or approximately 0.27. If he loses the water type and gets a fire type card with probability 20/56 or approximately 0.36, then the new probability of getting a water type card is 8/30 x 0.36 = 0.29. So, the chance of getting a water-type card after losing the original one is approximately 0.29.
"Response: 
Chad ordered a basic burrito for $6.50. He added extra beef for $2, extra cheese for $1, guacamole for $1, and salsa for $0.25. Then he decided to upgrade his meal with chips and drink for $3, which adds up to $14.50. Since he had a $5 gift card, he paid $9.50 in total. So there is $5 left over after paying for his meal."
Response:  If Kalinda can do 4 pieces in one minute and her mother can do half of that (which is 2 pieces), then they together can do 8 pieces in one minute. Since there are 360 pieces in total, it will take them 45 minutes to complete the puzzle (360 / 8 = 45).
"Response: 
Ashlyn left the farm with 120 small Greek olives. If 30% of them were ready for harvest after two months, then the number of olive that was ready to be picked would be:
30% of 120 = 36
So, when she returned two weeks later, there would be:
36 + (70 x 30%) = 49.8
Greek olives left to be picked.
Therefore, 49.8 Greek olives were not ready to be picked after two weeks."
Response:  The company sells cars for $20,000 each. They pay 10% of that amount in taxes, which is $2,000 per car ($20,000 x 10%). Additionally, they have to register each car at a cost of $1,000. So, the total cost per car is $23,000 ($20,000 + $2,000 + $1,000).
Response:  On Monday (hétfő), Kylie collected 5 shells. If she collected twice as many shells on Tuesday (kedd) than she did on Monday, then she collected 10 shells on Tuesday. So, in total, Kylie collected 15 shells on those two days (5 + 10 = 15).
Response:  We know that Dax found $ \frac{1}{2} $ times as many beetles as ants in the garden. If there are $ 50 $ ants in the garden, then there are $ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 $ beetles in the garden. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is $ 50 + 25 = 75 $.
Response:  There are initially 36 penguins. Three of them (1/3) go into the ocean and disappear. Another third (1/3) goes to the cave to have dinner with their friend. So, there are now 24 penguins left outside (3 x 8 = 24). Therefore, 8 penguins remain for sunbathing (24 - 8 = 8).
Response:  We know that Steve eats twice as much as his friend and he eats six units per day. So, his friend eats three units of paradise per week (6/2 = 3). Now we have to find out how many units of grapes Steve needs for one vineyard. If there are three grapevines per acre, then Steve needs 3 x 3 = 9 acres of land to grow enough grapes for himself and his friend.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and each of them wants to have 4 slices of pizza. Since they can only divide it into 8 parts, we need to divide 20 by 8 = 2.5. So John needs to order 3 pizzas (round up to the nearest whole number).
Response:  If he takes 25 tolls and mixes them together to create one full toll of ink, then he will have 25/1 = 25 full tolls of ink left. When he uses up half of those tolls (since each toll contains half a teaspoon of ink), he will be left with 25/2 = 12.5 full tolls of ink. So, when he creates new tolls from the remaining ink, he will have 12.5 tolls of ink left.
Response:  If Johnnie added $10 to his initial amount of $20, then he had $30 after that. Since it tripled within a year, he would have $90 after one year ($30 x 3 = $90).
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jessica. So, if we assume that all three girls are adults (not children), their ages can be represented as follows:
Mary - 25 (since she is two years younger than Joan)
Joan - 30 (since she is five years older than Jessica)
Jessica - 20 (as given in the problem statement)
Now, let's calculate the total age of these three girls:
Total Age = Mary + Joan + Jessica
= 25 + 30 + 20
= 75 years old
Therefore, the sum of the ages of these three girls is 75 years old."
Response:  The total number of students in the school was 1000. If 30% of them left through door A, then the number of students who left through door A is 300 (1000 x 0.3). Now, we have to find out how many students left through doors B and C combined. Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, the number of students who left through door B is 600 (3/5 x 700), where 700 is the total number of students minus the 300 who left through door A. Therefore, the number of students who left through door C is 600 - 300 = 300. So, the number of students who left through door C is 300.
Response:  We know that James has more candy than Robert and twice as many candies as John. So, if James has x candies, then Robert has x/2 candies and John has 3x candies. Now we are told that János has 54 candies, so he has 54 - (x/2) = 54 - x/2 candies less than James. Therefore, János has 54 - x/2 = 3x/2 candies more than Jakab.
"Response:  
Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book. If they both read their own books and each other's books, then together they will have read 3 books (2 + 1 = 3)."
"Response: 
Mike had 5 pen pals and he was not receiving any letters from them anymore. This means that each of his pen pals was sending him 2 letters per week, making it a total of 10 letters (2 x 5) per week.
Since Mike also writes letters at a rate of 5 minutes per letter, he spends a total of 50 minutes (10 letters x 5 minutes/letter) writing letters every week."
Response:  We know that Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, so in one week (7 days), he spends 105 minutes talking to him. In one month (4 weeks), he spends 420 minutes talking to him. Now, we are asked how many hours Jason spent talking to others during this month. Since there are 30 days in the month, and each day has 15-minute calls with other people, Jason spends 450 minutes talking to others in a month (30 days x 15 minutes/day). Therefore, Jason has 860 minutes of total phone time in the month (420 + 450 = 860). Finally, since there are 1000 minutes in an hour, Jason has 860 / 1000 = 860 hours of phone time in the month.
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 sült krumpli to start with and that Kyle took away 5 of them. So, Griffin had 19 sült krumpli left after Kyle took some away (we don't know how many). Then, Billy took twice as much from Griffin as Kyle did, so he took 38 sült krumpli from Griffin (since Billy took twice as much as Kyle). After this, Colby took 3 less sült krumpli from Griffin than Kyle did, which means Colby took 35 sült krumpli from Griffin (since Colby took 3 less than Kyle). Finally, we are told that Griffin ended up with 27 sült krumpli, so Ginger gave him 3 more sült krumpli than what was taken away from him by all these people combined (including Kyle, Billy, and Colby). Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 3 + 35 = 38 sült krumpli in total.
Response:  In one aquarium, there are 4 fish and in another aquarium, there are 32 fish. If we assume that each fish represents 1 unit of quantity, then...
Response:  The farmer makes $250 per hour and works for 6 hours every day. Therefore, he earns $1500 per day ($250 x 6). Since the movie lasts for 5 weeks, the total amount of money earned by the farmer is $7500 ($1500 x 5). Now, since the sminkes gives a 10% discount to Jean, the amount that Jean pays is $6750 ($7500 x 90%).
Response:  The total cost of the party is $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $2 = $86. Since Isabelle paid for half of it, she paid $86 / 2 = $43. So, Isabelle paid $43.
"Response:  The chef bought 4 baskets of carrots, and each basket contains 50 pounds (or 23 kg). Since each pound costs $1.50, we can calculate how much the chef paid for all those carrots as follows:

$1.50 x 23 kg = $34.50 per basket
$34.50 x 4 baskets = $1380

So, in total, the chef paid $1380 for the 4 baskets of carrots."
Response:  On Monday, Sue ate twice as much bread as her sister (Sue ate 4 times as much bread as her sister). So, if the sister ate x pieces of bread, then Sue ate 2x pieces of bread. On Tuesday, Sue ate half as much bread as her sister (Sue ate 1/2 as much bread as her sister), so if the sister ate x pieces of bread, then Sue ate x/2 pieces of bread. Now we know that the sister ate 5 pieces of bread on Monday and 13 pieces of bread on Tuesday, so Sue ate 2(5) = 10 pieces of bread on Monday and 10/2 = 5 pieces of bread on Tuesday. Therefore, Sue ate a total of 10 + 5 = 15 pieces of bread. Since each piece of bread contains 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 15 x 200 = 3000 calories.
