"Response: 
Janet sells eggs at $2 per variable egg. So she makes $2 x 16 = $32 per day from selling eggs.
Now, let's calculate how much money she makes from baking muffins and selling them to her friends. She bakes 4 muffins every day and sells each one for $2. Therefore, she makes $2 x 4 = $8 per day from selling muffins.
So, in total, Janet makes $32 + $8 = $40 per day from both selling eggs and baking muffins."
"Response:  The first blue vase contains 2 bolts of blue fabric and has half as much white fabric as it does blue fabric. Therefore, the total amount of fabric in the first vase is:

Blue fabric = 2 bolts x 1/2 = 1 bolt
White fabric = 2 bolts x 1/2 = 1 bolt

So there are 1 bolt of blue fabric and 1 bolt of white fabric in the first vase.

Now let's move on to the second vase. It contains 3 bolts of blue fabric and twice as much white fabric as the first vase. So the total amount of fabric in the second vase is:

Blue fabric = 3 bolts x 1 = 3 bolts
White fabric = 3 bolts x 2 = 6 bolts

Therefore, the total amount of fabric in both vases is:

Total fabric = 1 bolt + 3 bolts + 6 bolts = 10 bolts

So there are 10 bolts of fabric in total."
"Response:  The value of the house before renovation was $80,000 and after renovation it increased to $130,000 (150% more). So, the profit made by Josh is:
Profit = New Value - Original Value
= $130,000 - $80,000
= $50,000
Therefore, Josh made a profit of $50,000."
Response:  Since James does three sprints per week and each sprint is 60 meters long, he will do a total of 3 x 60 = 180 meters per week. Therefore, James will have run a total distance of 180 meters per week.
Response:  According to the information provided, Wendy gives her chickens three types of feed every day, which includes mixed grains, vegetables, and protein sources such as mealworms. She also feeds them according to their individual needs, giving each chicken 15 pieces of food in the morning and another 25 pieces in the afternoon. If Wendi has 20 chickens, she will need to give them a total of 375 pieces of food per day (15 x 20 = 300 + 25). Therefore, the correct answer is 375.
"Response:  If one glass of brandy costs $5 and every second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass, then we can write an equation as follows:
Glass 1 = $5
Glass 2 = x (where x is the cost of the second glass)
x = 0.6 \* $5 = $3
So, the total cost of 16 glasses would be:
$5 + ($3 \* 15) = $75
Therefore, Kylar must pay $75 for 16 glasses of brandy."
"Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many ships as Charleston and Charleston has four times as many ships as Seattle. So, we can write this information in an equation:
Toulouse = 2 x Charleston
Charleston = 4 x Seattle
Now, let's add these two equations together to find out how many ships Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have altogether:
Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle =... (1)
Substituting the values from the first equation into the second one, we get:
Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 2 x (4 x Seattle)
= 8 x Seattle
So, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have altogether 8 x Seattle = 160 ships."
"Response: 
Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute, which means she can download 120 GB in an hour (60 minutes).
Now, 40% of that is 48 GB (40% of 120 GB = 48 GB).
So, Carla needs to download 48 GB in one hour.
Therefore, the loading time for the entire 200 GB file is:
Loading time = Total amount to be downloaded / Download speed
= 200 GB / 48 GB/hour
= 4 hours and 20 minutes (rounded up to the nearest whole number)
Therefore, it will take Carla approximately 4 hours and 20 minutes to download the entire 200 GB file."
Response:  We know that John drove for three hours at an average speed of 100 km/h and then turned around because he realized he had forgotten something important near his house. He tried to reach his house within four hours but spent the first two hours stuck in traffic. During the next half hour, he accelerated to 30 mph before reaching his top speed of 80 mph during the remaining time. To find out how far he was from his house at the end of those four hours, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, John traveled at an average speed of 50 km/h (30 mph + 80 mph) for the last two hours, so the distance he covered during that time is: Distance = 50 km/h x 2 hours = 100 km (62 miles). Therefore, John was 100 km (62 miles) away from his house at the end of the four hours.
Response:  If Eliza works for 45 hours at an hourly rate of $10, her total earnings for that week would be: Total hours worked = 45 hours x Hourly wage = $10 per hour Total earnings = Total hours worked x Hourly wage = $450. So, Eliza's income for that week was $450.
Response:  In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. In the second month, it had three times more downloads than in the first month, which means it had 180 downloads (60 x 3 = 180). However, in the third month, it had 30% fewer downloads than in the second month, which means it had 126 downloads (180 x 0.7 = 126). Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.
"Response:  The total cost of all the pastries is given as follows:
Totally, Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 each = $204
She also bought 2 dozen mini-cookies at $80 each = $160
And she bought 6 dozen mini-cake cookies for $55 each = $330
Therefore, the total cost of all the pastries = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694
So, the total cost of all the pastries is $694."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend in total for buying and maintaining the tree over its lifespan. The cost of buying the tree is $90, and he needs to spend $3 every year to take care of it. Therefore, his total expenses are:
Total Expenses = Cost of Tree + Annual Maintenance Costs
= $90 + ($3 x Number of Years)
Now, let's find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making profits from selling the lemons. We know that each lemon costs $1.5, and he can sell 7 lemons annually. So, his annual income from selling lemons is:
Annual Income = Number of Lemons Sold x Price of Each Lemon
= 7 x $1.5
= $10.5
Since Carlos starts with no profit initially, we need to subtract his initial investment (the cost of the tree) from his annual income to get the net profit:
Net Profit = Annual Income - Initial Investment
= $10.5 - $90
= -$80
This means that it will take Carlos 8 years (($90 / $1.5) = 8) before he starts making any profit from his lemon tree."
Response:  We know that Melanie has sold one third of her stock at the green house and two thirds at the red house. So she has sold three parts out of five parts (3/5) of her total stock. Therefore, she has left with 2/5 = 0.4 of her original stock.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students, 20% are in contemporary dance, which means 4 students (20/100 = 0.4). Then we have 25% who are excellent in jazz dance, which is equal to 5 students (25/100 = 0.5). Finally, there are only 3 remaining students who are not in either contemporary or jazz dance. So, the percentage of students in hip hop dance is: 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.2 or 12%. Therefore, 12% of the total number of students are in hip hop dance.
Response:  The total value of both options are as follows: Option A - Juweliersware = R5 000 and Option B - Electronic devices = R8 000. Now let's calculate the expected return for each option based on their respective growth rates: Expected Return (ER) = Growth Rate x Total Value (TV). For Option A, ER = 2.5% x R5 000 = R125. For Option B, ER = 1.2% x R8 000 = R960. So now we have two values: R125 and R960. To determine which option will give the highest returns at the end of the month, we need to compare these values. If the higher return is greater than zero, then that option is the better choice. In this case, R125 > R960, so the better option is Option A - Juweliersware. Therefore, if the handeler chooses Option A, they can expect to make a profit of R125 at the end of the month.
Response:  On day one, both trains start simultaneously from San Rafael and travel 80 miles eastward. Therefore, the distance between them after one day is 80 miles. The next day, they move northwards for 240 kilometers (approximately 150 miles). So, the total distance traveled by each train during these two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.
"Response: 
Jill works for 50 weeks in a year and she spends 35 hours per week as an underwriter and 15 hours per week as a cheerleader coach. Therefore her total working hours are:
Total working hours = 35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Now let's calculate her annual salary based on these working hours:
Annual salary = Total working hours x Hourly wage (underwriter) + Hourly wage (cheerleader coach)
= 1750 hours/year x $20/hour (underwriter) + $30/hour (cheerleader coach)
= $35,000/year (underwriter) + $45,000/year (cheerleader coach)
= $80,000/year
Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $80,000."
Response:  If Claire makes an omelette of 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she will have made a total of 14 omelettes (3 eggs/omelette x 7 days/week) in one week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, she will have made a total of 56 omelettes (14 omelettes/week x 4 weeks). So, Claire will have consumed 56 eggs in 4 weeks.
Response:  If it took her 1 hour to run the first 4 miles and then another hour to run the next 2 miles, she ran a total distance of 6 miles in 2 hours. To find out how fast she needs to run to cover an overall distance of 12 miles in 3 hours, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, if she runs at a speed of 4 miles per hour, she will need to run for 3 hours to cover a distance of 12 miles. Therefore, her speed is 4 miles per hour.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of lemonade (which contains 2/3 water) and we want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice (which contains 1/4 water). When we pour out 1 liter of lemonade, there are now 9 liters left. So, the total amount of water in the remaining mixture is:

9 liters x 2/3 = 6.9 liters

Therefore, there are 6.9 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters."

"Response: 
1st 3 customers bought one each = 3 DVDs
Next 2 customers bought 2 each = 4 DVDs
Last 3 customers did not buy any = 0 DVDs
Total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday = 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs"
"Response:  The kers will be shorter by x centimeters after it has been burning for 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00). We know that the kers smolders every hour and burns with a speed of 2 centimeters per hour. So, in total, the kers will have burned for 4 \* 60 = 240 minutes. Therefore, the distance it will have burned is:
x = 2 cm/hour × 240 min = 480 cm
So, the kers will be shorter by 480 centimeters after it has been burning for 4 hours."
Response:  We know that last year, Kyle bought the best-seller book for $19.50 with a 25% discount from its original price. So we can write an equation as follows: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage) Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) Original Price = $78.00 Therefore, the original price of the book before the discount was $78.00.
Response:  We know that Marie paid $50.50 and she bought: - 1 hen dish for $12 - 5 packs of milk at $3 each - 4 apples at $1.50 each - A few boxes of pizza (let's assume she bought x boxes). Since each box costs $8.50, we can write an equation: Total cost = Number of boxes x Cost per box So, if Marie bought x boxes of pizza, her total cost would be: Total cost = x x $8.50 = $x Therefore, Marie bought 3 boxes of pizza ($8.50 x 3 = $25.50)
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Mishka bought three pairs of shorts, which cost $16.50 each. Therefore, the total cost of the shorts is:

$16.50 x 3 = $49.50

Next, we know that Mishka also bought three pairs of pants, which cost $22.50 each. Therefore, the total cost of the pants is:

$22.50 x 3 = $67.50

Finally, we know that Mishka bought three pairs of shoes, which cost $42 each. Therefore, the total cost of the shoes is:

$42 x 3 = $126

So, in total, Mishka spent:

$49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233

Therefore, the answer to the question is $233."
"Response:  If Cynthia buys cartons of rice with 15 portions of rice in each carton at a cost of $4 per carton, then she will spend:
$4 x 15 = $60 for 15 portions of rice
Therefore, after 60 days, she will have spent a total of:
$60 x 60 = $3,600 on rice
So, after 60 days, Cynthia will have spent $3,600 on rice."
Response:  The distance traveled by Henry is given as 60 miles (myl). He stopped twice during his ride. The first time he stopped after traveling 20 miles and the second time he stopped 15 miles before the end of the ride. So, we need to find out how many miles he traveled between these two stops. We can do this by subtracting the distance he traveled before each stop from the total distance traveled. Therefore, the distance between the two stops = Total distance - Distance traveled before first stop - Distance traveled before second stop. In this case, the total distance traveled by Henry is 60 myl, and he traveled 20 myl before his first stop and 15 myl before his second stop. So, the distance between the two stops = 60 - 20 - 15 = 25 miles.
Response:  We know that Gloria has to choose between two pairs of shoes, each pair costs differently. The first pair of shoes costs $50, and the second pair costs $20 less than the first pair ($70 - $20 = $50). So, if Gloria chooses the first pair of shoes, she will spend $50. If she chooses the second pair of shoes, she will spend $50 + $10 (the cost difference between the two pairs) = $60. Therefore, the total cost of the shoes for Gloria is $60.
"Response:  If Darrel is 7 years older than Allen, and their total age is 162 years, then we can write an equation as follows:
Allen's age = Darrel's age + (7 x 10)
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
Allen's age = 73 + (7 x 10)
Simplifying and solving for Allen's age, we get:
Allen's age = 80 years old
Therefore, Allen is 80 years old after ten years."
Response:  The first friend says that they think there are 80 jelly beans in the pot. The second friend thinks there are 20 more than the first friend, so their estimate is 100 (80 + 20). The third friend thinks there are 25% more than the first friend, which means they estimate there are 104 jelly beans in the pot (80 x 1.25 = 104). So, the average of these three estimates is (80 + 100 + 104) / 3 = 94.
Response:  John takes care of 10 dogs and each dog spends 5 hours per day walking and playing with him. To calculate how many hours he spends on dog care per week, we need to multiply the number of days in a week by the number of hours spent caring for the dogs per day. So, John spends 50 hours (10 dogs x 5 hours/day) taking care of his dogs per week.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we have x silver coins, then we have 30 + x gold coins. Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is 30 + x = 40. So, Gretchen has 40 gold coins.
"Response:  We know that Aaron has 2 fewer jewels than Raymon... (read more)

Solution: Let's think step by step. We know that Aaron has 2 fewer jewels than Raymond, so Aaron has 38 jewels. Since Siobhan has 10 less jewels than Aaron, she has 28 jewels. Therefore, the answer is 28."
Response:  The first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points which means he scored an average of 1 point per minute (4/20). Now, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than his previous score, which is equal to 1 + (25% of 1) = 1.25 points per minute. So, in total, Mike scored 4 + (1.25 x 20) = 4 + 25 = 39 points. Therefore, Mike scored a total of 39 points in the entire 40-minute game.
Response:  If Terry sells two yogurts per day and each yogurt costs $5, then he will make $10 in revenue per day ($5 x 2). Therefore, over 30 days, Terry will make a total of $300 in revenue ($10 x 30).
Response:  John sold all his toys for $15 each and bought games for $20 each. He spent $5 in total. So far, he has $15 x 13 = $195 from selling his toys. Now, he spent $5 on games, so he has $195 - $5 = $190 left. Therefore, John still has 13 Legos.
Response:  We know that John runs for 60 minutes per week, which means he covers a distance of 60/60 = 1 mile in one week. Now, we are told that Hardloop runs three days a week, but we don't know how long he runs each day. However, we do know that he runs for half an hour on the first day (3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours). So, on the first day, Hardloop covers a distance of 1.5 miles. On the other two days, he covers a distance of 1 mile each day since he runs for half an hour each day. Therefore, Hardloop covers a total distance of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 miles in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Hardloop covers a total distance of 3 x 7 = 21 miles in one week.
"Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than she can walk and can cover half of her speed while walking, then we know that:

Speed when running = 4 x Speed when walking (since she runs 4 times faster)
Speed when walking = 1/2 x Speed when running (since she covers half of her speed while walking)

Now, let's find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking:

Time spent running = 1/3 x 6 hours = 2 hours
Time spent walking = 2/3 x 6 hours = 4 hours

Distance traveled while running = Speed when running x Time spent running = 4 x 2 miles/hour = 8 miles
Distance traveled while walking = Speed when walking x Time spent walking = 1/2 x 4 miles/hour = 2 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel a total distance of 8 + 2 = 10 miles in six hours."
Response:  We know that Ben's iPhone is four times older than Brandon's iPhone. So if Ben's iPhone is two years old, then Brandon's iPhone must be twice as old, or four years old. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is four years old.
Response:  If we assume that the range of the dragon's flames is 300 meters and Polly can throw the golden spear 120 meters, then when she has the sapphire stone in her hand, she can throw it 4 times farther than before (i.e., 480 meters). So, with the sapphire stone, Polly can stand at a distance of up to 500 meters from the dragon and still hit it with the golden spear.
Response:  If Ouma Jones baked 5 apple tarts for the fireman's afternoon tea and cut each tart into 8 pieces, then there were 40 pieces of pie (5 x 8 = 40). Since the guests took 7 pieces of pie each, the total number of pieces taken by the guests is 280 (40 x 7 = 280). Therefore, 160 pieces of pie remained after the guests had eaten their fill (280 - 120 = 160).
Response:  According to the nutrition information provided, one serving of Sky Fries (300g) contains 250 calories. If you eat five servings of Sky Fries as your daily caloric intake is 2000 and you have already burned 1800 calories, then you can eat approximately 475 grams of Sky Fries in a day.
"Response:  If he sells each king for $2, and he makes 20 kings, then his total revenue from selling those kings would be:

$2 x 20 = $40
So far so good! But we also need to subtract the cost of making those kings. Since it costs him $10 per pound of beads, and he needs 5 pounds to make one king (since there are 10 beads in each king), then the cost of making one king is:

$10 / 5 = $2
So his total cost for making all 20 kings would be:

$40 + ($2 x 20) = $80
Now we can calculate his profit:

Profit = Revenue - Cost = $40 - $80 = -$40
Oops! It looks like Charlie isn't going to win any money after all. In fact, he will actually lose $40 if he sells all 20 kings at $2 each."
"Response: 
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday and 2/5 (or 2) more articles than she did on Monday on Tuesday. So, she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Tuesday, which means she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.
Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in those three days is:
7 + 14 = 21 hours."
"Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-it notes before she went to work and then stopped at the coffee shop. At the coffee shop, she bought a pack of Post-it notes containing 220 different colored sticky notes. So, if we assume that each pack contains an equal number of Post-it notes as the one Candice already had (i.e., 80), then the total number of Post-it notes Candice purchased is:

Total = Number of Post-its in original bag + Number of Post-its in pack / Total number of Post-its in original bag x Number of Post-its in pack
= 80 + 220 / 80 x 220
= 460
Therefore, there were 460 Post-it notes in the pack that Candice purchased."
"Response:  We know that John has spent $200 on blue doughnuts and each one costs $40. So he has bought 5 blue doughnuts. Now we are told that he has twice as many red bands as blue bands. If he has x red bands, then he has 2x blue bands. Since the red bands cost 50% more than the blue bands, the total amount of money John has spent on both is:
$$ Total = 2x \times (40 + (50\%) \times 40) $$
Simplifying this equation gives us:
$$ Total = 2x \times (80 + 20) = 2x \times 100 $$
Now we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
$$ x = Total / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50 $$
So John has 50 red bands."
Response:  We know that Tracy has a piece of string that is one meter long and she wants to use it to support tomato plants in her garden. She cuts the string into pieces of 15 centimeters each. To find out how many pieces she can make from the original string, we need to divide the length of the string (one meter) by the length of each piece (15 centimeters): Number of pieces = Length of string / Length of each piece = 1 m / 0.15 m = 7 pieces So, Tracy can make seven pieces of string using the original one-meter piece.
Response:  The building has 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, so there are 15 x 8 = 120 units in total. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can assume that 3/4 of 120 = 90 units are occupied. Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units is 120 - 90 = 30 units.
Response:  The number of eggs produced per day is given as 252 eggs/day. If each egg sells for $2/dose, then the total revenue from eggs per day is: 252 eggs/day x $2/egg = $504/day. So, Lloyd earns $504/day from eggs. Now, let's calculate his weekly income: $504/day x 7 days/week = $3,530/week. Therefore, Lloyd earns $3,530/week from selling eggs.
Response:  We know that Tom skips for 4 hours from 13:00 to 16:00 at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to return, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance he skied is 40 miles (since he skied for 4 hours), and his average speed was 10 miles per hour. So, if we divide the distance by his average speed, we get: Time = 40 miles / 10 miles/hour = 4 hours. Therefore, it will take Tom 4 hours to return.
Response:  If Uria has to remove 15 pounds of food from his home, and each stroekie print weighs half a pound (or quarter pound), then he will have to remove 30 stroekie prints. Since each plaything weighs half a pound (or half a pound), Uria must take away 60 playthings. Therefore, the correct response is 60.
"Response: 
Day 1 (Thursday):
* The worker repairs 6 vagmotor bands and earns $60 x 6 = $360.
Total income for the day: $360.
Day 2 (Friday):
* The worker does not repair any vagmotor bands as stated in the problem.
* However, the worker repairs 12 motor reeks and earns $40 x 12 = $480.
Total income for the day: $480.
Therefore, the total income for both days is: $360 + $480 = $840."
Response:  According to the question, the Doubtfire family had two cats, Patchy and Trixie. Patchy had three times more kittens than what was at the local school, which means he had 3 x 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens for the Doubtfire family is 21 + 12 = 33 kittens.
Response:  If Jean has already eaten 2 of the delicious sugar cookies and wants to put 2 more in a bag, then he will have 4 sugar cookies left (since there are 30 in total). So, he can fill 4 bags with 2 sugar cookies each. Therefore, the answer is 4 bags.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn each time he goes to the movies, then his total cost per trip is $14 ($7 + $7). Since he has $42 for the whole week, he can go to the movies $\frac{42}{14} = 3$ times per week.
"Response:  The maximum number of boxes that can be placed on the motor without exceeding the maximum weight of the bridge is equal to the total weight of the boxes divided by the weight of each box. In this case, the total weight of the boxes is 5000 pounds (which is the maximum weight allowed for the bridge), and each box weighs 15 pounds. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be placed on the motor is:

5000 / 15 = 333 boxes
So, the maximum number of boxes that can be placed on the motor without exceeding the maximum weight of the bridge is 333."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the discount given by the retailer. Since it was an installment sale, the discount is 25% of the final bill, which is $10 (25% x $40). So, the final amount paid by Stephen is $30 ($40 - $10). Then, we add the extra fee of $4, so the final price of Stephen's groceries is $34 ($30 + $4).
Response:  We know that there are six groups of 20 fruit each and 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the forest. So, we can calculate the total number of framboses as follows: Total number of groups = Number of groups x 20 fruit per group = 6 x 20 = 120 fruitTotal number of individual fruits = Number of individual fruits per group x Number of groups = 67 x 6 = 392 fruitTherefore, there are 120 + 392 = 512 framboses in total.
Response:  We know that there are 25 lemons in total and we want to find out how many good ones there are. From the information given, we can conclude that: • 1 lemon is bad (sleg) • 20% of the lemons are unripe (onvolwassen) • The remaining 80% of the lemons are ripe (goed) So, if we convert these percentages into actual numbers, we get: • Bad lemons = 1 x 25 = 25 Good lemons = 25 - 2 x 25 = 16 Now, let’s calculate the number of good lemons as follows: Number of good lemons = Total number of lemons x Percentage of good lemons Good lemons = 25 x 80/100 = 16 Therefore, there are 16 good lemons in the basket.
"Response: 
Janet paid $500 for the materials to make the necklace and then an additional $800 to the jeweler to have it made. Therefore, she has spent a total of $1,300 so far (500 + 800).
Then, she pays 10% of that amount as insurance, which is $130 (1,300 x 10%). So, in total, Janet has paid $1,430 ($1,300 + $130) for the necklace."
"Response:  We know that Marcy has worked for the same company for 40 years and received an annual pension of $50,000 for 20 years. Therefore, her total accumulated value is:
Yearly Pension x Number of Years = Total Accumulated Value
$50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000
Now, after 30 years, the yearly pension will be calculated as follows:
Total Accumulated Value / (Number of Years - 20) = Yearly Pension After 30 Years
$1,000,000 / 10 = $100,000 per year
Therefore, Marcy's yearly pension after 30 years will be $100,000."
Response:  The initial amount was R140 per month, which means it is R140 x 12 = R1680 for the first half of the year (January to June). Then, in the second half of the year (July to December), she will pay 10% less, so it is R1680 x 9/12 = R1376. Therefore, the total amount she will pay at the end of the year is R1680 + R1376 = R3056.
"Response:  We know that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since she last filled her tank and needed 4 liters of fuel to refill it. According to the user manual for her motorcycle, its tank can hold 12 liters of fuel. To find out how far Sophia can ride on one tank of fuel, we need to divide the distance she has traveled (in miles) by the amount of fuel she has left in her tank (in liters). So, the answer is:

Kilometers = Miles / Liters
= 100 / 4
= 25 kilometers
Therefore, Sophia can ride approximately 25 kilometers on one tank of fuel."
"Response: 
Jim watches two hours of TV and then decides to go to bed early and read for half an hour. He does this three times a week. To find out how many hours he spends reading in four weeks, we need to multiply the number of times he reads for half an hour by the number of weeks. So, Jim spends 3 x 4 = 12 hours reading in four weeks."
"Response:  We have four schools participating in the basketball tournament and each school has sent both male and female teams as well as coaches for each team. Therefore, we need to calculate how many people are involved from each school.
Male Teams: Each school has sent one male team with 5 players, so there are 4 x 5 = 20 male players in total.
Female Teams: Each school has sent one female team with 5 players, so there are 4 x 5 = 20 female players in total.
Coaches: Each school has sent one coach for each team, so there are 4 x 1 = 4 coaches in total.
Therefore, the total number of people involved from each school is 20 + 20 + 4 = 64."
Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. And we also know that there were twice as many emeralds as rubies, so the number of emeralds is 140 x 2 = 280. Therefore, the total value of jewels found at the grave is 175 + 140 + 280 = 695.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. So, if there are 60 girls and 5 students for every teacher, then there must be 120 boys (twice the number of girls). Therefore, there are 7 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school (60 girls x 5 students/girl + 120 boys x 1 teacher/boy = 7 teachers).
Response:  Bailey received $5 per week for 8 weeks, so he had $40 in total ($5 x 8). At the end of the 8 weeks, he had an additional amount of $60, bringing his total to $100. So, Bailey began with $40 + $60 = $100.
Response:  There are 5 dance classes per day (Monday to Saturday), and each class has 8 students. Therefore, there are 5 x 8 = 40 students attending dance classes every day. Since each student pays $15 per lesson, the total amount of money earned by Judy Gee in one week is: 40 students x $15 per student = $600 per week.
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first recipe. Therefore, if we multiply 20 by 2, we get 40 instructions in total for both recipes combined. So, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both geregtes.
"Response:  If Tommy sold 43 brownies at $3 each and 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 each, he would have earned a total of:

$3 x 43 = $132 from brownies
$4 x 23 = $92 from cheesecake
Total amount earned by Tommy = $132 + $92 = $224
Therefore, Tommy will collect $224 in charity funds."
Response:  We know that Sheila bought four smartphones for $150 each and will pay for them over three months with an interest rate of 2%. To calculate how much she will pay per month, we can use the formula: Total Cost / Number of Payments = Monthly Payment. In this case, the total cost is $600 (4 x $150), and the number of payments is 3. So, Sheila will pay $200 per month ($600 / 3) for three months.
Response:  If Artie sells 12 pots of gold flowers for $2.74 each, he will make $32.08 ($2.74 x 12). For petunias, if he sells 9 pots at $1.87 each, he will make $16.53 ($1.87 x 9). And for begonias, if he sells 17 pots at $2.12 each, he will make $35.34 ($2.12 x 17). So in total, Artie will make $83.95 ($32.08 + $16.53 + $35.34).
Response:  If we have a square with side length x meters and we want to find its area, we know that the formula for the area of a square is A = x^2. So if we make four such squares, each one will have an area of 4x^2 square meters. Now, in this case, the biggest square has a side length of 16 meters, so its area is 4(16)^2 = 656 square meters. Therefore, the average area of all four squares is 656/4 = 164 square meters.
"Response:  According to Cecilia's veterinarian, she must give her dog 180 treats every day for the first 180 days of its life. Then, she must give it 2 treats every day for the rest of its life. Since one bag of treats contains 110 treats, how many bags will Cecilia use in the first year?

To find out, we can divide the total number of treats that Cecilia needs to give her dog over the course of its lifetime (365 days) by the number of treats in each bag:

Total number of treats = 365 days x 2 treats/day = 730 treats
Number of bags = Total number of treats / Number of treats per bag = 730 treats / 110 treats/bag = 6.67 bags
Therefore, Cecilia will use approximately 6.67 bags of treats in the first year."
"Response:  We know that:
Raymond did 8 times as much work as Sarah (so he did 8 x 400 = 3200 pounds of work).
Sarah did 4 times as much work as David (so she did 4 x 400 = 1600 pounds of work).
Therefore, the difference between the amount of work done by Raymond and David is:
3200 - 1600 = 1600 pounds of work."
Response:  If we buy three bunches of flowers for R2,50 each, it will cost us R7,50 (3 x R2,50). Now if we buy two bunches of flowers for R1,50 each, it will also cost us R3 (2 x R1,50). So altogether, buying all 18 bunches of flowers will cost us R10,50 (R7,50 + R3). Therefore, we can save R6,50 ($4) by buying them in bulk.
"Response:  The cost of the dog grooming service without any discount is $100. If we apply a 30% discount, the new price will be:
$100 x (1 - 0.30) = $70
So, the cost of the dog grooming service after applying the discount is $70."
Response:  The two girls have each received 1/6 of the total amount of water (24 liters), so between them they have 24/6 = 4 liters of water. Now, the boy has 6 liters of water, which is not part of the original total amount given to the girls. So, the remaining amount of water that hasn't been distributed yet is 24 - 4 - 6 = 14 liters. Therefore, there are 14 liters of water left over after everyone has had their share.
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 stickers at first and then he bought 21 more from a store in the mall. So, his total number of stickers was 10 + 21 = 31. Later, he gave 9 stickers to his sister and used 28 for decorating a birthday card. Therefore, Charlie has 31 - 9 - 28 = 7 stickers left.
Response:  If Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs 2 pounds, then together they weigh 127 pounds (125 + 2). So their total weight is 127 pounds.
"Response:  We know that Dan has planted three rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Therefore, we have:
3 x 25 = 75 roses in total. Now, each rose has 8 dors. So, we can calculate the number of dors as follows:
75 x 8 = 600 dors."
Response:  We know that they won 22 matches and lost 10 matches. So, we can calculate their total wins as follows: Wins = Number of matches won + Number of matches won - Number of matches lost = 22 + 22 - 10 = 34 matches won. Therefore, they won 34 more matches than they lost.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Gene has taken four vacations every year since he turned 23 years old (which means he is now 34). Therefore, he has taken 14 vacations so far (4 x 34 = 140). Since each vacation consists of one comber from another year's hemmed fabric, we can assume that Gene has collected 140 different combers over the years.
Response:  The first time it went off, it beeped four times. The second time it went off, it beeped three times as long as the first time. So the third time it went off, it beeped half as long as the second time, which is three times shorter than the first time. Therefore, the total number of beeps was 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.
Response:  According to the policy of the company, every employee receives $600 per month. And for those who have worked at the company for more than five years, their salary will increase by 10% of their original salary each year. So if Sylvie has been working at the company for five years as of December last year (2022), her annual salary after three more years would be calculated as follows: Yearly Salary = Original Salary x (1 + Increase Percentage) ^ Number of Years Worked At Company After that, we need to find out how many years it has been since December last year (2022). If we assume that the current year is 2023, then the number of years since December last year can be calculated as follows: Number Of Years Since December Last Year = Current Year - December Last Year (2022) = 2023 - 2022 = 1 Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years would be: Yearly Salary = Original Salary x (1 + 10%)^5 x (1 + 10%)^(3) = $600 x $70 x $80 = $49,200 This means that Sylvie's annual salary after three more years would be $49,200.
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald and they together sold 88,000 records. So if Marilyn sold x records, then Harald sold x/10 records. Therefore, we can write an equation: x = (88,000 / 10) = 8800. Thus, Harald sold 8800 records.
Response:  We know that Christina needs 75 gift bags for all guests to attend her birthday party and she has 16 friends who will come. Each gift bag costs $2, so we need to calculate how much money Christina will spend in total. Therefore, the calculation would look like this: Total cost = Number of gift bags x Cost per gift bag = 75 x $2 = $150 So, Christina will spend $150 on gift bags for her birthday party.
Response:  We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of applesauce and a child will eat half as much (5 pounds). Since there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, we need to calculate how many total pounds of applesauce Ted needs to bring to feed everyone. So, we can multiply the number of adults by the amount each one will eat (10 pounds) and add it to the number of children and their share (5 pounds): 20 x 10 = 200 + 5 = 205 pounds. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 205 pounds of applesauce to the picnic.
Response:  We know that Jan has three times more stuffed animals than Marcia. So if Marcia has x stuffed animals, then Jan has 3x stuffed animals. We also know that Cindy has two more stuffed animals than Marcia, so Cindy has x + 2 stuffed animals. Finally, we are told that Cindy has four stuffed animals in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3x = (x + 2) + 4. Solving for x, we get x = 10. So Jan has 30 stuffed animals, Marcia has 10 stuffed animals, and Cindy has 14 stuffed animals.
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write:
Amy - 5 = Jackson + 2
We also know that James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey, so we can write:
James - 1 = Corey + 1
Now we have two equations:
Amy - 5 = Jackson + 2
James - 1 = Corey + 1
Can you solve these equations to find out how old Jackson is?"
"Response:  If Lee can run the 400m hurdles in 38 seconds, and he improved his speed by 10%, then his new time would be:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 400 m / (1.1 x 0.9)
= 352.67 s

So, if Gerald wants to run the 400m hurdles in 352.67 seconds, with his improved diet, he will need to improve his speed by approximately 10%. This means that he needs to reduce his time by about 10% of the current time, which is:

Time reduction = New time - Old time
= 352.67 s - 38 s
= 294.67 s

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400m hurdles in approximately 294.67 seconds, given his improved diet and increased speed."
Response:  We know that there are fewer dogs than cats in the neighborhood. If there are 12 less cats than dogs, then the number of dogs is equal to twice the number of cats minus 2. Since there are 60 dogs and 48 cats (including two cats per dog), we can calculate the number of dogs as follows: Number of dogs = 2(Number of cats) - 2 Number of dogs = 2(48) - 2 Number of dogs = 96 Therefore, there are 96 dogs in the neighborhood.
Response:  We know that out of the total number of students (200), 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls. So, the number of boys = 2 x 200 / 5 = 40. And the number of girls = 2 x 200 / 3 = 67. Therefore, there are 40 boys and 67 girls in the boy scouts.
"Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept, then we can write an equation:

Harry slept x hours
James slept (2/3)x hours

We know that Harry slept 9 hours, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

x = 9

Now we need to find out how many hours Harry slept more than James. We can do this by subtracting the amount of time James slept from the amount of time Harry slept:

Difference in hours = x - (2/3)x
= 9 - (2/3) \* 9
= 9 - 6
= 3

So Harry slept 3 hours more than James."
"Response:  If each batch of tamarinds that Freda makes loses half its volume during cooking, and every batch contains three tamarinds, then how many tamarinds did Freda use to make her last batch of 32 ounces of tamarind sauce?

Step-by-step calculation:
1. First, let's calculate the total number of tamarinds needed for the last batch of tamarind sauce:
Number of tamarinds = Total volume of tamarind sauce / Volume of one tamarind
= 32 oz / 0.5 oz (volume of one tamarind)
= 64 tamarinds
2. Now, we know that each batch of tamarinds that Freda makes contains three tamarinds. So, if Freda used 64 tamarinds to make her last batch of tamarind sauce, then she must have made:
Number of batches = Total number of tamarinds / Number of tamarinds per batch
= 64 tamarinds / 3 tamarinds/batch
= 21 batches
Therefore, Freda used 21 batches of tamarinds to make her last batch of tamarind sauce."
Response:  The first group of 15 minutes consists of 15 minutes + 5 minutes = 20 minutes. In this time frame, 10 motorcycles (since 5 did not take an exit) rode through the traffic jam, so there were 10 / 20 = 0.5 or 1/2 motorcycle per minute that rode through the traffic jam during this period. Therefore, in the first 15 minutes, 10 / 15 = 0.67 or approximately 1/2 motorcycle passed through the traffic jam every 15 seconds.
Response:  We know that Maria has already planted 2 plants per each of the 40 windows in her big house, which means she has planted a total of 80 plants so far (2 x 40 = 80). Now, she wants to give more plants to friends and family, so we need to find out how many plants she will have left after giving them away. Let's assume that she gives away half of the remaining plants (50 - 20 = 30) to friends and family. So, Maria will have 30 plants left after giving them away (80 - 30 = 30).
Response:  The first friend visited Jerome 20 times before Jerome answered the door, so each of his visits took 5 minutes (since there are 20 visits). Therefore, the second friend visited Jerome for 5 minutes less than the first friend, since he only visited once. So, the second friend visited Jerome for 4 minutes per visit. Since the third friend visited Jerome ten more times than the fourth friend, and each visit takes 4 minutes, then the third friend visited Jerome for 40 minutes in total (4 x 10 = 40). Finally, if the fourth friend visited Jerome 60 times, then he spent 60 x 4 = 240 minutes at Jerome's house. In conclusion, the doorknocker made 240 klokkies.
"Response: 
Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science Handbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies Handbook, 7 pages from his History Handbook, and 8 pages from his Geography Handbook. In total, he has to read 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages in one day. So, if he still has 4 days left to complete all of his reading work, he will have to read approximately 39 / 4 = 9.75 pages per day."
Response:  We know that John has to drink water for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day of the week. Therefore, he will have to drink 3 x 3 = 9 glasses of water per day. Since he also had a glass before going to bed, we can add one more glass to his daily total, making it 10 glasses of water per day. So, in a week, John will drink 7 days x 10 glasses/day = 70 glasses of water.
"Response:  The distance from the sea to the city is 42 miles (or 67.6 km). If it takes 10 minutes to cover each mile of the city, then it will take:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 67.6 km / 10 min/mile
= 6.76 hours

Therefore, it will take the bank 6.76 hours to completely cover the city."
Response:  We know that Poppy has already placed 25% of the cards (1/4) on the board. Now, we need to find out how much more needs to be placed. So, if Poppy has placed 25%, then Ma has placed 37.5% (1/3). Therefore, there are still 62.5% (3/4) of the cards left to place. To find out how many cards this is, divide 62.5% by 100 and you get 62.5 cards. So, there are 62.5 cards remaining to be placed on the board.
Response:  If Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir does, that means Cody eats 3 x 5 = 15 cookies. So, together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.
Response:  The volume of each box = length x width x height = 5 cm x 6 cm x 4 cm = 120 cubic centimeters (or cubic inches). Since there are three boxes, the total volume = 3 x 120 = 360 cubic centimeters (or cubic inches).
"Response: 
Frankie watches TV every day after he finishes his homework. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches each show for an hour. Wednesday, he watches two shows of 30 minutes each. Thursday, he does early morning homework and then watches one hourlong show and another 30-minute program. Friday, he sleeps in late and watches two hourlong shows. If Frankie watched TV for 7 hours total, how many 30-minute shows did he watch on Wednesday?
Solution: To find out how many 30-minute shows Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to subtract the time he spent doing homework from the total time he spent watching TV. According to the question, Frankie spent 2 hours doing homework on Wednesday, so if he watched TV for 5 hours (instead of 7), he would have watched 10 30-minute shows (not including the hourlong programs). Therefore, the answer is 10."
Response:  Last year, Henry made x koekies. This year, he wants to make twice that amount (2x). So, he makes 2x + 5 = 110 koekies in total this year. Now, let's find out how many koekies he made last year. Since he made 110 koekies this year and 5 of them fell while he was taking them out of the oven, he actually made 110 - 5 = x koekies last year. Therefore, the answer is x = 105.
"Response:  The plains like Benzine tank sells gas for $3.00 per gallon and an app company gives back $0.20 per gallon when you fill up at this station. If someone buys 10 liters of gas, how much will they get after the rebate bonus?

Firstly, let's convert the price of gas from dollars to liters:
$3.00 / $0.00625 (conversion rate) = $48.75 per liter

Now, let's calculate the total cost of 10 liters of gas:
$48.75 x 10 = $487.50

Next, let's subtract the rebate amount:
$487.50 - $0.20 x 10 = $487.30

Therefore, if someone buys 10 liters of gas at the plains like Benzine tank, they will receive a rebate bonus of $487.30 after filling up their car."
"Response:  We know that both Marcell and Beatrice have eaten their entire supply of rolls. So, we can start with the information given in the problem:
Marcell has eaten 3 rolls wide and 14 rolls long, which means he has a total area of 3 x 14 = 42 square rolls.
Beatrice has eaten 2 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, which means she has a total area of 2 x 24 = 48 square rolls.
Now, we need to find out how much they have eaten in total. To do this, we will divide the total area of each person by the number of people involved in the contest:
Total area eaten by Marcell = 42 / 2 = 21 square rolls
Total area eaten by Beatrice = 48 / 2 = 24 square rolls
So, the average amount of rolls eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
Average = (21 + 24) / 2 = 22 square rolls
Therefore, the answer to the question is 22 square rolls."
Response:  The boat took two liters of water for every ten feet it traveled away from the shore. Since Julia traveled twenty feet to reach the point where she could see the shore again, the boat took four liters of water (20/5 = 4). It then took sixteen seconds to travel that distance (64 - 20 = 16), so the total amount of water taken in is eight liters (4 + 8 = 12).
"Response:  Since there are four teachers and each teacher has two lessons per day, we have a total of eight lessons per day. Now, since the whiteboard is shared among these four teachers, it will be used three times per lesson (since it needs to be cleaned thrice). Therefore, the number of times the whiteboard will be cleaned in one day is:
8 lessons/day x 3 uses/lesson = 24 times/day
So, the whiteboard will be cleaned 24 times in a day."
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 blooms per day and it takes 15 days for them to grow, then he will have 30 blooms (2 x 2 = 4 x 15).
Response:  We know that Brittany can hold 50 more photos than the number of elephants in Jamal's photo of one elephant at the zoo. So if Jamal has 1800 photos, then Brittany can hold 1800 x 50 = 90000 photos. Therefore, there are 90000 elephants in Jamal's photo of one elephant at the zoo.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha spent on buying the wood. She bought ten pieces of 2x4 lumber that cost her $10 each, so she paid a total of $100 for those. Then, she bought five pieces of 4x4 lumber that cost her $16 each, so she paid a total of $80 for those. Therefore, in total, Sasha spent $180 on buying the wood. Now, let's find out how much profit she made from selling it. To do this, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the total amount she sold the wood for. According to the question, she sold all of the wood she had, which means she sold the entire $260 worth of wood. So, if she spent $180 on buying it and sold it for $260, her profit is $80 ($260 - $180).
"Response:  If Katy used 120 tea spoons of sugar and cups of water to make coffee with a ratio of 7:13, we can calculate how many tea spoons of sugar she used as follows:

Step 1: Convert the volume of water from cups to tea spoons. There are 8 tea spoons in 1 cup, so:

120 / 8 = 15 tea spoons of water

Step 2: Now, use the given ratio to determine how much sugar Katy used relative to the water. Since the ratio is 7:13, for every 7 parts of water, there are 13 parts of sugar:

15 (water) x 7/13 = 10.7 tea spoons of sugar

So, Katy used approximately 10.7 tea spoons of sugar to make her coffee."
Response:  For each of his three children, John has to buy two pairs of shoes at $60 per pair. Therefore, he will have to pay a total amount of: 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of shoes x $60 = $360. So, John will have to pay $360 in total for all three pairs of shoes.
"Response:  On day one, there were two hours with five vehicles each, so in total, there were 10 vehicles at the beach (2 x 5 = 10). The next day, more hours were brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the beach became 30. To find out how many hours were added on the second day, we need to subtract the original number of hours from the new total number of hours. Therefore, the number of hours added on the second day is:

30 - 10 = 20

So, 20 hours were added on the second day."
Response:  We know that Adrien's total salary increased by 30% in four years and then decreased by 20%. So we can calculate his new total salary using the following formula: New Total Salary = Old Total Salary x (1 + Increase Percentage) ^ Number of Years Then we need to find out how many years passed between when Adrien's salary increased by 30% and when he earned $40,000. Based on the information provided, it took four years for Adrien's salary to increase by 30%, so the time period between these two events is 4 years. Now let's plug in the values we have found into the formula: New Total Salary = $60,000 x (1 + 0.30)^4 = $87,500 Therefore, Adrien's total salary four years after his last increase was $87,500.
Response:  If Miguel uses two sheets of paper per week and there are 30 sheets of paper on a roll, then he will use 2 x 4 = 8 sheets of paper per month. Therefore, he will use 8 sheets of paper every month.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 lemons, which means he brought a total of 13 fruits (5 + 8 = 13). Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half as many lemons as Morisette, which means he brought 1/2 x 8 = 4 lemons. In total, both boys brought 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours. The next two days, she slept for 2 hours less than that, so she slept for 6 hours each day. Since she made up those missed hours at the end of the week and slept for an extra hour each night, she totalled 40 hours of sleep during the entire week (8 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 40).
Response:  If Rosie can run for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour, then she has covered a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles. Now, if she runs for another 5 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour, she will cover a distance of 5 x 60 = 300 miles. Therefore, in total, Rosie has covered a distance of 180 + 300 = 480 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  We know that Jennie has helped her mother with 60 baskets of strawberries and there are 30 already stamped baskets. So, if she started helping after 20 baskets were already stamped, then she must have helped for 40 baskets (60 - 30 = 40).
Response:  We know that Julia bought a new pack of skewers and her husband also bought her another pack of 5 small spoons. She used 3 of those small spoons to taste her stew while she was cooking it. So, the number of small spoons left in the original pack is 12 - 3 = 9. Therefore, there were 9 small spoons in the pack that Julia bought.
Response:  If Dylan needed 40 chicken wings and 6 more fish wings as chicken wings, then he bought 38 chicken wings x R15 per wing = R570 worth of chicken wings. Additionally, he bought 6 fish wings x R20 per wing = R120 worth of fish wings. Therefore, Dylan spent a total of R570 + R120 = R690 on wings for his party.
Response:  If Amy has made 20 more friends than Lily, that means Lily had 50 - 20 = 30 friends initially. So, together they have 30 + 20 = 50 friends.
Response:  The cost of one watermelon is three times that of one pepper, so the cost of one watermelon is $3 x 3 = $9. The cost of one orange is $5 less than the cost of one watermelon, so the cost of one orange is $9 - $5 = $4. Therefore, the total amount of money Dylan will spend on all the fruits is: $9 + $4 + $10 = $23.
Response:  The hospital sees 500 patients per day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent by doctors at the hospital is: Time = Number of patients x Average time per patient = 500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes per day Now, let's calculate how much money the hospital makes from these visits: Revenue = Total time spent by doctors x Rate per hour (for doctors) + Total time spent by hospital staff x Rate per hour (for hospital staff) = 12,000 minutes/day x $150/hour (for doctors) + 12,000 minutes/day x $200/hour (for hospital staff) = $180,000 per day ($150/hour x 12,000 minutes) + $240,000 per day ($200/hour x 12,000 minutes) = $420,000 per day So, the hospital makes approximately $420,000 per day in revenue from doctor visits alone!
"Response:  The total number of workers = 60. Now, let's analyze how many workers stop working after certain events occur:

* After 30% of the workers have children (20 out of 60 workers), they stop working. So, the remaining workers = 40.
* After 10 workers are hit on their shoes (5 out of 40 workers), they stop working. So, the remaining workers = 35.

Therefore, there are 35 workers who continue to work at Nissa's store."
Response:  If Joseph spent $500 in May and then $60 less in June, that means he spent a total of $440 in those two months combined. So, his total expenditure for those two months is $440.
"Response: 
Pam and Fred went to the mountain after a carnival. Pam climbed twice up the mountain and down again while Fred climbed four times up and down. Then they decided to take a ride on the cable car. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, how many tickets did they use that day?

Step 1: Pam climbed twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for her climbs.
Step 2: Fred climbed four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets for his climbs.
Total number of tickets used = 12 + 24 = 36 tickets."
Response:  On Monday, Walter ran 4 miles. On Tuesday, he ran 6 times more than what he ran on Monday, which means he ran 4 x 6 = 24 miles. Therefore, Walter ran a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles from Monday to Wednesday. So, he ran 28 miles on Wednesday.
Response:  Tom washes his car four times a month. Therefore, he washes it 4 x 12 = 48 times a year. Since each wash costs $15, Tom pays $15 x 48 = $720 per year for washing his car.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and lost 5 of them before the comparison was made. So, Brian had 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Now, we are told that Bobby has 3 times as many video games as Brian, which means Bobby has 3 x 15 = 45 video games. Therefore, Bobby has 45 video games.
"Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world and one-third of them are located in Scotland. Two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, how many female Scottish unicorns are there?

Let's convert the fraction to a decimal:

1/3 = 0.33

Now, we multiply the number of Scottish unicorns (which is two-thirds of the total) by the proportion of female unicorns:

(2/3) x 0.33 = 0.67

So, there are approximately 67 female Scottish unicorns."
"Response: 
Rory bought two cookies for $7.50 each and two skydives for $1.50 each. Therefore, her total purchase was:
$7.50 x 2 = $15.00 (cookies) + $1.50 x 2 = $3.00 (sky dives) = Total cost of purchases = $18.00
Since there is a 20% discount, we need to calculate the amount that Rory will pay after applying the discount:
Discount percentage = 20% = 0.20
Amount paid after discount = Total cost of purchases x Discount percentage = $18.00 x 0.20 = $3.60
So, Rory will pay $3.60 after applying the discount. If she wants to add $5.00 as an additional payment, then her final payment will be:
Final payment = Additional payment + Amount paid after discount = $5.00 + $3.60 = $8.60"
"Response:  If Markus took 8 hours to complete the first test with 75 questions and 6 hours to complete the second test with 100 questions, then we can calculate his completion rate as follows:

Time taken for first test = 8 hours
Number of questions in first test = 75
Completely answered questions = Number of questions x Time taken / Hours per question
= 75 x 8 / 5
= 32

So, Markus completed 32 out of 75 questions correctly in the first test. Similarly, he completed 32 out of 100 questions correctly in the second test. Therefore, the number of questions that Markus did not complete is:

Not completely answered questions = Total number of questions - Completely answered questions
= 100 - 32
= 68

Therefore, Markus did not complete 68 questions in the two tests combined."
Response:  We know that there are 4 times more purple balls than blue balls in the bag. So if there are 12 blue balls, then there are 48 (12 x 4) purple balls. Therefore, there are 48 + 12 = 60 balls in total in the bag.
Response:  We know that there are 20 motors available for rent and we have already identified 12 as automatic motors. So, the number of non-automatic motors (semi-automatic) can be calculated as follows: Number of non-automatic motors = Total number of motors - Number of automatic motors = 20 - 12 = 8. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic motors in the total number of motors is 8/20 x 100% = 40%.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in the box and twice as many worker bees as drones (or 1400 worker bees). Additionally, we know that there are twice as many drone bees as queen bees (or 280 queen bees). Therefore, the number of worker bees can be calculated as follows: Number of worker bees = Total number of bees x Ratio of worker bees to total bees Worker bees = 700 x 1/3 = 233 Queen bees + Drone bees = 700 - 280 = 420 So, there are approximately 420 worker bees in the box.
Response:  Jordan plays video games for two hours every day and earns $10 per hour working part-time. To calculate how much money he would make in a week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by seven (since there are seven days in a week). So, if Jordan makes $20 per day playing video games ($10/hour x 2 hours), then he would make $140 per week ($20 x 7 days).
"Response:  The cost of each item can be calculated as follows:
* Melk: $2 x 10 = $20 (since there is a 10% tax on non-food items)
* Eiers: $3 x 10 = $30 (same as above)
* Gloeilampe: $3 x 9 = $27 (since there is no tax on food items)
* Bekers: $3 x 10 = $30 (again, same as above)
* Kakkerlakvalle: $4 x 9 = $36 (no tax on food items)
So, in total, everything costs: $20 + $30 + $27 + $30 + $36 = $189."
"Response:  Firstly, let's calculate how much money each client will spend on cleaning products per month. There are 5 potential clients, and each of them needs 2 bottles of bleach solution and a pack of cloths to clean their houses. The cost of one bottle of bleach solution is $2, and the cost of a pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the total amount that each client will spend on cleaning products per month is:

$2 x 2 = $4 for two bottles of bleach solution (per client)
$5 x 1 = $5 for a pack of cloths (per client)
Total amount spent by each client per month = $4 + $5 = $9
Now, let's calculate the total income of Lucas' business per week. If he has 3 clients already, and he expects to get 5 more clients, then his total number of clients will be 8. Each client pays $9 per month for cleaning services, which means Lucas' total income from all clients per month is:

$9 x 8 clients = $72 per month
Therefore, Lucas' total income from all clients per week is:

$72 / 4 weeks = $18 per week
So, Lucas' wins per week can be calculated as follows:

Wins = Total income - Total expenses
= $18 - ($4 x 3 clients + $5 x 5 potential clients)
= $18 - ($12 + $25)
= $18 - $37
= -$19
Lucas does not make any profit or have any wins per week because his total expenses exceed his total income."
Response:  If John has 10 hectares of land and there are 100 pineapples per hectare, then he has a total of 1000 pineapples (10 x 100 = 1000). Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he will have 4 harvests per year (12 / 3 = 4). Therefore, John can harvest a total of 4000 pineapples per year (1000 x 4 = 4000).
Response:  We know that Johnny has 500 Legos on the floor and he wants to find out how many he will have if he picks up all of them. To do this, we need to use the information given in the problem. The number of Legos per packet is three times the number of packets, which means there are 3 x 500 = 1500 Legos in total. Since one quarter of the Legos are already picked up, there are 1500 - (1/4) = 1200 Legos left to be picked up. So, Johnny will have 1200 Legos if he picks up all of them.
"Response:  We know that $30$ bees left the hive during the first $6$ hours and then returned within the next $6$ hours. So, we have a total of $45$ bees ($30 + \frac{1}{2} \times 45$). Then, two times more bees departed from the hive than what was initially seen leaving it, which means an additional $90$ bees departed ($45 \times 2$). Therefore, the number of bees that returned to the hive after $6$ hours is:
$$\boxed{\text { $90$ bees}}$$"
Response:  The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and that of a child ticket is $10. Since Brittany's mom gave the cashier $8, it means she bought one child ticket ($10 x 0.8 = $8). So, Brittany had to pay for her own adult ticket, which costs $12 - $8 = $4.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then Charlie has 3x friends. Furthermore, we are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy does. Therefore, if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then James has 4x friends. Finally, we are given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. So, we can set up the equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, James has 4x = 48 friends on Facebook.
Response:  We know that Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute and Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for them to reach their houses after the race is over, we need to divide the distance between their houses by their speed. For Steve, the distance between his house and the school is 3 miles, so he will cover this distance in 3/440 = 7 minutes. For Tim, the distance between his house and the school is 2 miles, so he will cover this distance in 2/264 = 8 minutes. Therefore, the winner will arrive at their house before the other one by 1 minute (7 - 8 = 1).
"Response: 
1. The total number of people who came to inflate tires that day was 5 + 3 = 8.
2. Each person who inflated a bike tire earned $25. So, the total amount earned by all 8 people that day is 8 x $25 = $200.
Therefore, the person who arrived on an exercise bike earned $200 that day."
"Response:  We know that Carl buys 10 cookies for $10. Since each cookie costs $0.10, we can calculate how many cookies Carl bought as follows:

$10 / $0.10 = 100 cookies

So, Carl bought 100 cookies."
"Response: 
Dave had bought a big bag of potatoes and had eaten 14 before the hungry squirrel stole it from his hands. The squirrel then ate half of the remaining potatoes that Dave had eaten. Then three birds flew away with their share of the potatoes (3 x 3 = 9). Later, a wasp stole two-thirds of the remaining potatoes (2/3 x 14 = 9). Finally, a mouse took one last potato (5 - 1 = 4). So, there were 4 patats left in the bag when Dave bought it."
Response:  We know that Kimo has three one-hour classes every day from Monday to Friday, which means he has 3 x 24 = 72 hours of class per week. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 72 hours/week x 16 weeks = 1152 hours in class per semester. Therefore, Kimo spends 1152 hours attending classes during a semester.
"Response: 
* Broodjies: 300 x 4 = 1200 mm (length)
* Sjokolade-croissants: 120 x 6 = 720 mm (length)
* Baguettes: 60 x 1 = 60 mm (length)
Total length of all baked goods: 1980 mm
Therefore, if Bill bakes all these bread products every day, their total length would be approximately 1980 mm."
Response:  The apes need 200 piesangs each month, so for two months they will need 400 piesangs (2 x 200). The gorillas need 400 piesangs each month, so for two months they will need 800 piesangs (2 x 400). And the baboons need 100 piesangs each month, so for two months they will need 200 piesangs (2 x 100). In total, he needs to buy 1600 piesangs (400 + 800 + 200) for the next two months.
"Response: 
Blake loops 15 times back and forth along the 100-meter distance = 30 laps (since each lap takes him 15 minutes).
Kelly runs once from one end of the field to the other (a distance of 40 yards or 36 meters) and then turns around and runs back = 1 lap.
Kelly repeats this process 34 times = total distance run by Kelly = 34 x 36 meters = 1264 meters."
Response:  Raphael bought 4 pencils for $6 (each $1.5). He also bought 2 notebooks for $8 (each $4). Finally, he spent $20 on a ring. So, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  We know that Finn saw 11 paddas in the dam from his hiding place under a lily pad. Then he sees two of them crawling under a rock. So, if we subtract the number of paddas he already saw (11) from the total number of paddas he can see now (2), we get the remaining number of paddas that Finn can still see in the dam = 9. Therefore, Finn can see 9 paddas in the dam.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), the depth of the water was 17 feet. On Tuesday (day 2), the temperature increased by 2 meters, so the new depth of the water was 19 feet (since 1 meter = 3.2808 feet). On Wednesday (day 3), the temperature decreased by two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the new depth of the water was 13.65 feet (since 2/3 \* 19 = 13.65). Therefore, the water depth on Wednesday was 13.65 feet.
"Response: 
Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea urchins, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught fewer of each than Anakin: 5 less starfish, 3 less sea urchins, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. In total, they caught:
Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish
Locsin: 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 fish"
Response:  The price of a bag of chips will increase by 20% every two months. So after one month, the new price will be 120% of the original price (i.e., $20 x 1.2 = $24). After two months, the new price will be 144% of the original price ($24 x 1.2 = $28.80), and so on. Therefore, after 36 months, the price of a bag of chips will have increased to $57.60 ($20 x 1.36 = $40.80 + $17.80).
Response:  We know that there are five red motors and three action figures in the room. The doll costs $3. So, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys like this: Total cost = Cost of red motors + Cost of action figures - Cost of doll Total cost = 5 x $4 = $20 + 3 x $5 = $15 - $3 = $12 Therefore, the total cost of all the toys is $12.
Response:  If she does her taxes herself and saves 3 hours of work time at $35 per hour, that means she will save $105 ($35 x 3 hours). On the other hand, if she hires a tax preparer for $90, she will lose $65 ($90 - $25). Therefore, if she chooses to hire a tax preparer, she will have more money left over, which is $40 ($105 - $65).
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira received a new calculator worth €1500 from her family as a gift. She also spent money on other items such as a printer (€102), a scanner (€74), and a CD burner (€74). Therefore, the total amount of money she spent comes to €628. Since she had €1500 initially, she will have €872 left after buying all these things. So, the amount of money she has for clothes is €872.
Response:  We know that to make one Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs. So, to make 15 Spanish flanks for her school fundraiser, she will need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs. Since each egg weighs approximately 50 grams, Sandra will need to buy or collect 45 x 50 = 2250 grams of eggs. Therefore, Sandra must sit on children 2250 / 50 = 45 times to gather enough eggs to make all the Spanish flanks needed for her school fundraiser.
Response:  According to the question, Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is 28 years old now, then Seth is 56 years old (2 x 28 = 56).
Response:  We know that Jimmy has more money than Ethel because he has two dollars more than her. So, if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy must have at least $10 (since he has two dollars more). Therefore, the amount of money Jimmy has is $10.
Response:  If Pancho loops 20 miles per day and stops after 10 miles, then he has covered a total distance of 20 + 10 = 30 miles. So, in one week, Pancho will have covered a total distance of 30 x 7 = 210 miles.
"Response:  The cost of each hat is $25, and there are three hats in total. So, the total cost of all hats is:

$25 x 3 = $75

Now, let's move to the jacket. There are three times more jackets than hats, so the cost of one jacket is three times the cost of one hat:

$75 x 3 = $225

Finally, we have the pants. Since there are three pairs of pants for every four items (hats and jackets), the cost of one pair of pants is:

$225 / 4 = $56

So, the total cost of all uniforms is:

$75 + $225 + $56 = $456

Therefore, the answer is $456."
"Response: 
Jake sees 80 spider legs with each having 8 benefits, so he has seen 8 x 8 = 64 benefits from spiders alone.
Then, he sees 90 insects with each having 6 benefits, so he has seen 90 x 6 = 540 benefits from insects.
Finally, he sees 3 strange mutant creatures with each having 10 benefits, so he has seen 3 x 10 = 30 benefits from these creatures.
Therefore, Jake has seen a total of 64 + 540 + 30 = 634 benefits."
"Response:  We know that there are four birds at the caboose and their ages can be represented by the letters S, T, R, and V. From the information given in the question we have:
Sally Twee (T) is three years older than Ouma Rooi (R). So, Ouma Rooi is two times younger than Sally Twee.
Ouma Rooi (R) is twice as old as Sally Dertig Twee (D). So, Sally Dertig Twee is half as old as Ouma Rooi.
Sally Vier (V) is the same age as Sally Dertig Twee (D).
From these statements, we can conclude that the total age of all four birds is:
S + T = 3 + 2(R) = 5 + 2R = 7 + R
And since R is equal to half of D, we can write:
S + T = 3 + 2(R) = 5 + 2R = 7 + R = 10 + D
So, the total age of all four birds is 10 + D, where D is the age of Sally Dertig Twee which is 8 years old. Therefore, the total age of all four birds is 10 + 8 = 18 years old."
Response:  The total amount of money that Jessica has to pay each month is equal to her study loan + credit card debt + bond repayment. So, if she wants to pay more than the minimum payment for each one of these amounts, we can calculate it like this: Study Loan = $300 x 12 = $3600 Bond Repayment = $500 x 12 = $6000 Credit Card Debt = $200 x 12 = $2400 Total Monthly Payments = $3600 + $6000 + $2400 = $11000 Now, let's say Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each one of these amounts. So, the new total monthly payments would be: Study Loan = $3600 x 1.5 = $5400 Bond Repayment = $6000 x 1.5 = $9000 Credit Card Debt = $2400 x 1.5 = $3600 Total Monthly Payments = $5400 + $9000 + $3600 = $18000 In a year, there are 12 months, so the total amount of money Jessica will have paid at the end of the year is: $18000 x 12 = $216000 Therefore, Jessica will have paid a total of $216000 in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum payment for each of her debts.
Response:  We know that Billy has to prepare 60 apples for his big family reunion barbecue. Each apple takes approximately half a minute (30 seconds) to chop and about 5 seconds to slice. So, if we calculate how long it will take Billy to chop and slice all 60 apples, he will need around 12 minutes (60 x 0.5 = 30 minutes + 60 x 0.05 = 3 minutes). Therefore, Billy will need approximately 12 minutes to prepare all 60 apples.
Response:  The total amount of lemonade sold is given as $25. Since each gallon contains 4 cups (since 1 cup = $0.50), the number of gallons sold can be calculated as follows: Number of gallons = Total amount / Price per gallon = $25 / $3 = 8.33 gallons (round up to 9 gallons). Therefore, they have sold 9 gallons of lemonade and made $7.50 ($3 x 9) from it.
Response:  We know that there are 240 Asians and 80 Japanese in total. The number of boys among the Chinese is 60. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total = Number of Asians + Number of Japanese - Number of Boys among Chinese. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: Total = 240 + 80 - 60 = 160. Therefore, there are 160 girls among the Chinese.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Zaid spends on rent, fuel for his car, and charitable donations. According to the question, he spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $1500 per month (since he earns $6000 per month). He also spends 1/3 of his salary on fuel, which is $2000 per month ($6000 x 1/3 = $2000). Finally, he gives $800 to his favorite charity (1/4 of his salary minus the amounts spent on rent and fuel). So, the total amount of money that Zaid has left after all these expenses is: $6000 - $1500 - $2000 + $800 = $4500 per month.
"Response: 
Rani has ten more than Monica, which means that Monica has four less than Rani. So, Monica has 10 - 4 = 6 fewer kicks than Rani.
Bo has 40 kicks, so together they have 6 + 40 = 46 kicks."
"Response: 
Lloyd verdient $10 per hour as a math tutor. He has 5 hours of tutoring for the first week and 8 hours for the second week. So, his total earnings for both weeks are:
$10/hour x 5 hours = $50 for the first week
$10/hour x 8 hours = $80 for the second week
Therefore, Lloyd has earned a total of $130 ($50 + $80) over the two weeks."
"Response:  The number of voters who supported candidate A (Twee) is given as 3/4 of the total number of students in class Sara's school, which is 80. So, we can write:

Number of votes for Candidate A = Total number of students x 3/4
= 80 x 3/4
= 56

Therefore, the number of votes that Candidate B received is equal to 80 - 56 = 24."
"Response:  We know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white ones and she also ordered 200 pink calla lilies which are five times more than the number of white anemones. So, we can calculate the total number of white anemones that Fred needs to deliver by multiplying the number of pink calla lilies by five:

Number of white anemones = Number of pink calla lilies x 5
= 200 x 5
= 1000

Now, we need to divide this number by four since Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white ones:

Number of red roses needed = Total number of white anemones / 4
= 1000 / 4
= 250

Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 250 red roses to Sandra by 17:00 to avoid losing her business."
Response:  We know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than Jan. So, if today is January 30th and Mark is two years younger than Jan, then we can say that...
Response:  The first runner from the less well-rounded team will run their 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means that each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Therefore, the time it takes for the last runner to complete their 400 meters can be calculated as follows: Time = (Number of runners) x (Time per runner) + (Total time saved) Where Number of runners = 4 (since there are four runners in total), Time per runner = 60 seconds (as given in the problem statement), and Total time saved = 3 seconds (as given in the problem statement). Substituting these values into the equation above, we get: Time = (4) x (60) + (3) = 240 + 3 = 243 seconds. So, the last runner from the less well-rounded team will take approximately 243 seconds to complete their 400 meters.
Response:  If Jerry throws two coins simultaneously and they land heads up, then the probability of him throwing a coin that lands tails up is 50%. Now, if he throws another coin after that, the probability of it landing heads up is also 50%, since we are assuming independence of the coin tosses. Therefore, the probability of Jerry throwing a coin that lands greater than 3 is 2 x 0.5 = 1. So the probability is 1% or 0.01.
Response:  According to the question, Jenna picked up half of her mom's apples from the apple farm. So, if her mom had 20 apples and Jenna picked up half of them, then Jenna picked up 10 apples (half of 20). Therefore, the total number of apples that both Jenna and her mom picked is 30 apples (20 + 10 = 30).
"Response:  We have to find out how many pieces of food are given to each group of mice, and then we can calculate how much food there is for each mouse.

Firstly, let's look at the first group of mice. There are 3 mice in this group, and they receive 6 pieces of food each. So, the total number of pieces of food for this group is 3 x 6 = 18.

Next, let's move on to the second group of mice. There are 4 mice in this group, and they receive 5 pieces of food each. So, the total number of pieces of food for this group is 4 x 5 = 20.

Now, let's look at the third group of mice. There are 5 mice in this group, and they receive 6 pieces of food each. So, the total number of pieces of food for this group is 5 x 6 = 30.

Finally, let's look at the fourth group of mice, which consists of 10 hamsters. Each hamster receives 5 pieces of food, so the total number of pieces of food for this group is 10 x 5 = 50.

As for the fifth group of mice, there are 20 mice in this group, and they receive 1 piece of food each. So, the total number of pieces of food for this group is 20 x 1 = 20.

In conclusion, the total number of pieces of food for all the groups of mice is:

18 + 20 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 178 pieces of food.

Therefore, there are 178 pieces of food for the 160 mice in the store."
Response:  The amount borrowed is $100 and the interest rate per month is 2%. So after 3 months, the total amount to be paid back will be: $100 + (2% of $100) x 3 = $100 + $6 = $106. Therefore, Mandy must pay $106 to Benedict.
Response:  The farmer sold each chicken for $2, so he made $2 x 10 = $20 from the first batch of 5 chickens. For the second batch of 5 chickens, he made $2 x 5 = $10. Therefore, in total, the farmer made $20 + $10 = $30 from both batches combined. So, he sold 6 chickens in total (5 + 1).
Response:  Firstly, they spent $20.25 on three carnival tickets after subtracting $4.50 for the cost of the tickets themselves. Then, they took two different rides that cost $33 each, resulting in an additional expense of $66. Therefore, the total amount each person paid is: $20.25 + $66 = $86.25 per person.
Response:  If John can collect 3 hours of persimmons in 1 hour, then he can collect 3 x 60 = 180 minutes of persimmons in an hour. Since he can collect 2 persimmons per minute, he can collect 180 / 60 = 3 persimmons per minute. Therefore, John can collect 3 x 3 = 9 persimmons in total.
"Response:  If there are ten ants and each ant needs to eat 2.5 grams of insects per day, then we need to calculate how much total weight of insects they will consume in one day. So, the daily consumption of insects by all ten ants would be:
10 ants x 2.5 grams/ant/day = 25 grams/day
Now, let's convert this amount from grams to kilograms. There are 1000 grams in one kilogram, so:
25 grams/day / 1000 grams/kilogram = 0.025 kilograms/day
So, the ten ants would need to consume approximately 0.025 kilograms of insects per day."
"Response: 
Tom plants 10 trees per year and takes away 2 trees every year. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees will be dead, which means that 30 trees will be gone. So, he has left with 20 trees (50 - 30 = 20)."
Response:  On Monday, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's lawn. Then, on Tuesday, half of them (i.e., 9) were taken back and repainted white. So, on Tuesday evening, there were 9 white plastic flamingos on Sue's lawn. Finally, on Sunday morning, another 18 pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection, bringing the total number of flamingos to 27 (18 pink + 9 white). Therefore, on Sunday afternoon, there were 27 flamingos on Sue's lawn - 9 more than the number of white flamingos.
Response:  If she buys 5 different colored pencils and needs them for $20, then each pencil costs $4 (20 / 5). Since each pencil costs $4, if she buys 1 pencil, she will pay $4. Therefore, she will get $8 back from selling one pencil ($4 profit). So, to find out how many pencils she can buy with the money she has, we divide the amount of money she has by the cost of one pencil: $20 / $4 = 5 pencils. Thus, she can buy 5 pencils with the $20 she has.
Response:  We know that one pen costs $1,20 and one utensil costs $0,30. To find out how much 8 pens cost, we can multiply their individual cost by 8: $1,20 x 8 = $9,60. So, 8 pennies cost $9,60.
"Response:  We have to divide 200 pounds of wortels among 40 restaurants. Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of wortels. To find out how many kilograms of wortels this is, we can multiply the number of pounds by 0.453592 (since there are approximately 1 kilogram in 1 pound). So, the total amount of wortels that will not be used is:

200 pounds x 0.453592 = 90.7 kg
Therefore, approximately 90.7 kilograms of wortels will not be used."
Response:  According to the information provided, there are 23 786 people living in Sodatown. Of these, 8417 are males and 9092 are females. This means that the remaining part of the population consists of children. To find out how many children there are in Sodatown, we need to subtract the number of adults (males + females) from the total population. Therefore, the number of children in Sodatown is: 23 786 - (8417 + 9092) = 15 477.
"Response: 
Elaine had initially 20 Pokémon cards. Then she collected three times more in the second month, which means she collected 60 cards (3 x 20 = 60). However, in the third month, she collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined, which is 40 cards (2 x 80 = 160 - 60 = 40). Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 40 + 60 = 100 Pokémon cards."
Response:  We know that Mark edits 2 different versions for 2 separate publishers, and each version has a different number of pages. Publisher A pays him twice as much as Publisher B does. So, if Publisher A pays $5 per page, Publisher B pays $2.5 per page. Since Mark edits a total of 1000 pages per week, he earns $5,000 from Publisher A and $2,500 from Publisher B. Therefore, his total weekly income is $7,500.
"Response: 
1. In the morning, he takes out 5 emmers of water, which means he takes out 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water.
2. In the afternoon, he takes out 6 emmers of water, which means he takes out 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water.
So in total, he takes out 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water per day."
"Response:  If John earns $2000 per week and gets a one-time bonus of $5000 and a 5% salary increase, we can calculate his total income for the year as follows:

Total income = Weekly income x Number of weeks worked in the year
= $2000 x 52 weeks (assuming a standard workweek)
= $104,000

Now, let's find out how much money John made during the year based on the bonus he received:

Money made from bonus = Bonus amount / Number of weeks since receiving the bonus
= $5000 / 1 week (since he got the bonus on the first day of the year)
= $5000 / 52 weeks (to account for the entire year)
= $96,308

So, John made a total of $104,000 + $96,308 = $200,316 in the year."
"Response:  We know that Josie has 10 hectares of land and each hectare produces 5 tons of druiws per year. Therefore, the total amount of druiws produced by Josie's land is:

10 ha x 5 t/ha = 50 tons druiws per year
Now we need to calculate how many vats of wine are produced from these druiws. Since every ton of druiws produces 2 vats of wine, we can calculate the number of vats of wine produced as follows:

50 tons druiws / 2 vats/ton = 25 vats of wine per year
Therefore, Josie's land produces 25 vats of wine per year."
"Response: 
Carl has been making an omelette for lunch every day this week and has used 2 slices of cheese on each omelette. He has also made three omelettes per week using more than one slice of cheese per omelette. Therefore, he has used a total of 3 x 7 = 21 slices of cheese for omelettes this week.
Additionally, he has made a large macaroni and cheese dish that will last him a few days, which means he will use 8 slices of cheese in that dish. So, his total usage of cheese this week is 21 + 8 = 29 slices of cheese."
"Response: 
Janet had initially 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so together she had 32 pens (22 + 10 = 32).
Then, she bought 6 bags of blue pens and 2 bags of red pens. Each bag contains 9 pens, so altogether she bought 54 pens (6 x 9 = 54).
Now, let's calculate how many pens Janet has in total:
Total number of green pens = Initial amount of green pens + Number of green pens in new purchases = 32 + 54 = 86
Total number of yellow pens = Initial amount of yellow pens + Number of yellow pens in new purchases = 10 + 0 = 10
So, Janet now has 86 green pens and 10 yellow pens in total."
Response:  The first five test scores are as follows: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To calculate the average of these scores, we need to add them up and divide by 5. So, the total score = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 459. Now, to find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to have an average of 93, we can subtract the current average from 93 and then divide that result by 5. Therefore, the required score = (93 - 459) / 5 = 27.
"Response: 
Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks, which means he covered a total distance of:
5 x 5 = 25 km/week x 4 weeks = 100 km
Then, he reduced his rides to twice a week and increased the distance to 60 km each ride for another 3 weeks:
2 x 60 = 120 km
So, in total, Michael covered a distance of:
100 + 120 = 220 km"
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate sticks and 80 confected apples. Each chocolate stick weighs twice as much as each confected apple, so...
Response:  On Monday, she bought 4 cookies at one store. Then on Tuesday, she went to another store and bought three times as many cookies as she bought on Monday. So, she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cookies on Tuesday. And then on Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought 5 times as many cookies as she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, she bought 5 x 12 = 60 cookies in total after three days.
Response:  The total cost of buying one-half of a tankard is $6000 divided by two = $3000 per sale. Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $3000 / 20 cups = $150 per cup.
"Response: 
Sara will buy a new dress and two pairs of shoes that cost $30 and $20 respectively. She will also babysit four times for her neighbor's children and earn $5 each time she does so. Her parents will pay her $4 each time she takes care of the children. Since Sara has already saved $10 before starting to babysit, how many times must she take care of the children before she can afford the dress and shoes?
Let X be the number of times Sara takes care of the children.
We know that Sara earned $5 x times and spent $30 + $20 = $50 on the dress and shoes. So we have the equation:
$5x - $4x = $50
Simplifying the equation:
$x = 10
Therefore, Sara needs to take care of the children ten times to afford the dress and shoes."
"Response:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day and he has more white hens than red ones. So, if he has x red hens, he has 42 - x white hens. Since each white hen lays 5 eggs per day, Jerry gets 5x eggs from his white hens every day. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:

Number of red hens = x
Number of white hens = 42 - x
Total number of eggs collected = 5x + x (since there are x red hens)
Now we need to solve for x, which is the number of red hens Jerry has. To do this, we can subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:

42 - x = 5x + x
Subtracting 5x from both sides gives us:

-x = 9
Since x cannot be negative, we have:

x = 10
So Jerry has 10 red hens."
Response:  We know that Gary walks around the local park at a rate of 5 kilometers per hour. To calculate how many hours he spent walking, we need to divide the distance he walked (in meters) by his speed (in meters per hour). The distance he walked is given as 1,5 x 6 = 9 meters. So, if he walks for 5 hours, he will have covered a distance of 9 meters x 5 hours = 45 meters. Therefore, Gary spent 45 minutes walking around the local park.
Response:  On day one, Sloan had 100 customers come in and count them. The next day he had 50 more customers than the first day, so he counted 150 customers that day. And on the third day, if he had 500 customers total, then he must have counted 350 customers that day (since 500 - 100 = 400). Therefore, Sloan counted 350 customers on the third day.
Response:  The small pool had twice as much water as the large pool at first (2 x 4 = 8 liters/minute). Then, after four minutes, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool again (2 x 4 = 8 liters/minute), making it have 16 liters of water now. So, the small pool has 4 liters of water left.
"Response:  We know that Lori has to work for x hours before she can afford her shoes and belt. The cost of the shoes is $320, and the cost of the belt is $32. So, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to save enough money to buy these items.
We can start by calculating the total amount of money Lori needs to save: Total Cost = Shoes + Belt = $320 + $32 = $352
Now, let's divide the total cost by her hourly wage: Number of Hours = Total Cost / Hourly Wage = $352 / $8 = 44 hours
So, Lori needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford her shoes and belt."
Response:  We know that Janet received $2000 as a loan and she agreed to pay it back with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed. So, her total payment will be $2200 (10% of $2000 + $2000). Since she is going to pay $165 per month for 12 months, her outstanding balance at the end of those 12 months will be: Outstanding Balance = Total Payment / Number of Monthly Payments = $2200 / 12 = $183.33. Therefore, Janet's outstanding balance after making 12 monthly payments of $165 each will be $183.33.
Response:  We know that there are four roses and seven daisies in the vase. So, altogether we have 4 + 7 = 11 flowers in the vase. Therefore, the answer to the question is 11.
"Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet and Harriet is half as old as Zack. So we can write this information in an equation:
Adrian = 3 x Harriet
Harriet = Zack / 2
Now we want to find the average age of these three people over a period of three years. To do this, we need to multiply each person's age at the beginning of the period by a factor of 3 (since there are three years) and then add up all those products:
Average Age = (Adrian x 3) + (Harriet x 3) + (Zack x 3)
= (3 x 21) + (15 x 3) + (18 x 3)
= 63 + 45 + 54
= 162
So the average age of these three people over a period of three years is 162."
"Response:  
Vier students have scored 251 points in a board game together. Naomi has scored 68 points. Yuri has scored more than half of Naomi's score and Brianna has scored more than Naomi's score. So, Jojo must have scored at least 139 points (half of 251)."
"Response: 
Carmen took 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve another. Therefore, she spent a total of 15 minutes solving crossword puzzles.
During the next week, she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles. Each Sudoku puzzle takes her approximately 5 minutes to solve, so she spent a total of 40 minutes solving Sudoku puzzles.
Therefore, in total, Carmen spent 55 minutes (15 + 40) playing these two types of puzzles."
"Response: 
Celine took 90 liters of water from the tank to make her small garden wet. She could then collect rainwater twice as much as what she used. So how many liters are now in the tank?
Let X be the initial amount of water in the tank (X = 120 liters). Since Celine took 90 liters out, we have:
X - 90 = 30 (liters)
Now, since Celine collected rainwater that was twice as much as what she used, we can say that she collected:
2(30) = 60 liters (of rainwater)
So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
X + 60 = 180 liters (of water)
Therefore, there are 180 liters of water left in the tank."
Response:  If Andy plants 90 geraniums and he has 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, then the number of petunias is 90 - 40 = 50. So, Andy has 50 petunias.
Response:  The company spends $15,000 on advertising for one year, which means it spends $5,000 (one-third) of that amount on advertising for the second year. So, the total amount that the company spent on advertising over two years is $15,000 + ($5,000 x 2) = $15,000 + $10,000 = $25,000. Therefore, the total amount that the company spent on advertising over two years is $25,000.
"Response: 
Carlos pays $30 for each hour of use, and Benji pays $18 for each hour of use. So if they both rent their respective vessels for 3 hours (Carlos) or 5 hours (Benji), how much will they pay in total?
Total cost = Number of hours x Rental price
For Carlos: Total cost = 3 hours x $30/hour = $90
For Benji: Total cost = 5 hours x $18/hour = $90
So, together they will pay $180 ($90 + $90)."
"Response: 
Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, which takes 6 days. If he then returns to New Jersey by car from Rochester, it will take him half of that time, or 3 days. Therefore, if Andrew plans to go from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and return by car, he will spend a total of 9 days (6 + 3) traveling."
Response:  We know that James has 30 Fire-type cards, 20 Grass-type cards, and 40 Water-type cards in his deck. He lost 8 Water-type cards and bought 14 Grass-type cards. To find out the probability of drawing a random card being a Water-type card, we can use the following formula: Probability = Number of Water-type cards / Total number of cards in the deck. In this case, the total number of cards in the deck is 30 + 20 + 40 = 90. So, the probability of drawing a Water-type card is: Probability = 40/90 = 0.44 or approximately 44%.
"Response:  The total cost of the basic burrito is $6.50. If he adds extra meat for $1000, cheese for $1000, avocado for $1000, and sour cream for $1000 each, then the total cost would be:
$6.50 + $1000 + $1000 + $1000 + $1000 = $4150
If he decides to upgrade his meal with additional $3 for chips and drink, then the new total cost would be:
$4150 + $3 = $4153
So, the person should pay $4153."
Response:  If Kalinda can do 4 pieces per minute and her mother can help her half of what she does in one minute, then her mother can also do 2 pieces per minute (half of 4). So they will take 18 minutes to complete the puzzle together (Kalinda alone would need 360/4 = 90 minutes).
"Response: 
Ashlyn visited the watermelon farm after two months and found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvesting. She took some home and when she returned two weeks later, 75% of the remaining watermelons had been harvested. So, how many watermelons were not yet ready to be harvested after two weeks?
Let X be the number of watermelons that were not yet ready to be harvested after two weeks.
From the given information, we know that 30% of the total watermelons were ready for harvesting, which means that 30% of X = 30% of 120 = 36 watermelons were already harvested.
So, the number of watermelons that were not yet ready to be harvested after two weeks is:
X = 120 - 36 = 84
Therefore, 84 watermelons were not yet ready to be harvested after two weeks."
"Response:  The total number of motors is 12 and each motor costs $20,000, so the total cost of all the motors is:

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

Mark pays 10% tax on the motors, which means he has to pay $24,000 in taxes (10% of $240,000).

Additionally, there is a registration fee of $1000 for each motor, so the total amount Mark has to pay is:

$240,000 + $24,000 + ($1000 x 12) = $278,000

Therefore, Mark has to pay $278,000 for all the motors."
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, which means she collected 20 shells in total. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she collected on Monday, which is 40 shells (2 x 20 = 40). So, Kylie collected 40 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 mice in the garden and each mouse eats 3 apples per day, then the total number of apples eaten by all the mice would be: 50 x 3 = 150 apples per day. Now, let's assume that there are twice as many insects as mice in the garden (i.e., 2 x 50 = 100 insects). Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is also 150 per day (since there are twice as many insects as mice). So, the total number of insects in the garden is 150 + 100 = 250 insects per day.
"Response:  There are 36 penguins that go to the snowy beach. A third of them jump into the sea and swim. Another third go into the cave to eat their food. So, how many penguins are left outside? We can calculate this as follows:

Number of penguins that went into the sea = Number of penguins x Third that went into the sea / Total number of penguins
= 36 x (1/3) / 36
= 24

Therefore, there are 24 penguins left outside the cave."
Response:  We know that Steve wants to start growing more tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his friend. So he eats 6 tomatoes per day. Now we need to find out how many tomato plants Steve needs to produce enough tomatoes for himself. According to the problem statement, one tomato plant can produce 3 cherry tomatoes per week. Therefore, Steve needs 6/3 = 2 tomato plants to produce enough tomatoes for himself.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and John wants to make sure each one can have 4 slices of pizza. Since pizzas come in 8-slice portions, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many pizzas John needs to buy:

20 / 8 = 5

So, John needs to buy 5 pizzas."
Response:  If he uses 5 pens per liter of ink and buys 25 pens, then he will have 25 / 5 = 5 liters of ink. Since each liter of ink makes 10 pens (as stated in the problem), he will have 5 x 10 = 50 pens in total.
Response:  If John received his pension of $20 and then got an additional $10, he would have a total amount of money of $30 after one year. So, if the interest is tripled over three years, John will have $90 after three years ($30 x 3 = $90). Therefore, John had $90 after three years.
"Response:  We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan and five years older than Jessa. So we can write this down like this:
Mary = Joan - 2
Jessa = Joan + 5
Now we want to find out what the sum of their ages is. Using the first equation, we get:
Mary = 30 (Joan's age) - 2 = 28
And using the second equation, we get:
Jessa = 30 + 5 = 35
So the sum of their ages is:
28 + 35 = 63"
Response:  The number of students who left through exit A is 30%, which means that 300 students (out of 1000) left through exit A. Since there are three exits, each with a probability of leaving equal to 1/3, we can calculate the total number of students who left through any of the three exits as follows: Total = 300 + (3/3) x 297 = 300 + 108 = 408. Therefore, 408 students left through exit C.
Response:  We know that James has more delicious food than Robert because he has 6 more delicious things than Robert. So, if James has x delicious things, then Robert has x - 6 delicious things. Now we are told that John has twice as many delicious things as Robert, which means that John has 2(x-6) = 2x - 12 delicious things. Finally, we are given that Jacobus has 54 delicious things, and since there are three people in total (James, Robert, and Jacobus), we can say that Jacobus has 3 times as many delicious things as Robert, or 3(2x - 12) = 6x - 36 delicious things. Therefore, Jacobus has 6x - 36 delicious things more than James.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they have three books to read at the end. So, the answer is 3.
Response:  We know that Mike has five friends and he exchanges letters with two of them. Each letter takes up two pages, so in total, Mike receives ten letters from his five friends (2 x 5 = 10). Since he answers each letter twice, he spends six minutes writing each reply (since he can write one page in six minutes), which means he spends a total of sixty minutes per week writing replies to his friends (60 min/week). Therefore, Mike writes for approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes per week (60 min/week).
"Response: 
Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. He makes an average of 15 minutes per call with his boss every day, which is 105 minutes (15 x 7) for the entire month. Additionally, he had 300 extra minutes per call with other people this month, which means he made a total of 405 minutes (300 + 105) in calls to others during the month. Therefore, Jason used a total of 1405 minutes (1000 + 405) over the course of the month."
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 potatoes initially and gave some to Ginger. Then, Kyle took 5 of those potatoes from Griffin. So, Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 potatoes. Next, Billy took twice as many potatoes from Kyle as Kyle took from Griffin, which means Billy took 3 × 2 = 6 potatoes from Kyle. Therefore, Kyle was left with 19 - 6 = 13 potatoes. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer potatoes than what Griffin had at first, which means Colby took 27 - 3 = 24 potatoes. Now we can see how much Ginger gave to Griffin: since Ginger gave half of her potatoes to Griffin, she gave 24 / 2 = 12 potatoes to him.
Response:  In the first aquarium, there are 4 slugs, and in the second aquarium, there are 32 slugs. If we divide the number of slugs in the second aquarium by twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we get 16 fish per aquarium. Therefore, there are 16 fish in each aquarium.
"Response: 
Jeans spends $250 per hour for her grime work. She needs to spend 6 hours every day doing this work and has to repeat it 4 times a week for 5 weeks. Therefore, she spends a total of:

6 hours/day x 7 days/week = 42 hours/week
x 5 weeks = 210 hours

So, Jeans spends a total of $5,250 ($250/hour x 210 hours) on grime work.
Now, let's calculate how much the grime renderer gives back to Jeans as a discount:

The grime renderer gives Jeans a 10% discount after the roll of film is completed. So, if the roll of film takes 5 weeks to complete, the grime renderer will give Jeans a discount of:

10% of $5,250 = $525

Therefore, Jeans pays a total of $4,725 ($5,250 - $525) for the grime work."
"Response:  We know that Isabelle bought $12 worth of cake for her sister's birthday party and divided it equally among three people (her two parents). So each person paid $4 for the cake. Now let's calculate how much each person paid for other expenses: For gift, we have $43 / 3 = $14 per person; for decorations, we have $15 / 3 = $5 per person; for invitations, we have $4 / 3 = $1 per person; and for food, we have $22 / 3 = $7 per person. Therefore, each person paid a total of $4 + $5 + $1 + $7 = $17."
Response:  The boss bought 4 boxes of apples. Each box weighs 50 pounds. One pound costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of all 4 boxes is: 4 x 50 = 200 pounds x $1.50/pound = $300. So, the boss spent $300 on the apples.
Response:  On Monday, Sue had four times more cookies than her sister and ate two times more cookies than her sister on Tuesday. Her sister had five cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on the next day. If one cookie contains 200 calories, then Sue consumed more calories than her sister. We can calculate this using the following formula: Total number of calories = Number of cookies x Calories per cookie So, for Monday: Sue - 4 x 200 = 800 calories (since she ate 4 times more) Her sister - 5 x 200 = 1000 calories (since she ate only 5 cookies) For Tuesday: Sue - 2 x 200 = 400 calories (since she ate twice as much as her sister) Her sister - 13 x 200 = 2600 calories (since she ate 13 cookies) Therefore, Sue consumed more calories than her sister. The difference in calories between them is: 400 - 2600 = -2200 calories.
