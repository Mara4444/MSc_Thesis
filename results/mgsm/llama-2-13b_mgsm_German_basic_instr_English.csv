To calculate the profit, we need to know the original price of the house and the amount spent on repairs. Let's use the information given in the problem:

Original price of the house = $80,000
Amount spent on repairs = $50,000

After repairing the house, its value increases by 150%. This means that the new value of the house is:

New value = Original value x 1.5
= $80,000 x 1.5
= $120,000

So, the profit made by Josh is:

Profit = New value - Original value
= $120,000 - $80,000
= $40,000

Therefore, Josh makes a profit of $40,000 from selling the house after repairing it."

"Response: 

Solution: Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Distance traveled during first 2 hours at 60 mph = 2 x 60 = 120 miles
2. Time spent stuck in traffic (halved) = 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour
3. Distance traveled during last 2 hours at 80 mph = 2 x 80 = 160 miles

Total distance traveled = 120 + 160 = 280 miles

Since he started from home and drove for 4 hours, his total distance from home is:

Total distance = 280 + 0 = 280 miles

Therefore, he is 280 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."

"Response: 6 years.
Explanation: The cost of planting the tree is $90, and each year he sells 7 lemons for $1.50 per piece, so his annual income is $10.50 ($1.50 x 7). However, he also spends $3 per year to water and fertilize the tree, so his net income is $7.50 per year ($10.50 - $3). To break even, he needs to earn enough money to cover the initial investment of $90. Therefore, it will take him 6 years to earn back his investment and start making a profit ($90 / $7.50 = 6)."

To determine the maximum gain for the merchant, we need to calculate the expected return for each option and compare them. Let's assume that the probability of the schmuck market increasing by 2.5% is p = 0.4 (i.e., there is a 40% chance of this happening) and the probability of the electronics market increasing by 1.2% is q = 0.6 (i.e., there is a 60% chance of this happening).

For the schmuck option:
Expected return = 5000 x (1 + 0.025) = 5000 x 1.025 = 5125

For the electronics option:
Expected return = 8000 x (1 + 0.012) = 8000 x 1.012 = 8096

Since the expected return for the electronics option is higher than the expected return for the schmuck option, it would be optimal for the merchant to choose the electronics option in order to maximize their potential gain."

"Response: 4 Lego sets remain for John after he sells all of his Legos and buys video games with the proceeds. To calculate this, we need to first determine how much money John has from selling his Legos. If he sells each set for $15, then he will have:

13 x $15 = $195

After buying video games, John has $5 left over. So, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

$195 - ($20 x 8) = $5

Solving for the number of Lego sets remaining, we get:

$195 - ($20 x 8) = $5

$195 - $160 = $5

$35 = $5

Therefore, John has 4 Lego sets remaining (since $35 / $15 per set = 4)."
"Response: 5 miles per hour (mph).
Explanation: To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total weekly running distance and then divide it by the number of hours he spends running each week. We know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day and half as much (1.5 hours) on the other two days, so his total weekly running distance is:

3 hours/day x 3 days/week = 9 hours/week
+ 1.5 hours/day x 2 days/week = 3 hours/week
Total weekly distance = 9 + 3 = 12 hours

Since John runs for 12 hours per week, his speed can be calculated as follows:

12 hours/week / 7 days/week = 1.714 miles/hour (approximately 5 miles/hour)"

To calculate how many grams of chips you can eat if your daily calorie goal is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to use the information provided in the problem. Let's start by converting the number of portions from 5 to grams:

5 portions x 250 calories/portion = 1250 calories

Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, you have 1800 - 1250 = 550 calories left to reach your daily goal of 2000 calories. To find out how many grams of chips this represents, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving (250 calories/serving):

550 calories / 250 calories/serving = 2.2 servings

Therefore, you can eat approximately 2.2 servings of chips, which is equivalent to about 220 grams based on the serving size of 300g."

To find out how much Lloyd earns per week from his eggs, we need to calculate how many dozen eggs he sells in a day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

Let's start with the information given in the problem:

* Number of eggs laid per day = 252
* Price per dozen = $2

Now, let's convert the number of eggs into dozens:

252 / 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen) = 20.67 dozens per day

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of dozens sold per day by 7 to get the total number of dozens sold per week:

20.67 x 7 = 144.93 dozens per week

Finally, we can multiply the total number of dozens sold per week by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd earns per week:

144.93 x $2 = $289.86 per week

Therefore, Lloyd earns $289.86 per week from his eggs."

To find out how many toys Uriah must remove, we need to calculate the total weight of his books and compare it to the weight he needs to remove (15 pounds). Let's start by calculating the weight of each type of item:

Comic books: 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds
Spielzeuge: 30 x 1/2 = 15 pounds

Total weight: 7.5 + 15 = 22.5 pounds

Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds, he will have to take out all of his comic books and some of his toys. To determine how many toys he needs to remove, we can subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds

Therefore, Uriah must remove 7.5 pounds of toys. Since each toy weighs half a pound, he will need to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys."

To calculate Marcy's annual retirement benefit after 30 years of service, we need to consider two factors: her annual pension amount and the lump sum payment she will receive for her 20 years of service.

1. Annual Pension Amount:
Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000 per year for 40 years, starting from her retirement age (let's assume it's 65). Therefore, her total pension payments over 40 years would be:

$50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000

2. Lump Sum Payment for 20 Years of Service:
As per the agreement, Marcy will receive 5% of the value of her annual pension each year for 20 years. Since she has served for 40 years, we need to calculate the lump sum payment for only 20 years.

Let's assume the present value of Marcy's annual pension is $50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000. Then, the lump sum payment for 20 years would be:

$1,000,000 x 5% = $50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000

Now, let's calculate Marcy's annual retirement benefit after 30 years of service:

Annual Retirement Benefit = Annual Pension Amount + Lump Sum Payment
= $50,000 + $1,000,000
= $1,050,000

Therefore, Marcy's annual retirement benefit after 30 years of service would be $1,050,000."

To calculate the total amount that Aleena will pay for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to first find out how much she paid in the first half of the year and then add the reduced amount she will pay in the second half of the year.

Let's assume that the original price per month is $140.

For the first six months (January to June), Aleena paid the full price of $140 x 6 = $840.

For the remaining six months (July to December), since the price was reduced by 10%, the new price would be $140 x 0.9 = $126.

Therefore, the total amount that Aleena will pay for the entire year is:

$840 + $126 = $966"

Sophia can drive approximately miles with one tank of gas if she drives at the same rate as her previous 100 miles. To calculate this, we need to divide the amount of gas left in the tank (gallons) by the number of gallons the car holds and then multiply that result by the distance driven so far (miles). So, we have:

(4 gallons / 12 gallons) x 100 miles =

To calculate the total number of hours spent watching TV and reading over 4 weeks, we need to first determine how many hours Jim spends on each activity per week.

1 hour = 60 minutes

Jim watches TV for 2 hours per day = 2 x 60 = 120 minutes per day

He reads for half an hour after watching TV = 30 minutes per day

Therefore, Jim spends:

* 120 + 30 = 150 minutes per day on TV and reading (150/60 = 2.5 hours)

Since there are 7 days in a week, Jim spends:

* 2.5 hours x 7 days = 17.5 hours per week on TV and reading

Over 4 weeks, Jim spends:

* 17.5 hours/week x 4 weeks = 70 hours

So, Jim spends 70 hours over 4 weeks watching TV and reading."

Subtracting 40 from both sides gives us:

$$ x = 60 $$

Therefore, Bailey had $60 at the beginning."

"Response: 
To calculate how much Sheila will pay each month for three months, we need to first find out the total amount she owes for all five phones. Since each phone costs $150 and there are five phones, the total amount is:

Total = 5 x $150 = $750

Next, we can calculate the interest rate as a decimal by dividing the annual percentage rate (APR) of 2% by 12:

Interest rate (decimal) = 2% / 12 = 0.02

Now, we can use the formula for calculating the monthly payment on a loan with an interest rate and a fixed term (in this case, three months):

Monthly payment = Total x (1 + Interest rate)^Number of periods

In this case, the number of periods is three months, so we can substitute that value in along with the other values we've found:

Monthly payment = $750 x (1 + 0.02)^3

Using a calculator or doing the calculation by hand, we get:

Monthly payment = $750 x (1 + 0.02)^3 = $750 x 1.0468 = $779.20

So, Sheila will pay $779.20 per month for three months to cover the cost of the five phones plus interest."

Begonien: 17 x $2.50 = $42.50

Total amount: $36 + $18 + $42.50 = $96.50

Since Artie has no change, he will round up the prices to the next dollar, so the total amount he will receive is:

$96.50 rounded to the nearest dollar = $100

Therefore, Artie will earn $100 from selling all three types of flowers."

Question: If Lee can run the 400 meters hurdles in 38 seconds and Gerald has improved his speed by 10% through dietary changes, how fast can Gerald run the 400 meters hurdles?

To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much faster Gerald is than Lee. We know that Gerald has improved his speed by 10%, so he is now 10% faster than Lee. To calculate this, we can use the following formula:

Gerald's time = Lee's time x (1 + 0.10)

where 0.10 represents the 10% increase in speed due to dietary changes.

Substituting Lee's time with 38 seconds, we get:

Gerald's time = 38 seconds x (1 + 0.10)
= 38 seconds x 1.10
= 41.8 seconds

So, Gerald can run the 400 meters hurdles in approximately 41.8 seconds."

"Response: 75 times. Here's how we can calculate it:

* First friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door.
* Second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more often than the first friend, so they pressed it 20 x 4 = 80 times.
* Third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more often than the fourth friend, so they pressed it 60 - 40 = 20 times.
* Fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times in total.

Adding up all these numbers gives us a total of 20 + 80 + 20 + 60 = 75 times."

Let x be the number of keks that Henry baked last year. Then we know that he wanted to bake twice as many this year, so he baked 2x keks this year. Additionally, we know that he has 110 keks in total after baking and dropping 5 of them. So we can set up the equation:

2x + 110 = 3x + 5

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 95

So Henry baked 95 keks last year."

The total amount of money that both Adrian and Lylah earned four years later can be calculated as follows:

Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000.
His salary increased by 40% of his previous salary, so:

Rory orders two jumbo sandwiches for $7.50 each, two bags of chips for $1.50, and two cookies for $1.00, all to be delivered. A 20% delivery fee is added at checkout, and she wants to add a $5 tip. How much will her delivery order cost?

Numeric Answer:
The total cost of Rory's delivery order can be calculated as follows:

2 x Jumbo Sandwiches = $7.50 x 2 = $15.00
2 x Bags of Chips = $1.50 x 2 = $3.00
2 x Cookies = $1.00 x 2 = $2.00
Total Cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00

Adding the 20% delivery fee (based on the total cost):
$20.00 x 20% = $4.00
Total Cost with Delivery Fee = $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00

Adding the $5 tip:
$24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, Rory's delivery order will cost $29.00."
"Response: 
To find out how many questions Mark left unanswered, we need to calculate the total time he spent on both tests and compare it with the total number of questions. Let's start by calculating the time spent on each test:

Test 1 (75 questions):
Time = Number of questions x Time per question / Speed
Time = 75 x 2 / 5
Time = 30 minutes

Test 2 (100 questions):
Time = Number of questions x Time per question / Speed
Time = 100 x 2 / 5
Time = 40 minutes

Now, let's add the times for both tests:
Total Time = Time for Test 1 + Time for Test 2
Total Time = 30 + 40
Total Time = 70 minutes

Since Mark had 8 hours for the first test and 6 hours for the second test, we can calculate the total number of questions he could have answered as follows:

For Test 1:
Number of questions = Total Time x Speed
Number of questions = 8 x 5
Number of questions = 40

For Test 2:
Number of questions = Total Time x Speed
Number of questions = 6 x 5
Number of questions = 30

Now, let's subtract the number of questions Mark could have answered from the total number of questions in each test to find out how many questions he left unanswered:

For Test 1:
Unanswered questions = Total number of questions - Number of questions answered
Unanswered questions = 75 - 40
Unanswered questions = 35

For Test 2:
Unanswered questions = Total number of questions - Number of questions answered
Unanswered questions = 100 - 30
Unanswered questions = 70

Therefore, Mark left 35 questions unanswered in Test 1 and 70 questions unanswered in Test 2."

To calculate the weekly profit of Lucas's household cleaning business, we need to subtract his total expenses from his total income. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Total Income:

* 3 existing customers x 2 products each (Bleichmittel and Lappen) = 6 x 2 = 12 $
* 5 potential customers x 2 products each = 10 x 2 = 20 $

Total Income per Week = 12 + 20 = 32 $

Total Expenses:

* 2 Bleichmittel flaschen x 3 existing customers = 6 x 2 = 12 $
* 2 Bleichmittel flaschen x 5 potential customers = 10 x 2 = 20 $
* 1 pack of Lappen x 3 existing customers = 3 x 5 = 15 $
* 1 pack of Lappen x 5 potential customers = 5 x 5 = 25 $

Total Expenses per Week = 12 + 20 + 15 + 25 = 42 $

Now, let's calculate the weekly profit:

Weekly Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
= 32 - 42
= -10 $

So, Lucas will make a weekly loss of 10 dollars."

To calculate how many Ananas John can harvest within one year, we need to consider the number of months in a year and the frequency of harvesting. Since there are 12 months in a year, and John can harvest his Ananas every 3 months, he will be able to harvest his Ananas 4 times within one year (12 / 3 = 4).

Now, let's calculate the total number of Ananas that John can harvest within one year:

Number of Ananas per harvest = 100 Ananas/hectare x 4 harvests/year = 400 Ananas/year

Therefore, John can harvest 400 Ananas within one year."

The water depth in the tank on Monday is given as 17 feet. On Tuesday, there is an increase of 7 feet, so the water depth on Tuesday is:

17 + 7 = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so we can set up a proportion to find the new depth:

Wednesday depth : Tuesday depth = 2/3 : 24

Simplifying this ratio, we get:

Wednesday depth = 24 x (2/3) = 16 feet

Therefore, the water depth in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet."

To calculate how much Jessica will pay in one year if she pays 50% more than the minimum, we need to first calculate her monthly payments for each debt. Then, we can multiply these amounts by 12 to find the annual total.

For the student loan:
Minimum payment = 300 $/month x 12 = 3600 $/year
If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum, she will pay:
3600 $ + (50% of 3600) = 3600 $ + 1800 $ = 5400 $/year

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = 200 $/month x 12 = 2400 $/year
If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum, she will pay:
2400 $ + (50% of 2400) = 2400 $ + 1200 $ = 3600 $/year

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = 500 $/month x 12 = 6000 $/year
If Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum, she will pay:
6000 $ + (50% of 6000) = 6000 $ + 3000 $ = 9000 $/year

Therefore, if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum on all three debts, she will pay a total of 5400 $ + 3600 $ + 9000 $ = 18000 $ in one year."

To calculate how much Mandy must pay to Benedict after 3 months, we need to use the formula for compound interest:

A = P x (1 + r/n)^(n\*t)

where:
A = amount owed at the end of the period (in this case, the amount Mandy must pay to Benedict)
P = principal amount borrowed (in this case, $100)
r = annual interest rate (in this case, 2% per month, or 24% per year)
n = number of times interest is compounded per year (in this case, 12 times per year, since interest is compounded monthly)
t = time elapsed (in this case, 3 months)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = $100 x (1 + 2/12)^(12\*3)
= $100 x (1 + 0.02)^36
= $100 x 1.0798
= $107.98

Therefore, Mandy must pay Benedict $107.98 after 3 months, assuming an annual interest rate of 24%."

The h√§ndler sold x sacks of wheat to the farmer at a price of $20 per sack, so he paid $20x for all the sacks. The cost of transporting each sack from the farm to the warehouse was $2, so the total cost of transportation was $2x. To make a profit of $400, the h√§ndler must have sold all the sacks for $30 each, which means that he received $30x in revenue. Since the h√§ndler made a profit of $400, we can set up the following equation:

$30x - $2x = $400

Simplifying the equation by subtracting $2x from both sides gives us:

$30x = $402

Dividing both sides by $30 gives us:

x = 13

So the h√§ndler sold 13 sacks of wheat to the farmer."

Violetta has 20 dollars to spend on 5 different colored markers. Each marker costs 2 dollars, so she needs to calculate how much change she will receive for her remaining 4 dollars after buying one marker. To do this, we can use long division with remainders.

Step 1: Divide 4 (remaining amount) by 2 (cost of one marker):

4 √∑ 2 =?

Step 2: Calculate the quotient and remainder:

Quotient =?
Remainder =?

Step 3: Determine the number of markers Violetta can buy with her remaining amount:

Response: 23786 inhabitants in total - 8417 men + 9092 women = 23786 = (8417 x 2) + (9092 x 2). Therefore, there are exactly 2 times 8417 = 16954 men and 2 times 9092 = 18184 women in Soda. The number of children is equal to the total population minus the sum of men and women, i.e., 23786 - (16954 + 18184) = 23786 - 35138 = -11352. So, there are -11352 children in Soda.
"Response: 60 Pokemon cards.
Explanation:

1st month: Elaine collected 3 times as many cards as she had initially (20 x 3 = 60). So, she had 60 cards at the end of the first month.

2nd month: Elaine collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month (60 - 20 = 40). So, she had 40 cards at the end of the second month.

3rd month: Elaine collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first two months combined (40 + 60 = 100). So, she had 100 cards at the end of the third month."

To find out how much water Baldur collects each day, we need to calculate the total amount of water he collects in a morning and afternoon.

Morning: 5 eimers x 5 liters/eimer = 25 liters
Afternoon: 6 eimers x 5 liters/eimer = 30 liters

Therefore, Baldur collects a total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water each day."

To calculate how much money John earned that year, we need to first calculate his weekly earnings before the prize and then add the one-time cash bonus and the salary increase.

Weekly earnings before the prize = 2000 x 52 = 104,000 $

One-time cash bonus = 5000 $

Salary increase = 5% of 104,000 = 5200 $

Total earnings for the year = 104,000 + 5000 + 5200 = 119,200 $"
"Response: 
To find out how many barrels of wine are produced on the farm per year, we need to first calculate how many tons of grapes are produced per year and then convert that number into barrels.

There are 5 tons of grapes produced per year on each acre of land (10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons/year).

Since 2 barrels of wine can be made from 1 ton of grapes, we can calculate the number of barrels of wine as follows:

50 tons/year / 2 barrels/ton = 25 barrels/year

So, the farm produces 25 barrels of wine per year."

Gary goes around the perimeter of the local park, which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour, how many hours will he spend walking?

Formula: Distance = Rate x Time
Time = Distance / Rate

In this case, we know the distance (perimeter) and the rate (3 miles/hour), so we can plug those values into the formula to solve for time:

Time = Perimeter / Rate
= 1.5 miles x 6 miles / 3 miles/hour
= 9 hours

Therefore, Gary will spend 9 hours walking around the perimeter of the park."

To calculate Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to first calculate the total amount she has paid so far. This can be done by multiplying the number of months (12) by her monthly payment ($165):

Total amount paid = Number of months x Monthly payment
= 12 x $165
= $1980

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the original amount borrowed to find out Janeth's remaining balance:

Remaining balance = Original amount borrowed - Total amount paid
= $2000 - $1980
= $20

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $20."

Question: If there were twice as many beetles as ants in the garden, and Dax found half as many beetles as he did ants, how many beetles were there?
Based on the information given, formulate a numeric answer. 
Answer: Let x be the number of beetles. Then, since there are twice as many beetles as ants, there would be 2x ants. Dax found half as many beetles as ants, so he found x/2 ants. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 50

Solve for x to find the number of beetles."

"Response: 

Let's break down the information given:

* Johnny had $20 in cash as his starting amount (Taschengeld).
* He added an additional $10 to this amount, so he had a total of $30.
* This amount was invested and tripled over the course of one year.

To find out how much money Johnny had after one year, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P x (1 + r)^n

where:
A = the final amount (the amount Johnny had after one year)
P = the principal amount (the initial amount Johnny had, which is $30 in this case)
r = the rate at which the amount grows (in this case, the amount will triple, so the growth rate is 3)
n = the number of periods (in this case, there is only one period of one year)

Plugging in these values, we get:

A = $30 x (1 + 3)^1
= $30 x 4
= $120

So, after one year, Johnny had $120."
"Response: 
Mary is two years younger than Joan, and Joan is five years older than Jessa. So we can start by finding out how old Joan is.
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25
Now we know that Joan is 25 years old. We also know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so we can find out how old Mary is.
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23
So Mary is 23 years old. Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
Jessa's age (20) + Joan's age (25) + Mary's age (23) = 68"

"Response: 58 Bonbons (calculation below)

Explanation:
Let's start by identifying what we know about each person's number of bonbons:

* James has 6 more than Robert. So if Robert has x bonbons, James has x + 6 bonbons.
* John has double the number of bonbons as Robert. So if Robert has x bonbons, John has 2x bonbons.

Now let's look at the information given in the problem:

* John has 54 bonbons.

We can use this information to find out how many bonbons Robert must have. Since John has double the number of bonbons as Robert, we know that John has 2 times the number of bonbons as Robert. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x = 54

Solving for x, we get:

x = 27

So Robert has 27 bonbons. Now we can find out how many bonbons James has:

James has 6 more than Robert, so James has:

x + 6 = 27 + 6

Therefore, James has 33 bonbons.

To summarize, John has 54 bonbons, Robert has 27 bonbons, and James has 33 bonbons."

"Response: 
To calculate how much Jean was paid, we need to know the following information:

* The cost per hour of the makeup artist's services: $250/hour
* The number of hours spent on making up Jean each day: 6 hours/day
* The number of days Jean needed her makeup done each week: 4 days/week
* The total number of weeks the film took to finish: 5 weeks
* The discount given by the makeup artist as a percentage of the total amount due: 10%

Using this information, we can calculate the total amount Jean owed for the makeup services as follows:

Total amount due = (Number of days x Hourly rate) x Number of weeks
= (6 hours/day x $250/hour) x 5 weeks
= $750 x 5 weeks
= $3,750

Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we can calculate the amount Jean actually paid using the following formula:

Amount paid = Total amount due x Discount percentage
= $3,750 x 10%
= $375

Therefore, Jean paid $375 for the makeup services."
