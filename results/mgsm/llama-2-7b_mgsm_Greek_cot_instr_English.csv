Response:  The papaya tree produces 16 fruits per day. Janet eats three for breakfast every day and gives one to each of her four friends. She sells the remaining fruit at the market for $2 per piece. How much money does she make every day?  To find out, we need to calculate how many pieces of fruit Janet sells at the market each day. Since she has 16 fruits per day and sells them for $2 each, she makes $2 x 16 = $32 in revenue from selling fruit each day. Now, let's subtract the cost of the three fruits she eats for breakfast ($3) and the one she gives to each of her four friends ($4 x 4 = $16). So, Janet makes $32 - $3 - $16 = $13 in profit each day from selling fruit.
Response:  We know that one cup of rice requires 2 cups of water to cook. So, if we want to make 2 cups of cooked rice, we need 4 cups of water (2 x 2 = 4). Now, let's consider the leftover water after cooking the rice. If we use 1/3 of the total water for washing the rice, then we will have 4 / 3 = 1 1/3 cups of leftover water. Therefore, in total, we need 4 + 1 1/3 = 5 1/3 cups of water to cook 2 cups of rice.
Response:  At first, Tzos bought a house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on renovations, which increased its value by 150%. So, the total cost of the renovations was $50,000 / 150% = $33,333. Therefore, Tzos made a profit of $50,000 - $33,333 = $16,667.
Response:  The distance traveled in one spring is 60 meters. Since he runs three springs per day, the total distance traveled per day is 60 x 3 = 180 meters. Therefore, the total distance traveled over 7 days is 180 x 7 = 1260 meters.
"Response:  The Gooney bird feeds its kids with three different types of food every day, which are seeds, fruits and insects. It provides them with 15 pieces of food in the morning and 25 pieces of food at night. So, if the size of the Gooney bird's nest is 20 chicks, how many pieces of food does it need to provide for each chick per meal?

Note: In this problem, we assume that the number of chicks in the nest remains constant throughout the day, so the total amount of food required will be the same regardless of when the bird provides it."
Response:  The first jar costs $5, and each subsequent jar costs $60% of its price. So, the cost of the second jar is $60% of $5 = $3. Therefore, the total cost of 4 jars would be $5 + ($3 x 4) = $21. To buy 16 jars, Kailar needs to pay $21 x 16 = $320.
Response:  The Toulouse has 16 more pigs than the Charleston and 8 more pigs than the Seattle. So, the total number of pigs that the Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is:  16 + 8 = 24 pigs. Therefore, the Seattle has 20 - 24 = -4 pigs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kárlā can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute. Since she has to download a total of 200 GB, it will take her 10 minutes (200 GB / 2 GB per min = 10 min) to complete the download. However, due to the Windows updates taking 20 seconds every time they are needed, Kárlā needs to restart her computer 4 times during the download process. Therefore, the total time required for KáRLA to download the archive is: Total Time = Download Time + Restart Time = 10 min + (4 x 20 s) = 10 min + 80 s = 98 min And so, the amount of time Kárlā needs to spend downloading the archive is 98 minutes.
Response:  Jon has been driving for 3 hours with an average speed of 60 miles per hour and then he turns back. He tries to reach his house in 4 hours but fails to do so because he spends the first 2 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Therefore, he covers the remaining time of 4 hours at a speed of 80 miles per hour, which means that he is away from his house by 160 miles at the end of those 4 hours.
"Response:  Eliza works for 40 hours per week and earns $10 per hour. She also receives overtime pay of $1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If she worked 45 hours that week, how much did she make?

First, let's calculate Eliza's regular earnings for that week:

Regular earnings = Number of hours worked x Hourly wage
= 40 hours x $10 per hour
= $400

Now, let's calculate her overtime earnings:

Overtime earnings = Overtime hours x Overtime hourly rate x Multiplier
= 10 hours x ($1.2 x $10) = $120

So, Eliza's total earnings for that week are:

Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
= $400 + $120
= $520

Therefore, if Eliza worked 45 hours that week, she would have made $520."
"Response:  The program had 60 receptions in the first month and the number of receptions decreased by 30% in the third month compared to the second month. So, if we want to find out how many receptions the program had overall for the three months, we can use this information as follows:

Total receptions = (First month + Second month) - (Third month / 30%)
= 60 + 90 - (30 / 30%)
= 60 + 90 - 21
= 171 receptions
Therefore, the program had 171 receptions over the course of the three months."
Response:  The first purchase was three large donuts that cost $68. The second purchase was two medium-sized muffins that cost $80. Finally, she bought six small turtles for $55 each. Therefore, the total amount spent is: $68 + $80 + ($55 x 6) = $413.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Karlos will plant 7 lemons every year and sell them for $1.5 each. Therefore, he will earn $10.5 per year (7 x $1.5).  Secondly, we are told that it costs him $3 to take care of the tree during one year, so he will incur an annual cost of $3. Thirdly, we want to find out how many years it will take for Karlos to start making profits from his lemon trees. To do this, we need to subtract the total cost of taking care of the tree over those years from the total revenue earned during those same years. So, if Karlos starts with 100 lemons, after one year he will have 7 x 10 = 70 more lemons, which means he has earned $70 ($10.5 x 70) in revenue. However, he also spent $3 on taking care of the tree, so his net profit is actually $67 ($70 - $3). If he continues to do this for n years, then at the end of n years, he will have earned a total of $n x $67 = $n x 67 dollars in net profit. Since he spends $3 every year to take care of the tree, he will break even after n/3 years, where n is the number of years it takes him to reach his goal of earning $100 in net profit. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of years it will take Karlos to start making profits from his lemon trees = $\frac{n}{3}$
Response:  The Melani has sold three electric skateboards at the green house, two more at the red house, and almost nothing left in the portico. If the Melani has 5 electric skateboards, how many did she sell?
Response:  We know that out of 20 students in the dance class, 20% were enrolled in the modern dance course and 25% of the remaining students were enrolled in the jazz dance course. Therefore, we can calculate the number of students who are not enrolled in either dance course as follows: Number of non-enrolled students = Total number of students - Number of enrolled students in modern dance course - Number of enrolled students in jazz dance course = 20 - 4 - 3 = 13 So, 13 students from the total of 20 students are not enrolled in either the modern or jazz dance courses.
"Response:  The total value of the two options is $50,000 for cosmetics and $80,000 for electronic gadgets. If the sales growth rate for cosmetics is 2.5%, then in one year, the value of the cosmetics option will be:

$50,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $51,250

Similarly, if the sales growth rate for electronic gadgets is 1.2%, then in one year, the value of the electronic gadgets option will be:

$80,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $81,600

Now, let's calculate the profit at the end of the year. If the trader chooses to buy the cosmetics option, the profit will be:

Profit = Purchase price - Sale price
= $51,250 - $47,300
= $3,950

If the trader chooses to buy the electronic gadgets option, the profit will be:

Profit = Purchase price - Sale price
= $81,600 - $75,200
= $6,400

Therefore, if the trader wants to maximize their profit at the end of the year, they should choose the electronic gadgets option."
Response:  On day 1, both trains travel for 80 miles and then turn around to go back in the opposite direction. So they cover a total distance of 80 + (–80) = 0 miles.  On day 2, they travel north again, covering a distance of 240 miles. Therefore, the difference in distance traveled between the two trains is:  Distance traveled by Train A - Distance traveled by Train B = 240 – 0 = 240 miles.
Response:  The teacher earns $20 per hour and works for 50 weeks of the year (3 months). Therefore, her annual income is: $$ \text {Annual Income} = \text {Hourly Wage} \times \text{Number of Hours Worked} \times \text{Number of Weeks in a Year} $$ $$ \text {Annual Income} = \$ 20 \times 35 \times 50 = \$ 7,500 $$ So, the teacher's annual salary is $7,500.
"Response:  If Kler works every day from Monday to Friday and has three eggs per day for breakfast, then in one week (Monday to Sunday) he will have:

* 7 days x 3 eggs/day = 21 eggs per week

If he continues this routine for four weeks, he will have:

* 4 weeks x 21 eggs/week = 84 eggs total

So, Kler will have 84 eggs in four weeks."
Response:  Firstly, Maria walked for 1 hour to cover the first 4 miles, so she walked at a speed of 4/1 = 4 miles per hour during that time. Then, she rested for another hour and walked again to cover the remaining 2 miles, which means she walked at a speed of 2/1 = 2 miles per hour during that time as well. Therefore, if Maria wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour throughout the entire journey, she needs to have covered a total distance of 4 + 2 = 6 miles in the two hours she spent walking.
Response:  We have 10 liters of port wine and we want to add it to 15 liters of water that is already the third part (3/4) full. So, if we add 10 liters of port wine to 15 liters of water, how much water will be left? Well, if we subtract 10 liters from 15 liters, we get 5 liters of water left. Therefore, there are 5 liters of water remaining in the container after adding the port wine.
Response:  We know that Reimon was born 6 years before Samantha and is currently 35 years old (born in 1987). Therefore, if Samantha is now 31 years old (born in 1990), then Reimon's son was born when he was 23 years old (in 1987). So, the answer is 23 - 6 = 17 years ago.
Response:  The first three customers bought one DVD each, so they bought a total of 3 DVDs. The next two customers bought 2 DVDs each, so they bought a total of 4 DVDs. Therefore, in total, Bilí sold 7 DVDs (3 + 4).
"Response:  The hare moves at a speed of 2 km/h.  We know that it takes him 4 hours to cover 80 km (since he runs at a constant speed). Therefore, in one hour, he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 2 km/h x 1 h = 2 km

Now, let's find out how many kilometers the hare will have covered after 5 hours:

Distance = Speed x Time = 2 km/h x 5 h = 10 km

So, after 5 hours, the hare will have covered a distance of 10 km."
Response:  The book was sold for $19.50 with a discount of 25%. To find the original price, we can use the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage). Plugging in the values given in the question, we get: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $78.00 So, the original price of the book was $78.00.
Response:  Firstly, Marí paid $12 for the meal (which is not included in the calculation of the change). Then she bought 5 bags of grapes that cost $3 each, so she spent $15 total ($3 x 5 = $15). Next, she bought 4 apples at $1.50 each, which means she spent $6 total ($1.50 x 4 = $6). Finally, she received $50 as change, which we will subtract from the total amount she spent to find out how much money she has left. Therefore, the number of cups of coffee Marí purchased can be calculated as follows: Number of cups = Total amount spent - Change $= $15 + $6 - $50 = $49 So, Marí purchased 49 cups of coffee.
Response:  The cost of one sorcesak is $16.50, and there are three of them, so their total cost is $16.50 x 3 = $49.50.  Similarly, the cost of one panetelonia is $22.50, and there are also three of them, so their total cost is $22.50 x 3 = $67.50. Finally, the cost of one papoutsia is $42, and there is only one of it, so its cost is simply $42. Therefore, the total cost of all the items is $49.50 + $67.50 + $42 = $158.50.
Response:  Sinta eats one portion of pasta every day. She buys 15 portions of pasta at once with a cost of $4 per portion. After 60 days, how much will she have spent in total?  Total amount spent = Number of portions x Cost per portion x Number of days = 15 x $4 x 60 = $900 So, after 60 days, Sinta will have spent $900 on pasta.
Response:  The first stop was made after 20 miles and the second stop was made before the end of the trip (15 miles away from the destination). So, the distance between the two stops is: Distance = Second Stop - First Stop = 15 miles - 20 miles = -5 miles. Therefore, Henri traveled 5 miles less than he had planned during his trip.
Response:  The glorious Gkloria has found two pots with different prices: one pot costs $33 and the other costs twice as much ($66). If we want to buy both pots together, how many dollars will it cost in total?
Response:  The age of Darrel is 7 years and that of Allen is 162 years. If we want to find out the age of Allen in 10 years from now, we can use the formula: Age = Current Age + Time. So, the age of Allen in 10 years will be: Age of Allen = 162 + 10 = 172 years. Therefore, the age of Allen after 10 years will be 172 years.
Response:  The first friend says that he thinks there are 80 grams of sugar in the bazo. The second friend says that he thinks there are 20 more grams than the first friend. So, if the first friend said 80 grams, then the second friend must have said 100 grams (20 + 80 = 100). Now, the third friend says that he thinks there are 25% more grams than the second friend. If the second friend said 100 grams, then the third friend must have said 125 grams (100 x 125%). Therefore, the median is 125 grams.
Response:  Since Jon has 10 skylarks to care for and each skylark needs 0.5 hours of exercise and thinking time per day, we can calculate how many hours Jon spends caring for his skylarks in total as follows: Total hours spent caring for skylarks = Number of skylarks x Exercise/thinking time per skylark per day Total hours spent caring for skylarks = 10 x 0.5 = 5 hours per day Now, let's calculate how many hours Jon spends caring for his skylarks in an week: Total hours spent caring for skylarks in a week = Total hours spent caring for skylarks per day x Number of days in a week Total hours spent caring for skylarks in a week = 5 x 7 (since there are 7 days in a week) = 35 hours per week Therefore, Jon spends 35 hours per week caring for his 10 skylarks.
"Response:  We know that there are 110 nomismata in total and 30 more than the silver ones. So, we can write an equation as follows: Nomismata = 110 + (30 - Silver Nomismata) Now, we need to find out how many silver nomismata there are. According to the question, ""there are 30 more than the silver nomismata"". This means that if we subtract the number of silver nomismata from the total number of nomismata, we will get the number of gold nomismata. Therefore, we can rewrite the previous equation as: Gold Nomismata = Nomismata - (Silver Nomismata - 30) Solving for the gold nomismata, we get: Gold Nomismata = 110 - (30 - x) Where x is the number of silver nomismata. Since we are given that there are 30 more silver nomismata than gold nomismata, we can set up the following inequality: x > 30 Substituting this inequality into our original equation, we get: Gold Nomismata > 110 - 30 > 80 Therefore, the Greeks have 80 gold nomismata."
Response:  We know that Ααρον has 5 more cosmetics than Rémond. If Remond has 40 cosmetics, how many does Siovan have? So, we can conclude that Siovan has 30 cosmetics (40 - 5 = 35).
Response:  In the first 20 minutes (400 seconds), he scored 4 points.  In the second 20 minutes (400 seconds), he scored 25% more than in the first period, which is equal to 10 points (since 25% of 40 = 10). Therefore, the total number of points scored during the game is: 4 + 10 = 14 points.
"Response:  The Terri eats 2 burgers per day. At present, they are selling for $5 each. How much does he save in 30 days?

Answer:
To find out how much Terri saves in 30 days, we need to calculate the total cost of the burgers he buys and then subtract the amount he pays for them.

Total cost = Number of burgers x Price per burger
= 2 x $5.00
= $10.00

So, Terri saves $10.00 in 30 days."
Response:  Jon has $15 to spend and he wants to buy all of his favorite LEGO sets. Each set costs $13. So, if he buys all of them, he will have spent $15 x 13 = $195. However, he only has $15 to spend, so he cannot buy all of the sets. Therefore, the number of LEGO sets that Jon has left is $195 - $15 = $180.
"Response:  Jon runs for 100 kilometers in one week. He runs for 3 hours during the first day and for half an hour less than that during the second day. How much does he run per hour?

First, let's calculate how many minutes Jon runs each day:

Day 1: 3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes
Day 2: Half an hour less than 3 hours = 3 - (3/2) = 90 minutes

Now, we can convert these minutes to hours:

Day 1: 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours
Day 2: 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours

So, Jon runs for 3 hours on Day 1 and 1.5 hours on Day 2. To find out how fast he runs, we need to divide the distance he covers (100 kilometers) by the time he spends running (in hours):

Jon runs at a speed of 100 km / 3 h = 33.33 km/h

Therefore, Jon runs at a speed of approximately 33.33 kilometers per hour."
Response:  If Dina can run at a speed of 3 miles per hour, she can cover a distance of 3 x 60 = 180 miles in one hour.  Since she has been running for three hours, she has covered a total distance of 180 x 3 = 540 miles.  However, if she slows down to a speed of 2 miles per hour, it will take her 3 x 60 = 180 minutes to cover the same distance, so she will have traveled a total distance of 180 x 2 = 360 miles during those three hours. Therefore, Dina can travel a maximum distance of 360 - 540 = -180 miles in three hours if she slows down from her initial speed of 3 miles per hour.
Response:  If the iPhone of Ben is two times older than the iPhone of Suzy, and Suzy's iPhone is one year old, then Ben's iPhone must be 2 + 1 = 3 years old.
Response:  The dragon is at an altitude of 300 meters and can throw fireballs up to 400 meters away from its location. However, when Poli has the petrified wood, she can throw it three times farther than her own height. If she doesn't have the petrified wood, she can only throw it twice as far as her own height. So, if Poli throws the petrified wood with all her might, how far will it go?  Solution:  To calculate the distance that the petrified wood will travel, we need to use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed of the petrified wood is given as 2xPoli's height, where x is the number of times Poli throws the wood. Since Poli can throw it three times farther than her own height, the distance traveled by the petrified wood will be: Distance = (2xPoli's height) x 3 = 6xPoli's height. Therefore, if Poli throws the petrified wood with all her might, it will travel a total distance of 6xPoli's height away from her location.
Response:  The grandmother made 5 pies for the guests of the wedding feast. Each pie was cut into 8 slices and placed in the buffet table to be served to the invited ones. At the end of the night, after the guests had eaten all the slices, they were left with 14 pieces of pie. So, the number of slices each guest got is:  14 / 5 = 2.8
Response:  We know that the sack has 250 thermoses and we want to find out how many grams of coffee we can make if we have already used 1800 thermoses. So, let's calculate the number of grams of coffee we can make based on the remaining thermoses in the sack: Number of grams = Total number of thermoses x Amount of coffee per thermos - Number of thermoses used = 250 x 170 g / thermos - 1800 = 4250 g Now, we are asked how much coffee we can make if we have 300 grams of coffee beans. To do this, we need to divide the amount of coffee we can make by the amount of coffee beans available: Number of grams of coffee = Amount of coffee beans / Amount of coffee per gram = 300 g / 170 g/thermos = 1.76 thermae So, we can make approximately 1.76 thermes of coffee with the remaining 250 thermoses in the sack.
Response:  If he sells each chicken for $2, then he will have a total revenue of $2 x 20 = $40 from selling 20 chickens. So, his profit will be $40 - $10 = $30 per chicken.
Response:  On average, she writes one article per day (Monday to Wednesday), and two articles per day (Thursday). Therefore, in total, she wrote 15 articles during those five days (3 x Monday + 2 x Tuesday + 2 x Wednesday + 8 x Thursday). So, her daily writing time is approximately 3 hours (15 articles / 5 days = 3 hours per day).
Response:  The woman had 80 notes in her purse before she went to work at the cafe. She stopped at the store and bought one pack of Post-its containing 220 different colored sticky notes. If she had 23 remaining notes after using them all up, how many notes were in the pack she bought?
Response:  The cost of one red grape is $0.20. Since Jon buys 200 grapes, the total cost of red grapes is: 200 x $0.20 = $40. So, John spent $40 for red grapes.
"Response:  We know that the trellis had 1 meter in length and there were 6 sections (or ""incts"") of it. To find out how many pieces of wood were used to make the trellis, we need to divide the length of the trellis by the length of each section. So, we can calculate as follows: Length of trellis = 1 m / 6 in = 0.17 m per inch Therefore, if the trellis was made up of 6 equal sections, each section would be 0.17 meters long. Since there are 45 cm in 1 meter, we can convert this to centimeters as follows: Section length = 0.17 m x 45 cm/m = 7.95 cm Now, since there were 6 sections in total, we can multiply the length of each section by 6 to get the total length of all the pieces of wood used to make the trellis: Total length of wood = 6 x 7.95 cm = 47.7 cm In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, there were approximately 47.7 centimeters of wood used to make the trellis."
"Response:  We know that there are 15 outhouses in total and each outhouse has 8 monads. Therefore, the number of monads in all outhouses is:

15 x 8 = 120 monads
Now, we need to find out how many areas are left unused in the house. The text says that ""τα 3/4 του κτιρίου"" (the three-quarters of the house) are not used. So, let's calculate what percentage of the house this is:

(3/4) x 100% = 75%
So, 75% of the house is left unused, which means that 75% of 120 monads are left unused:

75% x 120 = 90 monads
Therefore, there are 90 monads left unused in the house."
Response:  The lion has a farm of eggs and every day it sells 252 eggs for $2 each. So, in one week (7 days), the lion earns $1464 from egg sales ($2 x 252 eggs/day x 7 days). In one month (30 days), the lion earns $4328 from egg sales ($2 x 252 eggs/day x 30 days). Therefore, the lion earns $4328 per month from egg sales.
Response:  The boat can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 4 hours. Therefore, it will cover a distance of 4 x 10 = 40 miles. Since it starts at 1 pm and returns at 5 pm, it will have traveled for 5 hours (from 1 pm to 6 pm). So, the time it takes to make one round trip is 5 hours / 6 mph = 0.83 hours or 51 minutes.
Response:  If Ouida loses 15 kg of fat, her weight will decrease by 15/2 = 7.5 kg. Since each kilogram of fat lost is equivalent to one kilogram of weight loss, Ouida will lose 7.5 kg x 2 = 15 kg in total. Therefore, she needs to lose 15 - 30 = 15 kg more to reach her goal of losing 30 kg.
Response:  On Wednesday, the mechanic visited 6 cars and did not visit any trucks. Therefore, he earned $60 x 6 = $360 from car repairs. Since he didn't visit any trucks, he didn't earn anything from their repairs. So, his total income for that day was $360. Now let's move to Friday. The mechanic visited 12 cars but didn't visit any boats or planes. Therefore, he earned $40 x 12 = $480 from car repairs. Again, since he didn't visit any boats or planes, he didn't earn anything from their repairs. So, his total income for that day was $480. Comparing both days, we can see that the mechanic earned $360 + $480 = $840 more on Friday than on Wednesday.
Response:  The mother of the Doubtfire family has seven cats that she has adopted from her local animal shelter when she calls them to inform them that the two cats have just given birth to seven kittens each. According to Patsy, the first cat, they have had three litters of kittens so far, while Tricky, the other cat, has had twelve. Therefore, how many kittens does the Doubtfire family have now?
Response:  Since Τζιν (Jin) has 30 glifitzouris and she eats two of them, there are 28 glifitzouris left. With these remaining glifitzouris, Zan wants to put two in a basket. Therefore, Jin can fill one basket with 28 glifitzouris.
Response:  Peter has $42 for one week and he spends $7 each time he goes to the cinema. Since he goes to the cinema every day, he spends a total of $7 x 7 = $49 per week on cinemas. So, after one week, he will have $42 - $49 = -$7 left. Therefore, Peter can go to the cinema only 7/(-$7) = 10 times in one week.
"Response:  The wooden bridge can carry up to 5000 kg. A cart with a total weight of 3.755 kg (including the driver and goods) wants to cross the bridge. To find out how many boxes of goods that weight can be carried without exceeding the maximum load capacity of the bridge, we need to divide the total weight of the cart by the maximum load capacity of the bridge. So, the number of boxes of goods that can be carried is:

Number of boxes = Total weight of cart / Maximum load capacity of bridge
= 3.755 kg / 5000 kg
= 0.0751 boxes
Therefore, the largest number of boxes of goods that can be carried across the wooden bridge without exceeding its maximum load capacity is 0.0751 boxes."
Response:  Firstly, Stiven made an electronic sale for $40. Then, as a commission, he added 25% to the final price and paid $14 in taxes ($40 x 25%). Finally, he gave a discount of $6 (3 dollars x 2) and received a donation of $4. So, after all the calculations, Stiven had $28 left ($40 - $14 - $6 + $4).
"Response:  We know that there are 6 baskets of figs in total and each basket contains 20 figs. So, the total number of figs is:

6 baskets x 20 figs/basket = 120 figs
Now, we need to find out how many figs are left after cutting off the top layer of soil from the entire garden. The question states that there are 67 fronds (a type of leaf) above the ground, which means that the height of the top layer of soil is equal to 67 fronds multiplied by their height. Since we don't have any information about the height of each frond, let's assume an average height of 5 cm for simplicity. Therefore, the volume of the top layer of soil is:

Volume of soil = Number of fronds x Height of each frond
= 67 fronds x 5 cm/frond = 335 cm^3
Finally, we can calculate the number of figs remaining in the garden by subtracting the volume of the top layer of soil from the total number of figs:

Number of figs remaining = Total number of figs - Volume of soil
= 120 figs - 335 cm^3
= 91 figs
Therefore, there are 91 figs remaining in the garden after cutting off the top layer of soil from the entire garden."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 portions of food in total, and we want to find out how many good ones there are. From the information given, we can conclude that:

* The first portion is bad (1/4 = 0).
* The second portion is unknown (20%).
* The third and fourth portions are good (2/4 = 0.5).
* The fifth and sixth portions are also good (2/6 = 0.33).
* The seventh and eighth portions are unknown (2/8 = 0.25).
* The ninth and tenth portions are good (2/10 = 0.2).
* The eleventh and twelfth portions are unknown (2/12 = 0.17).
* The thirteenth and fourteenth portions are good (2/14 = 0.14).
* The fifteenth and sixteenth portions are unknown (2/16 = 0.125).
* The seventeenth and eighteenth portions are good (2/18 = 0.111).
* The nineteenth and twentieth portions are unknown (2/20 = 0.095).
* The twenty-first and twenty-second portions are good (2/22 = 0.091).
* The twenty-third and twenty-fourth portions are unknown (2/24 = 0.083).

So, based on this analysis, we can say that there are 10 good portions of food (5 + 5) out of a total of 25 portions. Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many portions of food are good?"" is 10."

Response:  If Mars works for the same company for 40 years and takes annual bonuses of $50,000 starting from age 20, then at age 60 (after 40 years of work), her total bonus amount would be: $50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000. Now, if she retires after 30 years of work, her total bonus amount at retirement would be: $2,000,000 - ($50,000 x 30) = $1,700,000.
"Response:  At first, Alina paid $140 for the service in January. If the company charges her $130 less each month (10% of $140), then she will pay a total of:

$140 - ($130 x 10%) = $126 per month

So, until the end of the year (December), Alina will have paid a total of:

$126 x 12 = $1512

Therefore, the total amount that Alina will have paid for the service throughout the year is $1512."
"Response:  The distance traveled so far is 160 kilometers and she has to fill up her car with 4 gallons of gasoline again. According to the manual, the capacity of her car's fuel tank is 12 gallons. Therefore, Sophia can travel an additional distance of:  160 km - (4 gal / 12 gal) = 80 km  
So, Sophia can travel 80 kilometers more with only one gallon of gasoline left in her car."
Response:  The man watches TV for 2 hours and then takes a nap and reads for the rest of the time. He does this three times a week. So in one week, he spends 6 hours (3 x 2) watching TV and reading. In four weeks, he spends 24 hours (6 x 4) watching TV and reading.
Response:  Each school has one boys' and one girls' team, so there are in total teams. Since each team consists of players, we have players in total. Finally, since all schools sent representatives to the tournament, we have participants in total. Therefore, the answer is.
Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds in total and 35 less rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is 175 - 35 = 140. Since we have no information about the size of each stone, let's assume they are all equal in weight. Therefore, the total weight of rubies found in the treasure chest is 140 x 2 = 280 grams.
Response:  If there are 60 girls and each girl has 5 math teachers, then we have:  Number of math teachers = 60 x 5 = 300.
Response:  At first, Beilie starts with $100. Then she receives an monthly income of $5 for 8 months in total. So at the end of 8 months, her balance is: $100 + ($5 x 8) = $100 + $40 = $140. Therefore, Beilie has $140 after receiving $40 in income over 8 months.
Response:  The school teaches 5 lessons per day and 8 lessons on Saturday. So in total, it teaches 13 lessons per week (5 + 8 = 13). Since each lesson costs $ 15, the total cost of teaching one week is: Total Cost = Number of Lessons x Cost Per Lesson = 13 x $ 15 = $ 195. Therefore, the school spends $ 195 per week.
Response:  The first strategy has 20 instructions and the second one has multiple (not specified) instructions from the first one. So, in total, Kellian needs to read 20 + (number of instructions in the second strategy) = x instructions. Therefore, the answer is x.
Response:  If Tom sells 43 mbira and 23 tyropitakia, he will earn $135 from those sales (since each mbira costs $3 and each tyropitakia costs $4). So, in total, Tom has earned $135 + $135 = $270.
Response:  The total cost of the five phones is $150 each, so the total cost for one month would be $150 x 3 = $450. Since there is a toll of 2% per month, the total amount that Silas will pay in three months would be $450 x (1 + 0.02) ^ 3 = $469.80.
Response:  If Artie sells 12 glasses of margarine at $2.74 each, he will make $31.56 in total ($2.74 x 12 = $31.56).  If he sells 9 glasses of pesto at $1.87 each, he will make $16.53 in total ($1.87 x 9 = $16.53). And if he sells 17 glasses of bougainvillea at $2.12 each, he will make $35.04 in total ($2.12 x 17 = $35.04). Therefore, Artie will have made a total of $82.03 ($31.56 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $82.03) from selling all three types of flowers today.
Response:  The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = l × w × h, where l, w and h are the length, width and height of the cube respectively. Since we know that each side of the castle has the same length as the diameter of the circle (which is half the circumference), we can use this information to find the volume of one side of the castle.  Therefore, the volume of one side of the castle is equal to the volume of a cylinder with radius equal to half the diameter of the circle and height equal to the height of the wall.  Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height, we can solve for the volume of one side of the castle.  Now, since there are four sides to the castle, we need to multiply the volume of one side by 4 to get the total volume of the castle.  So, the total volume of the castle is 4 times the volume of one side of the castle.  Finally, since we want to know the average volume of an epipedon, which is a three-dimensional rectangular prism with six square faces, we need to divide the total volume of the castle by 6.  Therefore, the average volume of an epipedon in the castle is 4/6 = 2/3 times the volume of one side of the castle.
Response:  The puppy is supposed to eat 1 flitzi per hour for the first 180 hours of its life (or about 7.5 flitzia per day). After that period, it will need 2 flitzia per day until it reaches adulthood. If an average meal of dog food contains 110 flitzia, how many meals will Sesilia have to prepare during the first year of her puppy's life?
Response:  If Reimon makes 100 plungers and Sara makes 4 times that amount (i.e., 4 x 100 = 400), then the total number of plungers made is:  Reimon + Sara = 100 + 400 = 500 plungers.
Response:  If Vinsent can buy three loulies for $2.50 or two loulies for $1, then he can buy 3 x 2 = 6 loulies for $2.50 and 2 x 3 = 6 loulies for $1. So, if he buys 18 loulies at the best price, he will pay $2.50 x 6 = $15 for 6 loulies and $1 x 6 = $6 for another 6 loulies, totaling $21.
Response:  The cost of the puppy is $100. If Jon gets an additional discount of 30%, then he will pay $70 for the puppy ($100 x 30%). So, the final cost of the puppy to Jon is $70.
Response:  The first two girls took 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which means they took 4 liters (24 / 6 = 4). Then, a boy took 6 liters of water. So, in total, there are 4 + 6 = 10 liters of water left.
Response:  At first, Τσάρλι had 10 automobiles. Then he bought 21 more from a car dealership and took 23 for his birthday. After that, he gave 9 of them to his sister and used 28 for a gift card. So, how many automobiles does Τσάρλι have now?  We can calculate it as follows:  Initially, Τσάρλι had 10 automobiles, plus the ones he bought = 10 + 21 = 31 automobiles. Later, he gave 9 automobiles to his sister, so he has 31 - 9 = 22 automobiles left. Therefore, Τσάρλι has 22 automobiles in total.
Response:  The weight of Gkrias is 40 kg and Alex's weight is 2 kg less than 4 times the weight of Gkrias. So, we can write:  Weight of Gkrias = 40 kg... (1)... Alex's weight = 2 kg < 4 x (Weight of Gkrias)... (2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: 40 kg - 8 kg = 32 kg... (3) Therefore, the total weight of both Gkrias and Alex is 32 kg.
Response:  We know that Dan has 3 triangular gardens and each garden has 25 triangles. So, in total, he has 3 x 25 = 75 triangles. Now, we are asked how many angles there are in total. Each triangle has 8 angles, so the total number of angles is 75 x 8 = 600 angles. Therefore, the answer is 600.
Response:  The team played 22 games and won more times than they lost. So, we can say that their win-loss record is positive. To find out how many more wins they had than losses, we need to subtract the number of losses from the number of wins. Therefore, the answer is: $ 8 - x = 22$ where $x$ is the number of losses. Solving for $x$, we get: $x = 14$. So, the team won $8$ more games than they lost.
Response:  The text says that Jinn has been working for 15 years and has taken 7 days off in total. Since he started work at age 23, now he is 34 years old. So, let's calculate how many working days he had from age 23 to 34:  Age 23 - 7 days = 16 years of work Age 34 - 7 days = 27 years of work Total number of working days = 16 + 27 = 43 years of work Therefore, Jinn has worked for 43 years.
"Response:  On the first day, the ghost chained three times and then was closed by the owner of the house. On the second day, it chained four more times than the previous day. On the third day, it chained for half the time as the second day. So, if we calculate the total number of times the ghost chained during these three days...

Answer: $3 + 4 + \frac{1}{2} = 7$

Therefore, the ghost chained $7$ times in total during those three days."
Response:  The company pays $600 to each employee every month. There is a political increase of 10% for each employee every year. If Sylvi has worked at the company for 5 years as of December, how much is her annual salary after another 3 years of service?  We know that the annual salary increases by 10% every year, so if Sylvi has been working at the company for 8 years (including the 5 years she has already served), her annual salary will be increased by 10% again. Therefore, we can calculate Sylvi's current annual salary as follows: Annual Salary = Monthly Salary x (1 + Political Increase Rate) ^ Number of Years of Service  Since Sylvi has been working at the company for 5 years as of December, and there are 8 years in total including those 5 years, we have: Annual Salary = $600 x (1 + 0.10) ^ 8 = $72,000 So Sylvi's annual salary after another 3 years of service would be: Annual Salary = $72,000 x (1 + 0.10)^3 = $84,640
Response:  The first album of Miley Cyrus sold 10 times more copies than Harry Styles. If they together sold 88,000 copies, how many did Harry Styles sell? We know that Miley Cyrus sold 10 x 88,000 = 880,000 copies. So Harry Styles sold 880,000 - 88,000 = 792,000 copies.
"Response:  We have:

* The number of gift boxes that Christina needs to make is 75.
* Each gift box requires 1/4 of the total amount of decorations (which are not shown in the problem). Since we don't know the total amount of decorations, let's assume it's x.
* The cost of each decoration is $2.
* Christina has 16 friends who want to contribute money for the gifts.

Now, let's calculate how much money Christina will need to collect from her friends:

Total number of decorations needed = Total number of gift boxes x Number of decorations per gift box = 75 x 1/4 = 18.75

Since each decoration costs $2, the total amount of money Christina needs to collect from her friends is:

$18.75 x 16 friends = $309.50

Therefore, Christina will need to collect $309.50 from her 16 friends to buy the necessary decorations and make the 75 gift boxes."
"Response:  If one adult deinosaur can carry 10 kilograms of patatosalata and one child can carry half as much as an adult, then for 20 adults and 5 children in the picnic, we need:

Adults: 20 x 10 = 200 kilograms (of patatosalata)
Children: 5 x ½ = 25 kilograms (of patatosalata)
Total amount of patatosalata needed: 200 + 25 = 225 kilograms."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jan has three houses more than Maria. So, if Maria has x houses, then Jan has 3x houses.  Secondly, we know that Marsia has two more houses than Sinthi. Therefore, if Sinthi has y houses, then Marsia has 2y houses. Finally, we are asked how many houses in total have the three (Jan, Marsia and Sinthi). To find this out, we need to add up all the houses of these three people. So, the answer is: 3x + 2y = 10
Response:  The eldest child is Emily (age 5), then Jack (age 3), Cori (age 2), and James (age 10). So, Jack is 7 years younger than Emily. Therefore, if James is 10 years old and one year younger than Cori, we can conclude that Cori is 11 years old.
Response:  If Li can run 400 meters in 38 seconds with two jumps of 20% improvement over Jerry, then Jerry can run 400 meters in 35.6 seconds (calculation: 38 + (2 x 20%) = 35.6).
Response:  If there are 12 less cats than dogs in the neighborhood, and each cat has 3 kittens, then the total number of kittens is 3 x 12 = 36. Since there are twice as many dogs as cats, if there are 60 dogs, then there are 60 / 2 = 30 cats. Therefore, the total number of animals living in the neighborhood is 36 + 30 = 66.
Response:  From the 200 students in class 5, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the kindergarten. So, how many girls are not in the kindergarten? To find this out, we need to subtract the number of girls who are in the kindergarten from the total number of girls. Therefore, the answer is:  Number of girls who are not in the kindergarten = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the kindergarten.
Response:  We know that Χάρι (Harry) slept for 9 hours last night and his friend Tzéimis slept for only 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, if Harry slept for x hours, then Tzéimis slept for x / 3 hours. Since Tzéimis slept for less than half of what Harry slept, we can say that x > 2x / 3. Solving for x, we get x = 6 hours. Therefore, Harry slept for more than 6 hours longer than Tzéimis.
Response:  When Frida is making tacos with three tortillas per serving, and each tortilla has three layers of meat, then the total number of layers of meat she uses for one serving is 3 x 3 = 9 layers of meat. Since Frida made 32 servings of tacos, the total number of layers of meat she used is 9 x 32 = 288 layers of meat.
Response:  In the first 15 minutes of traffic flow, some cars may have passed through the intersection and then left it, while others may still be in the process of passing through.  Therefore, we cannot determine exactly how many cars have passed through the intersection during this time period based solely on the information provided. However, we can estimate the number of cars that passed through the intersection during this time frame as follows:  The total number of cars entering the intersection = 30 (as given in the problem)  During the first 15 minutes, some cars may have already passed through the intersection and left it, so let's assume that 5 cars did not pass through the intersection during this time period.  Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the intersection during the first 15 minutes = Total number of cars entering the intersection - Number of cars that did not pass through the intersection = 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Maírithe has already planted 2 plants in pots and wants to give one plant away to each of her friends and family tomorrow. So, she will have given away a total of 4 plants (2 + 2).  Now, let's consider how many plants she will have left after giving them away. If she has 18 new plants and gives away 4, then she will be left with 18 - 4 = 14 new plants. Therefore, the number of plants Maírithe will have left is 14.
Response:  The first friend hit the ball 20 times before Jerome woke up, and the second friend hit it 1/4 of the number of times that the first friend did (since they hit it more than once). So, the second friend hit the ball 5 times ( since 1/4 of 20 is 5). Now, the third friend hit the ball 10 times more than the second friend, so he hit it 50 times ( since 10 > 5). Therefore, if the fourth friend hit the ball 60 times, then he hit it 59 times ( since 60 - 50 = 9).
Response:  The Solon has to read 4 pages from the book of Sciences, 20 pages from the book of Social Studies, 7 pages from the book of History and 8 pages from the book of Geography. If he has 15 days left for reading, how many pages does he need to read per day?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of pages = Total number of pages / Number of days left for reading So, in this case, the number of pages that Solon needs to read per day is: Number of pages = (4 + 20 + 7 + 8) / 15 = 36 pages/day
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Jon drinks one glass of water each day before he goes to bed. So, in total, Jon drinks 4 glasses of water during these days. However, on Saturday and Sunday, Jon likes to relax and drink an energy drink with his dinner. Therefore, Jon drinks 2 more glasses of energy drinks (1 per night) = 6 glasses of energy drinks in total. Thus, the total number of glasses of liquid Jon drinks in one week is 4 + 6 = 10 glasses.
"Response:  The omichlē needs to cover 42 miles (or 67.6 km) from the coastline until it reaches the opposite shore. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each mile, it will take:

Response:  The Pope lays down one pazzl (a unit of measurement equal to 1000 tetrachions) and then her mother takes away three tetrachions from it. So, after these two operations, how many tetrachions will remain? We can start with the initial amount of 1000 tetrachions and subtract three tetrachions, which gives us 997 tetrachions remaining.
Response:  If Kónti eats three times more than Amir, and Amir eats 5 biskots, then Kónti eats 15 (3 x 5) biskots. So, the two of them together eat 20 biskots (15 + 5).
Response:  The three cups have a total volume of 3 x 5 = 15 inches. Since each cup has a height of 6 - 4 = 2 inches, we can calculate the internal volume of each cup as follows: Volume of first cup = 15 inches - (2 x 6) = 9 inches Volume of second cup = 15 inches - (2 x 4) = 7 inches Volume of third cup = 15 inches - (2 x 2) = 5 inches Now, let's find the sum of these volumes to get the total internal volume of all three cups: Total internal volume = Volume of first cup + Volume of second cup + Volume of third cup = 9 + 7 + 5 = 21 inches Therefore, the total internal volume of the three cups is 21 inches.
Response:  On Monday and Tuesday, Frank watched one hour of TV each day. Therefore, he saw 2 hours of TV in total (1 hour x 2 days). On Wednesday, he saw some episodes of his favorite show for 30 minutes each. Since there were 4 such episodes, Frank saw a total of 2 hours of TV that day (4 x 30 minutes = 2 hours). On Thursday, he finished his work early and watched an episode of his favorite show for 30 minutes. So, he saw 30 minutes of TV that day. On Friday, he stayed up late to prepare for the weekend, so he watched two episodes of his favorite show for 60 minutes in total. Therefore, Frank saw a total of 8 hours of TV during the week (2 + 2 + 30 + 60 = 8 hours).
Response:  When Henri started baking, he had 100 biscuits in total. He took out 5 to put them outside for cooling down, so he had 95 left. Then, after 30 minutes, he checked again and found that they had cooled down by 15 more than what he expected (15 + 15 = 30). So, he had 60 biscuits left. Finally, after another 20 minutes, he checked again and found that they had cooled down by an additional 5, leaving him with 55 biscuits in total. Therefore, Henriccoolled down 55 - 95 = 40 biscuits during the time period.
Response:  The local oil trader sells gasoline for $3 per gallon. An company offers to pay $20 per meter of gasoline sold at the station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline, how much will they have after the discount?  We need to calculate the total amount of gasoline bought first. To do this, we multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon: Total Gasoline = Number of Gallons x Price per Gallon = 10 x $3 = $30 Then, we subtract the discount amount from the total amount of gasoline bought: Discounted Gasoline = Total Gasoline - Discount Amount = $30 - $20 = $10 So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline and gets a $20 discount, they will have $10 worth of gasoline left after the discount.
Response:  The two contestants, Mars and Venus, had to guess how many fronds they could eat in one minute. They were given different amounts of space to work with: Mars had 3 plates of equal size (each plate containing 14 fronds) and Venus had 24 plates of varying sizes. If both contestants ate all their allocated fronds, how much did they eat per minute?
"Response:  The barge had a leak while it was in the harbor and took in 2 liters of water for every 3 meters it traveled towards the shore. It took 16 minutes to travel 20 feet. The distance to the shore was 64 feet long. How much water did the barge take in until it reached the shore?

Answer:  To find out how much water the barge took in, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that the barge took in 2 liters of water for every 3 meters it traveled towards the shore. So, if it traveled 20 feet (which is equal to 6 meters), it took in 2 x 6 = 12 liters of water. Since it took 16 minutes to travel this distance, the barge took in 12 liters / 16 minutes = 0.75 liters per minute. Therefore, the barge took in 0.75 liters per minute until it reached the shore."
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 classes per day, we have a total of 8 classes per day (4 x 2 = 8).  If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per class, then it will be cleaned a total of 8 x 3 = 24 times per day. Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in one hour.
Response:  Ryan plants two tulips in his garden every day for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, he has planted a total of 2 x 15 = 30 tulips. If he doesn't fertilize them and they don't grow, then after 15 days (not minutes) he will have 30 tulips. So, the answer is 30.
Response:  The maximum number of photos that Jamal's phone can take is 6 times more than Britney's phone. Therefore, if Jamal's phone takes 1800 photos, then Britney's phone took at most 300 photos (6 x 300 = 1800).
Response:  Firstly, Sasa has 10 pieces of wood with dimensions 2 x 4 x 10 that cost $10 each, so their total value is $100. Additionally, she has 5 pieces of wood with dimensions 4 x 4 x 10 that cost $16 each, so their total value is $80. If she sells all these pieces of wood, her total profit will be: $100 + $80 = $180.
"Response:  If she uses 7:13 coffee filters and each filter holds 1/7 of the total amount of water (which is 120 cups), then we can calculate how many filters she used as follows:

Number of filters = Total amount of water / Amount of water in each filter
= 120 cups / 1/7 cup per filter
= 85 filters
Therefore, if she used 120 kourabiedes cookies and filled them with syrup, she used approximately 85 coffee filters."
"Response:  Jon has 3 children and he buys 2 toy cars for each of them. The cost of each toy car is $60. Therefore, the total amount that Jon spends is:

So, Jon spends $120 in total."
Response:  On day one, there were two incoming ships with a total of 10 containers (each container has 5 boxes). Therefore, the number of containers that arrived on the second day is:  2 x 10 = 20 containers.
Response:  The average salary of American workers increased by 30% over four years, and then it increased again by another 40% over three more years. If we assume that both the American worker and the Greek worker had their salaries increase at the same rate as each other, then after six years (i.e., four years plus three years), the American worker would have earned an additional $40,000 compared to before. So, the total amount of money that the two workers would have earned in those six years is: $40,000 + ($30,000 x 2) = $160,000.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Τζούλια did not have any plastic cups at home, so she bought one from the store. Later, her husband also brought five more plastic cups and gave them to Τζούλια. When Τζούλια was preparing the coffee, she used three of the cups to taste the coffee. Therefore, the number of plastic cups she had left afterward was 12 - 3 = 9.
"Response:  If Δύλαν (Dylan) bought 38 puppies and 6 kittens above the number of puppies he already had (which is not specified in the question), then we can say that he bought:

Number of puppies = 38 - Number of puppies he already had

So, if Dylan already had x puppies, then the number of puppies he bought is:

Number of puppies = 38 - x

Similarly, if he bought y kittens above the number of kittens he already had, then the total number of kittens he has now is:

Total number of kittens = y + Number of kittens he already had

Now, let's substitute the values given in the question:

Number of puppies = 38 - x
Total number of kittens = 6 + Number of kittens he already had

Solving for x and Number of kittens he already had, we get:

x = 24
Number of kittens he already had = 2

Therefore, Dylan bought 38 puppies and 6 kittens above the number of puppies and kittens he already had, which means he now has 24 puppies and 2 kittens in addition to the ones he already had."
Response:  After Emily moved to her new school, she made 20 more friends than Lily. If Lily made 50 friends, how many friends does Lily have in total now?
Response:  The mother of Guel sells carpets, pearls and porcelain at her local store. A carpet costs three times more than each pearl. A porcelain piece costs five dollars less than a carpet. Dolon goes to the store to buy 4 carpets, 20 pearls, and 10 porcelain pieces. How much will he spend in total if each carpet costs $15?
Response:  The clinic sees 500 patients per day and each patient is followed for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors spend $ 150 per hour at the clinic and the clinic spends $ 200 per hour on patients. Therefore, the profit made by the clinic from these visits can be calculated as follows: Profit = (Number of patients seen x Average time spent per patient) - (Doctor's fee x Number of hours doctors work) - (Patient's fee x Number of hours patients are treated) So, in this case, we have: Profit = (500 x 24) - ($ 150 x 8) - ($ 200 x 6) = $ 32,000 - $ 900 - $ 12,000 = $ 11,100 per day Now, to calculate the total profit for one year, we need to multiply the daily profit by 365 days: Total profit per year = $ 11,100 x 365 = $ 3,979,500 So, based on the information provided, the clinic makes approximately $ 3.9 million in profits per year.
"Response:  The village of Agios Vasilios has 60 workers who work in agriculture and are paid 10 euros per day. If they have to pay 3 euros for each of their children when they go to school, then how many xotika (oxen) remain?

Solution:
Let's first calculate how much money the workers earn per day:
60 workers x 10 euros per day = 600 euros per day
Now let's subtract the amount they spend on their children's education:
600 euros per day - 3 euros per child per day x number of children = 597 euros per day
So there are 597 oxen remaining."
Response:  In May, Joseph made $500. In June, he made $60 less than in May. So, Joseph made $440 in June.
Response:  Pam made two turns and Frent did seven. If each turn costs 6 euros, then together they spent 12 euros (2 x 6 = 12). So, they spent 12 euros that day.
Response:  On Wednesday (Day 1), Wolt traveled 6 miles. On Thursday (Day 2), he traveled 6 times more than he did on Wednesday, which means he traveled 6 x 6 = 36 miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Wolt from Wednesday to Friday (Day 3) is 41 + 36 = 77 miles. So, Wolt traveled 77 miles on Friday (Day 3).
"Response:  Tom has 4 cars and each car costs $15 to fill up. So, in one month (30 days), Tom will spend:

$15 x 4 = $60 per month on fuel for all 4 cars."
Response:  We know that Βράιαν has 20 videos and lost 5 of them before the comparison. So, he has 15 videos left. Now, we need to find out how many videos Bob has. According to the question, Bob has 5 more videos than Braian. Therefore, if Braian has 15 videos, then Bob has 15 + 5 = 20 videos.
Response:  We know that there are 27 monkeys in the world and three of them are Skoczek monkeys. Two of these Skoczek monkeys are female. Therefore, we have: Number of male Skoczek monkeys = Total number of Skoczek monkeys - Number of female Skoczek monkeys Male Skoczek monkeys = Female Skoczek monkeys Now, we can calculate the number of male Skoczek monkeys as follows: Male Skoczek monkeys = 3 (total number of Skoczek monkeys) - 2 (number of female Skoczek monkeys) = 1 So, there is one male Skoczek monkey in the world.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of goods sold (COGS) for each product:  Samples:  For the rice, the COGS is $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 per package. For the sauces, the COGS is $1.50 x 2 = $3.00 per package. For the biscuits, the COGS is $1.00 x 2 = $2.00 per package. Total COGS = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 Secondly, we need to subtract the cost of goods sold from the total revenue to get the gross profit: Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS = $20.00 - $20.00 = $0.00 Finally, we need to add the filo dough fee ($5) to the gross profit to get the total profit: Total Profit = Gross Profit + Filo Dough Fee = $0.00 + $5.00 = $5.00 So, the total cost of the paraggelia would be $5.00.
"Response:  If Mark took 75 minutes to complete the first test with 75 questions and used the same time schedule for the second test with 100 questions, then he spent:

For the first test:
Time taken = Total questions / Time per question = 75 / 5 = 15 minutes per question
So, he answered 15 x 75 = 1125 questions in total.

For the second test:
Time taken = Total questions / Time per question = 100 / 5 = 20 minutes per question
So, he answered 20 x 100 = 2000 questions in total.

Therefore, Mark left out 935 questions (2000 - 1125) from the second test."
Response:  We know that there are 22 tsp of sugar in total and we want to find out how many roses (in tsp) are equal to 12 tbsp. So, let's convert both units to the same unit, for example, from tsp to tbsp. There are 8 tbsp in 1 tsp, so: Number of roses = Total number of tsp / Number of tbsp per tsp = 22 tsp / 8 tbsp/tsp = 3 roses. Therefore, there are 3 roses equivalent to 12 tbsp of sugar.
Response:  From the given options, we know that 12 out of 20 cars are automatic, 4 are manual, and the remaining 4 are semi-automatic. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is 4/20 = 0.2 or 20%. Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the total number of cars is 20%.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and they are divided into two categories: small ones (μικρά) and big ones (βασίλισσες). The number of small bees is twice the number of big bees. So, we can write an equation: Small bees = 2 x Big bees Now, let's find out how many big bees there are: Number of big bees = Total number of bees / 2 = 700 / 2 = 350 Therefore, there are 350 big bees. Since each big bee has two smaller counterparts, the total number of small bees is also 350. So, the final answer is: Small bees = 350 + 350 = 700
Response:  The question states that Tzortan plays video games for 2 hours every day and earns $10 per hour. So, in one week (7 days), he will have earned $70 ($10/hour x 7 hours/day). Now, let's calculate how much money Tzortan would make in a month (30 days) if he continues to play video games for the same amount of time each day. In one month, Tzortan will have earned $210 ($70 x 30 days). Therefore, if Tzortan spends all his time playing video games instead of working, he would have made $210 in a month.
Response:  Jon buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, lamps for $3, fruit for $4, and cat food for $5. If there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, how much will each item cost?  To find out, we need to calculate 10% of the price of each item that is not food. So, for the milk, the calculation would be:  $2 x 0.10 = $0.20 (tax on milk) Total cost of milk = $2 + $0.20 = $2.20 For the eggs, the calculation would be: $3 x 0.10 = $0.30 (tax on eggs) Total cost of eggs = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30 For the lamps, the calculation would be: $3 x 0.10 = $0.30 (tax on lamps) Total cost of lamps = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30 For the fruit, the calculation would be: $4 x 0.10 = $0.40 (tax on fruit) Total cost of fruit = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40 For the cat food, the calculation would be: $5 x 0.10 = $0.50 (tax on cat food) Total cost of cat food = $5 + $0.50 = $5.50 Therefore, the total cost of each item after the 10% tax on non-food items is as follows: Milk: $2.20 Eggs: $3.30 Lamps: $3.30 Fruit: $4.40 Cat food: $5.50
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Kim will earn from each customer. Since he has already served three customers and is expecting to serve five more, the total amount of money he will make is:

3 x $10 = $30 + 5 x $5 = $25 = $55

So, Kim will earn a total of $55 per week. Now, let's calculate his profit. Profit equals revenue minus costs. In this case, the cost of one bucket of cleaning solution is $2, and the cost of one pack of rubber gloves is $5. So, the total cost for one customer is:

$2 + $5 = $7

Since Kim expects to serve five customers per week, the total cost for the week is:

$7 x 5 = $35

Now, let's subtract the cost from the revenue:

$55 - $35 = $20

Therefore, Kim's profit per week is $20."
Response:  We know that Jon has 10 boxes of apples with him and each box contains 100 apples. He can sell each apple for $2. So, in total, he has $200 from selling all his 10 boxes of apples. Now, we are asked how many apples Jon can buy with $200 in 3 months. To find out, let's calculate the number of days in 3 months. There are 90 days in 3 months. Therefore, Jon can buy $\frac{200}{90} = 2.2$ boxes of apples in 3 months. Since there are 100 apples in each box, Jon can buy $\frac{2.2 \times 100}{10}$ = $22$ boxes of apples in 3 months.
Response:  If Jon has 500 Lego bricks in one container and another container with 3 times more than that (i.e., 1500 Lego bricks), then he has a total of 2000 Lego bricks. Additionally, there is another container with 1/4 of the number of bricks as the other two containers combined (i.e., 750 Lego bricks). Therefore, the total number of Lego bricks Jon has is 2000 + 750 = 2750 Lego bricks.
Response:  At first, Debra sees 30 bees flying away from the spot in the first 6 hours. Then she observes that some of them return after 6 hours and others do not come back until later than that. Based on this information, we can conclude that each bee that flew away before the 6-hour mark has a probability of returning to the same spot within the next 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that returned to the spot within the last 6 hours of the day is equal to the total number of bees that flew away before the 6-hour mark minus the number of bees that did not return within the last 6 hours. So, the answer is:  Number of bees that returned = Total number of bees that fled - Number of bees that did not return within the last 6 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brittany and her mom went to the museum together. The cost of admission for adults is $12, while it is $10 for children. Since Brittany's mom gave money to the ticket vendor, we can assume that she paid for both tickets. Therefore, the total amount of money that Brittany's mom spent on their visit to the museum is $22 ($12 + $10). If Brittany received $8 in change, then she gave $14 to the ticket vendor ($22 - $8).
Response:  If Tzari has 3 more friends than Dorothy on Facebook, and Tzari has 12 friends on Facebook, then Dorothy must have 9 friends on Facebook (since 12 - 3 = 9). Therefore, Tzari has 4 more friends on Facebook than Dorothy ( since 12 > 9).
Response:  The distance between Stiv and Tim is 5 kilometers, so it takes Stiv 440 seconds to reach the school if he runs at a speed of 10 meters per second (m/s). Since Tim is 2 miles away from the school, it takes him 384 seconds to run there if he also runs at a speed of 10 m/s. Therefore, the time difference between them is: Time difference = 440 - 384 = 56 seconds. So, the winner will arrive at the school before the loser by 56 seconds.
Response:  At first, 5 people came to the beach with skateboards and spent $10 each for fuel. Therefore, they spent a total of $50. Then, three more people arrived with their own skateboards and spent $25 each for fuel. So, in total, they spent $75. Finally, one person came with a monocycle and spent $30 for fuel. Thus, the total amount spent that day was $105.
Response:  If Karl buys 10 baskets of apples and each basket contains 12 apples, then he has bought a total of 12 x 10 = 120 apples. Since each apple costs $0.10, the total cost of all the apples is 120 x $0.10 = $12. Therefore, if Karl pays with one chartomism of 10 dollars, he will get back $98 in change ($12 - $10).
Response:  When David ate 14 patatoes before he became hungry again, he had eaten half of the initial amount (since he ate 14 out of 28). Then, when he ate three more patatos after feeling hungry again, he had eaten another third (3/6) of the remaining patatos, which is 5 patatos. Finally, when a raven took two of the last five patatos, there were only three patatos left in the bag. So, to answer your question, David initially had 28 patatos in his bag, and then he ate 14 of them, leaving 28 / 2 = 14 patatos.
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, Kímo has three hours of classes each day. On Thursday and Friday, he has two hours of classes each day. In total, Kímo spends 3 + 2 = 5 hours per week in school. Since there are 16 weeks in an academic year, Kímo spends 5 x 16 = 80 hours per year in school.
Response:  The ball Bill throws has a diameter of 30 cm, so its circumference is: Circumference = π x diameter = 3.14 x 30 = 94.6 cm Now, let's calculate the area of each circle: Area of one circle = π x radius^2 = 3.14 x (4/5) = 87.1 cm^2 There are 300 circles in total, so their total area is: Total area = 300 x 87.1 = 25,130 cm^2 Next, let's calculate the length of each line segment: Length of one line segment = 2 x radius = 2 x (4/5) = 8 cm Finally, let's calculate the total length of all line segments: Total length of line segments = 300 x 8 = 2,400 cm So, if Bill throws all the balls at once from top to bottom, they will cover an area of approximately 25,130 cm^2 and a distance of approximately 2,400 cm.
"Response:  The kitten needs 200 bananas per month, the gerbil needs 400 bananas per month, and the bunny needs 100 bananas per month. Therefore, to supply all three animals with their required amount of bananas for 2 months, he will need a total of:

200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas
So, the cat needs to collect 700 bananas in total to meet the demand for 2 months."

Response:  The total cost of all the items is: 4 molybiums x $1.5 = $6  Two tetradia x $4 = $8  One chart x $20 = $20 Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 So, Ρafl has spent $34 for all the items.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Fin can see 11 cats playing in the lake. Of these, he sees 6 of them emerging from below a bush and then disappearing behind a rock. Afterwards, he sees 2 more cats hiding beneath another stone. Therefore, the number of cats that Fin can currently see in the lake is:  11 - 6 = 5 remaining cats + 2 hidden cats = 7 cats.
Response:  On Monday (Deu), the depth of water was 5 meters. On Tuesday (Triti), the depth of water increased to 7 meters. On Wednesday (Tetarti), the depth of water decreased to 9 meters. So, the depth of water on Thursday (Tetarti) is 9 meters.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Ω Nikin and Loxin went to the beach today. Ω Anakin caught 10 seagulls, 6 fish, and 3 crabs. While Loxin caught fewer seagulls than Anakin (5), fewer fish than Anakin (3), and more crabs than Anakin (2). So, in total, they could have caught 17 seagulls + 9 fish = 26 sea creatures.
Response:  The price of one sac of botanas increases by 20% every two months. So after 14 days (half of 28 days), the new price will be: $20 x 1.2 = $24. After another 14 days (total of 28 days), the new price will be: $24 x 1.2 = $28.80. Therefore, after 36 days, the price of one sac of botanas will be: $28.80 x 1.2 = $35.76.
Response:  We know that there are 5 kinky cars, 3 models, and one coupe. The coupe costs $3 action figures and one red car costs $4 dollars. So, we can write an equation as follows: Total cost = Number of toys x Cost per toy + Value of the coupe Now let's substitute the values given in the question into this equation: Total cost = (5 x $5) + ($3 x 1) = $25 + $3 = $28 Therefore, all the toys together cost $28.
Response:  If Jackie pays for her own logistics (no external help), she will have to pay $35 per hour of free time lost due to logistical issues. Since she has 3 hours of free time left, the cost would be $35 x 3 = $105. However, if she hires a logistician ($90) and they handle all the logistical issues, then Jackie won't incur any additional costs beyond what she already paid for the service. Therefore, the total amount she will have to pay is $105 + $90 = $195.
Response:  Firstly, Elvira received $1500 as a gift from her family and she believes that it will be enough to buy something expensive like a laptop. So, let's assume that she wants to spend all of this money on buying a new laptop. The cost of a new laptop can vary greatly depending on its features and brand, but let's take an average price of around $800 for now. Therefore, Elvira would have $700 left after buying a laptop.  Now, let's consider what else she might want to buy with the remaining amount of money. She mentioned wanting to buy some accessories for her new laptop, such as a mouse, keyboard, and bag. These items typically cost between $50-$100 each, so let's assume an average cost of $75 per item. This means that Elvira would need around $225 more to buy these accessories ($75 x 3 = $225).  Finally, Elvira also mentioned wanting to buy a CD player and a printer. A basic CD player can cost anywhere from $20-$50, while a printer can range from $50-$100 or even more. For simplicity, let's assume an average cost of $30 for both items. This brings the total amount needed for everything to around $335 ($225 + $110).  In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, Elvira would have $335 left after buying a new laptop, accessories, and other items.
Response:  The Santra gives 9 eggs to their daughter every time they make breakfast. To make Spanish omelette (flan), it needs 3 eggs. If Sandra has the mission to make 15 Spanish omelettes for her school event, how many times does she need to make an egg dish?
"Response:  If Seth is 2 years old now and in 2 years he will be 28 years old, then:

Age of Seth = Now (2) + Future Age (2 x 2 = 4) = 6

So, the age of Seth is 6 years old."
Response:  The total amount of money that Jim has is $10 more than twice the number of dollars he has in cash. So if Jim has $8 in cash, then the total amount of money he has is $10 + ($8 x 2) = $10 + $16 = $26. Therefore, Jim has $26.
"Response:  We know that Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day, except for Saturday when he only walks 10 miles. So in one week, he walks a total of:

30 km/day x 7 days = 210 km/week

So, in one month (which is 4 weeks), he walks a total of:

210 km/week x 4 weeks = 840 km/month"
Response:  The orchid sells for $25 per stem, and each stem has three petals that cost $3 more than the stem itself. Therefore, the total cost of one stalk is: $25 + ($3 x 3) = $31. So, the total cost of all the stolikes (stems plus petals) is: $31 x 4 = $124.
Response:  The first group of creatures (80 arachnids) has 8 legs each, so there are 8 x 80 = 640 legs in total.  For the second group (90 entomologists), we have to count the number of legs for each person and then multiply it by the number of people. Each entomologist has 6 legs, so there are 90 x 6 = 540 legs from this group. Finally, we have 3 spiders with 10 legs each, giving us an additional 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs that Tjeik sees is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1470 legs.
Response:  The first part of the question is asking about the number of dogs in Camp Out. According to the passage, there are four dogs at Camp Out, and Salli Dyo is three years older than Renny. Therefore, if Salli Dyo is three years older than Renny, then Renny is two years younger than Salli Dyo. So, the total age of all five dogs (including Renny) is 2 + 3 = 5 years old.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Tzesika has available for repayment each month. We know that her student loans have an interest rate of 3%, and she makes payments of $1,000 per month. Therefore, her total monthly payment is:

$1,000 x (1 + 0.03) = $1,030

Now, let's assume that Tzesika wants to repay 50% of her debt each year. To do this, she needs to make additional payments of $515 ($1,030 x 0.5) each month. So, her new total monthly payment will be:

$1,030 + $515 = $1,545

Finally, if Tzesika continues making these extra payments for one year, she will have paid off half of her debt. Specifically, she will have paid off $765 ($1,545 x 0.5), leaving her with a remaining balance of $765."
Response:  The Bilby needs to dig and collect food for its babies, which will take about 30 minutes per patata (assuming an average size of 1 kg). Since it takes about 2 hours for the Bilby to dig one patata, it means that it needs to spend about 60 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to gather enough food for its babies. However, since the Bilby can only spend about 5 minutes at a time digging, it would need to make around 12 trips to the garden to gather enough food (12 x 5 = 60 minutes). Therefore, the Bilby would need approximately 60 minutes to prepare enough food for its babies.
Response:  Firstly, they sell each lemon for $3 and each orange for $2. So, if they sell 20 lemons and 10 oranges, their total revenue will be: Lemons: 20 x $3 = $60 Oranges: 10 x $2 = $20 Total Revenue: $80 Now, let's calculate their cost of goods sold (COGS). They buy each lemon for $0.50 and each orange for $0.40. So, their COGS will be: Lemons: 20 x $0.50 = $10 Oranges: 10 x $0.40 = $4 Total COGS: $14 Now, we need to subtract their COGS from their total revenue to find out their profit: Profit = Total Revenue - COGS = $80 - $14 = $66 Therefore, they made a profit of $66 selling 20 lemons and 10 oranges.
Response:  We know that there were 240 participants in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160. Since we are asked for the number of girls among the Chinese participants, we can say that the proportion of girls among the Chinese participants is the same as the overall proportion of girls in the competition, which is 50%. Therefore, the number of girls among the Chinese participants is 160 x 50% = 80.
Response:  Firstly, Zain is giving away $200 to his daughter for her monthly expenses and $700 to his wife for their living expenses. So far, he has given away $900. Then, if he wins $6,000 in the lottery, how much money will he have left after all these expenditures?  Therefore, Zain will have $5,100 ($6,000 - $900) left after all these expenses.
Response:  The Ran has more than Moni and less than Bo. If Bo has 40 caviar, then the total number of caviar that the three have is: Total = (Ran's caviar) + (Moni's caviar) + (Bo's caviar) = 10 + x + 40 =? where x is the amount of caviar that Moni has. Since Moni has fewer caviar than Ran, x < 10. Therefore, the total number of caviar that the three have is:? = 10 + x + 40 = 50.
Response:  The first two weeks of school are 2 x 5 = 10 hours long and 2 x 8 = 16 hours long, respectively. So, in total, Linos has attended 10 + 16 = 26 hours of math classes during the first two weeks of school. Therefore, he has earned $26 \times 10 = $260.
Response:  We know that there are two candidates running for class president of Sarai School and they received 3/4 and 1/4 of the total votes respectively. The total number of students who voted in the election was 80. So we can write an equation to represent this situation as follows: 3/4 x + 1/4 y = 80 where x represents the number of votes obtained by candidate A and y represents the number of votes obtained by candidate B. Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of both candidates' votes is equal to the total number of votes cast. Therefore, we have: 3/4 x + 1/4 y = 80 Subtracting 1/4 y from both sides gives us: 3/4 x = 72 Divide both sides by 3/4 to get our final answer: x = 56 So, candidate A received 56 votes out of a total of 80 votes cast in the election.
Response:  The Sandra ordered 7 times more red trumpets than white garlic cloves from Frank. Specifically, she ordered 492 red trumpets and 60 white garlic cloves. Additionally, she requested that Frank deliver 200 rose bushes, which were five times more than the white garlic cloves. Sandra threatened to replace her agent if the missing red trumpets did not arrive by 5 pm. To calculate how many red trumpets Frank needs to deliver until 5 pm, we need to divide the total number of red trumpets by 5. Therefore, Frank needs to deliver 98 red trumpets (492 / 5) before 5 pm.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:

1. The age of Mark was 5 years more than Jan's age before two years ago. So, if Jan is currently 30 years old, then Mark was 30 + 5 = 35 years old before two years ago.
2. Now, we are told that Mark was 5 years older than Jan before two years ago, so Mark's age at that time was 35 + 5 = 40 years old.
3. Therefore, the current age of Jan (30 years) minus the age of Mark (40 years) gives us the difference between their ages now: 30 - 40 = -10 years.
So, the correct answer is -10 years."
Response:  The first race will be 400 meters long and each member of both teams will run it in exactly 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the first team to complete the race will be: Time = Number of members x Race distance / Race time per member = 8 x 400 m / 55 s = 1290 s (or 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 30 seconds) Now, let's calculate the time for the second team to complete the race: Since the second team is less well-trained than the first one, their running speed will decrease gradually over the course of the race. Specifically, they will run the first 200 meters in 30 seconds faster than the first team, then they will slow down by 10 seconds per 100 meters until they finish the race in exactly 60 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the second team to complete the race will be: Time = Number of members x Race distance / Race time per member = 6 x 400 m / (30 + (10/100) x (distance - 200 m)) = 1080 s (or 1 hour, 48 minutes, and 40 seconds) Comparing these times, we can see that the fastest team will finish the race in 1290 seconds, while the slower team will take 1080 seconds to complete it. So, the difference between the two times is 210 seconds or 3 minutes, 30 seconds.
Response:  If Jerry can throw a dart with 6 legs and hit a target with 12 segments, then he has a probability of hitting each segment equal to 1/12. Now, if we give him two darts with 4 legs each, he will have a total of 8 legs to throw (4 + 4). So, his probability of hitting any one of the 12 segments is now (1/12)^2 = 1/96. Therefore, the number of throws required for Jerry to hit a target with more than 3 segments is at least 96.
Response:  Jenny and her mother picked some apples from their orchard. Jenny picked half of the apples (10). So, her mother had 20 - 10 = 10 apples left. Therefore, Jenny and her mother together picked 10 + 10 = 20 apples.
Response:  There are 10 clubs with 4 players each, so there are 40 players in total. Each player has to hit 6 balls into each hole, and since there are 18 holes in total, each player needs to hit 108 balls (6 x 18). Since there are no golfers who can use more than one ball at a time, we need to divide this number by the number of golfers, which is 40. Therefore, each golfer hits an average of 2.7 balls per hole (108 / 40 = 2.7).
Response:  The amount of money that Mani owes to Benny is $100. They agreed that they would pay interest at an annual rate of 2%. If it takes Mani more than 3 months to pay back the loan, how much will he have to give to Benny?  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for calculating simple interest: Simple Interest = Principal x Rate x Time Where: Principal = $100 Rate = 2%/year (or $2/month) Time = number of months taken to pay back the loan In this case, Mani took 3 months to pay back the loan, so the time is 3 months. Plugging in the values, we get: Simple Interest = $100 x ($2/month) x 3 months = $60 So, Mani has to give $60 to Benny as interest.
Response:  The trader buys each sack of wheat from the farmer for $20 per sack. If it costs him $2 to transport each sack from the farm to his warehouse, and he has sold all the sacks at a price of $30 per sack, how many sacks did he sell?  We can start by calculating the total cost of transportation: $2 x number of sacks = $2 x 100 sacks (since he bought 100 sacks) = $200 So, his profit is: $400 - $200 = $200 He sold 100 sacks of wheat.
Response:  Firstly, three friends spent €20.25 for three meals at the tavern. Additionally, they spent €4.50 less than for food because they had a discount of 10%. Therefore, the total amount they spent for food was €15.75. Next, they went to two different places that cost €33 each, making a total of €66. Lastly, if they decided to share everything equally among themselves, each person would have paid €20.83 (€66 / 3).
Response:  Jon has been working for 3 hours and he can dig two holes in that time. So, after 3 hours of work, Jon will have dug 6 holes (2 x 3 = 6). Therefore, Jon has 6 rodakins.
Response:  The papas need to eat 1.5 kilograms of meat per day to survive. If there are ten papas, how many kilograms of meat do they need in total?
Response:  Tom starts with 50 trees and every year he loses 2/3 of his trees (i.e., 2/3 × 50 = 33 trees). So after 10 years, he has 50 - 33 = 17 trees left. Now, we are told that after another 10 years, 30% of the remaining trees have died. This means that 30% of 17 trees is equal to 5 trees (since 30% of a number is always less than the original number). Therefore, after 20 years, Tom has 17 - 5 = 12 trees left.
Response:  On Friday morning, the neighbors threw 18 red plastic flamingos into Su's yard. On Saturday morning, they took back the third one that had just been painted white and threw it away again. So, in total, how many more red plastic flamingos were outside Su's house on Sunday compared to Friday?
Response:  The Biolita wants to buy 5 different colored mollies and has budgeted $20 for this purchase. Each molly costs $2. How many mollies can she afford?  We can calculate this as follows: Number of mollies = Budget / Cost per molly = $20 / $2 = 10 mollies So, Biolita will be able to afford 10 mollies.
Response:  The cost of one molly is $1.20 and the cost of one skupee is $0.30. Therefore, the total cost of 8 stylos would be: 8 x $1.20 = $9.60 + $0.30 x 8 = $2.40 = $11.70
"Response:  We have:
Total weight of carrots = 200 kg
Number of estiatórios = 40
Each estiatório will receive = 2 kg/estiatório
So, total weight received by each estiatório = 2 x 40 = 80 kg
Now we subtract the amount that won't be used = 200 - 80 = 120 kg
Therefore, 120 kg of carrots will not be used."
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 residents in Sodom. Among them, there are 8417 males and 9092 females. The remaining population consists of children. How many children live in Sodom?
Response:  In the first month, Eleni had 20 Pokemon cards and added three times to it, so she had 60 cards in total. In the second month, she subtracted 20 cards from the previous amount, leaving her with 40 cards. In the third month, she added the number of cards she had in the first two months together, which is 80 cards + 40 cards = 120 cards. Therefore, Eleni has 120 Pokemon cards in total.
Response:  The Mark travels every day for two publishers (A and B) and receives $5 per proposal from Publisher A and $2 per proposal from Publisher B. Since he makes 1000 proposals each month, in one week he will make 143 proposals (1000 / 7 = 143). So, in one week, Mark earns $795 ($5 x 143 proposals from Publisher A + $2 x 143 proposals from Publisher B).
Response:  The Balnurt takes 5 cups of water every morning and 6 cups of water every evening. If each cup contains 5 liters of water, how much water does Balnurt take in total? So, we have to find out the total number of liters of water that Balnurt takes per day. To do this, we multiply the number of cups he takes per day (morning + evening) by the amount of water in each cup. Therefore, the total number of liters of water taken by Balnurt per day is: 5 cups/day x 5 liters/cup = 25 liters/day + 6 cups/day x 5 liters/cup = 30 liters/day = 55 liters/day.
Response:  Jon receives $5000 as an award and gets a 5% increase in his salary every year. If he works for 10 years and receives the award at the beginning of each year, how much money did he make during those 10 years? We can calculate this using the formula: Total amount = (Initial amount x Increase rate) x Number of years So, total amount = ($5000 x 5%) x 10 = $25,000 Therefore, during those 10 years, Jon made a total of $25,000.
Response:  The total number of stalks is 10, and each stalk produces 5 tons of wheat per year. Therefore, the total amount of wheat produced by all stalks in one year is:  10 stalks x 5 tons/stalk = 50 tons of wheat/year Now, let's calculate how many barrels of wine are produced from these 50 tons of wheat:  Each ton of wheat produces 2 barrels of wine (as given in the problem). So, the total number of barrels of wine produced from 50 tons of wheat is:  50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine/year
Response:  The man loved tyrı and used it every day for breakfast. He made sandwiches with two slices of tyrı each day and added eggs for three days in a row using one slice above the egg mixture. On the fourth day, he made a large pie from macaroni and tyrı to have enough food for the week and used eight slices of tyrı in that. So, he used a total of 16 slices of tyrı (2 x 2 x 3 + 8).
Response:  Initially, Tzane had 22 purple and 10 pink styloids. After buying 6 blue and 2 red styloids, she had 38 styloids in total. Since each blue styloid has 9 styloids inside it, and each red styloid has 6 styloids inside it, we can calculate the number of styloids Tzane has now as follows: Number of blue styloids = 6 x 9 = 54 Number of red styloids = 2 x 6 = 12 Total number of styloids = 54 + 12 = 66 Therefore, Tzane currently has 66 styloids.
"Response:  The teacher gives Bert five tests with different scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To get an average score of at least 93 in the last test, Bert needs to have a score that is as close as possible to 93 minus his current total score. So, he needs to find the missing number.

Solution:
Let's calculate the total score of Bert so far:
Total Score = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 548
Now, let's find out how many points Bert needs to get to reach an average score of 93 in the last test:
Missing Score = Total Score - 93 = 548 - 93 = 455
Therefore, Bert needs to get a score of 455 in the last test to achieve an average score of at least 93."
Response:  On Monday, he ran 25 kilometers. On Tuesday, he did not run at all. On Wednesday, he ran again and covered 30 kilometers. He repeated this pattern for seven days in total. So, on the seventh day (Sunday), he ran 20 kilometers. Therefore, in total, Michael ran 190 kilometers (25 + 30 + 20 = 190).
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolates and 80 cherries in Tzo's sack. Each chocolate contains two halves of a cherry, so we have a total of 50 half-cherries inside the sack (25 chocolates x 2 halves per chocolate = 50 half-cherries). Now, each half-cherry has 40 grams of sugar, so the total amount of sugar in Tzo's sack is 50 half-cherries x 40 grams/half-cherry = 2000 grams of sugar. Therefore, the answer is 2000 grams.
Response:  On Wednesday (Day 1), Rooz went to the store and bought 4 keys. On Thursday (Day 2), she went to another store and bought three times as many keys as she bought on Wednesday. Finally, on Friday (Day 3), she went to yet another store and bought five times as many keys as she bought on Thursday. So, how many keys did Rooz buy in total?  To find this out, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that Rooz bought 4 keys on Wednesday, then she bought 3 x 4 = 12 keys on Thursday, and finally she bought 5 x 12 = 60 keys on Friday. Therefore, the total number of keys Rooz bought is 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 keys.
Response:  The cost of one flipper is $1,200 less than the total cost of all flippers sold for $6,000 each. So, we can write an equation as follows: Cost of one flipper = Total cost of all flippers - $6,000 x Number of flippers sold Now, we need to find out how many flippers are sold. According to the question, the total cost of all flippers is $6,000, and there are 6,000 flippers in total. Therefore, we can plug these values into our equation to solve for the number of flippers sold: Cost of one flipper = $6,000 - ($6,000 x 6,000) = $6,000 - $36,000 = -$30,000 Number of flippers sold = $6,000 / Cost of one flipper = 6,000 / (-$30,000) = 200 flippers sold So, there are 200 flippers sold. To calculate the average cost per flipper, we divide the cost of one flipper by the number of flippers sold: Average cost per flipper = Cost of one flipper / Number of flippers sold = $1,200 / 200 = $6 per flipper
Response:  Firstly, Sara wants to buy a bouffant and two pairs of pumps for $30 each, so in total she needs $90. Then, her grandmothers give her $4 per time she takes care of them, which means she earns $4 x 4 = $16 in total. Therefore, Sara still needs $90 - $16 = $74 to buy the bouffant and pumps. If she already has $10 saved up before starting to take care of her grandmothers, then she only needs to work $74 / $10 = 7 times to save enough money to buy the bouffant and pumps.
Response:  The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and the white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. So, in total, Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has more than two white chickens above the red ones, how many red chickens does he have? We can assume that the number of white chickens is x. Then, the number of red chickens = 42 / (3 + 5x). Solving for x, we get x = 10. Therefore, Jerry has 10 red chickens.
Response:  The distance traveled is given as 5 kilometers and the time taken to travel that distance is also given as 1 hour and 30 minutes (or 90 minutes). To find out how many hours Garry walked in total, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, the speed of Garry is 1.5 meters per minute, so: Distance = 1.5 m/min x 90 min = 135 meters per minute. Now, since Garry walked for 1 hour and 30 minutes, he walked a total distance of: Total distance = 135 m/min x 75 min = 9750 meters. Therefore, Garry walked a total distance of 9750 meters in 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Response:  On day 1, Slone measured 100 customers at the store. The next day, he measured 50 more customers above that number (i.e., 50 + 100 = 150 customers). If the total number of customers up to day 3 was 500, then how many customers did Slone measure on day 3?
Response:  At first, both pails had equal amounts of water (4 gallons). Then, in a short time (less than 4 minutes), the large pail gained more water from the small pail. So, after 4 minutes, the large pail had 7 times as much water as the small pail. Therefore, the amount of water the small pail has now is:  4 gallons x (1 / 7) = 0.57 gallons
Response:  Lorri wants to buy an electric fan worth $320 and a matching pillow that costs $32. Her work pays her $8 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work before she can afford the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then divide it by the amount she earns per hour. The total cost of the items is: Electric fan = $320 Pillow = $32 Total cost = $352 Now, let's divide the total cost by the number of hours Lorri works per day: Number of hours worked per day =? (based on the information provided) If Lorri works for 8 hours per day, she will need to work for: Number of hours worked = $352 / $8 per hour = 44 days (rounded up to the nearest whole number) Therefore, Lorri needs to work for 44 days before she can afford to buy the electric fan and the matching pillow.
Response:  Tzanet has borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay it back with an additional 10% interest after one year. If he pays $165 per month for 12 months, we can calculate how much he will owe at that point using the formula: Total amount owed = Initial amount + Interest + Monthly payments - Amount paid so far. So, plugging in the numbers, we get: Total amount owed = $2,000 + ($2,000 x 10%) + ($165 x 12) - $165 = $2,394. Therefore, Tzanet still owes $394 until the end of the period.
Response:  We know that there are 4 triangles in the base and 7 more than triangles above it. So, the total number of triangles in the bazo is:  Total number of triangles = Number of triangles in the base + (Number of triangles above it - 4)  Substituting the values given in the question, we get:  Total number of triangles = 4 + (7 - 4)  = 13  Therefore, there are 13 triangles in the bazo syolically.
Response:  The age of Andria is three times greater than the age of Charity, and Charity is half the age of Zak. If Charity is currently 21 years old, then in three years, her age will be: 3 x (current age) = 3 x 21 = 63 years old. Therefore, the median age of the three is 63 years old.
Response:  The total number of points scored is given as 251. Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score. Therefore, Yuri scored 68 + (10/2) = 78 points.  Brana scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brana scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Finally, Toto scored 251 - (68 + 78 + 85) = 94 points.
Response:  The Carmen needs 10 minutes to complete one staurolux and 5 minutes to complete one suntoku. The Sabato Kyriaakos completed 3 staurolexes and 8 suntoku in 3 hours. Therefore, the time taken by Carmen to complete one staurolex is: Time = Number of staurolexes / Speed (in minutes per staurolex) = 10 / 5 = 2 minutes per staurolex And the time taken by Carmen to complete one suntoku is: Time = Number of suntoku / Speed (in minutes per suntoku) = 5 / 5 = 1 minute per suntoku So, Carmen took 2 minutes to complete one staurolex and 1 minute to complete one suntoku.
Response:  At first, Selina had 120 liters of water in her container. She used 90 liters to irrigate her small garden and then she had 30 liters left (120 - 90 = 30). So now there are 30 liters of water remaining in the container.

Response:  Karlos earns $30 per hour and Bentzi earns $18 per hour. If Karlos uses his shovel for 3 hours and Bentzi uses his plan for 5 hours, their total earnings will be:  Karlos's earnings = $30 x 3 hours = $90  Bentzi's earnings = $18 x 5 hours = $90 So they will both earn the same amount of money, which is $90.
Response:  If he travels for 6 days with a car and driver from New York to Los Angeles, then he will spend 6 days x $100 per day = $600 for transportation costs. Additionally, if he spends 2 days driving from New York to Los Angeles, then he will spend 2 days x $50 per day = $100 for fuel costs. Therefore, in total, he will spend $700 for his trip.
Response:  If Jim measures 30 feet of fabric and buys 14 feet more, he will have 44 feet of fabric in total (30 + 14 = 44). Now, let's assume that half of the fabric is waterproof (17 feet or 56 inches), which means that the other half is not waterproof (27 feet or 94 inches). So, if 8 feet of non-waterproof fabric are removed from the total amount, there will be 36 feet (or 112 inches) left (27 - 8 = 36). Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected piece of fabric will be waterproof is 36/44 = 0.81 (or 81%).

When he returned two weeks later, 75% of the remaining carrots (or 90 out of 120) were ready to be harvested. So, the number of carrots that weren't ready for harvesting after those two additional weeks is:  90 - 30 = 60
Response:  Mark buys 12 cars for his company and pays $20,000 each. This means he paid a total of $240,000 ($20,000 x 12). He also pays 10% of the price of each car, which is $20,000 ( $20,000 x 12 = $240,000). So, in total, Mark pays $260,000 ($240,000 + $20,000) for all 12 cars.
Response:  On Monday (day 1), Kaíli and Rombert collect seashells equally. Therefore, Kaíli collected 5 more shells than Rombert, who collected 20 shells. On Tuesday (day 2), Kaíli collected twice as many sand dollars as she did on Monday. So, Kaíli collected 4 times as many sand dollars as Rombert, who collected 0 sand dollars on Tuesday. Therefore, Kaíli collected 80 sand dollars on Tuesday.
Response:  If there were 50 myrmecia in the garden and each one collected 3 fruits, then we have: Number of fruits collected = Number of myrmecia x Number of fruits per myrmecia Total number of fruits collected = 50 x 3 = 150 fruits.

"Response:  Stib has decided to eat more tomatoes and wants to know how many apples he needs to buy to get 3 tomato seeds per day for 6 days. So, we need to calculate:
Number of apples = Number of tomato seeds / Number of tomatoes needed per day
= 3 / 1 (since he needs one tomato seed per day)
= 3 apples
Therefore, if an apple can produce 3 tomato seeds in a week, then Stib needs 3 apples to produce 3 tomato seeds per day for 6 days."
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and Jon wants to make sure each one has at least 4 servings of pizza. Since the pizzas can only be sold in 8 sections, we need to divide the total number of pizzas by 8 to find out how many Jon needs to sell. So, Jon needs to sell 25 pizzas (20 friends x 4 servings per friend / 8 sections).

Response:  We know that initially there were 1000 students in the school and after the incident, 30% of them left through door A, 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, and the rest (the remaining 2/5) left through door C. So, we can write an equation based on this information as follows: Number of students who left through door C = Total number of students - Number of students who left through door A x 30% - Number of students who left through door B x (3/5) - Number of students who remained in the building = 1000 - 300 x 30% - 200 x (3/5) = 400 Now, let's calculate the number of students who left through door C: Number of students who left through door C = Total number of students - Number of students who left through door A x 30% - Number of students who left through door B x (3/5) = 400 - 300 x 30% - 200 x (3/5) = 400 - 90 x 30% - 60 x (3/5) = 400 - 90 x 30% - 60 x (3/5) = 240 Therefore, the number of students who left through door C is 240.
Response:  We know that Τζέιμς has 6 more sweets than Ρόμπερτ. So, if Τζον has 54 candies, he must have more than Τζέιμς. Therefore, the answer is: More than 6 = 54 - 6 = 48
Response:  Since Δόλι has two books and Πανδώρα has one book, they will have read a total of 3 books (2 + 1) until the end.
Response:  The number of letters in each message is given as 20 (since each letter has 20 letters). Since there are five people and they send one message per week, we have 5 x 1 = 5 messages per week. Each message takes 6 minutes to write, so the total time spent writing messages for all five people is 5 x 6 = 30 minutes per week. Therefore, the number of hours spent writing messages for all five people is 30/60 = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes per week.
"Response:  The program has 1000 minutes in total, and each day has 15 minutes of phone calls with an average duration of 30 seconds per call (since there are 20 calls per day). So, the total time spent on phone calls for one month is:

$$ \text {Total time spent on phone calls} = \frac{1000 \times 15}{60} = 2500 \text{ minutes} $$

Now, let's calculate how much time Tjeison spends on phone calls during a month:

$$ \text {Time spent by Tjeison on phone calls} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} $$

So, Tjeison spends approximately 5 hours on phone calls every month."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Γκρίφιν (Griffin) had 24 patties initially. Then, Káil (Kyle) took 5 of them. Next, Bil (Bill) got some of Káil's patties. Finally, Jenzer (Jenny) gave Griffin one of her patties back, and Colmbi (Colby) took 3 fewer patties from Griffin than he gave to Káil. So, if at the end of the story Griffin had 27 patties, then Jenzer gave him 3 more patties than she took away from him. Therefore, the number of patties Jenzer gave to Griffin is 3 + 3 = 6.
Response:  We have four swallows in one pond and 32 swallows in another pond. The difference between the number of swallows in the two ponds is due to the amount of food available and the two ponds. If both ponds have the same number of fish, how many swallows are there in each pond?  So, if we have x swallows in the first pond and y swallows in the second pond, then the total number of swallows is x + y.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much time Jins spends working each day. Since she works for 8 hours per day and needs to work 6 hours per day to complete her task in 5 weeks, we can calculate that she spends 137.5 hours (8 hours/day x 6 days/week) working each week. Therefore, she spends a total of 687.5 hours (137.5 hours/week x 5 weeks) working during the entire period.  Next, we need to calculate how much money Jins earns from her work. According to the problem statement, Jins earns $250 per hour worked. So, if she works for 687.5 hours, she will earn a total of $169,375 ($250/hour x 687.5 hours).  Finally, we need to calculate the percentage increase in Jins' income after completing the movie. As stated in the problem, Jins receives a 10% increase in pay due to the quality of her work. To find out how much this increase is worth, we divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked and multiply it by 10%.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Izzabella spent $12 for her sister's makeup, $43 for gifts, $15 for haircuts and styling, $4 for invitations, and $22 for decorations and party favors. In total, she spent $78. Now, let's divide this amount among the three parties involved: Izzabella herself, her mother, and her father. Since they are equally responsible for the cost, each of them will pay $26. So, the answer is $26 x 3 = $78.
Response:  The seal bought 4 barrels of oil at $1.5 per kilogram. So, he paid for each barrel as follows:  Number of barrels = 4 Barrel volume = 4 x 50 kg/barrel = 200 kg Oil cost = 200 kg x $1.5/kg = $300 Therefore, the seal spent $300 to buy the 4 barrels of oil.
Response:  On Tuesday, Su had eaten 4 times more than her sister. If Su had eaten 4 times more than her sister, then her sister had eaten x = 4/4 = 1 moussaka.  On Wednesday, Su had eaten twice as much as her sister (since she had eaten 5 moussakas and her sister had eaten 1). So, Su had eaten 2x = 5 moussakas. In total, Su had eaten 2 + 5 = 7 moussakas more than her sister.
