Response:  Janet makes $32 per day at the farmers' market ($2 x 16 eggs).
"Response:  To find the total number of bolts needed, we need to calculate the amount of each type of fiber required for one robe. Since a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, we can write this as:

Number of blue fibers = 2
Half Number of white fibers = 0.5

Now, let's assume that the robe requires x bolts of fiber altogether. We know that the total number of blue fibers is 2, so the number of white fibers must be equal to half that value minus 2:

Number of white fibers = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for one robe is:

x = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5

So, it takes 3.5 bolts of fiber to make one robe."

"Response:  To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we can use the following formula:
Cost = (Price of one glass x Number of glasses) + (Price of one glass x Number of glasses / 2)
First, let's calculate the cost of one glass:
Cost of one glass = $5
Now, let's calculate the cost of each additional glass:
Cost of each additional glass = ($5 x 60%) = $3
So, the total cost of 16 glasses is:
Total cost = (Price of one glass x Number of glasses) + (Price of one glass x Number of glasses / 2)
= ($5 x 16) + ($5 x 16 / 2)
= $80 + $10
= $90
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $90 for 16 glasses."

Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694
Therefore, the total cost of the pastries is $694."
"Response:  To calculate how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider two factors: (1) the initial investment in planting the tree, and (2) the annual costs of caring for the tree.

Initial Investment: $90
Annual Costs: $3 + ($1.5 x 7) = $3 + $10.5 = $13.5 per year

To determine when Carlos will start earning money, we subtract the annual costs from the revenue generated by the tree:
Yearly Revenue = $1.5 x 7 = $10.5
Yearly Profit = $10.5 - $13.5 = -$3

Since Carlos is not making any profit in the first year, we can say that it will take one year for him to start earning money from his lemon tree. Therefore, the answer is:
Years until profitable = 1

Note: This calculation assumes that the tree grows at a constant rate throughout its life and that there are no other external factors affecting its growth or productivity."
Response:  Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners (5 - 3/4 = 15).
"Response:  To find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to calculate the total number of students who did not enroll in contemporary or jazz dance. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students (20%) and then subtracting the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining amount (25%). Finally, we divide the result by the total number of students to get the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance. Here is how you would solve it step by step:
1. Calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 = 4
2. Calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance: 25% of the remaining students = 15 (since 80 - 4 = 75)
3. Calculate the total number of students who did not enroll in contemporary or jazz dance: Total - Contemporary - Jazz = 20 - 4 - 15 = 11
4. Calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance: 11/20 x 100 = 55%
Therefore, 55% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."

Therefore, the profit for the merchant if he chooses the jewelry option is $1,085."
Response:  Let's assume that the speed of the first train is x mph and the second train is y mph. We can use the formula d = rt to find the total distance traveled by each train in the two days: For the first train: d1 = x(80) + (y/2)(150) = 4x + 75 For the second train: d2 = y(80) + (x/2)(150) = 3y + 75 Now we need to find the value of x and y such that the distance covered by each train on the second day is equal to the distance covered by each train on the first day. Solving this equation, we get: x = 60 and y = 40 So the distance covered by the first train in the two days is 4x + 75 = 4(60) + 75 = 240 miles And the distance covered by the second train in the two days is 3y + 75 = 3(40) + 75 = 140 miles. Therefore, the answer is: Distance covered by the first train in the two days = 240 miles Distance covered by the second train in the two days = 140 miles
Response:  Jill's annual salary is $48,000 (20 x 50 weeks) + $45,000 (30 x 35 hours/week) = $93,000.
Response:  To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she eats per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelette every morning, she eats 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Therefore, she will eat 21 x 28 = 568 eggs in 4 weeks. So, Claire will eat 568 / 12 = 48 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.
Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance is 12 miles and the time taken so far is 3 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles + 1 hour for the next 2 miles). So, Marissa's average speed needed to complete the remaining distance of 6 miles is: Average Speed = 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 miles/hour.

Here's how I arrived at that answer:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of servings of ice cream that Cynthia will eat over the course of 60 days:

1 serving/night x 60 nights = 60 servings
2. Next, we can calculate the total cost of ice cream that Cynthia will spend over 60 days by multiplying the number of servings by the cost per serving:

$4.00/carton x 60 servings = $240
3. Therefore, the answer to the question is $240."
Response:  The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 30 miles (20 + 15).
"Response:  The answer can be found by using the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Gloria has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels.
2. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost five dollars less than the boots.
3. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much (i.e., $66).
4. Therefore, the boots cost $X + ($33 + $66) = $99.
5. Since the total cost of the three options is $104, we know that X + ($33 + $66) = $104.
6. Solving for X, we get:
X = $99 - ($33 + $66) = $99 - $99 = $0.
7. So, the boots cost $0.

Therefore, the answer is $0."

"Response:  Mike scored a total of 79 points in the 40 minutes he played ping pong. Here's how we can calculate this:

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored an average of 0.2 points per minute (4/20).

In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes, which means he scored (1.25 x 0.2) = 0.25 points per minute more than in the first 20 minutes. So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored a total of:

0.2 points per minute x 20 minutes = 4 points

Adding the points from both periods, we get:

4 + 4 = 8 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 8 points in the 40 minutes he played ping pong."
Response:  Terry spends $15.00 on yogurt over 30 days ($5.00 per yogurt x 30 days).
Response:  John still has 7 Lego sets after selling all of them.
"Response:  John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour (mph).

Here's how you can arrive at this answer:

* Total distance ran by John in a week = 60 miles
* Number of days John runs per week = 3
* Time taken to run each day = Half of the total time spent running (as given in the problem)

So, on the first day, John runs for 3 hours, which means he covers a distance of 3 x 30/60 = 20 miles.
On the second and third days, John runs for half the time taken on the first day, i.e., 30 minutes each day. So, the distance covered on these two days is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mph x 30 min = 3 miles per day

Now, let's calculate the total distance ran by John in a week:
Total distance = Distance ran on each day x Number of days = 20 miles + 3 miles + 3 miles = 56 miles

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour (mph)."
"Response: 60 miles

Answer:
Let's assume that Dana runs for x hours and walks for (6 - x) hours. Since she can run four times faster than she can walk, we know that her rate of travel while running is 4x miles/hour, and her rate of travel while walking is x miles/hour.

We are given that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, so her rate of travel while skipping is 2x miles/hour.

Since Dana skis for 3 miles per hour, we can set up the following equation:

Runnning = 4x miles/hour
Walking = x miles/hour
Skipping = 2x miles/hour

Solving for x, we get:

x = 60 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 60 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking."
Response: 4 * (Ben's age of iPhone) = Brandon's iPhone age.
Response:  To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin. We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for 400 feet (the distance to the dragon). When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin an additional 3 times farther = 3 x 400 = 1200 feet. Therefore, the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone is 1200 - 400 = 800 feet. So, if Polly stands at least 800 feet away from the dragon when holding the gemstone, she will be able to hit it with the gold javelin.
Response:  The number of pieces taken by the guests is 7 (14 - 5 = 7).
"Response:  To calculate the number of grams of chips that you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a single serving of chips, we need to use the following formula:

Number of grams = Daily calorie target / Number of calories per serving

In this case, your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and each serving of chips contains 250 calories. Therefore, you can eat:

Number of grams = 2000 / 250 = 800 grams

So, you can eat up to 800 grams of chips if your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories."
"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. Since each candle weighs 10 grams, we can calculate this as follows:

1 lb = 453.6 g (conversion factor)
10 g / 453.6 g = 0.022 pounds (or 22 grams)

So, with one pound of beeswax, Charlie can make approximately 22 candles.

To determine the total cost of making these candles, we add up the cost of the beeswax and the wicks:

Cost of beeswax = $10.00 per pound x 1 pound = $10.00
Cost of wicks = $10.00 per pack x number of wicks needed = $10.00
Total cost = $20.00

Now, let's calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the sale price of each candle:

Net profit = $2.00 per candle - $20.00 (total cost) = $18.00 per 20 candles sold

Therefore, Charlie's net profit would be $18.00 if he makes and sells 20 candles using one pound of beeswax and ten wicks."
"Response:  To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information provided in the question.

Day 1 (Monday):
Number of articles written = 5
Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
Total time spent writing articles on Monday = 5 x 4 = 20 hours

Day 2 (Tuesday):
Number of articles written = 2/5 x Number of articles written on Monday
= 2/5 x 5 = 3 articles
Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
Total time spent writing articles on Tuesday = 3 x 4 = 12 hours

Day 3 (Wednesday):
Number of articles written = 2 x Number of articles written on Tuesday
= 2 x 12 = 24 articles
Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
Total time spent writing articles on Wednesday = 24 x 4 = 96 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
20 + 12 + 96 = 138 hours."

"Response:  The time it takes for Tom to get back depends on the distance he traveled during each leg of his journey.

During the first leg, Tom traveled at a rate of 10 miles per hour for 5 hours (from 1 to 4 PM). Therefore, he traveled a total distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 5 hours = 50 miles

During the second leg, Tom traveled at a rate of 6 miles per hour for 2 hours (from 4 to 6 PM). Therefore, he traveled a total distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 6 miles/hour x 2 hours = 12 miles

To find the total time it took Tom to get back, we need to add the distances he traveled during each leg:

Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2 = 50 miles + 12 miles = 62 miles

And finally, we can divide the total distance by his speed during each leg to find the time it took him to complete each leg:

Time Leg 1 = Total Distance / Speed = 62 miles / 10 miles/hour = 6.2 hours
Time Leg 2 = Total Distance / Speed = 62 miles / 6 miles/hour = 10.3 hours

Therefore, it took Tom 6.2 hours to travel from 1 to 4 PM and an additional 10.3 hours to travel from 4 to 6 PM, for a total time of 16.5 hours to get back."
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that the total weight of Uriah's book bag is 15 pounds, and that the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each. Therefore, if he removes 30 comic books, their total weight is 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. Since the toys weigh 1/2 pound each, if he removes 7.5 pounds worth of comics, he will have room for 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 toys. So, he needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

"Response:  To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight limit of the bridge.

Weight of truck and driver = 3755 pounds
Total weight limit of bridge = 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:
Number of boxes = Total weight limit of bridge / Weight of each box
= 1245 pounds / 15 pounds per box
= 83 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83 boxes."

"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how much fuel Sophia has left in her tank after traveling 100 miles. We can do this by subtracting the amount of fuel used (4 gallons) from the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons):

Fuel remaining = Total capacity - Amount used
= 12 gallons - 4 gallons
= 8 gallons

Now, we can divide the distance traveled (100 miles) by the amount of fuel remaining (8 gallons) to find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas:

Distance driven / Fuel remaining
= 100 miles / 8 gallons
= 12.5 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 12.5 miles on a single tank of gas."

"Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs and divide it by the number of cups per bag. Let's do that:
Total cups of dog food needed = 1 cup/day x 180 days + 2 cups/day x remaining days = 180 + (365 - 180) = 485 cups
Since there are 110 cups per bag, we can now divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per bag to get the answer:
Number of bags needed = 485 cups / 110 cups/bag = 4.4 bags
So, Cecilia will use approximately 4.4 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how much laundry Raymond and David do. Let's start by using the first part of the problem: ""If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah."" This means that if Sarah does x pounds of laundry, then Raymond does x/2 pounds of laundry. Now, let's use the second part of the problem: ""Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David."" This means that if David does y pounds of laundry, then Sarah does 4y pounds of laundry. Finally, we are told that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. So, we can set up the following equation:
x + (x/2) = 4(y)
Now, we can solve for x (the amount of laundry done by Sarah):
x = 4y - x/2
Substituting the value of x = 400, we get:
4y - (400)/2 = 0
y = 160
So, David does 160 pounds of laundry. To find out how much laundry Raymond does, we can use the fact that he does half as much laundry as Sarah:
Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 / 2
Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry."
"Response:  To find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of each package and calculate the total amount saved.

Package of 3 flowers costs $2.50:
$2.50 x 3 = $7.50

 Package of 2 flowers costs $1:
$1 x 18 = $18

Total amount saved = $7.50 - $18 = $10.50

Therefore, Vincent saves $10.50 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."

"Response:  To find the number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the number of rows x the number of blocks per row. Since every shirt represents one block, we can multiply the number of years by the number of shirts per year to get the total number of blocks.
1. Calculate the number of rows: We know that every row consists of blocks from a different year of vacations. So, if Gene goes on 4 vacations/year x 4 years/row = 16 rows.
2. Calculate the number of blocks per row: As mentioned earlier, each row consists of blocks from a different year of vacations. Therefore, the number of blocks per row = Number of years x Number of shirts per year.
Number of years = 34 - 23 = 11 years (Gene started vacationing at age 23)
Number of shirts per year = 4 (assuming Gene gets one shirt per vacation)
So, the number of blocks per row = 11 years x 4 shirts/year = 44 blocks/row.
3. Total number of blocks: Now, let's calculate the total number of blocks using the formula: Total number of blocks = Number of rows x Number of blocks per row.
Total number of blocks = 16 rows x 44 blocks/row = 704 blocks.
Therefore, Gene has 704 quilt blocks in total!"
"Response:  The alarm rang 12 times in total. Here's how we can calculate that:

1. First time the alarm went off: It rang 4 times.
Alarm rang for x number of times = 4
x + 1 = 3 (since it will continue to ring after the first time)
x = 2

So, the alarm rang 4 times during the first time it went off.

2. Second time the alarm went off: It rang for 3 times longer than the first time.
Time taken by alarm to ring = (3 - 2) \* x = 9

So, the alarm rang for 9 times during the second time it went off.

3. Third time the alarm went off: It rang for half as long as the second time.
Time taken by alarm to ring = (1/2) \* 9 = 4.5

Since the alarm didn't actually ring for exactly 4.5 times, let's round up to the nearest whole number. So, the alarm rang for 5 times during the third time it went off.

Total number of times the alarm rang = 2 + 9 + 5 = 16

Therefore, the alarm rang 16 times in total."
"Response:  To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the formula provided in the question: Salary = Initial Salary x (1 + Increment Percentage) ^ Number of Years of Service.
First, let's determine the initial salary of Sylvie:
Initial Salary = $600
Now, let's find out the increment percentage per year:
Increment Percentage = 10% of $600 = $60
So, the increment per year is $60.
Next, let's calculate the salary after three more years of service:
Salary After Three More Years = Initial Salary x (1 + Increment Percentage)^Number of Years of Service
= $600 x (1 + $60)^3
= $729.60
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $729.60."
Response:  Harald sold 8,800 copies.
Response:  To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags she will need based on the number of guests who actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can assume that 4/8 or half of the invited guests will not be present. Therefore, the actual number of guests attending the party is 16 / 2 = 8 guests. So, Christina will need (0.75 x 8) = 6 gift bags for the guests who actually attend the party. The cost of each gift bag is $2, so Christina will spend $6 x $2 = $12 on gift bags.
"Response:  To find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed is:

20 x 10 = 200 lbs (from adults) + 5 x 5 = 25 lbs (from children) = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."

Response:  Jackson is 7 years old.
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how much Gerald's speed has improved after changing his diet. According to the question, Gerald's speed improved by 10% after changing his diet. This means that for every second Lee takes to complete the 400-meter hurdles (which is 38 seconds in this case), Gerald will take 38 x 1.1 = 41 seconds to complete the same distance. Therefore, if Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, Gerald, with his improved diet, will run the same distance in 41 seconds.
"Response:  The answer to the question can be found by using the following steps:

1. First, find out the number of dogs in the neighborhood. Since there are twice as many cats as dogs, if there are x dogs, then there are 2x cats. So, the total number of pets (dogs + cats) is 60.
2. Now, we need to find out the number of rabbits. According to the problem, the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of pets. So, if the total number of pets is x, then the number of rabbits is x - 12.
3. Finally, we can use the information that there are two cats for every dog to find out the number of cats. Since there are 60 dogs, there are also 60 cats.

So, the answer to the question is:
Total number of pets = 60 (dogs + cats)
Number of rabbits = 60 - 12 = 48
Number of cats = 60 / 2 = 30

Therefore, there are 48 rabbits, 30 cats, and 60 dogs in the neighborhood."

Response:  Ryan has 30 flowers in his garden after 15 days (2 flowers/day x 15 days). If 5 flowers did not grow, then the total number of flowers is 30 - 5 = 25.
Response:  To find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, so if Brittany's phone can hold 50 photographs, then Jamal's phone can hold 300 photographs (6 x 50 = 300). Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, if there are X birds in Jamal's photograph, then Brittany's phone can hold a maximum of 50X photographs. Finally, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so the total number of photographs that Jamal has taken is equal to the number of photographs he can hold minus the number of photographs he has already taken. Therefore, the number of photographs left for Jamal to take is 1800 - 300 = 1500 photographs. Since each photograph contains X birds, the total number of birds in all of Jamal's photographs is 1500X. Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 1500 / 2 = 750 ducks.
"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has left and then subtract that amount from the total revenue she will get from selling it all. The total cost of her leftover lumber is:

Total Cost = (10 x $10) + (5 x $16) = $180

Since she has 15 boards left, the total revenue she will get from selling them is:

Total Revenue = (10 x $20) + (5 x $24) = $320

So, the profit she makes from selling all of her leftover lumber is:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $320 - $180 = $140

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $140 from selling all of her leftover lumber."
Response:  To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to use the ratio given in the problem. The ratio is 7:13, which means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 teaspoons of water. So, if Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar, she also used 120 x 13 = 1560 teaspoons of water. Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 120 / 7 = 17 teaspoonfuls.
Response:  John paid a total of $180.
"Response:  To calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles inside each container, so the total number of vehicles at the port was 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.
2. On the second day, additional containers were brought in, resulting in a total of 30 vehicles at the port. This means that if the number of containers remained constant, the number of vehicles per container would have increased from 5 to 30 / 2 = 15 vehicles per container.
3. Since all containers contained 5 vehicles each, the total number of containers imported on the second day can be calculated as follows: Number of containers = Total number of vehicles / Number of vehicles per container = 30 / 15 = 2 containers.

Therefore, two containers were imported on the second day containing a total of 10 vehicles (5 vehicles per container x 2 containers)."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how much Adrien's salary increased over time and then add it to his original salary to get the new total salary of both Adrien and Lylah together. Here is the calculation:

1. Find out how much Adrien's salary increased over time:
Adrien's current salary = 40% more than his previous salary (which was $40,000)
= ($40,000 x 1.4) = $56,000
2. Add Adrien's new salary to his old salary to get the new total salary:
New total salary of Adrien = Old salary + Increase in salary
= $40,000 + $16,000
= $56,000
3. Now, find out how much Lylah's salary increased over time using the same formula as above:
Lylah's current salary = 40% more than her previous salary (which was $30,000)
= ($30,000 x 1.4) = $42,000
4. Add Lylah's new salary to her old salary to get the new total salary:
New total salary of Lylah = Old salary + Increase in salary
= $30,000 + $12,000
= $42,000

Therefore, the new total salary of Adrien and Lylah together after four years is $98,000 ($56,000 + $42,000)."

Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital during each day. We can use the following formula to calculate this amount: Total Revenue = Number of Patients x Charge per Patient. In this case, the number of patients seen by the hospital in one day is 500, so the total revenue would be: Total Revenue = 500 x $200 = $100,000 (one hundred thousand dollars). Now, we need to subtract the cost of providing medical care to those patients. This includes the salaries of the doctors, nurses, and other staff members who provide care to the patients, as well as any other expenses related to running the hospital. Let's assume that it costs the hospital $75,000 per day to provide medical care to its patients ($150 x 500 patients). So, the net profit made by the hospital would be: Net Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Providing Care = $100,000 - $75,000 = $25,000 (twenty-five thousand dollars) per day.

So, Rory's delivery order will cost $40.00 in total."
"Response:  To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered in both tests from the total number of questions in each test.
For the first test, Mark answered 75/5 = 15 questions per hour. So, he completed the test in 8 hours (since he had 8 hours to complete it), which means he answered 15 x 8 = 120 questions.
For the second test, Mark answered 100/5 = 20 questions per hour. So, he completed the test in 6 hours (since he had 6 hours to complete it), which means he answered 20 x 6 = 120 questions.
Therefore, Mark left 100 - 120 = 20 questions incomplete on the second test."

"Response:  To find out the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the total number of cars available for rent, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars available for rent. In this case, there are 20 cars available for rent, and 5 of them are semi-automatic (the remaining 15 cars are either automatic or manual). Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:
(Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) x 100 = (5/20) x 100 = 25%
So, approximately 25% of the cars available for rent are semi-automatic."
Response:  The number of worker bees is 1400.
Response:  To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends playing video games and then multiply it by his hourly wage. Let's assume that Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day, which means he spends 14 hours (2 x 7) playing video games per week. If he works at his part-time job for 14 hours per week, he will earn $140 ($10/hour x 14 hours). So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.
Response:  The total cost of the items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15.  The tax on the non-food items = $15 x 10% = $1.50. So, the final cost = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50.
Response:  To calculate the profit that Lucas will make each week, we first need to calculate his total income. His total income for the week will be: Total Income = Number of Clients x Price per Client x Number of Items needed per Client Total Income = 3 clients x $92 per client x 2 bottles of bleach + 1 pack of cloths = $2860 For the next step, we subtract his total expenses from his total income: Total Expenses = Cost of bleach x Number of bottles of bleach used + Cost of cloths x Number of packs of cloths used Total Expenses = $2 x 6 bottles of bleach + $5 x 4 packs of cloths = $48 + $20 = $68 Total Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses Total Profit = $2860 - $68 = $2792 This means that Lucas will make a profit of $2792 each week.
"Response:  John can harvest 1000 pineapples within a year.

Here's how you can arrive at the answer:

1. First, find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year:
Harvesting frequency = 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year
2. Next, calculate the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year:
Total pineapples = 10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare x 4 harvests/year = 4000 pineapples/year
3. Finally, divide the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests to get the average number of pineapples harvested per harvest:
Average pineapples per harvest = Total pineapples / Number of harvests = 4000 pineapples/year / 4 harvests/year = 1000 pineapples/harvest

Therefore, John can harvest 1000 pineapples within a year."
"Response:  To find out how many Legos Johnny picked up, we need to add the number of pieces in each Lego set.

Johnny picked up the 500-piece Lego set, which has 500 pieces.
He also picked up the larger Lego set, which has 3 times as many pieces as the 500-piece set, so it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces.
Finally, he picked up the smaller Lego set, which has 1/4 the number of pieces as the larger set, so it has 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces.
In total, Johnny picked up 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 pieces of Legos."
"Response:  The number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day can be calculated as follows:

At first, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Since she sees twice as many bees leaving than returning, this means she sees 60 bees (twice 30) leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

In the second 6-hour period, half of the original 60 bees return to the hive, which is 30 bees. So, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 90 bees (60 + 30).

Therefore, the answer is 90 bees."

Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Steve has traveled when Tim catches up to him. We know that Steve travels at a rate of 440 feet per minute, so if it takes Tim x minutes to catch up to Steve, then Steve has traveled x \* 60 seconds = 0.44 miles during that time. Therefore, the winner will arrive at their house after 0.44 / 2 = 0.22 miles.
Response:  To find out how much money Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the cost of inflating each tire and then multiply it by the number of tires inflated for each customer. For the bicyclists, each tire costs $0.25, so the total cost for 5 customers is $1.25 ($0.25 x 5). For the tricycle riders, each tire costs $0.25 as well, so the total cost for 3 customers is $0.75 ($0.25 x 3). And for the unicycler, there is only one tire, which costs $0.25, so the total cost is $0.25. Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $2.25 that day ($1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25).
Response:  $60
"Response: 5

Answer: 5

Explanation:
Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the rest. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries (half of 14). So, there were 7 + 14 = 21 fries left after the seagull's snatch.
Three pigeons bullied the seagull away, each eating 3 fries. That means the seagull had 21 - 9 = 12 fries left.
A raccoon then stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is equal to 12 x 2/3 = 8 fries. So, there were 12 - 8 = 4 fries left.
Finally, an ant carried off one fry, leaving 4 - 1 = 3 fries. Therefore, there were 3 fries in the pack when Dave bought it."
"Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he attends classes per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Weekly hours attending classes = (3 x 1 hour/day) + (2 x 2 hours/day) = 7 hours/week
Total hours attending classes in a semester = Weekly hours attending classes x Number of weeks in a semester = 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 112 hours attending classes in a semester."

* Baboons need 100 bananas per month x 2 months = 200 bananas
* Monkeys need 200 bananas per month x 2 months = 400 bananas

Next, we add up the total number of bananas needed by each type of ape to get the total number of bananas needed for the entire 2-month period:

800 + 200 + 400 = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"Response:  The distance between the start and finish lines of the football field is 100 yards = 91.44 meters (using the conversion rate of 1 yard = 0.9144 meters).
Kelly ran from the 40-yard line to the end zone and back, which is a total distance of 80 yards + 40 yards = 120 yards.
Therefore, the winner (Blake) ran a total distance of 15 x 100 yards = 1500 meters, while the loser (Kelly) ran a total distance of 120 yards + 40 yards = 160 yards. So, the winner ran approximately 94% more distance than the loser."
"Response:  Raphael spent a total of $39 on everything he bought. Here's how we can calculate this:

* Number of pens x Cost per pen = Total cost of pens = $1.5 x 4 = $6
* Number of notebooks x Cost per notebook = Total cost of notebooks = $4 x 2 = $8
* Rim of bond paper x Cost per rim = Total cost of rim = $20
Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34
Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on the school supplies."

"Response:  After 36 months, the price of a bag of marbles will be:

Price = Original Price x (1 + Increase Percentage)^Number of Months
= $20 x (1 + 0.20)^36
= $48

Therefore, after 36 months, a bag of marbles will cost $48."
"Response:  To find the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them up. Let's start by identifying the given information:

1. There are 5 red cars. Each red car costs $2.
2. There are 3 action figures. Each action figure costs $5.
3. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car together. So, the cost of the doll is $2 + ($5 x 3) = $2 + $15 = $17.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items:
Total cost of red cars = 5 x $2 = $10
Total cost of action figures = 3 x $5 = $15
Total cost of doll = $17
Total cost of all toys = Total cost of red cars + Total cost of action figures + Total cost of doll = $10 + $15 + $17 = $42

Therefore, all the toys in the room are worth $42."
"Response:  To calculate how much more money Jackie will have by hiring the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant from the lost income due to doing her own taxes. So, we can set up the following equation:

Lost Income = 3 hours x $35/hour = $105
Cost of Accountant = $90
More Money with Accountant = Lost Income - Cost of Accountant = $105 - $90 = $15

Therefore, by hiring an accountant, Jackie will have $15 more than she would have if she did her taxes herself."
"Response:  To calculate how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of the computer and its accessories from her budget of €1500. The total cost of the computer and its accessories is:
€1090 (computer) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1323
So, Elvira will have €1500 - €1323 = €177 left for her clothing."

"Response:  To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total number of miles he walks during the weekdays and then add that to the total number of miles he walks on weekends. Let's break it down like this:

Weekdays (Monday through Friday):
Pancho walks 20 miles per day = 20 x 5 days = 100 miles

Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):
Pancho walks 10 miles per day = 10 x 2 days = 20 miles

Total miles walked in a week = 100 + 20 = 120 miles

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"Response:  To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Hat cost = $25
2. Jacket cost = 3 times hat cost = $25 x 3 = $75
3. Pants cost = average of hat and jacket cost = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50
4. Total cost of each uniform = hat cost + jacket cost + pants cost = $25 + $75 + $50 = $140

Therefore, each uniform costs $140 in total."
Response:  To find out how many legs Jake sees, we need to add up the number of legs on all the creatures he saw. The spiders have 8 legs each, so that's 8 x 80 = 640 legs from the spiders alone. The insects have 6 legs each, so that's 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. And there are 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 legs from those. Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
Response:  The total age of the four birds is 30 + 24 + 16 + 8 = 78 years.
"Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we need to calculate the total amount she needs to pay each month. Let's start by calculating the minimum payments for each debt:
Minimum Payment = $300 (Student Loans) + $200 (Credit Card) + $500 (Mortgage) = $1000/month
Now, let's calculate the total amount Jessica needs to pay each month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum: Total Monthly Payment = Minimum Payment x 1.5 = $1000 x 1.5 = $1500/month
Finally, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we can multiply the total monthly payment by 12: Yearly Payment = Total Monthly Payment x 12 = $1500 x 12 = $18,000/year
Therefore, Jessica pays $18,000 per year on her debts if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment."
Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the time it takes him to peel and cut each potato by the number of potatoes he needs to prepare. So, if it takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato (1.5 minutes), and he needs to peel 60 potatoes, it will take him 90 minutes (60 x 1.5 = 90) to complete that task. If it only takes him 5 seconds to cut each potato, then it will take him 3 hours and 20 minutes (60 x 5 = 300) to cut them all up!
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to subtract the amount of money they made from the total amount they spent. In this case, they made $25 in profit, so they spent a total of: $3 x 20 = $60 + $2 x 20 = $40 = $100. Therefore, they spent $100 on lemons.
Response:  There are 160 people on the Asian team who are not Japanese (240 - 80 = 160). Since there are 60 boys on the Chinese team, there must be 100 girls on the Chinese team (160 - 60 = 100).
"Response:  Zaid will have $5,800 left after all these expenses and donations.

Here's how you can solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the total amount that Zaid spends on rent, car fuel, and donations:
Rent = 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500
Car Fuel = 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000
Donation = Half of ($6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000) = $3,500
Total Expenses = $1,500 + $2,000 + $3,500 = $7,000
2. Next, let's subtract the total expenses from Zaid's monthly income:
Zaid's Income = $6,000
Subtract Total Expenses = $6,000 - $7,000 = $-1,000
3. Now, let's calculate the amount that Zaid has left after giving his daughter $200 and his wife $700:
Given Amounts:
* $200 given to daughter
* $700 given to wife
Remaining Money = $6,000 - ($200 + $700) = $5,800

Therefore, Zaid will have $5,800 left after all these expenses and donations."

Response:  To find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm, we need to divide the total number of red roses that Sandra wanted by the percentage of red roses in her original order. Let's assume that the total number of red roses Sandra wanted was 48 (4 times as many as white carnations). If red roses made up 75% of her original order, then Fred needs to deliver 36 red roses (48 / 0.75) by 5 pm to satisfy Sandra's demand.
Response:  Jean is 32 years old.
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for each member of the slower team to complete their 400 meter leg. Since each runner's time decreases by 3 seconds from the previous runner, we can use the following formula to calculate their times: Time = 60 + (3 x Runner Number) Where ""Runner Number"" ranges from 1 to 4, since there are 4 runners on the team. Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: Team A: Each runner runs their 400 meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. Team B: First runner runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds, second runner runs their leg in 57 seconds, third runner runs their leg in 54 seconds, and fourth runner runs their leg in 51 seconds. So, using the formula above, we can calculate the time it takes for each member of Team B to complete their 400 meter leg: Runner 1: 60 + (3 x 1) = 60 + 3 = 63 seconds Runner 2: 60 + (3 x 2) = 60 + 6 = 66 seconds Runner 3: 60 + (3 x 3) = 60 + 9 = 69 seconds Runner 4: 60 + (3 x 4) = 60 + 12 = 72 seconds Therefore, the total time it takes for Team B to complete their 4x400 meter relay is: Total Time = Runner 1 + Runner 2 + Runner 3 + Runner 4 = 63 + 66 + 69 + 72 = 358 seconds Now, let's compare this with the time it takes for Team A to complete their relay: Team A: Each runner runs their 400 meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. So, the total time it takes for Team A to complete their 4x400 meter relay is: Total Time = Runner 1 + Runner 2 + Runner 3 + Runner 4 = 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 260 seconds As you can see,"
Response:  Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. The probability of him rolling a number greater than 3 is 5/6, or 83.33%. To calculate the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling another even number on the second roll. This can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each event occurring separately: P(rolling an even number on the first roll) x P(rolling an even number on the second roll | the first roll was even). Using the formula for conditional probability, we get: P(rolling two even numbers in a row) = 0.79% (or 7.9%). Therefore, Jerry is 11.4 times more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than he is to roll two even numbers in a row.
Response:  Jenna picked 10 apples and her mother picked 20 apples, so together they picked 30 apples.
"Response:  Let's assume there are x rats in each cage. Since there are 3 cages and each cage has an equal number of rats, we can write:
x = 3x/3 = 3x/9 = 4x/27
Now, let's substitute this expression for x into the statement ""There are 6 pieces of straw per rat"":
6 = 6(4x/27)
Simplifying, we get:
6 = 24x/27
Dividing both sides by 6, we find that there are 4x/27 rats in each cage.
So, if 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, then 48 pieces of straw (160 / 4x/27) have been distributed to each cage of rats."
Response:  To find out the amount that Mandy needs to pay to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount due including the principal and interest. The formula for calculating the total amount due is: Total Amount Due = Principal x (Interest Rate / Number of Payments) x Time Period In this case, the principal is $100, the interest rate is 2% per month or 24% per year, and the time period is 3 months. So, the calculation would be: Total Amount Due = $100 x (24/3) = $100 x 8 = $800 Therefore, Mandy needs to pay $800 to Benedict after 3 months.

"Response:  To determine the number of pounds of insects that the duck needs per day, we must divide the total amount of insects needed by the number of days in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate as follows:

Total amount of insects needed = 3.5 pounds/week x 7 days/week = 24.5 pounds/week

Therefore, if there is a flock of ten ducks, they will need approximately 24.5 pounds of insects per day."
"Response:  Tom has 40 trees left after 10 years.

Here's how you can solve this problem step by step:

Step 1: Identify the given information and write it down in a list or table format. In this case, we are given:

* Tom plants 10 trees a year.
* Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.
* He starts with 50 trees.
* After 10 years, 30% of the trees die (i.e., 30 out of 100 trees).

Step 2: Define the problem statement. Based on the information provided, the problem is to find out how many trees Tom has left after 10 years.

Step 3: Create an equation based on the information provided. Let T be the number of trees Tom has after 10 years. We know that:

T = 50 - (2 x 10)
T = 50 - 20
T = 30

So, Tom has 30 trees left after 10 years. Therefore, the answer is 30."

"Response:  To find the cost of each color, we need to divide the total amount by the number of colors. In this case, Violetta has $20 to spend on 5 colors, so the cost per color is:
$20 / 5 = $4 per color
Now, let's calculate the cost of each crayon:
$4 x 5 = $20
So, Violetta will pay $20 for all 5 crayons. Since one crayon costs $2, Violetta will get $20 - ($2 x 5) = $18 in change."

"Response:  To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to know the rates paid by both publishers and the total number of sentences he edits. Let's assume that Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence and Publisher B pays $0.10 per sentence. If Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences, then his total earnings from Publisher A would be:

$0.05 x 500 sentences = $25.00

And his total earnings from Publisher B would be:

$0.10 x 500 sentences = $50.00

So, Mark makes a total of $75.00 in a week ($25.00 + $50.00)."

"Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres she has by the amount of grapes produced per acre. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and there are 10 acres in total, we can calculate the total number of tons of grapes as follows:

10 acres x 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes per year

Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total number of barrels of wine as follows:

50 tons of grapes x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine per year

Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
Response:  Carl used 24 slices of cheese (6 x 2 = 12 slices for sandwiches + 3 x 2 = 6 slices for omelets).

"Response:  To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we can use the formula for calculating a weighted average:

Average = (Highest score x Number of tests) + (Lowest score x Number of tests - 1)

In this case, the highest score is 100, and the number of tests is 6. So, we can plug these values into the formula:

Average = (100 x 6) + (86 x 5)
= 600 + 430
= 1030

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of at least 1030 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"Response:  To find out how many kilometers Michael did in total, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during each period of his biking activity and then add them up.
During the first four weeks, Michael rode his bike at least 5 times a week and made 25 kilometers each time, so he traveled a total distance of:
5 x 25 = 125 kilometers per week
Since he did this for 4 weeks, the total distance he traveled during this period is:
125 km/week x 4 weeks = 500 kilometers
Afterwards, he reduced the number of times he rode his bike to twice a week, but increased the distance he covered each time to 60 kilometers. So, during the next three weeks, he traveled a total distance of:
2 x 60 = 120 kilometers per week
Adding up all these distances gives us the total distance Michael traveled:
500 km + 120 km = 620 kilometers
Therefore, Michael traveled a total distance of 620 kilometers."

"Response:  To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and then subtract that from the cost of the jacket and shoes. Let's do this step by step:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting:
$5 x 4 = $20 (from babysitting) + $10 (already saved) = $30
2. Subtract the total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting from the cost of the jacket and shoes:
$30 - ($30 for the jacket + $60 for 2 pairs of shoes) = $30 - $90 = $-60

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn enough times to make $60 in order to afford the jacket and shoes. Since she has $10 already saved, she only needs to mow the lawn 60/10 = 6 times."

Response:  To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to use the information given in the problem. On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so the total number of customers on the second day was: 100 + (50 x 2) = 150 Customers On the third day, there were again 50 more customers than the previous day, so the total number of customers on the third day was: 150 + (50 x 3) = 450 Customers Therefore, Sloane counted 450 customers on the third day.
Response:  The small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.
Response:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, we need to divide the total cost of the shoes and belt by her hourly wage. In this case, the total cost is $352.00 ($320.00 + $32.00). If Lori works at a rate of $8.00 per hour, then she needs to work: $352.00 / $8.00 = 46 hours to save enough money to buy the shoes and belt.
Response:  To find out Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate her total payment first. The formula for calculating total payment is: Total Payment = Principal Amount x Interest Rate x Number of Months. In this case, the principal amount is $2000, interest rate is 10%, and number of months is 12. So, Total Payment = $2000 x 10% x 12 = $3200. Now, if Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance at the end of 12 months can be calculated as follows: Remaining Balance = Principal Amount - Total Payment = $2000 - $3200 = -$1200. Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months is -$1200.
Response:  Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias. = 4 + (7 - 4) = 15. Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total.
"Response:  The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack will be calculated as follows:
Adrian's age = 3 x (Harriet's age + Zack's age)
= 3 x (21 + Zack's age)
= 63 + Zack's age

In three years, Adrian's age will be:
Adrian's age after 3 years = 63 + Zack's age + (3 x 3)
= 63 + Zack's age + 9
= 72 + Zack's age

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after three years will be:
Average age = (Adrian's age after 3 years + Harriet's age + Zack's age) / 3
= (72 + 21 + Zack's age) / 3
= 94 / 3
= 31.33

So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after three years will be approximately 31.33 years."

Response:  To find out how much Chad still owes, we need to subtract the amount of the gift card from the total cost of his meal. So, if the total cost of his meal is $X, then he still owes $X - $5 = $X/2. Therefore, Chad still owes $X/2.
Response:  To solve for the time it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to use the information provided in the problem. We know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, so she will be able to complete 4 x 360 = 1440 pieces in one hour. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom will be able to complete 1440 / 2 = 720 pieces in one hour. Therefore, it will take them 1440 - 720 = 720 minutes to complete the puzzle.
Response:  After two weeks, there were 80 melons left on the farm (70% of the original number - 120). So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 80 - 30 = 50 melons.
"Response:  To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the cars first, then the taxes, and finally the registration fees.

Cost of cars = Number of cars x Price of each car = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000
Taxes = Cost of cars x Tax rate = $240,000 x 10% = $24,000
Registration fees = Number of cars x Registration fee per car = 12 x $1000 = $12,000
Total amount paid by Mark = Cost of cars + Taxes + Registration fees = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000
Therefore, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for the fleet of 12 cars."

"Response:  To find out how many vines Steve needs, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes he wants to eat by the number of tomatoes each vine produces in a week. In this case, Steve wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day, so he needs:

Total number of tomatoes = Number of days x Number of tomatoes per day
= 7 x 6
= 42 tomatoes per week

Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve needs:

Number of vines = Total number of tomatoes / Number of tomatoes per vine
= 42 / 3
= 14 vines

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to grow enough cherry tomatoes to meet his daily demand of 6 tomatoes."
Response:  John needs to order 5 pizzas.
"Response:  To find out how many pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the amount of ink available in each pen after mixing the ink from five empty pens. Let's assume that each pen contains 0.5 ml of ink (this is just an estimate, as the actual amount of ink in a pen may vary).

So, if Ram mixes the ink from five empty pens, he will have:

5 x 0.5 ml = 2.5 ml of ink

Now, let's see how much ink is left in each pen after using it to make a new pen:

If Ram uses 0.5 ml of ink from each pen to make a new pen, he will have:

0.5 ml - 0.5 ml = 0 ml of ink left in each pen

"Response: 270

Answer:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Initially, there were 1000 students in the school hall.
* After the meeting, 30% of the students (300) went out through exit A.
* Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 (420) went out through exit B.
* So, the total number of students who went out through exit C is 700 - 420 = 280.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
Response: 280

"Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes and divide it by the time it takes him to write one page. Let's assume that Mike stops being pen pals with two people after sending a total of 10 letters (5 letters per person x 2 people). So, he has 30 letters left to write (5 letters per person x 3 remaining people).

Let's also assume that it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page, as you mentioned in the question. Therefore, he can write 6 minutes / 5 pages = 1 minute per page.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages Mike writes in a week:
Total pages written = Number of letters written / Time taken to write one letter
= 30 letters / 6 minutes
= 5 pages/week

So, Mike spends 5 pages/week \* 1 minute/page = 5 minutes/week writing letters.
Therefore, Mike spends 5 minutes/week writing letters."
"Response:  To find out how many minutes Jason has left after making the calls, we need to subtract the number of minutes used from the total number of minutes available in his plan. In this case, Jason has 1000 minutes per month, and he has already used 300 minutes (including the daily 15-minute call with his boss). Therefore, Jason has 700 minutes left for the rest of the month. Here is the calculation:

Total minutes available = 1000 minutes/month
Minutes used so far = 300 minutes (including daily call) + other calls
Minutes left = Total minutes available - Minutes used
= 1000 - 300
= 700 minutes

Therefore, Jason has 700 minutes left for the rest of the month."
Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 10 fries.
"Response:  Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Then, the number of fish in the second aquarium is twice that value, so it is 2x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the equation:

Number of snails in first aquarium = 4
Number of snails in second aquarium = 2(number of fish in first aquarium)

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:

Number of fish in first aquarium = x
Number of snails in first aquarium = 4
Number of fish in second aquarium = 2x
Number of snails in second aquarium = 8x

Now we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 16

So, there are 16 fish in the first aquarium and 8 times that value, or 128 snails, in the second aquarium."
"Response:  To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services over the duration of the movie shoot.

Total Cost = Number of Hours x Rate per Hour
= 6 hours/day x $250/hour
= $1500/week (4 days)
= $6000 (5 weeks)

Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we subtract that amount from the total cost:
Discounted Total Cost = Total Cost - Discount Percentage x Total Cost
= $6000 - ($6000 x 10%)
= $5400

Therefore, Jean paid $5400 for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid $70 / 3 = $23.33.
Response:  The chef spent a total of $675.
"Response:  To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of calories that each of them consumed over the two days. Let's assume that one cookie contains 200 calories.
Day 1 (Monday):
Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies, and her sister ate 5 cookies. Total calories consumed by Sue on Monday = 20 x 200 = 4000 calories. Total calories consumed by her sister on Monday = 5 x 200 = 1000 calories.
Day 2 (Tuesday):
Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies, and her sister ate 13 cookies. Total calories consumed by Sue on Tuesday = 26 x 200 = 5200 calories. Total calories consumed by her sister on Tuesday = 13 x 200 = 2600 calories.
Now, let's subtract the total calories consumed by her sister from the total calories consumed by Sue to find out how many more calories Sue consumed:
Difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 5200 - 2600 = 2600 calories.
Therefore, Sue consumed 2600 more calories than her sister over the two days."
