"Response:  Rp 108.750

Pendapat Anda : 

Jawaban yang paling tepat adalah Rp 108.750. Ini dapat dirahasiakan dengan menggunakan persamaan:

Total earnings = Regular hourly rate x Total hours worked + Overtime pay x Total overtime hours

Dari pertanyaan, kita tahu bahwa total hours worked = 45 hours dan overtime hours = 10 hours. Kemudian, menggunakan persamaan di atas, kita dapat mengetahui bahwa total earnings = Rp 100 x 45 + (Rp 10 x 10) = Rp 108.750.

Therefore, the correct answer is Rp 108.750."

* Carlos mengelola biaya planting dan pemeliharaan pohon limon dengan cara menghitung biaya bersifat tahunan (tahunan).
* Setiap tahun, pohon limon akan mengecil dan membuahi 7 butir limon.
* Biaya untuk memelihara pohon limon setiap tahun adalah $3.
* Karena biaya pembuatan dan pemeliharaan pohon limon lebih rendah dari hasil keuangan, maka waktu untuk Carlos mulai mendapat keuntungan dari pohon limon adalah 6 tahun."

Meredith spend 4 hours per article, so she spent 4 x 5 = 20 hours writing articles on Monday.
She spent 2/5 x 4 = 8 hours writing articles on Tuesday (since she wrote twice as many articles on Wednesday).
So, she spent a total of 20 + 8 = 28 hours writing articles in the three days."

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long. So, if he watches TV for x hours, he will read for x/2 hours. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total number of hours he spends on TV and reading per week is 3x. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 4(3x) = 1260 hours."

Explanation:
Shiela pays $150 x 5 = Rp 750.000 for the cellphones.
A 2% interest means she has to pay Rp 750.000 x 2/100 = Rp 15.000 as interest.
So, her total monthly payment is Rp 750.000 + Rp 15.000 = Rp 465.000 per month for 3 months."

Reasoning:
Gene has been on vacation every year for the past 13 years (from age 23 to 34). Since each shirt represents one quilt block, the number of quilt blocks Gene has is equal to the number of years he has been on vacation multiplied by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

Number of years Gene has been on vacation = 13 years
Number of shirts per vacation = 1 (assuming he always brings back one shirt from each trip)

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:
13 x 1 = 13 quilt blocks
So, Gene has 13 quilt blocks in total."

Explanation:
Let's assume the original volume of each can of tomatoes is V0 = 16 ounces = 0.5 liters. Since the volume of the tomato sauce is 32 ounces, we know that the amount of tomatoes used in the recipe is:
Volume of tomatoes used = Amount of tomato sauce / Original volume of each can of tomatoes
= 32 ounces / 0.5 liter
= 64 tomatoes
So, Freda used 64 tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce."

"Response:  Rp 375.000 per hari.

Solution:
Let's break down the calculation as follows:

Total time spent on seeing patients = Total number of patients / Time each patient spends at the hospital
= 500 patients/day x 24 minutes/patient
= 12,000 minutes/day

Profit made by doctors = Number of patients x Charge per patient x Time taken to see each patient
= 12,000 minutes/day x $150/hour x 24 minutes/patient
= $360,000/day

Profit made by hospital = Revenue - Cost
= $360,000/day - ($150/hour x 8 hours)
= $360,000/day - $120,000/day
= $240,000/day

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of Rp 375,000 per day (approximately)."

"Response:  Rp 578

Solution:
Let's break down the cost of each item:

* Milk: $2/gal = $2 x 4 gal = $8
* Eggs: $3/dozen = $3 x 6 doz = $18
* Light bulbs: $3/pack = $3 x 4 pack = $12
* Cups: $3/package = $3 x 4 package = $12
* Roach traps: $4/pack = $4 x 2 pack = $8

Total cost without tax: $8 + $18 + $12 + $12 + $8 = $60

Now, let's calculate the tax amount:
Tax rate = 10%
Total cost with tax = Total cost x Tax rate
= $60 x 10%
= $6

So, the total cost including tax is: $60 + $6 = $66

Therefore, the answer is Rp 66 (approximately)."

Answer: Rp 5800

Explanation:
Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is Rp 1500 (Rp 6000 x 1/4). Then, he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is Rp 2000 (Rp 6000 x 1/3). After that, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is Rp 3000 (Rp 6000 x 1/2).

For his daughter's weekly expenses, he gives her Rp 200. For his wife's budget for groceries and other household goods, he gives her Rp 700. So, the total amount he gives away is Rp 900 (Rp 200 + Rp 700).

After all these expenses and donations, Zaid has Rp 5800 left (Rp 6000 - Rp 900 = Rp 5800)."
