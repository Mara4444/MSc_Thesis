"Response:  
* The number of eggs laid per day = 16 (given)
* Number of eggs eaten per day = 3 (given)
* Price of one egg = $2 (given)
Now let's calculate the total amount of money earned by Jennet every day:
Total amount of money earned per day = Number of eggs sold x Price of one egg
= 16 x $2
= $32
Therefore, Jennet earns $32 every day."
"Response:  We need 1 yard of fabric to make one garment. Since we have 2 volts of blue thread and half a volt of white thread, we can calculate the number of yards of fabric needed as follows:

Number of yards = (Total weight in volts) / (Weight of one yard in volts)
= (2 volts + 0.5 volts) / (1 volt per yard)
= 2.5 yards

Therefore, we need approximately 2.5 yards of fabric to make one garment using these two types of threads."
Response:  The original price of the house was $800,000 and Josh invested $500,000 in repairs. After the repairs, the value of the house increased to $1,300,000, which is 150% more than its original value. So, the profit made by Josh would be: Profit = New Value - Original Value = $1,300,000 - $800,000 = $500,000. Therefore, Josh earned a profit of $500,000 from his investment in repairs.
Response:  James decides to run 3 times a week for 1 mile each time. So, he will run a total of 3 x 3 = 9 miles per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will run a total distance of 9 miles / 7 days = 1.2857 miles per day. Therefore, James will cover a total distance of approximately 1.2857 miles per day.
"Response:  
Wendy feeds the chickens 3 cups of food each day. She gives them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the evening. If Wendy has 20 chickens, how many cups of food will she need to give them per day? 
So, the answer is 15 + 25 = 40 cups of food per day."
Response:  The price of one jar is $5, and the discount percentage for two jars is 60%. So, the price of two jars would be $5 x 0.6 = $3. Therefore, if Kaitlyn wants to buy 16 jars, she will have to pay $16 x $3 = $48.
"Response: 
Charleson has twice as many sheep as Seattle. So Charleson has 80 sheep (2 x 40 = 80).

"Response: 

1. Karen is downloading a file of 200 GB.
2. The download speed is typically 2 GB per minute.
3. However, Windows forces Karen to restart every 20 minutes to install updates.
4. Therefore, it takes 40% of the total time (or 80 minutes) for Windows to update itself while Karen is trying to download the file.
5. So, in total, it would take Karen approximately 160 minutes (2 hours and 40 minutes) to download the entire file.

Therefore, the answer is 160 minutes."
Response:  John started driving at a speed of 100 km/h and drove for 3 hours. In total, he traveled a distance of 30 miles (x) in the first 2 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Then, he reduced his speed to 80 km/h and drove for another 4 hours, covering a distance of y miles. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + y = 30 \* 2 + 4 \* 80 = 160 \* 3. Solving for y, we get y = 50 miles. So, after 4 hours, John was 50 miles away from his house.
"Response: 
Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, and her hourly wage is $10 per hour. Since she also receives overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, we need to calculate her regular hourly rate first.
Regular hourly rate = $10 x 1.2 = $12
Now, let's calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week:
Total earnings = Number of hours worked x Hourly wage + Overtime pay
= 45 hours x $10 + ($10 x 1.2)
= $450 + $120
= $570
Therefore, Eliza earned $570 this week."
"Response: 

First month (January): 60 downloads
Second month (February): 3 times as many downloads as in January = 180 downloads
Third month (March): 30% decrease from February = 126 downloads

Therefore, the total cost of the pastries was $694."
"Response: 
Year 1: Carlos spends $90 to plant the lemon tree and earns $7 x $1.5 = $10.5 per year (Total income in Year 1: $90 + $10.5 = $100.5)
Year 2: Carlos spends $3 for maintenance and earns $7 x $1.5 = $10.5 per year (Total income in Year 2: $100.5 + $10.5 = $111)
Year 3: Carlos spends $3 again for maintenance and earns $7 x $1.5 = $10.5 per year (Total income in Year 3: $111 + $10.5 = $121.5)
And so on...
After 5 years, Carlos has earned a total of: $100.5 + $100 + $100 + $100 + $100.5 = $600
So it will take approximately 6 years ($600 / $90 = 6.67 years) for Carlos to break even and start making a profit from his lemon tree."
Response:  Melani sold half of her belongings in each of three houses - red house, blue house, and green house. So she sold 3/2 = 1 1/2 times as many items in total. Since there are 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling everything, we can conclude that Melani started with 5 x 1/2 = 2 1/2 vacuum cleaners initially.
"Response: 
From the given information, we know that out of 20 students in the dance class, 20% are registered for modern dance, and 25% are registered for jazz dance. This means that there are 4 students (20% x 20) who are registered for modern dance.
Now, let's find out how many students are registered for hip-hop dance. We know that 75% of the remaining students are not registered for either modern or jazz dance, which means they are registered for hip-hop dance. So, the number of students registered for hip-hop dance is equal to 75% of the total number of students minus the number of students registered for modern and jazz dance.
Using the formula above, we can calculate the percentage of students registered for hip-hop dance as follows:
Percentage of students registered for hip-hop dance = Total number of students - Number of students registered for modern and jazz dance / Total number of students
Substituting the values from the question into this formula, we get:
Percentage of students registered for hip-hop dance = 160 - 8 / 160 = 30%
Therefore, the percentage of students registered for hip-hop dance is 30%."
"Response:  If the trader chooses to buy either of the two options, he will make a profit equal to the difference between the market price at the end of the month and his purchase price. So, if he buys the $5,000 bond option, his profit will be $5,000 x (Market Price - Purchase Price). Similarly, if he buys the $8,000 electronic device option, his profit will be $8,000 x (Market Price - Purchase Price).
Now, let's calculate the maximum profit for each option based on the given probabilities:
For the $5,000 bond option:
Probability of price increase = 0.025 = 2.5%
Maximum profit = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,375
For the $8,000 electronic device option:
Probability of price increase = 0.012 = 1.2%
Maximum profit = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,496
Therefore, if the trader wants to maximize his profit, he should choose the option with the higher probability of price increase, which is the $8,000 electronic device option. This option has a higher potential profit of $8,496 compared to the $5,375 profit from the $5,000 bond option."
"Response: 
Day 1:
* Distance traveled by both trains = 80 miles
* Speed of Train A = x mph
* Speed of Train B = y mph
* Time taken by Train A to travel 80 miles = TA hours
* Time taken by Train B to travel 80 miles = TB hours

Now, let's find out the distance between the two trains after one day:
Distance between Trains = (x + y) miles

Day 2:
* Distance traveled by both trains = 150 miles
* Speed of Train A = x mph
* Speed of Train B = y mph
* Time taken by Train A to travel 150 miles = TA hours
* Time taken by Train B to travel 150 miles = TB hours

Now, let's find out the distance between the two trains after two days:
Distance between Trains = (x + y) miles

So, the total distance traveled by both trains in two days is:
Total Distance = Distance between Trains x 2 = (x + y)^2 miles

Therefore, the answer is:
Answer = (x + y)^2 miles"

"Response:  Clerie eats 3 eggs every morning for breakfast. If she continues this habit for 4 weeks, then...
1. Week 1: Clerie eats 3 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
2. Week 2: Clerie eats 3 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
3. Week 3: Clerie eats 3 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 21 eggs.
4. Week 4: Clerie eats 3 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 28 eggs.
Therefore, if Clerie continues to eat 3 eggs per day for 4 weeks, she will have consumed a total of 28 eggs."
"Response: 
If she took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and then another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles, that means she walked at a constant speed for 5 hours in total.
So, her average speed over those 5 hours is:
Speed = Total distance / Time taken = 12 miles / 5 hours = 2.4 miles/hour
Therefore, if she wants to finish walking the remaining distance of 8 miles at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour, it will take her:
Time = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 4 miles/hour = 2 hours
So, she needs to walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour for 2 hours to complete the remaining distance of 8 miles."
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange juice and add 15 liters of water to it, making it 25 liters in total. Then, we take out 1 liter of orange juice, leaving us with 24 liters. So, there are 24 - 1 = 23 liters of water in the remaining mixture.
Response:  According to the passage, Raymond was born six years before Samantha and is currently 23 years old. Therefore, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond's son would have been born about 8 years ago (i.e., when Raymond was 15 years old).
"Response: 
Step 1: The first three customers buy one DVD each. So, Bilili sells 3 DVDs on Wednesday.
Step 2: The next two customers buy 2 DVDs each. So, Bilili sells an additional 4 DVDs (2 x 2 = 4).
Step 3: The last three customers do not buy any DVDs. So, Bilili does not sell any more DVDs on Wednesday.
Total number of DVDs sold by Bilili on Wednesday = 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs."
"Response:  The fire burns for 1 hour every day from 1 pm to 5 pm. So in one hour, it will move forward by 2 centimeters. Therefore, if we calculate the distance traveled during this time period, we get: Distance = Speed x Time = 2 cm/hr x (5 hours - 1 hour) = 10 cm. 
So, after 5 hours, the fire will have moved forward by an additional 10 centimeters, making its total length 30 centimeters."
Response:  We know that Kylie paid $19.50 for the best-seller book last year, which was originally priced at $25%. So, we can calculate the original price of the book as follows: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage) Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) Original Price = $25 Originally, the book cost $25 before it was discounted to $19.50.
"Response: 
Marry ordered $12 worth of chicken, $3 worth of yogurt, $5 worth of apples, and $4 worth of pizza. In total, Marry paid $50. So, if one box of pizza costs $8.50, then Marry must have ordered how many boxes of pizza?
Let X be the number of boxes of pizza that Marry ordered.
From the problem statement, we know that Marry paid $50 for all the items she ordered. Therefore, the cost of each item is:
$12 (chicken) + $3 (yogurt) + $5 (apples) = $70
So, the cost of one box of pizza is:
$8.50 / $70 = 0.12 or 12% of the total cost
Now, we want to find out how many boxes of pizza Marry ordered. Since the cost of one box of pizza is $8.50, and Marry paid $50 in total, we can set up the following equation:
$8.50 x X = $50
Solving for X, we get:
X = $50 / $8.50 = 6
Therefore, Marry ordered 6 boxes of pizza."

"Response:  
Step 1: Calculate how many boxes of ice cream she buys per day.
She eats one box of ice cream every night, so she buys 365 boxes (one for each day) in a year.
Step 2: Calculate how much money she spends on ice cream per month.
Since there are 30 days in April and May, she spends $4 x 30 = $120 on ice cream in those two months combined.
Step 3: Calculate how much money she spends on ice cream over 60 days.
Since June has 30 days as well, she spends an additional $4 x 30 = $120 on ice cream in June alone. Therefore, her total spending on ice cream over 60 days is $120 + $120 = $240."
"Response: 
Henry traveled 60 miles on his bicycle tour and stopped twice. The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. So, we can calculate the distance between the two stops as follows:
Distance = End point - Second stop = 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles
Therefore, Henry traveled 45 miles between the first and second stops."
Response:  Gloria wants to buy shoes that cost $100 and she has budgeted $80 for them. She finds two pairs of shoes whose prices are $60 and $70 respectively. Since one pair of heels costs $33, if she buys both pairs of heels, they will cost her $66 ($33 + $33). So, the total amount she spends on shoes is $140 ($100 + $40), which is more than her budget of $80. Therefore, the answer is (D) More than $80.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Derek and Allen are currently 7 years old, which means their combined age is 7 x 2 = 14 years old. If they were born 10 years ago, then their current age would be 10 + 14 = 24 years old. Therefore, in 10 years, Allen's age will be 24 + 10 = 34 years old.
Response:  The first friend said there are 80 candies in the jar, and the second friend said there are 20 more than that, so there are 100 candies in total.

"Response: 
1. The dragon is 400 feet away from Polly when she throws the gold spear.
2. With the gold spear, Polly can throw it to a distance of 3 times the length of her arm (since she has a 5-foot long arm). Therefore, the maximum distance the gold spear could be thrown is 1500 feet (3 x 5 = 15).
3. However, if Polly has the silver bullet with her, she can throw it to a distance of twice the length of her arm (since she has a 5-foot long arm), which would be 1000 feet (2 x 5 = 10).
Therefore, the maximum distance the dragon's flame could reach without the silver bullet is 1500 feet, and with the silver bullet, it could reach up to 1000 feet."
"Response: 
Firstly, Mrs. Jones made five pies for the firefighters as an apology. Then she cut each pie into eight slices so that her guests could eat them directly. After everyone had eaten their fill and there were 14 remaining pieces of pie, how many slices did each guest take home?
So, if 14 pieces of pie remained after everyone had eaten their fill, and each pie was cut into 8 slices, then the number of slices taken home by each guest can be calculated as follows:
Number of slices taken home = Total number of pieces of pie / Number of guests
= 14 / 5 (guests)
= 2.8 (rounded to nearest whole number)
Therefore, each guest took home approximately 2.8 slices of pie."
Response:  If one scoop of protein powder contains 250 calories and you have 300g of protein powder in total (which is equal to 750 scoops), then you need to consume 750 x 250 = 187,500 calories per day. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, that means you still have 187,500 - 1800 = 169,500 calories left to consume. Therefore, you can eat up to 169,500 / 750 = approximately 224 grams of protein powder per day.
Response:  If Charlie sells each candle for $2, he will make a profit of $8 per candle ($2 - $1 = $8). Since he can make 10 candles at once with one pound of wax, and he has 10 pounds of wax, he can make 100 candles in total (10 x 10 = 100). So his overall profit from selling all 100 candles is $800 ($100 x 8 = $800).

"Response: 
Candice has 80 postcards and goes to the coffee shop. She spends some time there and then comes back to work with 220 coffee cups that each have one Post-it note attached. If she had 23 Post-it notes in total, how many Post-it notes were there in the package she purchased?
Let X be the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased.
Since Candice has 80 postcards, and each postcard has one Post-it note, the total number of Post-it notes is 80.
At the coffee shop, Candice spent some time and came back to work with 220 coffee cups, each having one Post-it note attached. So, the total number of Post-it notes at the coffee shop is 220.
The difference between the total number of Post-it notes at the coffee shop (220) and the total number of Post-it notes Candice had (80) is 140.
Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased is 140."
Response:  John paid $200 for each of the blue neckties that cost $40 each. So he bought 5 blue neckties in total. Now let's calculate how much he paid for each red tie. Since each red tie costs twice as much as the blue one, and John bought 3 times as many red ties as he did blue ones, we can conclude that John paid $120 per red tie ($2 x $60). Therefore, John paid a total of $800 for all 5 neckties ($200 x 5 = $1000)
Response:  We know that Treyce is using a 4-foot long train to transport tomato plants from one garden bed to another. Each tomato plant has a diameter of 6 inches. Since we want to find out how many pieces of track are needed to transport all the tomato plants, let's assume there are x number of tomato plants in total. Now, since each tomato plant takes up an area of π (pi) x radius^2 square feet, where radius = 6 inches / 2 = 3 inches, we can calculate the total surface area of all the tomato plants as follows: Total surface area = π x (3 inches)^2 = 9.41 square feet. Therefore, if we divide the length of the train (4 feet) by the width of the train (which is equal to half the diameter of the tomato plants), we get the number of pieces of track needed to transport all the tomato plants: Number of tracks = 4 feet / 3 inches = 13.33 pieces. So, there would be approximately 13.33 pieces of track needed to transport all the tomato plants.
Response:  Since Richard lives in an 15-story building and each floor has 8 units, there are 120 units in total (15 stories x 8 units/floor). Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that 90 units are actually occupied (3/4 x 120 = 90). So, there are 90 apartments in the building that Richard lives in.
"Response: 
1. Royd's chicken lays 252 eggs per day.

"Response:  Tom's boat can move at a speed of 10 miles per hour. If it moves for 5 hours from 1 pm to 4 pm, then it will have traveled a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 mph x 5 hrs = 50 miles

Now, if it returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour, it will take:

Time = Distance / Speed = 50 miles / 6 mph = 8.33 hours

Therefore, Tom's boat journey took 8.33 hours in total."
Response:  If we remove 30 comic books that have a weight of $15 each, then we will have $450 ($30 x $15). Now, if we divide this amount by the weight of each comic book (which is $1 per 4/5), we get $110. So, to remove 30 comic books, we need to pay $110.

Total income for Tuesday = $48

Day 3 (Wednesday):
* No tire repair at all
Total income for Wednesday = $0

Day 4 (Thursday):
* 6 truck tires and 4 car tires are repaired = $60 + $40 = $100
Total income for Thursday = $100

Day 5 (Friday):
* No tire repair at all
Total income for Friday = $0

Therefore, the total income for the week is: $100 + $48 + $0 + $100 + $0 = $248."
"Response: 
The two sisters had adopted seven kittens from the local animal shelter and were driving them back home in their car when they received a call from their mother that she had given birth to two more kittens at home. The first cat, Patchy, gave birth to three times as many kittens as Trixie did. So, if we assume that each litter has an average of 4-5 kittens per litter, then...
Let X be the number of kittens that Patchy gave birth to. Since Trixie gave birth to 12 kittens, we know that X + 12 = 3(X). Solving for X, we get X = 36. Therefore, there are currently 36 kittens being raised by the two sisters."

"Response:  Peter has $42 to spend on movies for one week. If he spends $7 per ticket and $7 per popcorn every time he goes to the movies, how many times can he go to the movies in one week?

1. First movie: $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14
Total cost for first movie = $42 - $14 = $28
Number of movies he can go to in one week = $28 / $7 = 4 times
2. Second movie: $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14
Total cost for second movie = $42 - $14 = $28
Number of movies he can go to in one week = $28 / $7 = 4 times
3. Third movie: $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14
Total cost for third movie = $42 - $14 = $28
Number of movies he can go to in one week = $28 / $7 = 4 times
...
Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 4 times in one week."
"Response: 
The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is equal to the total weight of the truck and driver minus the weight of the bridge itself.
Weight of truck and driver = 3755 pounds
Weight of bridge = 5000 pounds - 15 pounds (per box) x Number of boxes
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is:
Number of boxes = 3755 pounds - 5000 pounds + 15 pounds (per box) x Number of boxes
= 2245 pounds / 15 pounds per box

Step 1: Ali receives $140 per month for one year.
$140 x 12 = $1,680 (total amount paid by Ali)
Step 2: The streaming service charges an initial fee of $50 for the first six months ($140 x 1/3).
$1,680 - $50 = $1,630 (amount left to be paid by Ali after the initial fee)
Step 3: For the remaining six months, the streaming service charges a reduced fee of $40 per month ($140 x 1/2).
$1,630 / $40 = 40 months (number of months Ali pays the reduced fee)
Therefore, the total amount Ali pays for the streaming service is:
$1,680 + $40 x 40 = $6,720
So, Ali pays a total of $6,720 for the streaming service over one year."

"Response: 
The cloud covers the city every 10 minutes, and it takes 3 miles to cover the entire city. If the city is 42 miles long from the coast to the opposite side, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many times the cloud covers the entire city in one hour.
We know that the cloud covers the city every 10 minutes, so it covers the entire city 6 times in one hour.

Step 2: Calculate how far the cloud travels in one hour.
Since the cloud moves at a speed of 3 miles per hour, it travels 6 x 3 = 18 miles in one hour.

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for the cloud to cover the entire distance of the city.
Since the city is 42 miles long, it will take the cloud 42 / 18 = 2.3 hours to cover the entire distance.

"Response: 
Franky watches his favorite show every Monday and Tuesday for 1 hour each. On Wednesday, he finishes his homework early and watches 2 episodes of a 1-hour show and 3 episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he watches another episode of the 1-hour show. And on Friday, he doesn't have time to watch any shows because he has work. So if Franky watched TV for 7 hours in total, then how many times did he watch the 30-minute show on Wednesday?
Let X be the number of times Franky watched the 30-minute show on Wednesday. Since he finished his homework early, he had extra time to watch TV, so the total time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 3 = 4 hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
X × 4 = 7
Solving for X, we get:
X = 7 / 4 = 1.75
So Franky watched the 30-minute show on Wednesday 1.75 times."

"Response: 
The boat travelled for 20 feet (6.2 meters) in 16 seconds, so it traveled at a speed of:
Speed = Distance / Time = 20 ft / 16 s = 1.25 ft/s
Now, let's find out how much water the boat displaced during this time:
Displacement = Volume of water displaced = Length x Width x Depth
Since we are given that the boat is 10 feet wide and 20 feet long, and it displaces 2 liters of water per second, we can calculate the volume of water displaced as follows:
Volume of water displaced = Length x Width x Depth = 10 ft x 20 ft x 2 l/s = 40 cubic feet
Therefore, the boat displaced 40 cubic feet of water during the 16-second period. To convert this to liters, we divide the volume in cubic feet by 1000 (since there are 1000 liters in a cubic foot):
Volume of water displaced (in liters) = 40 cu ft / 1000 = 40 liters
So, the boat displaced 40 liters of water during the 16-second period."

Profit per piece = Selling price - Cost = $10 - $1 = $9.
Step 3: Calculate the total profit from selling all the wood.
Total profit = Number of pieces x Profit per piece = 10 x $9 = $90.
Therefore, if she sells everything, she will make a profit of $90."
"Response: 
Katy uses 7:13 ratio to make coffee with sugar and water. If she uses x cups of sugar and y cups of water, then...
x + y = 120 (total amount of liquid used)
Now, we need to find out how many cups of sugar Katy used based on the given information. So, let's substitute x = 7/13 into the equation above:
x + (7/13)y = 120
Simplifying the equation:
4y = 83
Now, we can find out how many cups of water Katy used by dividing the total amount of liquid used (120) by the number of cups of water (y):
120 / y = 83
Solving for y:
y = 16
So, Katy used 16 cups of water in making her coffee. And since she used a 7:13 ratio, she also used 7/13 cup of sugar."

Response:  Morisete brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so together they have 13 fruits (5 + 8 = 13). Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisete, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. So, in total, there are 13 + 10 = 23 fruits on the tree.
"Response: 
Day 1: 8 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours
Day 2: 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours
Total time spent sleeping in one week: 8 hours + 8 hours = 16 hours
Therefore, if she slept for 1 hour more than the remaining days of the week, she would have slept for a total of 17 hours in that week."
Response:  If she runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, then she has run a total distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. After that, if she reduces her speed to 8 km/h, it will take her 7 hours to cover a distance equal to 7 x 8 = 56 kilometers. Therefore, in 7 hours, she can cover a distance of approximately 56 / 2 = 28 miles.
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that there are 60 letters in total that need stamps and have already been written.
Then, Jenny starts to stamp the letters with 1/3 of the remaining letters (which is 20 letters). So, the number of letters she has to stamp now is 40 letters (60 - 20 = 40).
Finally, if there were 30 letters already stamped when Jenny started, then the total number of letters she needs to stamp is 70 letters (40 + 30 = 70).
Therefore, the answer is 70 letters."

"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes spent by patients in the hospital per day.
Total minutes = Number of patients x Time spent per patient
= 500 patients x 24 minutes/patient
= 12,000 minutes/day
Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned by doctors for their consultation services per day.
Total amount earned by doctors = Number of doctors x Amount charged per doctor
= 150 doctors x $150/doctor
= $22,500/day
Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned by the hospital per day from both patients and doctors.
Total amount earned by the hospital = Total minutes spent by patients x Amount charged per minute
+ Total amount earned by doctors x Amount charged per doctor
Total amount earned by the hospital = 12,000 minutes/day x $200/minute
+ $22,500/day
To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to subtract its costs from its revenue.
Costs = Salaries of nurses + Cost of medicines + Other expenses
Let's assume the salary of a nurse is $60,000/year, or $5,000/month. The cost of medicines can be assumed to be $10,000/month. Other expenses can be assumed to be $5,000/month.
Profit = Revenue - Costs
= $27,500/day (total amount earned) - ($5,000 + $10,000 + $5,000)
= $12,500/day
Therefore, the hospital earns a daily profit of $12,500."
"Response: 
We know that Nisa hired 60 seasonal workers to play Santa at her mall.
Out of these, 3/5 or 60% are children who played Santa after being chosen by lottery.
So, the number of adult Elves (10) is equal to the number of children who did not get to play Santa.
Therefore, the total number of Elves = 60 - 10 = 50.
So, there were 50 Elves left in the mall after the children finished playing Santa."

Secondly, she ordered two chips at $1.50 each, so the total cost of the chips is $3.00 (2 x $1.50).
Lastly, she ordered two cookies at $1.00 each, so the total cost of the cookies is $2.00 (2 x $1.00).
Therefore, the total cost of the order including delivery fee and tip is: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00."
"Response: 

First test (75 questions): Mark took 8 hours to complete this test, so he answered 75/8 = 9 questions per hour.

Second test (100 questions): Mark took 6 hours to complete this test, so he answered 100/6 = 16.67 questions per hour.

Since Mark did not finish both tests in the same amount of time, we can conclude that he left some unanswered questions at the end of the second test. To find out how many questions he left unanswered, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered from the total number of questions in the second test:

100 - (9 x 2) = 40 questions left unanswered.

Therefore, Mark left 40 questions unanswered at the end of the second test."
Response:  We know that there are 22 red rubber balls and 4 times as many blue rubber balls, so there are 88 blue rubber balls in total (22 + 336). If there are 12 blue marbles, then there are 12 / 88 = 0.14 or 14% as many red rubber balls as blue rubber balls. Therefore, there are 12 / 0.14 = 90 red rubber balls.

"Response:  Jordan works for 2 hours every day playing video games and earns $10 per hour as a part-time job. To calculate how much he can earn in a week, we need to multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week. So, if there are 7 days in a week, then:

$10/hour x 2 hours/day = $20/day
$20/day x 7 days/week = $140/week

Therefore, Jordan can earn around $140 in a week by playing video games instead of working as a part-time job."
"Response: 
John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and traps for $4. If there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, what will be the price of each item after tax?

Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item without tax.
Milk: $2
Eggs: $3
Light bulbs: $3
Cups: $3
Traps: $4

Total cost without tax: $9 + $6 + $6 + $3 + $4 = $28

Step 2: Calculate the tax amount for each item. Since it's a flat rate of 10%, we can simply multiply the cost of each item by 0.10 (10%).
Tax amount: $28 x 0.10 = $2.80

Step 3: Add the tax amount to the original cost of each item to get the final price with tax.
Final price with tax: $28 + $2.80 = $30.80

Therefore, the prices of the items after tax are:
Milk: $28 / $30.80 = $9.35
Eggs: $30.80 / $30.80 = $10.00
Light bulbs: $30.80 / $30.80 = $10.00
Cups: $30.80 / $30.80 = $10.00
Traps: $30.80 / $30.80 = $10.00"
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Kim has three customers and he is expecting to get $100 from each of them every month. So, his total expected revenue for this month would be:
$100 x 3 = $300
Now, let's consider the cost of the cleaning supplies. Each bottle of cleaner costs $20, and he needs two bottles per customer. Therefore, his total cost for cleaning supplies would be:
$20 x 6 (customers) = $120
So, his total expenses for this month would be:
$300 - $120 = $180
Now, let's calculate his profit for this month:
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
= $300 - $180
= $120
Therefore, Kim can expect to make a profit of $120 per month."
"Response: 

Step 1: Calculate the total area of land that John owns in hectares (h).

Step 2: Calculate the number of ananas per hectare (n).

$$ n = 100 \text{ anans/ha} $$

Step 3: Calculate the total number of ananas that John can harvest in one month (m).

$$ m = 3 \times 100 \text{ anans/ha} = 300 \text{ anans} $$

Step 4: Repeat Step 3 for each of the next two months to find the total number of ananas that John can harvest over the course of three months (t).

$$ t = 3 \times 300 \text{ anans} = 900 \text{ anans} $$

Therefore, John can harvest $900$ ananas over the course of three months."

"Response: 

1. In one hour, 30 bees come and go from the hive. (So in 6 hours, they will come and go 30 x 6 = 180 times.)
2. After 6 hours, half of the original number of bees return to the hive. (So after 6 hours, there are 15 bees left outside the hive.)
3. Debra saw twice as many bees leave the hive than returned during the next 6 hours. (So she saw 30 - 15 = 15 bees leave the hive during that time.)
4. Therefore, the total number of bees that came and went from the hive during the entire 12-hour period is 180 + 15 = 195 bees."
Response:  Bridgette and her mother went to the museum together. The entrance fee for an adult is $12, and for a child it is $10.

Step 1: Distance between Steve and school (S = 3 miles)
Step 2: Speed of Steve on bike (V = 440 ft/min)
Step 3: Time taken by Steve to reach school (t =?)
Step 4: Distance between Team and school (d = 3 km)
Step 5: Speed of Team on skateboard (v = 264 ft/min)
Step 6: Time taken by Team to reach home after losing (t' =?)
Question: How long will the winner have to wait at home after winning?
Solution:
Let W be the time waited by the winner at home after winning.
From Step 5, we know that the team takes t minutes to reach home after losing. Therefore, the time waited by the winner is given by:
W = t + d / V
Substituting the values, we get:
W = (3 km) / (264 ft/min) + 3 min
W = 12.78 min
Therefore, the winner will have to wait for approximately 12.78 minutes after winning before reaching home."

"Response: 

Step 1 (Current price): The current price of one pound of gold is $20 per troy ounce. So, the current price of Han Boong-tou's gold coin is $20 x 0.032 = $0.64 per gram.

Step 2 (Price increase): Every two months, the price of gold increases by 20% of the original price. Therefore, after two months, the new price of Han Boong-tou's gold coin will be:

$0.64 x 1.20 = $0.72 per gram

Step 3 (Continuous increase): We need to continue this process for 36 months, so we can calculate the price of Han Boong-tou's gold coin at each time period as follows:

Month 1: $0.64 per gram
Month 2: $0.72 per gram (increase of $0.08)
Month 3: $0.80 per gram (increase of $0.08)

"Response:  
1. The age of Red is 3 years more than that of Salley. So, Red is 3 + x = 56 years old. (Where x is the age of Salley)
2. Salley is 2 years younger than her mother. So, Salley's mother is 2 + x = 58 years old.
3. The total age of all four birds is equal to the sum of their ages. Therefore, we can write: 4(x + 3) = 56 + 58...(1)
Now let's substitute the values given in the question:
x = 32 (since Salley is 32 years old)
So, equation (1) becomes: 4(32 + 3) = 56 + 58...(2)
Simplifying equation (2), we get: 4(35) = 104...(3)
Therefore, the total age of all four birds is 104 years."
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of debt that Jessica has. The minimum monthly payment for her student loan is $300, for her credit card it is $200, and for her mortgage it is $500. Therefore, the total amount of debt she has is:
Total Debt = Student Loan + Credit Card + Mortgage
= $300 x 12 + $200 x 12 + $500 x 12
= $36,000 + $24,000 + $60,000
= $110,000
Now, if Jessica wants to pay off at least 50% of her debt in one year, she needs to make monthly payments equal to:
Monthly Payment = Total Debt / (Number of Months x Percentage to be Paid)
= $110,000 / (12 x 0.5)
= $9,167 per month
Therefore, if Jessica wants to pay off at least 50% of her debt within one year, she will have to make monthly payments of $9,167 for 12 months."

"Response:  Juan and Carlos sell lemonade for $1 per gallon, sugar is $2 per gallon, and they give away one cup free with every gallon sold. If they make a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
Revenue = Number of gallons sold x Price per gallon
= 100 gallons x $1 per gallon
= $100

Step 2: Calculate the cost of sugar.
Cost of sugar = Total revenue x Cost per gallon of sugar
= $100 x $2 per gallon
= $200

Step 3: Calculate the profit made from selling lemonade.
Profit = Revenue - Cost
= $100 - $200
= -$100

So, if Juan and Carlos made a profit of $25, then they spent $25 / (-$100) = $250 on lemons."
"Response: 
We know that there were 240 Asian people in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese people was 160 (240 - 80).
Now, we are told that the number of male Chinese athletes was 60. Therefore, the number of female Chinese athletes must be:
Female Chinese athletes = Total number of Chinese athletes - Male Chinese athletes
= 160 - 60
= 100
So, there were 100 female Chinese athletes in the race."
"Response: 

Firstly, we know that $1/4$ of Jade's income goes towards rent ($1500\times \frac{1}{4} = 375$).

Secondly, we know that $1/3$ of Jade's income goes towards car expenses ($1500\times \frac{1}{3} = 500$).

Lastly, we know that Jade donates $\$200$ to his daughter and $\$700$ to his wife for groceries and other household items.

Now let's calculate how much money Jade has left after paying all these bills:

Money left = Total Income - Rent - Car Expenses - Donations
= $1500 - $375 - $500 - $200 - $700
= $1500 - $1575
= $-175$

So, Jade has $\-$175 left after paying all his bills."
"Response: 
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monica, so Rani has 30 crabs (30 = 20 + 10).
Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monica has 36 crabs (36 = 40 - 4).
Now, let's find out how many crabs Boris has. Since Boris has 40 crabs and Monica has 36 crabs, we can say that Boris has 4 crabs more than Monica, i.e., Boris has 36 + 4 = 40 crabs.
So, the total number of crabs possessed by all three is:
Rani has 30 crabs, Monica has 36 crabs, and Boris has 40 crabs. Therefore, the total number of crabs is 30 + 36 + 40 = 106 crabs."
Response:  The first week, Lloyd spent $10 per hour for 5 hours, so he spent $50 in total. In the second week, he spent $10 per hour for 8 hours, so he spent $80 in total. Therefore, over the two weeks, Lloyd spent a total of $130 ($50 + $80).
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of votes that both candidates have received.
Candidate A has received 3/4 of the votes, which is equal to 3 x 80 = 240 votes.
Candidate B has also received 3/4 of the votes, which is equal to 3 x 80 = 240 votes.
So, the total number of votes for both candidates is 240 + 240 = 480 votes.
Step 2: Calculate the number of votes that Candidate B received.
Since Candidate B lost, we know that their vote share is less than 3/4. Let's say they received x votes out of 80.
We can set up an equation based on this information:
x / 80 = (480 - 240) / 80
Solving for x, we get:
x = 160
Therefore, Candidate B received 160 votes in total."
Response:  Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations (which is 160 red roses). She also ordered 200 pink lilies. So far, so good! However, she threatened to switch suppliers if they didn't deliver all of the red roses by 5 PM today. To find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver by that time, we need to divide the total number of red roses by the number of hours left until 5 PM: Number of red roses delivered = Total number of red roses / Number of hours left until 5 PM = 160 red roses / 7 hours = 22 red roses per hour Now, let's convert this rate into minutes: 22 red roses/hour x 60 minutes/hour = 1320 red roses per hour Finally, we can calculate how many red roses Fred needs to deliver by 5 PM today: Total number of red roses / Time left until delivery = 160 red roses / 7 hours = 22 red roses per hour x 5 hours = 110 red roses By 5 PM today, Fred needs to deliver 110 red roses to satisfy Sandra's order and avoid switching suppliers.
"Response: 
Jin is 2 years older than Mark, so Jin is 2 + 2 = 4 years old than Mark.
Mark was 5 years older than Jan, so Mark was 5 + 1 = 6 years old than Jan.
Since Jan is 30 years old, Jean is 30 - 6 = 24 years old."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the time taken by each team in their respective races.
Team A - 55 seconds (very fast)
Team B - 60 + 3 = 63 seconds (less fast)
Step 2: Determine the difference between the times taken by both teams in their respective races.
Time difference = Team B's time - Team A's time
= 63 seconds - 55 seconds
= 8 seconds
Therefore, based on the given information, Team A can potentially win by 8 seconds."
Response:  The probability of throwing a number that is greater than $3$ is $\frac{1}{6}$. Now, let's calculate the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers that are both odd or both even. There are $3$ ways to do this (either all odd, all even, or one odd and one even). So, the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers that are not in the same pair is $\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, the probability of throwing three consecutive numbers that are not in the same pair is $\frac{3}{4}$ (since there are now $4$ possible pairs to choose from). Finally, the probability of throwing four consecutive numbers that are not in the same pair is $\frac{4}{5}$ (since there are now $5$ possible pairs to choose from). Thus, the probability of throwing a number that is greater than $3$ while avoiding any triplets of consecutive numbers that are in the same pair is $\frac{5}{6}$.
Response:  If Jenna and her mother together picked 30 apples from the orchard, then Jenna must have had half of them, which is 15 apples. So, if Jenna's mother received 20 apples, then they must have had altogether 35 apples (15 + 20).
"Response: 
Step 1: We know that Russell works at an animal store and gives treats to mice. There are 3 groups of mice, each containing 6 mice. So, there are in total 3 x 6 = 18 mice.
Step 2: Now, we know that each hamster has 5 treats, and there are 10 hamsters in total. Therefore, the total number of treats given to hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50 treats.
Step 3: Finally, we know that there are 20 rabbits in the store, and each rabbit gets 4 treats. So, the total number of treats given to rabbits is 20 x 4 = 80 treats.
Now, let's calculate the total number of treats available for all animals in the store: 18 mice + 50 hamsters + 80 rabbits = 148 treats.
So, there are 148 treats available for all animals in the store."
"Response:  The amount of money that Mendi owes to Benedict is $100. They agreed to pay an interest rate of 2% per month. If Mendi pays the debt in 3 months, how much will she owe Benedict then?

Step 1: Calculate the total interest paid for 3 months
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $100 x 2% x 3/12
= $6

So, after 3 months, Mendi will have paid a total of $106 ($100 + $6) towards the debt.

Step 2: Calculate the new balance after payment
New Balance = Old Balance - Payment
= $100 - $106
= -$6

Since Mendi has already paid $106 towards the debt, her new balance with Benedict would be -$6 (-$106). In other words, Benedict now owes Mendi $106."
"Response:  
1. The farmer sells 20 kg of rice to the merchant for $20 per kilogram. So, the total amount of money exchanged between them is $20 x 20 = $400.
2. To transport one bag (which weighs 50 kg) from the farm to the merchant's store, it costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of transporting all 30 bags ($30 x $2 = $60).
So, the merchant earned a profit of $400 - $60 = $340.
Therefore, the merchant sold 30 bags of rice."
"Response: 
The three friends spent $20.25 for tickets to the park festival. They also paid $4.50 less than the cost of food. So, the total amount they spent on food is:
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
Now, let's consider the other two expenses:
* The first friend went to two other attractions and paid $33 each time. Therefore, he spent a total of:
$33 x 2 = $66
* The second friend went to one attraction and paid $33. Therefore, she spent:
$33
So, the total amount each friend spent is:
Friend 1: $66 + $15.75 = $81.75
Friend 2: $33 + $15.75 = $48.75
Friend 3: $15.75
Therefore, the answer is:
Friend 1: $81.75
Friend 2: $48.75
Friend 3: $15.75"
"Response:  John can collect 2 fruits per minute, so he can collect in total...

Please fill in the blank with the appropriate number."
"Response:  Since one pound of insects is equivalent to 16 ounces (oz), we can calculate the number of insects needed for each ostrich as follows:

1 oz = 28.35 grams (g)

So, to determine how many grams of insects an ostrich needs per day, we divide the weight of an ostrich (in pounds) by 16:

1 lb / 16 oz = 64 g/day

Now, since there are 10 mares in the herd, we multiply the daily requirement for each ostrich by 10 to get the total amount of insects needed per day:

10 x 64 g/day = 640 g/day

Therefore, if there are 10 mares in the herd, they need approximately 640 grams of insects per day to survive."
Response:  Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees per year. So after 10 years, he has planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees. Now, in the next 10 years, 30% of the trees will die, which means that 30/100 = 30 trees will be dead. Therefore, after 20 years, there will be 70 trees left (100 - 30 = 70).
Response:  On Friday morning (day 1), 18 pink plastic flamingos were placed in front of Su's house. On Saturday morning (day 2), 3/5 of them (6 flamingos) were taken away and replaced with white ones. So, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left in front of Su's house. Then, on Sunday morning (day 3), another 18 pink flamingos were added to the total number, making it 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos in front of Su's house. Therefore, the difference between the number of pink flamingos on Sunday afternoon and the number on Friday morning is 30 - 18 = 12 more pink flamingos.
Response:  If Viollet buys one pack of pens for $2, and she wants to buy 5 different colored pens that cost $2 each, then she will spend a total of $10 (5 x $2). So, she will have $10 - $2 = $8 left after buying the pens.
Response:  If one pen costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30, then 8 pens would cost $9.60 ($1.20 x 8). Therefore, the value of 8 pens is $9.60.
"Response:  Since there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of kale, we have:
Number of pounds of kale = Number of restaurants x Amount per restaurant
= 40 x 2
= 80 pounds
Therefore, 80 pounds of kale will not be used."
"Response:  According to the given information, there are exactly 23786 people living in Soda City. Out of these, 8417 are males and 9092 are females. So, the number of children (including infants) is equal to the total population minus the number of males and females. Therefore, the number of children in Soda City is:

23786 - 8417 + 9092 = 15377

So, there are approximately 15377 children living in Soda City."
"Response:  
Step 1: Elena had 20 cards in the first month. (Given)
Step 2: She collected three times as many cards in the second month, so she had 60 cards in total (20 x 3 = 60).
Step 3: In the third month, she collected half as many cards again, so she had 30 cards left (60 / 2 = 30).
Therefore, the total number of Pokémon cards Elena had was 30."
"Response:  Mark edits 1000 sentences per week for Publisher A and receives $0.05 per sentence from them. Since Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, he receives $0.10 per sentence from Publisher B. Therefore, Mark earns a total of:
$0.05 x 1000 = $50 per week from Publisher A
$0.10 x 1000 = $100 per week from Publisher B
So, Mark earns a total of $150 per week."
"Response:  
1. In the morning, he drinks 5 liters of water from the well every day. So, in one day, he drinks 5 liters x 24 hours = 120 liters of water.
2. Similarly, in the evening, he also drinks 5 liters of water from the well every day. Therefore, in one day, he drinks 5 liters x 24 hours = 120 liters of water again.
Total amount of water drunk per day = 120 liters + 120 liters = 240 liters."
"Response:  If John receives $5000 as one-time bonus and his salary increases by 5%, then his monthly income will be:
$5000 x (1 + 0.05) = $5250
If he earns $2000 per month, then his total annual income will be:
$2000 x 12 = $24,000
So, in this case, John earned $24,000 that year."
"Response: 

Jooshi has 10 acres of land for farming grapes and produces 5 tons of grapes per acre per year. Since she produces 2 barrels of wine from each ton of grapes, she produces 10 barrels of wine per year (5 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels).

Now, we need to find out how many barrels Jooshi produces in total. We know that her farm covers 10 acres, so the total area is 10 acres x 43,560 square feet/acre = 435,600 square feet.

Since she produces 10 barrels of wine per year and there are 435,600 square feet in her farm, we can calculate the number of barrels produced as follows:

Number of barrels produced = Total area of the farm / Number of barrels produced per year
= 435,600 square feet / 10 barrels/year
= 43,560 barrels/year

Therefore, Jooshi produces around 43,560 barrels of wine per year."
"Response: 
Kal likes cheese and eats it every day for lunch with sandwiches. He adds two pieces of cheese to each sandwich. For breakfast, he eats cheese and an omelette. Three times a week, he eats more omelettes than sandwiches, and he makes many macaroni and cheese dishes with eight pieces of cheese. How many pieces of cheese did Kal eat in total?
Let X be the number of pieces of cheese Kal ate in total.
From the question, we know that Kal ate 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich (for lunch) and 1 piece of cheese per omelette (for breakfast). So, the total number of pieces of cheese Kal ate for lunch is 3X, and the total number of pieces of cheese Kal ate for breakfast is 1X = 4X.
Since Kal made many macaroni and cheese dishes, let Y be the number of dishes he made. Then, the total number of pieces of cheese Kal used is 8X + 4X = 12X.
Now, we can find X by solving the equation above:
X = 12X / 16 = 8.
So, Kal ate 8 pieces of cheese in total."
"Response: 

Jennet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens initially. She then bought 6 blue pens and 2 red pens. The blue pens have 9 pens each, and the red pens have 6 pens each.

So, Jennet now has:

* Green pens: 22 - 6 = 16
* Yellow pens: 10 - 2 = 8
* Blue pens: 6 x 9 = 54
* Red pens: 2 x 6 = 12

Therefore, Jennet now has a total of 72 pens (16 + 8 + 54 + 12)."
Response:  Brandy has taken 5 exams so far and got scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71, which means that the average score for the first 5 exams is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 84. To get an average score of 93 in the next 6 exams, Brandy needs to make up for the difference between her current average and the desired average, which is (93 - 84) x 6 = 9. So she needs to get at least 9 more points than her current average in the remaining 6 exams.
"Response: 
Michael rode his bike for 5 days in a row and covered 25 km each day, so he covered a total distance of 125 km (25 km/day x 5 days) during that period. Then, he decided to ride only twice a week instead of every day, but he still managed to cover an average distance of 60 km per session. Therefore, Michael covered a total distance of 1800 km (60 km/session x 3 weeks) during the next 3 weeks. In summary, Michael covered a total distance of 125 km + 1800 km = 1925 km."
Response:  We know that there are 25 pieces of chocolate bars and 80 pieces of candies in Jo's candy bag. Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, so there are 40 x 25 = 1000 grams of chocolate in the bag. Now, let's calculate the total weight of the bag: 1000 grams + 80 x 5 (since each candy weighs 5 grams) = 960 grams. Therefore, Jo's candy bag weighs approximately 960 grams.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes at the store. On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought 3 times as many cakes as she bought on Monday, which is 12 cakes (since 3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought 5 times as many cakes as she bought on Tuesday, which is 60 cakes (since 5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, in total, Rose bought 72 cakes over those three days ($4 + $12 + $60 = $76$).
Response:  The total cost of buying all 20 cups is $6,000. If each cup costs $300 less than the price of the entire container, then the price of each cup is $5,800 ($6,000 - $1200). Therefore, the cost of each cup is $5,800 / 20 = $290 per cup.
"Response: 

Step 1: Calculate how much money Sarah has saved so far.
Sarah has saved $10 + ($4 x 4) = $10 + $16 = $26.

Step 2: Calculate how much money Sarah needs to save each month to buy the new clothes and shoes she wants.
The cost of the new clothes and shoes is $30 + $20 = $50. To find out how many months it will take for Sarah to save enough money, we divide the total cost by her monthly savings: $50 / $26 = 1.92 months (or approximately 2 months).

Therefore, if Sarah continues to save money at this rate, she will be able to buy the new clothes and shoes in approximately 2 months after she starts saving."
"Response: 
1. The red hen lays 3 eggs per day.
2. The white hen lays 5 eggs per day.
3. Jeremy collects 42 eggs every day.
So, the total number of eggs laid by both hens is:
Red hen - 3 x 7 = 21 eggs/day
White hen - 5 x 7 = 35 eggs/day
Total eggs collected by Jeremy - 42 eggs/day
Therefore, the number of red hens is:
Number of red hens = Total eggs / Number of eggs laid by each red hen
= 21 eggs/day / 3 eggs/red hen
= 7 red hens
So, there are 7 red hens."
Response:  If Gerry walks at a speed of 5 km/h, he will cover a distance of 5 x 6 = 30 kilometers in one hour. Therefore, if he walks for 6 hours (which is the length of the side of the rectangle), he will have covered a total distance of 30 x 6 = 180 kilometers.
Response:  On day 1, Sloane had 100 customers in her store. On day 2, she had 150 customers (including the additional 50 from day 1). On day 3, she had 200 customers (including the additional 50 from day 2). Therefore, on day 3, Sloane had 50 more customers than on day 2. So, the number of customers on day 3 was 200 + 50 = 250 customers.
"Response: 
Let X be the amount of water in the small pool initially. Since both pools have the same rate of leakage (4 gallons per minute), the amount of water in the big pool after 4 minutes is also 4 times that of the small pool:
X + 4(X) = 16X
Now we know that the amount of water in the big pool is 16 times that of the small pool, so the amount of water in the small pool now is:
X = 16/17X
Therefore, there are 17X gallons of water in the small pool now."
"Response:  Lorri wants to buy $320 shoes and $32 belt. Her part-time job pays her $8 per hour. To calculate how many hours she needs to work before buying the shoes and belt, we can use the following formula:

Total cost of shoes + Total cost of belt = Hourly wage x Number of hours worked

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

$320 + $32 = $8 x Number of hours worked

Number of hours worked = $8 x $320 / ($32 + $8)
= $8 x $320 / $40
= 80 hours

Therefore, Lorri needs to work for 80 hours before buying the shoes and belt."
Response:  The total amount of money that Genes promised to lend is $2000. If he pays back $165 per month for 12 months, then the total amount paid back will be $2000 x 12 = $24,000. So, the remaining balance after 12 months will be $2000 - $24,000 = $-23,800.
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and more than 7 daisies. So, let's assume that there are x daisies. Since there are 4 roses, we can write an equation as follows: Total flowers = Roses + Daisies...(1) Now, we have to find out how many daisies are there. From the question, we know that there are more than 7 daisies, so we can write another equation as follows: Number of daisies = Total daisies - 7...(2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: Total flowers = Roses + (Total daisies - 7)...(3) Now, we need to solve for the value of Total flowers. To do this, we will use the information given in the question that there are 4 roses and more than 7 daisies. Therefore, we can substitute these values into equation (3) as follows: Total flowers = 4 + (x - 7)...(4) Now, we need to solve for the value of x, which is the number of daisies. To do this, we will divide both sides of equation (4) by 4, giving us: x = Total flowers / 4...(5) Finally, substituting the value of Total flowers from equation (4) into equation (5), we get: x = 4 + (x - 7) / 4...(6) Simplifying equation (6), we get: x = 11...(7) Therefore, there are 11 daisies in addition to the 4 roses in the vase.
"Response: 
Adrian is three times older than Harry, and Harry is one-half of Jack's age. If Jack is 21 years old now, then in 3 years, Adrian will be 3 x 3 = 9 years older than Jack. Therefore, Adrian's current age is 9 + 21 = 30 years old."
Response:  We know that Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored more than Naomi by 10 points. So Yuri scored at least 78 points (68 + 10 = 78). Brian also scored more than Naomi by 17 points, so he scored at least 95 points (68 + 17 = 95). Finally, Jojo scored some points but less than all of them. Therefore, Jojo scored fewer than 95 points.

"Response:  We know that Selin used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank after she finished is:
Tank capacity = 120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters
Therefore, there are 30 liters of water remaining in the tank now."
Response:  Andy has planted 90 geraniums and wants to reduce that number by 40. So, he will have 50 geraniums left after reducing them. Now, we need to find out how many flowers Andy has planted in total. Since each geranium produces multiple flowers, let's assume that one geranium produces an average of 3 flowers (this is just an estimate). Therefore, Andy has planted 150 flowers (50 x 3) in total.
Response:  The company spent $15000 in advertising for one year and then spent $5000 in the next year. So, the total amount of money spent on advertising over two years is: $15000 + $5000 = $20000.
"Response: 
Carlos pays $30 per hour for the kayak and Benji pays $18 per hour for the banana boat. If Carlos uses the kayak for 3 hours and Benji uses the banana boat for 5 hours, how much money will they pay in total?
To find out, we need to multiply the time each person used the boat by their respective rental price. So, for Carlos, he paid $30 x 3 = $90 for the kayak, and for Benji, he paid $18 x 5 = $90 for the banana boat. Therefore, the total amount they paid together is $90 + $90 = $180."
"Response: 
From New Jersey to Rochester, it takes 6 days by bus and half that time (3 days) by car. So, if we travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and then take a car to return to New Jersey, it will take us approximately 9 days in total."
Response:  If James has 30 water cards and 20 full cards, then he has a total of 50 cards. If he loses 8 water cards and gains 14 full cards, his new card count is 50 - 8 + 14 = 66 cards. Since there are only two types of cards, we can calculate the probability of drawing a water card as follows: Probability of drawing a water card = Number of water cards / Total number of cards = 8 / 66 = 0.127 (approximately).
"Response: 

Firstly, the basic burrito costs $6.50.
Secondly, the customer adds an additional $2 for extra meat, which brings the total cost to $8.50 ($6.50 + $2).
Thirdly, the customer adds another $1 for avocado, bringing the total cost to $9.50 ($8.50 + $1).
Fourthly, the customer pays an additional $3 for salsa and guacamole, making the final cost $12.50 ($9.50 + $3).
Lastly, the customer uses a $5 gift card to pay for the meal, reducing the amount owed to $7.50 ($12.50 - $5).
Therefore, the customer owes a total of $7.50 for their meal."
"Response: 
Kalinda has 360 pieces of candy and wants to share them equally among her mother and herself. Since Kalinda can divide each piece into 4 equal parts, she will have 90 pieces after dividing them (360 / 4 = 90).
Now, Kalinda's mother can also divide each piece into 4 equal parts, so she will have 225 pieces in total (90 x 4 = 225).
Therefore, it will take approximately 225 minutes for Kalinda and her mother to finish the puzzle together (360 pieces / 2 people = 180 pieces per person / 4 parts per piece = 45 minutes per person)."
"Response: 

As Ashlin knew that 120 melons were produced in the greenhouse and she prepared 30% of them for harvesting, then there are 36 melons (120 x 0.3) left in the greenhouse after preparation.

Two weeks later, when Ashlin returned home, there were only 24 melons left (36 x 0.75), as 3/4 of them had been harvested. Therefore, there were 24 melons left in the greenhouse after two weeks."
"Response: 
Firstly, Mark sells each car for $20,000, so he earns total revenue of $240,000 ($20,000 x 12 cars).
Secondly, he pays 10% tax on his income, which is $24,000 (($240,000 x 10%).
Thirdly, he spends an additional $1,000 per car for registration fees, making it a total of $12,000 ($1,000 x 12 cars).
Therefore, Mark will have to pay a total of $364,000 ($240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000) in taxes and registration fees."
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 shells and Robert collected 20 shells. So, in total, they collected 25 shells (5 + 20). On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, which means she collected 10 shells (2 x 5 = 10). Therefore, the total number of shells collected by Kylie and Robert is 35 (25 + 10).
"Response:  If there are 50 ants in the garden and each ant can carry food that is 1/4 of its body weight, then...
Step-by-step calculation:
1. Calculate the total weight of 50 ants: Each ant weighs 1/4 of its own body weight, so the total weight of 50 ants = 50 x (1/4) = 12.5 kg.
2. Calculate the total number of insects in the garden: Since there are 50 ants and 1/2 of them are carrying food, the total number of insects in the garden = 50 / 2 = 25 insects.
Therefore, if 50 ants were to bring back food from their farms, there would be approximately 25 insects in the garden."
"Response: 
We know that out of 36 penguins, 1/3 (or 12) jump into the sea to swim. And another 1/3 (or 12) go into caves for dinner. So, there are 12 penguins left outside. Therefore, there are 12 + 12 = 24 penguins still basking in the sunlight."
"Response:  Steve started eating more tomatoes and decided to grow them directly. If he eats 6 tomatoes per day, how many tomato plants will he need in one week?

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessica. So, Mary is 7 years old (Joan - 5 = Mary).
Jessica is 20 years old.
So, the sum of their ages is:
7 + 20 = 27 years old."
"Response: 
Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who left the building through any exit.
Total number of students = Total number of students in school x Percentage of students leaving through each exit
= 1000 x (30/100) + (3/5) x (70/100) + (2/5) x (20/100)
= 300 + 24 + 40
= 564
Step 2: Calculate the number of students who left through the C exit.
Number of students who left through C exit = Total number of students x Proportion of students leaving through C exit
= 564 x (2/5)
= 133
Therefore, the number of students who left through the C exit is 133."
Response:  James has more than Robert by 6 pieces of candy. John has twice as many candies as Robert and also has 54 pieces of candy in total. So, if John has x pieces of candy more than James, then John has (x + 6) pieces of candy in total. Therefore, the answer is (x + 6).
Response:  If Dolly and Panndora each have one book, then they will read two books in total. If they exchange their books, they will read four books in total (two from each other). Therefore, if they continue to exchange books, they will read 2 x 4 = 8 books in total.
"Response: 
1. Mike sends two letters per week to each of his five pen pals, for a total of 10 letters per week (2 x 5).
2. Each letter takes him 5 minutes to write, so in one week he spends 50 minutes writing letters (10 letters x 5 minutes/letter).
3. In a month, there are 4 weeks, so Mike spends 200 minutes writing letters in a month (4 weeks x 50 minutes/week).
Therefore, Mike spends approximately 3.33 hours per month writing letters to his pen pals."
"Response:  Jason can make calls for 1000 minutes in one month. Since he talks to his boss every day for 15 minutes and has talked to other people for an additional 300 minutes this month, the total number of minutes he has spent talking is:

Jason's daily call time with his boss = 15 minutes/day x 30 days = 450 minutes
Additional talk time with other people = 300 minutes
Total talk time = 450 + 300 = 750 minutes
Therefore, Jason has 750 - 1000 = -250 minutes left in the month."
"Response:  
Gregory ate 24 French fries and Bill ate 5. So, together they ate 29 French fries (24 + 5). 
Jessica ate twice as many French fries as Bill, so she ate 58 French fries (2 x 5 = 10). 
Colin took away 3 French fries from Jessica, so he gave her 55 French fries (58 - 3 = 55). 
If Gregory had 27 French fries, then Colin gave him 12 French fries (27 - 12 = 15)."
"Response: 
Step 1: We know that in one aquarium there are 4 fish and in another aquarium there are 32 fish.
Step 2: Since the number of fish in each aquarium is twice the number of aquariums, we can write an equation: 4 + 32 = x (where x is the total number of fish).
Step 3: Solving for x, we get x = 36. Therefore, there are 36 fish in both aquariums combined."
"Response: 
The makeup artist charges $ 250 per hour and works for 6 hours a day, Monday through Friday, for a total of 24 hours per week.
Since it takes 5 weeks to complete the movie, the makeup artist works for a total of 120 hours (24 hours/week x 5 weeks).
Therefore, the total amount paid to the makeup artist is $ 30,000 ($ 250/hour x 120 hours).
As for why the makeup artist gives a 10% discount to Jung, the reason is that he worked for such a long time (5 weeks) and deserves some appreciation. So, Jung pays $ 27,000 ($ 30,000 x 90%)."
"Response:  
Isabelle spent $12 on cake ingredients, $43 on gifts for her brother, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on party supplies for the guests. In total, she spent $86.
Now, let's divide this amount among three people - Isabelle, her mother, and her father. Since they are sharing the cost equally, each person will pay $28.33 ($86 / 3)."
Response:  The chef bought 4 bags of vegetables weighing 200 pounds in total (since each bag weighed 50 pounds). Therefore, the total cost of all four bags is $750 ($150 per pound x 4 bags = $600 + $150 per pound x 200 pounds = $750). So, the chef spent $750 on vegetables.
"Response: 
Day Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Total amount of cookies eaten (in kg) 4 times as much = 4 x 9 = 36 2 times as much = 2 x 13 = 26 1 time as much = 1 x 17 = 17 5 times as much = 5 x 20 = 100 13 times as much = 13 x 20 = 260 Total amount of calories consumed by Sunday = 36 + 26 + 17 + 100 + 260 = 689
Therefore, Sunday consumed 689 kilograms of cookies, which is 269 more than her sister."
