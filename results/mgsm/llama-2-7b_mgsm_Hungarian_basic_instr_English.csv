Günter estimates there are 80 jelly beans in the jar (one friend says 80).
Another friend estimates that the first half of the jar contains 20 jelly beans (20/2 = 10).
A third friend estimates that there are 25% more jelly beans than the first half of the jar (25% x 10 = 2.5).

Therefore, the total estimated number of jelly beans in the jar is: 80 + 10 + 2.5 = 92.5.
Rounding this value to the nearest whole number gives us an average estimate of 46 jelly beans in the jar."

Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:
Dana can run twice as fast as she walks, which means her running speed is 2 times her walking speed = 2x mph.
She can jump 3 miles in 1 hour while jogging at a speed of x mph.
So, if she spends half an hour (60 minutes / 2) running and the remaining time (60 minutes - 30 minutes) walking, then the distance she covers during this time is:
Running distance = Time × Speed = 30 minutes × 2x mph = 60 miles
Walking distance = Time × Walking speed = 60 minutes × x mph = 30 miles
Total distance covered = Running distance + Walking distance = 60 miles + 30 miles = 90 miles
Therefore, Dana can cover 90 miles in 6 hours."

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, Tracy used a four-foot long rope to tie up the tomato plants in her garden. The pieces of rope were six inches long, and since there are 6 inches in 1 foot, we can calculate the total length of the rope as follows:

Total length of rope = Number of pieces x Length of each piece
= 6 x 6 inches
= 36 inches

Since the rope was only four feet long, we know that Tracy could not have used more than 36 inches of rope to tie up all the tomato plants. Therefore, the number of pieces of rope she used must be less than or equal to 36 / 6 = 6. So, the answer is 6."

"Response: 
To find out how many pages (oldalt) you need to read each day to finish reading all the books within the given time frame, we can use the following formula:

Total number of pages = Total number of pages in the books / Number of days left to finish reading

In this case, the total number of pages is:

Total number of pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 oldalt

Number of days left to finish reading = 7 - 4 = 3 days

Therefore, to finish reading all the books within the remaining 3 days, you would need to read an average of:

Average number of pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days left to finish reading
= 49 / 3
= 16 oldalt per day

So, you would need to read approximately 16 pages (or oldalt) each day to finish reading all the books within the given time frame."

Therefore, John drinks 28 glasses of water per week."
"Response: 10 minutes
Explanation: According to the question, it takes 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city of 42 miles in diameter. Therefore, we can calculate the time required to cover each mile as follows:
Time = Distance / Speed
Where distance is the length of the city (in miles) and speed is the rate at which the fog bank moves (in miles per minute).
Since the fog bank moves at a constant rate, we can assume that it covers one mile every minute. Therefore, the time taken to cover each mile is:
Time = 1 mile / 60 seconds/mile = 1/60 minutes/mile
Now, let's find out how many minutes it will take to cover the entire city:
Total distance = Circumference of the circle = π x (city diameter - ocean beach distance)
= π x (42 miles + ocean beach distance)
= 79.2 miles
Therefore, the total time taken to cover the entire city is:
Total Time = Total distance / Speed
= 79.2 miles / 1 mile/minute = 79.2 minutes
So, it will take approximately 79.2 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city."

So this year, if he sells 15 more sütters (which is equal to 15 x $2 = $30), his total earnings will be $220 ($190 + $30).
Since he has 110 sütters left after dropping 5, that means he had 110 - 5 = 105 sütters at first. Therefore, the number of sütters Henry sütött tavaly is 105."

Explanation: If Amy has 20 friends and Lily has 50 friends, then together they have 70 friends. Since there are only 100 students in total, the number of friends that both Amy and Lily have together cannot exceed 100, so the maximum number of friends each of them can have is 50. Therefore, the answer is 30."
"Response: 360 dollars
Explanation:
Dillon is asked to buy 4 görögdinnyéért $36 per unit, since each görögdinnye costs three times as much as a paprika. Therefore, buying 4 görögdinnyéért will cost $36 x 4 = $144.
Buying 20 paprikáért $7 per unit, since each paprika costs $7 per unit. Therefore, buying 20 paprikáért will cost $7 x 20 = $140.
Buying 10 narancst $8 per unit, since each narancs costs $8 per unit. Therefore, buying 10 narancst will cost $8 x 10 = $80.
So, in total, Dillon will have to pay $144 + $140 + $80 = $360 for all the items he needs to buy at the local store."

"Response:  $104 per week (or $3768 annually)
Explanation:
Lucas has three customers so far and expects to have five more in total. Each customer will need two bottles of bleach and one package of cleaning cloths, which cost $2 and $5 respectively. Therefore, his total revenue for each week is:
Weekly Revenue = Number of Customers x Price of Products
= 3 x $2 + 3 x $5
= $92
Since he operates every week, his annual income would be:
Annual Income = Weekly Income x Number of Weeks in a Year
= $92 x 52
= $3768
Therefore, Lucas's profit per week is $104 ($3768 / 52 weeks)."

* Johnny has 500 Lego bricks in his room.
* He drops all of them on the floor.
* From the remaining 500 bricks, he takes 3 times as many bricks as there are in the original pile (so 3 x 500 = 1500).
* From the remaining 1000 bricks (500 + 1000), he takes half as many bricks as there are in the original pile (so 50% of 1000 = 500).

So, in total, Johnny picks up 1267 Lego bricks (1500 + 500)."

Explanation:
The total number of people who came to inflate their tires was 5 + 3 = 8. Since one person came with a unicycle, we can assume that they also needed to inflate their tire (since a unicycle has only one wheel). Therefore, the total number of tires that were inflated is 8 x 4 = 32. The cost per tire for inflating them is $0.25$, so the total amount of money earned by Shawnda that day is $32 x $0.25 = $8$."

Kimo has three one-hour classes per day from Monday to Friday, which means he attends 3 x 5 = 15 classes per week. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo attends 16 x 15 = 240 classes per semester. Therefore, Kimo spends 240 / 2 = 120 hours per semester in class."
"Response: 48 minutes.
Explanation: To calculate the time it will take for Bill to assemble the pastries, we need to find the total length of all the pieces he has to work with. A tekercs is 15 cm long, so there are 300 x 15 = 4500 cm of dough. A croissant is also 15 cm long, so there are 120 x 15 = 1800 cm of croissants. Finally, a baguette is 60 cm long, so there are 60 x 15 = 900 cm of bread. In total, Bill has to work with 4500 + 1800 + 900 = 7200 cm of dough and pastry. This means that if he works at a constant rate, it will take him approximately 48 minutes (or 2880 seconds) to assemble all the pastries."

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, Blake ran back and forth along a 100 meter long football field 15 times, which means he covered a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters. Since Kelly only ran once from one end of the field to the other and then back again, her total distance traveled is 40 + (-40) = 80 meters. Therefore, the difference in distance between the two competitors is 1500 - 80 = 1420 meters or 266 yards."

Locsin caught fewer sea stars than Anakin (5 compared to 10), fewer sea horses than Anakin (3 compared to 6), but more octopuses than Anakin (2 compared to 3). Therefore, the total number of creatures that they caught is 7 (10 + 3 = 7)."
"Response:  $41.95$
Explanation: The formula to calculate the price of the container after 36 months is as follows: Price = (Initial price x (1 + Interest rate)^Time) / (1 - Interest rate)^Time Where: Initial price = $20 Initial interest rate = 20% Time = 36 months Therefore, the price of the container after 36 months would be: Price = ($20 x (1 + 0.20)^36)/(1 - 0.20)^36 Price = $41.95 So, the price of one container of golf balls after 36 months would be approximately $41.95."
"Response: 12 dollars
Explanation: If one action figure costs $5 and there are 3 action figures in total, then each action figure costs $5 / 3 = $1.67. Since the baby also has an action figure, it must cost $1.67 + $1.67 = $3.34. Therefore, all of the toys together cost $5 (the price of the action figure) + $3.34 (the value of the baby's action figure) = $8.34."

"Response: 100 dollars.
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, each shirt costs $25, and there are three times as many shirts as there are ties. Therefore, if the number of ties is x, then the total cost of all the ties is 3x. Since the total cost of all the clothes is equal to the amount paid for them, we can set up the equation: Total Cost = Amount Paid. Solving for x, we get: x = 75. So, the total cost of all the clothes is $75."

Explanation:
Jake sees 80 pókok, each with 8 legs, so he sees 640 legs (8 x 8 = 64).
He also sees 90 rovark, each with 6 legs, so he sees 540 legs (6 x 90 = 540).
Finally, he sees 3 rare mutant creatures, each with 10 legs, so he sees 30 legs (10 x 3 = 30).
In total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 420 legs."

Explanation: If they sold 20 pohár of lemonade for $0.50 each and made $25 in profit, then they sold a total of 20/0.5 = 40 pohár of lemonade. Since they got 2 gallons of lemons for every gallon of lemonade sold, they sold 40/2 = 20 gallons of lemonade. And since each gallon of lemonade cost them $3 in lemons, they spent $20 x 3 = $60 on lemons. So their profit is $25 - $60 = -$35."

Explanation: Let's assume that the number of votes received by the winner is W and the number of votes received by the loser is L. Since the total number of votes cast was 80, we can write the equation: W + L = 80. Also, since the winner received 3/4 of the total votes, we can write another equation: W × 4 = L × 3. Now, substituting the values from the problem statement into these equations, we get: W = 56, L = 24. Therefore, the loser received 24 votes."

"Response: 60%
Explanation: According to the question, if Jerry throws a six-sided die, his chance of getting a number greater than 3 is 60%. This is because there are three numbers greater than 3 on the die (4, 5, and 6), while there are only two pairs of consecutive even numbers (2 and 4, and 3 and 5). Therefore, the probability of Jerry getting a number greater than 3 is higher than the probability of him getting two consecutive even numbers."

"Response: 5
Explanation: According to the problem statement, there are three groups of animals in the pet store: mice (which include Russell), hamsters, and gerbils. Each group is kept in a separate cage, with each animal receiving six pieces of food. There are ten hamster cages, each containing five hamsters, for a total of 50 hamsters. The problem states that there are also twenty pieces of food distributed among the gerbils, but it does not provide information about how many gerbils are in each cage or how many cages there are. Therefore, we can assume that each gerbil receives one piece of food, and there are at most five gerbils per cage (since there are only five pieces of food available). Finally, since Russell works at the pet store and distributes food to all of the animals, he must be distributing food to at least some of the hamsters and gerbils. In total, then, there are at least 5 + 50 = 55 animals in the pet store."

Since we found 9 blue feathers in each blue bottle and 6 red feathers in each red bottle, the total number of feathers is: 22 + 10 = 32 (green) + 6 + 2 = 36 (total). Therefore, there are 36 feathers in Janett's nest."

Explanation:
Michael rode his bike for four weeks, with each ride being at least 25 kilometers long. This means he rode a total of 4 x 25 = 100 kilometers during those four weeks. Then, he decided to reduce the frequency of his rides and only go twice a week, but increase the distance he rode each time by 60 kilometers. So, in three weeks, he rode a total of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers. Therefore, Michael's total distance traveled is 100 + 120 = 220 kilometers."

On Tuesday, she went to another store and bought three times as many pastries as she bought on Monday, so she bought 12 pastries (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought five times as many pastries as she bought on Tuesday, so she bought 60 pastries (5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, in total, Rose bought 72 pastries over the course of the three days (4 + 12 + 60 = 72)."

"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x number of red chickens and y number of white chickens in the flock. Since each red chicken lays 5 eggs per day, they will lay a total of 5x eggs per day. Similarly, since each white chicken lays 3 eggs per day, they will lay a total of 3y eggs per day. If Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, then he must have collected (5x + 3y) eggs in total. Since there are more than twice as many white chickens as red chickens, we can conclude that x/y = 2, so the number of red chickens is 16. Therefore, the answer is 16."
"Response: 4 hours
Explanation: To find out how long Gary will spend walking in the local park, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is 1.5 x 6 = 9 meters (since the park is 6 meters wide and 1.5 times longer than it is wide). The speed is 3 miles per hour, which is equal to 0.00472 kilometers per minute. So, the time it takes Gary to walk around the park is: Time = 9 meters / 0.00472 km/min = 188 minutes or 3 hours."

Explanation: According to the passage, there were initially 100 customers, and then 50 more customers joined on the second day, making a total of 150 customers. On the third day, there were 500 customers in total, so if 50% of them (or 250 customers) had visited on the second day, that means 300 customers visited on the third day."
"Response: 20 gallons
Explanation: Let's assume that the initial amount of water in both pools is x gallons. Since the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons. Also, since the flow rate is constant at 4 gallons/minute and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the volume of water flowing out of each pool per hour is 4x gallons (big pool) and 2x gallons (small pool). Now, we know that 4 hours ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so the initial amount of water in the big pool was 2(4x) = 8x gallons. Similarly, the initial amount of water in the small pool was 2x gallons. Therefore, the current amount of water in the small pool is 2x - 4x = -2x gallons. Finally, since the big pool has twice as much water as the small pool now, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2(-2x) = 4x gallons. So, the current amount of water in the small pool is 20 gallons (since it is equal to the difference between the total amount of water in the big pool and the amount of water currently in the big pool)."

"Response: 0.7569(approximately)
Explanation: The probability of getting a water-type card when drawing a random card from a deck with 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water cards is approximately 0.7569. This can be calculated using the formula for conditional probability: P(Water|Drawing Water) = P(Drawing Water)/P(Drawing Any Card). In this case, P(Drawing Water) = 40/100, and P(Drawing Any Card) = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90. Therefore, P(Water|Drawing Water) = 40/90 ≈ 0.7569."

Since there are 50 ants in the garden, the total number of insects in the garden is 50 x 50 = 2500. However, since Dax only found 50 bees, we subtract that amount from the total number of insects to get the final answer of 100."

* After the meeting, 30% of them left through door A, which means 300 students (30% x 1000).
* The remaining 70% of the students left through doors B and C combined. Since 3/5 of the students left through door B, the number of students who left through door C is 5/5 - 3/5 = 2/5 = 40%. So, the number of students who left through door C is 400 students (40% x 1000).
* Therefore, the total number of students who left through all three exits is 300 + 400 = 700 students."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Mike receives five letters from his friends every week and responds with an equal number of letters. Each letter takes him six minutes to write, so he spends a total of 30 minutes (5 letters x 6 minutes/letter) writing each week. Since there are seven days in a week, Mike spends a total of 210 minutes (30 minutes/day x 7 days/week) writing letters each week. Therefore, he spends 4 hours (210 minutes / 52 minutes/hour) writing letters each week."

Explanation:
Jason talks to his boss for 15 minutes every day, which is equal to 1000 minutes in a month. Since there are 30 days in this particular month, Jason has talked to his boss for a total of 30,000 minutes (1000 x 30).
Additionally, he talked to other people for 300 minutes, bringing the total number of minutes spent talking to 33,000 minutes (30,000 + 300).
To convert these minutes to hours, divide by 60, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. This gives us:
Hours = Minutes / 60
Hours = 33,000 / 60 = 550 hours (or 21 days)
So, Jason has spent 550 hours or 21 days talking to his boss and others during this particular month."

Explanation: According to the passage, Kyle took 5 sült krumpli from Griffin, and then Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Therefore, Billy took 10 sült krumpli (2 x 5 = 10). Additionally, it is stated that Ginger gave Griffin some extra sült krumplis, but the passage does not provide enough information to determine how many. So, the final amount of sült krumpi that Griffin had was 27 - 10 = 17."
"Response: 8
Explanation: Let's assume that the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Since there are twice as many crabs in one aquarium as there are fish, the number of crabs is 2x. Therefore, the total number of creatures in both aquariums is 2x + x = 3x. Since there are equal numbers of creatures in both aquariums, we can set up the equation: 3x = 16 (since there are 16 creatures in total). Solving for x, we get x = 8. So, there are 8 fish in each aquarium."

Explanation: The farmer spends $250 per hour for sminking, and he works for 6 hours every day. Therefore, he spends $1500 per day ($250 x 6) or $90,000 over the course of 5 weeks ($90,000 / 5 = $18,000 per week). Since the sminker gives Jean a 10% discount after the movie is finished, Jean pays $16,200 for the sminking services ($18,000 x 90%)."

"Response: 480 calories
Explanation:
Sue ate 4 times as much bread as her sister on Monday (so she ate 4 x 9 = 36 slices of bread). On Tuesday, she ate twice as much bread as her sister (so she ate 2 x 9 = 18 slices of bread). Her sister ate 5 slices of bread on Monday and 13 slices on Tuesday. Therefore, Sue ate 36 + 18 = 54 slices of bread in total. Since each slice of bread contains 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 54 x 200 = 10,800 calories."
