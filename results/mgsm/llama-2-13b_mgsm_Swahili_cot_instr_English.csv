Response:  We know that Batta earns Ksh. 16 per day and spends Ksh. 2 on transport every day. That means he has Ksh. 14 left after transport costs (16 - 2 = 14). Now, we need to find out how much money Batta makes in a week. To do this, we multiply the daily amount by 7 days: 14 x 7 = 98. So Batta makes Ksh. 98 per week.
"Response:  We have two quantities of ufumwele (buluu and nusu) that we want to combine into one quantity of komeo. To do this, we need to know how many units of each ingredient are needed for one unit of komeo. This information is given as follows:

1. Buluu: 2 za ufumwele = 2 x 500g = 1kg
2. Nusu: 1 kg = 900g + 100g

So, to make 1kg of komeo, we need:

* 1kg of buluu (which is equal to 2x500g)
* 900g of nusu (since 1kg is equal to 900g + 100g)

Therefore, the total amount of ingredients needed for 1kg of komeo is:

2x500g + 900g = 3500g

Hence, the answer is 3500g."
Response:  We know that the cost of building the house is $80,000 and we spent $50,000 as down payment, so the amount borrowed = $80,000 - $50,000 = $30,000. The interest rate charged on the loan is 150%, which means for every dollar borrowed, we pay back $1.50 in interest. So, the total amount paid back = $30,000 x 1.5 = $45,000. Therefore, the profit made = $45,000 - $30,000 = $15,000 or 50% of the original price of the house.
"Response:  We know that James has 3 bags of flour weighing 3 kg each and he wants to sell them at Ksh 60 per bag. So, if he sells all the bags, how much money will he get in total?

Ksh 60 x 3 = Ksh 180

Therefore, James will get Ksh 180 if he sells all his 3 bags of flour."
"Response:  We know that Wendi wants to prepare 20 pieces of chicken for lunch today and she has already prepared 15 pieces. So, how many more pieces does she need to prepare? To find out, we can subtract the number of pieces she has already prepared from the total number of pieces she needs. In this case, we can subtract 15 from 20:  
20 - 15 =? 
The difference is 5. Therefore, Wendi needs to prepare an additional 5 pieces of chicken to complete her lunch preparations."
Response:  We know that Kylar wants to buy a product worth $5 with a discount of 60%. So, if he pays $5, he will get a discount of 60% which is equal to (60/100) x $5 = $3. Therefore, the amount Kylar needs to pay for the product after the discount is $5 - $3 = $2.
"Response:  We know that Toulouse has 3 idioms and Charleston has 4 idioms. So, if we add them together, we get:

3 + 4 = 7

Now, we are asked to find out how many idioms Seattle has if it has 20 idioms in total. To do this, we can subtract the number of idioms Toulouse and Charleston have from 20:

20 - 7 (Toulouse + Charleston) =?

Solving for the equation above, we get:

20 - 7 = 13

Therefore, Seattle has 13 idioms."
"Response:  We know that Carla can do 200 tasks per day with a success rate of 60%. This means she fails 40% of the time, which is 80 tasks (40% of 200). So, if she works for 20 minutes, she will complete 160 tasks (20 minutes x 80 tasks/hour) and fail 40 tasks. Therefore, the time taken to complete all 200 tasks would be:  
Time = Total Tasks / Completion Rate  
= 200 tasks / 0.6 (success rate)  
= 33.33 minutes (approximately 20 minutes)"
"Response:  We have been given that John spends Ksh. 30 per day for the first two days and Ksh. 80 per day thereafter. He has Ksh. 60 left after the second day. So we can start by calculating how much he spent during the first two days:  
Day 1: Ksh. 30 x 1 = Ksh. 30  
Day 2: Ksh. 30 x 2 = Ksh. 60  
Total spend = Ksh. 30 + Ksh. 60 = Ksh. 90  
Now let's calculate how much he will spend on the remaining two days:  
Day 3: Ksh. 80 x 1 = Ksh. 80  
Day 4: Ksh. 80 x 2 = Ksh. 160  
Total spend = Ksh. 80 + Ksh. 160 = Ksh. 240  
So John will spend a total of Ksh. 240 during the last two days."
"Response:  We know that Eliza worked for 45 weeks and her daily wage was $10. So we can calculate how much she earned in total as follows:  
Total earnings = Daily wage x Number of days worked  
= $10 x 45 weeks  
= $450
Therefore, if Eliza worked for 45 weeks and her daily wage was $10, then her total earnings would be $450."
"Response:  We know that the program was implemented for 60 days in the first month and 30% of the program was implemented in the second month. So we need to find out how many days were left after implementing 30% of the program in the second month. To do this, we will divide the total number of days in the second month by 100 to get the percentage of days implemented. Then we multiply the result by 30 to get the number of days implemented. Finally, we subtract the number of days implemented from the total number of days in the second month to get the remaining number of days.

Let X be the number of days in the second month. Since it is a 30-day month, X = 30.

The percentage of days implemented in the second month is 30%, so the number of days implemented is:

(X x 30%) / 100 = (30 x 30) / 100 = 900 / 100 = 9 days

Therefore, the remaining number of days in the second month is:

X - (X x 30%) / 100 = 30 - 9 = 21 days

So the program was implemented for 21 days in the second month."
"Response:  We have three types of donations with different prices and quantities:

Dazeni 1 ($68 x 3) = $204
Dazeni 2 ($80 x 2) = $160
Dazeni 6 ($55 x 6) = $330
Total amount = $204 + $160 + $330 = $794
Therefore, the total amount is $794."
Response:  We know that Carlos has $90 and he spends $1.5 per day on lunch. So, if he spends $1.5 per day, then in one week (7 days), he will spend $1.5 x 7 = $10.5. Now, we need to find out how much money Carlos will have left after one week. To do this, we subtract the amount he spent from his initial amount of money: $90 - $10.5 = $79.5. Therefore, Carlos will have $79.5 left after one week.
"Response:  We have three conditions to consider:
1. Melanie has five fish to fry in the pan.
2. She needs one more fish to make six for her family of four (two adults and two children).
3. The last fish she buys will be wasted if she doesn't use it immediately.
Now let's assign numbers to each condition:
Melanie has five fish = 5
She needs one more fish = 6 - 5 = 1
The last fish is wasted if not used immediately = 1
So, the total number of fish Melanie needs to buy is 1 + 5 = 6."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 students in the class and we want to find out how many of them will be seated in each row. The teacher has said that 25% of the students will sit in the front row, which means that 25/100 = 1/4 of the students will sit in the front row. Since there are 20 students in total, 20 x 1/4 = 5 students will sit in the front row.  
Now, let's find out how many students will sit in each of the other rows. There are 3 rows in total (front row + 2 back rows). So, if 5 students are sitting in the front row, then there are 20 - 5 = 15 students left to distribute among the back rows. Since 25% of the students will sit in each back row, we can fill one entire back row with 25/100 = 1/4 of the remaining students. Therefore, 15 / 4 = 3 students will sit in each of the two back rows.  
So, the distribution of students per row is: Front Row: 5 students Back Row 1: 3 students Back Row 2: 3 students Total: 20 students"
Response:  We know that the profit from selling electronics is 8,000 - 5,000 = 3,000 shillings. This means that for every 100,000 shillings sold, there is a profit of 3,000 shillings or 3%. Now, if we want to find out the percentage increase in profits for the month of December compared to the previous months, we can use the following formula: Percentage change = (new value - old value) / old value x 100. In this case, the new value is 3,000 and the old value is 2,500, so the percentage change would be: Percentage change = (3,000 - 2,500) / 2,500 x 100 = 20% increase. Therefore, the profit from selling electronics increased by 20% in December compared to the previous months.
Response:  We know that each train has 80 and 150 passengers respectively. So we can start by finding out how many trains are needed to transport all the passengers. To do this, we add the number of passengers for both trains: 80 + 150 = 230. Since there are two trains, we divide the total number of passengers by 2: 230 / 2 = 115. Therefore, two trains with 80 and 150 passengers are needed to transport all the passengers.
Response:  We know that Jill has $20,000 and wants to save $30,000 in five years. She earns $50,000 per year as a teacher and spends $15,000 annually on living expenses. To find out how much she needs to save each month, we can use the following formula: Total Amount / Number of Years = Monthly Savings. In this case, the total amount is $30,000, and the number of years is five. So, we divide $30,000 by five to get our monthly savings: $30,000 / 5 = $6,000 per month. Therefore, Jill needs to save $6,000 per month for the next five years to reach her goal of $30,000.
"Response:  We know that Claire has been working at Stafata for three years (3 x 12 = 36 months). If she started working there in January, then she has worked for 36 months up to December of the same year. So, if we subtract 36 months from December, we get:  
December - 36 months = December - 3 x 12 = December - 36 = December - 3 = November. Therefore, Claire will have worked for 36 months or 3 years at Stafata until November."
Response:  We have 12 apples and we want to divide them equally among 4 people so that each person gets the same amount of apples. If we give one apple to each person, we will be left with 3 apples. So, if we want to distribute 4 apples to each person, we need to give 4 - 3 = 1 more apple to each person. Therefore, each person will get 4 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 10 liters of water in the first jug and we want to transfer it to two smaller jugs. The second jug can hold 5 liters of water and the third jug can hold 3 liters of water. So, if we fill the second jug with 5 liters of water from the first jug, we will have 5 liters left in the first jug. Similarly, if we fill the third jug with 3 liters of water from the first jug, we will have 2 liters left in the first jug. Therefore, the amount of water left in the first jug after filling both smaller jugs is 2 liters.
Response:  We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha and he is currently 23 years old. So, if we subtract 6 from 23, we get 17. Therefore, when Samantha was born, she was 17 years old. Now, since she is 31 years old now, we can say that she has lived for 14 years (31 - 17).
"Response:  We know that Billy has 8 DVDs and he wants to distribute them equally among 3 people. So, if we divide 8 by 3, we get:

8 ÷ 3 = 2

So, each person will receive 2 DVDs. But wait! Billy also wants to give one extra DVD to one of the people. Who will it be? Let's use numbers again. If we have 3 people and we want to choose one person to receive an extra DVD, we can use the number 1 out of 3. In this case, we'll choose the first person (person 1) to receive the extra DVD.

Now, let's summarize:

Person 1 receives 2 DVDs + 1 extra DVD = 3 DVDs
Person 2 receives 2 DVDs
Person 3 receives 2 DVDs

So, Billy will give 3 DVDs to Person 1, 2 DVDs to Person 2, and 2 DVDs to Person 3."
"Response:  We know that there are 3 hours between 7:00 am and 11:00 am. So we can divide this time into smaller parts as follows:  
* From 7:00 am to 8:00 am = 1 hour  
* From 8:00 am to 9:00 am = 1 hour  
* From 9:00 am to 10:00 am = 1 hour  
* From 10:00 am to 11:00 am = 1 hour  
Therefore, there are 4 hours in total from 7:00 am to 11:00 am."
"Response:  We know that the original price of the book was $19.50 and it was discounted by 25%. So we can start by finding out what percentage of the original price was discounted. To do this, we divide the amount of the discount ($19.50 x 25%) by the original price:

$19.50 x 25% = $4.875

Now we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:

$19.50 - $4.875 = $14.625

So the sale price of the book is $14.625."
Response:  We know that Marie has $50 and she wants to buy pizzas for herself and her friends. She can buy 5 large pizzas at $8.50 each, so the total cost would be $8.50 x 5 = $42.50. Since she has $50, she will have enough money to buy all the pizzas she needs. So, the answer is $42.50.
"Response:  We have three items to purchase and we want to know how much each item will cost us in total. The prices of the items are as follows:

* Kaptura: $16.50
* Suruali: $22.50
* Viatu: $42

We need to calculate the total cost for each item based on the quantity we want to buy. Since we want to buy three of each item, let's multiply the price of each item by 3:

* Kaptura: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50
* Suruali: 3 x $22.50 = $67.50
* Viatu: 3 x $42 = $126

So, the total cost for all three items is:
$49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Therefore, the total cost for all three items is $243."
"Response:  We know that Cynthia has 15 pieces of candy and each piece costs $4. If she wants to sell all her candies, how much money will she get in total?
We can calculate this by multiplying the number of pieces of candy (15) by the cost per piece ($4):
15 x $4 = $60
So, if Cynthia sells all her candies, she will get $60."
"Response:  We know that Henry went on a trip for 60 days and spent $20 on the first day and $15 on the last day. So we can start by finding out how much he spent in total.  
Total amount spent = $20 + $15 = $35  
Now let's find out how much he spent each day on average. To do this, we divide the total amount spent by the number of days he was away.  
Average daily spend = $35 / 60 = $0.58 per day  
So Henry spent an average of $0.58 per day on his trip."
Response:  We know that Gloria has $33 and she wants to buy two things with a total value of $50. So we can start by finding out how much one thing costs. If she buys two things, then each thing must cost half of $50, which is $25. Therefore, the price of one thing is $25. Now, if we subtract $25 from $33, we get $8, which is the amount left after buying one thing. Since she still needs to buy another thing, we can repeat the same process: Each thing costs $25, so the second thing will also cost $25. Therefore, the total amount spent on both things is $25 + $25 = $50. The remaining balance after buying both things is $8 - $50 = -$42, which means she owes $42.
"Response:  We know that the current age of Umri is 162 years and the age of Darrel is 10 years less than Umri. So we can write an equation based on this information:
Umri's age = 162... (1)
Darrel's age = Umri's age - 10... (2)
Now we need to find out Darrel's age. Substituting equation (1) into equation (2), we get:
Darrel's age = 162 - 10
= 152
So Darrel is currently 152 years old."
"Response:  We have three people giving their answers to the number of years they spent in school.
Person A says 80 years. Person B says 20 years more than person A. And Person C says 25% more than person A.
We can start by finding out how many years Person A spent in school first. If we multiply 80 by 10 (since there are 10 years in a decade), we get 800. So, Person A spent 800 years in school.
Now, let's find out how many years Person B spent in school. Since they say they spent 20 years more than Person A, we add 20 to 800: 800 + 20 = 820. Therefore, Person B spent 820 years in school.
Lastly, let's calculate how many years Person C spent in school. They say they spent 25% more than Person A, so we multiply 800 by 1.25 (to get the percentage increase): 800 x 1.25 = 1000. Therefore, Person C spent 1000 years in school."
Response:  We know that John has 10 dogs and each dog eats 0.5 kilograms of food per day. So, in total, John needs to provide 10 x 0.5 = 5 kilograms of food for his dogs every day.
"Response:  We know that Gretchen has $110 and she spends $30 on jewelry. So, how much does she have left?
We can subtract $30 from $110 to find out:
$110 - $30 =?
The answer is $80. Therefore, Gretchen has $80 left after buying the jewelry."
"Response:  We know that:
Aaron has 5 more years than Raymond, so if Raymond is x years old, Aaron is x + 5 years old.
Siobhan is 2 years older than Aaron, so if Aaron is x + 5 years old, Siobhan is x + 7 years old.
We also know that Siobhan is 40 years old, so we can set up the equation:
x + 7 = 40... (1)
Now we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 7 from both sides of equation (1):
x + 7 - 7 = 40 - 7
x = 33
So, Raymond is 33 years old and Aaron is 38 years old (33 + 5). Siobhan is also 38 years old."
"Response:  We know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike ran for 4 kilometers. That means he covered 4 km in 20 min. Now, we need to find out how many meters he ran in those 20 minutes. To do this, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time. In this case, the speed is given as 4 km/h, and the time is 20 min. So, we can calculate the distance like this: distance = 4 km/h x 20 min = 800 m. Therefore, Mike ran for 800 meters in the first 20 minutes.  
Now, let's move on to the second part of the problem. We are told that in the next 20 minutes, Mike ran for 25% more than he did in the first 20 minutes. This means that if he ran for 800 meters in the first 20 minutes, he will run for 800 x 1.25 = 1000 meters in the next 20 minutes. Therefore, the total distance Mike ran in 40 minutes is 800 + 1000 = 1800 meters."
"Response:  We know that Terry has $5.00 and he wants to buy milk for 30 days. So we need to calculate how much money he will spend on milk per day. To do this, we can divide the cost of one liter of milk ($1.00) by the number of liters he needs per day (30). Therefore, the daily cost of milk is:

$1.00 / 30 = $0.033 per day

Now, let's calculate how much money Terry will spend on milk for 30 days:

$0.033 x 30 = $0.99

So, Terry will spend $0.99 on milk for 30 days."
Response:  We know that John has 13 pieces of Lego and he wants to sell them for $15 each. That means if he sells all his Legos, he will get $15 x 13 = $195. However, he also mentioned that he spent $20 to buy 8 videos. So, we need to subtract the cost from the revenue to find out how much profit he made. Profit = Revenue - Cost Profit = $195 - $20 = $175 Therefore, John made a profit of $175 from selling his Lego sets.
"Response:  We know that John has 60 cows and he wants to sell them in three weeks. So, we can start by calculating how many cows he needs to sell each week to meet his goal. To do this, we need to divide 60 by 3, which gives us...

1. Calculate how many cows John needs to sell each week:

60 / 3 = 20

So, John needs to sell 20 cows each week for three weeks to meet his goal."
"Response:  If we have $3$ coins and we want to toss them simultaneously, there are ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ possible outcomes:

1. Heads-Heads (HH)
2. Heads-Tails (HT)
3. Tails-Tails (TT)

Now, if we toss each coin once, there are again ${3 \choose 1} = 3$ possible outcomes for each coin:

1. Head (H)
2. Tail (T)

So, in total, there are $3 \times 3 = 9$ possible outcomes when tossing each coin once.

If we want to toss all three coins together, we can either get any of the above nine outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads is $\boxed{9/18}$ or $\frac{9}{18}$."
"Response:  We know that iPhone ya Brandon was released before iPhone ya Ben because it is said to have been released ""zaidi ya mwaka mingapi"". This means that iPhone ya Brandon was released one year earlier than iPhone ya Ben.
We also know that iPhone ya Suzy was released after iPhone ya Ben because it is said to have been released ""mbili zaidi ya iPhone ya Ben"". This means that iPhone ya Suzy was released two years after iPhone ya Ben.
So, if we count back from the release of iPhone ya Suzy, we get:
Year 1: Release of iPhone ya Suzy
Year -2: Release of iPhone ya Ben
Year -3: Release of iPhone ya Brandon
Therefore, iPhone ya Brandon was released three years before iPhone ya Suzy."
"Response:  We know that Polly can carry 400 kg of potatoes at once and she needs to transport 1000 kg of potatoes. So we can start by finding out how many trips Polly will need to make to transport all the potatoes. To do this, we divide the total weight of potatoes (1000 kg) by the weight Polly can carry per trip (400 kg):

1000 kg / 400 kg = 2.5 trips

So Polly will need to make 2.5 trips to transport all the potatoes. Now let's calculate the total distance traveled by Polly during these trips. Since each trip is 400 kg x 2 km = 800 meters long, we multiply the number of trips by the length of each trip to get the total distance traveled:

2.5 trips x 800 meters/trip = 2000 meters

Therefore, Polly will travel a total distance of 2000 meters to transport all the potatoes."
Response:  We have 5 eggs and we want to divide them equally among 8 people. So, if we divide 5 by 8, we get... (counting on my fingers)...2! Yes, that's right - 2 eggs per person. But wait, there's more! Since each egg has 2 parts (yolk and white), we can say that each person gets 2 x 2 = 4 parts of eggs in total. And since we started with 5 eggs, we have 5 x 4 = 20 parts of eggs altogether!
"Response:  We know that;
Kulingana na maelezo yake ya lishe = 250 calories per serving (given)
Mfuko wa chipsi una kalori 250 kwa kila sehemu iliyopakuliwa = Chips contain 250 calories per serving (given)
Iwapo mfuko wa gramu 300 una sehemu 5 za kupakuliwa = If we eat 300 grams of chips and there are 5 servings in 300 grams, then each serving has 60 grams (divide 300 by 5).
Unaweza kula gramu ngapi iwapo lengo lako la kalori kila siku ni 2000 na tayari umekula kalori 1800? = Can we consume 60 grams of chips per day if our daily calorie intake is 2000 calories and we want to consume 1800 calories?
To determine this, we need to calculate the number of servings we can have per day based on our daily calorie intake.
Let's divide our daily calorie intake by the number of calories in each serving:
2000 / 250 = 8 servings (approximately)
So, we can have approximately 8 servings of chips per day if we want to consume 1800 calories.
Therefore, the answer is:
Yes, you can consume 60 grams of chips per day if your daily calorie intake is 2000 calories and you want to consume 1800 calories."
"Response:  We know that each packet of rice costs $2 and we want to buy 20 packets. So, if we multiply $2 by 20, we get:

$2 x 20 = $40

So, the total cost of buying 20 packets of rice is $40."
"Response:  We have four weeks in a month and we want to divide them into two parts of three days each. To do this, we will use fractions.

Week 1 (Jumatatu): 3/4 of the week = 3 x 7 = 21 days

Week 2 (Jumanne): 1/4 of the week = 1 x 7 = 7 days

Therefore, the total number of days in the month is: 21 + 7 = 28 days."
"Response:  We know that candice has 80 shillings and wants to buy coffee at 220 shillings per cup. She also knows that she will be given 23 shillings change from her purchase price of 23 shillings. So we can start by calculating how many cups of coffee Candice can buy with her money:  
Cups of Coffee = Total Amount / Price Per Cup  
= 80 / 220  
= 0.36 or 3/10 of a cup  
Since Candice cannot buy a fraction of a cup, she will have to round up to the nearest whole number of cups. In this case, she can buy one full cup of coffee. Therefore, the correct answer is:  
Number of Cups = 1"
"Response:  We know that the cost of one unit of tai for local consumption is $40 per kilogram. If we want to calculate the total cost of 50 units of tai for export, we need to first find out how much it would cost us if we were buying these units locally. So, let's multiply the number of units (50) by the cost per unit ($40):  
50 x $40 = $2,000
So, the total cost of 50 units of tai for local consumption would be $2,000. Now, since we are exporting these units, we will have to add a 50% markup to this price to cover our costs and make a profit. Therefore, the total cost of 50 units of tai for export will be:  
$2,000 + (50% of $2,000) = $2,000 + $1,000 = $3,000
Therefore, the total cost of 50 units of tai for export is $3,000."
Response:  We have 4 cows and we want to distribute them equally among 6 people. So, if we divide 4 by 6, we get 0.67 or approximately 1 cow per person. Therefore, each of the 6 people will receive 1 cow.
"Response:  We know that there are 8 rooms in total and 3/4 of them have been painted. So we can start by finding out how many rooms have not been painted yet. To do this, we need to divide 8 by 3/4.

8 ÷ 3/4 = 8 × 4/3 = 20/3

So, 20/3 rooms have not been painted yet. Since each room needs one gallon of paint, we need 20/3 gallons of paint for the remaining rooms."
"Response:  We know that Lloyd has 252 chickens and each chicken lays one egg per day. So, in total, Lloyd gets 252 eggs per day. If he sells each egg at $2, then his daily income from eggs would be:  

252 eggs x $2 per egg = $504 per day

Now, let's calculate how much money Lloyd makes in a week (7 days):

$504 per day x 7 days = $3,528 per week

So, Lloyd makes $3,528 per week from selling eggs."
Response:  We know that Melina can travel at a speed of 10 km/h for 3 hours without taking any breaks. This means she covers a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 km during this time. Now we need to find out how long it would take her to cover 6 km if she travels at the same speed. To do this, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled (in this case, 6 km), r is the rate or speed (which remains constant at 10 km/h), and t is the time taken to cover the distance. So, t = d / r, which simplifies to t = 6 / 10 = 0.6 hours or 36 minutes. Therefore, Melina will take 36 minutes to cover 6 km if she maintains a steady speed of 10 km/h.
"Response:  We have 30 books in total and we need to divide them into groups of 15 books each. To do this, we can use fractions.

We know that 1 book is equal to 1/4 of the total number of books (30), so we can write:

1 book = 1/4 x 30 = 7.5

Now, we want to find out how many groups of 15 books we can make with these 30 books. To do this, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books per group (15):

30 books / 15 books per group =?

Can you solve for the missing number?"
"Response:  We know that for every lorry (L) and car (C), Makanika charges $60 and $40 respectively. On Sunday, she charged 6 lorries and 4 cars, so her total earnings were:

6L x $60 = $360 + 4C x $40 = $160 = $520

On Monday, she charged 12 cars and no lorries, so her total earnings were:

12C x $40 = $480

So, the difference between her earnings on Sunday and Monday is:

$520 - $480 = $40

Therefore, the amount of money Makanika earned on Monday more than any other day is $40."
Response:  We know that there are seven children living with Mrs. Doubtfire (Dada wa Doubtfire), and we also know that she has three more children who are not yet born but will be born soon. So, if we add 3 to 7, we get 10. Therefore, the total number of children living with Mrs. Doubtfire is 10.
Response:  We know that Jean has two children and each child needs one pair of shoes. So, in total, Jean needs two pairs of shoes for her children. As she already has one pair, she will need to buy another pair. Therefore, the answer is 2.
"Response:  If Pete spends $7 every day and has been doing so for 42 days, then he has spent a total of:

$7 x 42 = $294

So, if Pete wants to go to the film with $7, he will be left with:

$294 - $7 = $287

Therefore, Pete can afford to go to the film with $287."
"Response:  We know that there are 5000 cows in total and each cow needs 15 liters of water per day. So, we need to calculate how much water is needed for all the cows. To do this, we can multiply the number of cows by the amount of water each cow needs per day. Therefore, the total amount of water needed for all the cows would be:  
5000 x 15 = 75,000 liters  
So, the remaining amount of water after deducting 3755 liters (which is the amount of water available) from the total amount of water needed for all the cows would be:  
75,000 - 3755 = 71,245 liters  
Therefore, the idadi ya juu (the remaining amount of water) would be 71,245 liters."
Response:  We know that Stephen spent $40.00 and got a discount of 25%. So he paid $40.00 x 75% = $30.00. Then he received $4.00 as change. Therefore, his final amount is $30.00 + $4.00 = $34.00.
Response:  We have 67 yams and we want to divide them equally among 6 people. So each person will get...
"Response:  We have 25 workers who will work for 1 month (30 days). Each worker works for 8 hours per day, so they will work a total of 240 hours (25 x 8 x 30) during the month.  
Now, we need to calculate how much each worker should be paid based on their performance. Since 20% of the workers are high performers, we can assume that they will receive a higher salary than the average performer. Let's say the high performers earn twice as much as the average performers.  
So, if the average performer earns $10 per hour, then the high performers would earn $20 per hour. Therefore, the total amount earned by each worker during the month would be:  
High performers: 25 x $20 x 30 = $90,000  
Average performers: 25 x $10 x 30 = $75,000  
Total amount earned: $90,000 + $75,000 = $165,000"
Response:  We have been given that Janet borrowed Kshs. 500 and paid back Kshs. 800 with a commission of 10%. To find out how much she paid in commissions, we can use the formula: Commission = (Amount borrowed x Rate%) / 100. In this case, the amount borrowed is Kshs. 500, the rate is 10%, and the result will be divided by 100 to convert it into a percentage. So, Commission = (500 x 10) / 100 = 50. Therefore, Janet paid Kshs. 50 as commission. Now, let's calculate the total amount she paid back: Total Amount Paid Back = Amount Borrowed + Commission = 500 + 50 = 550.
"Response:  We know that Malipo ya Uzeeni (MU) = $50,000 per year and Haki ya Kupata Thamani (HKT) = 5% of MU per year. So, we can start by calculating the total amount received over 20 years:  

1. Calculate MU for 20 years: MU x 20 = $50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000  
2. Calculate HKT for 20 years: HKT x 20 = $50,000 x 20 = $1,000,000  

Now, let's calculate the amount received after 30 years:  

1. Calculate MU for 30 years: MU x 30 = $50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000  
2. Calculate HKT for 30 years: HKT x 30 = $50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000  

So, the amount received after 30 years is $1,500,000."
"Response:  We know that the monthly salary is $140 and there are 12 months in a year. So, the annual salary is:

$140 x 12 = $1680 per year

Now, we need to calculate the amount of money earned in each month. To do this, we can use the formula:

Total amount earned = Annual salary x (1 + Interest rate) ^ Number of periods

In this case, the number of periods is 12 months. The interest rate is given as 10%. So, we can calculate the total amount earned in each month as follows:

Total amount earned = $1680 x (1 + 0.10) ^ 12
= $1680 x 1.10^12
= $1953.76

Therefore, the monthly earnings would be:

Monthly earnings = Total amount earned / Number of periods
= $1953.76 / 12
= $162.81 per month"
"Response:  We know that Sophia has to travel 100 miles and she needs to stop every 4 miles to refuel her car. She can only carry 12 gallons of fuel at a time. So, how many times will she need to stop to refuel her car if she wants to travel 100 miles?
We can start by dividing the total distance (100 miles) by the distance between each refueling stop (4 miles):
100 miles / 4 miles = 25 stops
Since Sophia can only carry 12 gallons of fuel at a time, we need to calculate how much fuel she will use for each stop:
25 stops x 12 gallons per stop = 300 gallons
Therefore, Sophia will need to stop 25 times to refuel her car if she wants to travel 100 miles."
"Response:  If Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads a book for 1 hour every day, then he spends a total of 3 hours per day on entertainment (2 hours + 1 hour). Therefore, if he wants to spend 4 hours on entertainment on Wednesday, he will have to sacrifice either his TV time or his reading time. Here's one way he could do it:

Option 1: Jim gives up 1 hour of TV time and reads for 2 hours instead. In this case, he would watch TV for 1 hour (instead of 2) and read for 2 hours. This adds up to a total of 3 hours of entertainment time, which is what he wanted.

Option 2: Jim gives up 2 hours of reading time and watches TV for 4 hours instead. In this case, he would watch TV for 4 hours and not read at all. This also adds up to a total of 3 hours of entertainment time, but now he has sacrificed his reading time."
Response:  We have 10 schools with an average of 5 teachers each (5 x 10 = 50). Each teacher has 2 assistants (2 x 50 = 100), and there are 3 students per assistant (3 x 100 = 300). Therefore, the total number of students is 300.
"Response:  We know that there are 175 coins in total and 35 of them are rubies. So, we can start by finding out how many zircons there are. To do this, we subtract the number of rubies from the total number of coins:

175 - 35 =?

Can you solve for the remaining coins?"
"Response:  If there are 60 students and each class has 5 students, then we have:

60 / 5 = 12 classes

So, there would be 12 teachers (walimu) in the school."
Response:  We know that Bailey has $5 for each of the first 8 weeks, so he has a total of $5 x 8 = $40 for the first 8 weeks. If he needs $100 in total, then he still needs $60 more. So, Bailey will have to find another way to get $60 or use his current money wisely to make up the difference.
Response:  We know that there are 5 classes in a day and each class has 15 students. So, in total, there are 5 x 15 = 75 students in the school. If each student pays $15 per week, then the total amount of money collected from all the students is 75 x $15 = $1,125 per week.
Response:  If Kelian has 20 cows and wants to sell them all at once, then he will have to divide his cows into groups of three because that is the maximum number of cows he can sell in one day. So, he will have to make 7 trips (3 x 7 = 21) to sell all his cows. However, if he only sells 20 cows per day, it will take him 4 days (20/3 = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24) to sell all his cows.
Response:  We know that Tommy has $3 for snacks and $4 for drinks, so he has a total of $3 + $4 = $7. He spent $43 on snacks and $23 on drinks, so he is left with $7 - $43 - $23 = $7 - $66 = $0. Therefore, Tommy has no money left after buying snacks and drinks.
"Response:  We know that Sheila will receive $150 every month for three months. That means she will get $150 x 3 = $450 in total. If there is a 2% interest rate per month, then the amount of money after one month will be:
$450 x (1 + 0.02) = $450 x 1.02 = $460
So, after one month, Sheila will have $460. After two months, the amount will be:
$460 x (1 + 0.02) = $460 x 1.02 = $472.40
And after three months, the amount will be:
$472.40 x (1 + 0.02) = $472.40 x 1.02 = $484.92
Therefore, Sheila will have $484.92 after three months."
"Response:  We know that Artie sells each plant for $2.74, $1.87 and $2.12 respectively. So if he sells 12 of one type of plant (let's say it's matageta), he will earn:

12 x $2.74 = $33.08

For petunia, he will earn:

9 x $1.87 = $16.93

And for begonia, he will earn:

17 x $2.12 = $35.94

Total earnings:

$33.08 + $16.93 + $35.94 = $86.05

So Artie will have earned $86.05 if he sells all his plants."
"Response:  We know that there are four types of coins in total (20, 50, 100, and 200). To find out how many coins of each type we need to make 16 rupees using only these denominations, let's first calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominations. The GCD is the largest number that divides all the denominations without leaving any remainder. In this case, it is 4 because 4 divides all the denominations without leaving any remainder. Now, let's divide each denomination by the GCD:  
20 / 4 = 5  
50 / 4 = 12  
100 / 4 = 25  
200 / 4 = 50  
Now, we can see that we have 5 coins of 20 rupees, 12 coins of 50 rupees, 25 coins of 100 rupees, and 50 coins of 200 rupees. Therefore, to make 16 rupees using only these denominations, we need:  
5 coins of 20 rupees + 12 coins of 50 rupees + 25 coins of 100 rupees + 50 coins of 200 rupees = 16 rupees."
Response:  We know that Cecilia has to feed her puppy with milk for 180 days (6 months). If she feeds it with milk every day, then she will need to buy 180 packets of milk. Each packet contains 400g of milk, so she needs to buy 72 kg of milk in total (180 x 400g = 72kg). Now, if we divide this amount by the weight of one packet (400g), we get the number of packets she needs to buy:  72 kg / 400 g per packet = 180 packets.
"Response:  We know that:
Raymond has 400 cows and gives 1/3 of them to Sarah.
Sarah already had 4 cows, so she now has:
4 + (1/3) x 400 = 4 + 133 = 137 cows.
Therefore, the difference between the number of cows Raymond has and the number of cows Sarah has is:
400 - 137 = 263 cows."
"Response:  We know that we have to buy 18 units of maua at $2.50 each and 2 units of maua at $1 each. So, let's calculate the total cost first.  
For 18 units of maua at $2.50 each, the total cost is:
18 x $2.50 = $45
For 2 units of maua at $1 each, the total cost is:
2 x $1 = $2
Total Cost = $45 + $2 = $47
Therefore, the total cost of buying 18 units of maua at $2.50 each and 2 units of maua at $1 each is $47."
Response:  We know that the value of the dog is $100 and the commission rate is 30%. To find out how much money the agent will make from selling the dog, we can use the following formula: Commission = Value x Rate. In this case, the commission would be: Commission = $100 x 30% = $30 So, the agent will make $30 if they sell the dog for $100.
"Response:  We know that wasichana wawili has 1/6 of the money and needs 24 shillings more to buy the book. So we can start by finding out how much she already has.  
1/6 of 200 =? (since 200 is the total amount)

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 5:

1/6 = 1 × 5 / 6 × 5 = 10 / 30

So wasichana wawili has 10 shillings. Now we need to find out how much more she needs to buy the book.

24 - 10 =?

The difference between 24 and 10 is 14 shillings. Therefore, wasichana wawili needs 14 shillings more to buy the book."
Response:  We know that Charlie had $10 and spent $21 at the mall to buy something worth $23 for one week. So he spent an extra $21 - $10 = $11 for one week. Now, if we divide $11 by 7 (days of the week), we get $1.57 per day. Therefore, Charlie will have $9 + $1.57 = $10.57 left after buying the item.
"Response:  We know that Alex has been working for 4 years and Grace will join them after 125 days. So we can start by finding out how many months Grace will work before joining Alex.  
There are 365 days in a year, so there are 365/125 = 2.97 months before Grace joins Alex. Now let's calculate how long Alex has worked already. Since he has worked for 4 years, he has worked for 4 x 12 = 48 months. Therefore, the total number of months that both Alex and Grace have worked together is 48 + 2.97 = 50.97 months. Finally, to find the total amount of time they have worked together, we multiply this number of months by the number of days in each month (assuming a 30-day month): 50.97 x 30 = 1529.1 days."
Response:  We have 3 vya waridi (3 x 25 = 75) and each has 8 miibas. So in total we have 75 x 8 = 600 miibas.
Response:  We know that there are 22 players in total and 8 of them have scored goals. So, we can say that 22 - 8 = 14 players have not scored any goals yet.
"Response:  We know that the person has been alive for 34 years and was born when they were 23 years old. So we can calculate their age as follows:

Age = (Current Year - Birth Year)
= (2023 - 1989)
= 34 years

Therefore, the person is currently 34 years old."
"Response:  We have been given that Greg has 30 cows and he sold 5 to his friend King'ora. So, how many cows does Greg have left?
We can start by subtracting 5 from 30:
30 - 5 =?
The answer is 25. Therefore, Greg has 25 cows left after selling 5 to King'ora."
"Response:  We know that Sylvie received $600 for the month of December last year (Desemba). If she worked for 5 months in that camp, then she earned $600 x 5 = $3,000 for the entire year. Now, we need to calculate how much her share would be if the camp takes 10% of the total earnings as commission.

We can use the formula: Share = Total Earnings x Commission Percentage

In this case, the total earnings are $3,000, and the commission percentage is 10%. So, we can calculate the share as follows:

Share = $3,000 x 10%
= $300

Therefore, Sylvie's share would be $300."
Response:  We know that Marilyn has 10 more records than Harald, so if Harald has 88,000 records, then Marilyn will have 88,000 + 10 = 98,000 records.
"Response:  We have 1/4 of the total amount which is $2k (since each unit costs $2). So we need to find out how much money Christina has.
We know that she spent 75% of her allowance, so we can calculate as follows:
$2k x 0.75 = $1.5k
Therefore, Christina has $1.5k - $2k = $500 left."
"Response:  We know that there are 10 dinosaurs in total and each one has 2 children except for Ted who has 5 children. So if we add up all the number of children from all the dinosaurs, we get:  
10 x 2 = 20 + 5 (Ted's children) = 25 children in total."
"Response:  We know that Marcia has two boyfriends, and each of them likes her equally. So we can say that the degree of love that Marcia's first boyfriend has for her is equal to the degree of love that her second boyfriend has for her. Now, if Cindy is also in love with one of Marcia's boyfriends (let's assume it's the same one), then the degree of love that this boyfriend has for Cindy is equal to the degree of love that he has for Marcia. Therefore, the total amount of love that all three people have for each other can be represented as follows:  
Love between Marcia and her first boyfriend = Love between Marcia and her second boyfriend = Love between Cindy and the boyfriend = 100%  
Now, since there are three people involved, the total amount of love cannot exceed 100%. So we can set up the following equation based on the information given:  
100% = Love between Marcia and her first boyfriend + Love between Marcia and her second boyfriend + Love between Cindy and the boyfriend  
Simplifying the equation further, we get:  
50% + 50% + x = 100% where x represents the percentage of love that Cindy has for the boyfriend.  
Solving for x, we get:  
x = 33%  
Therefore, the total amount of love that all three people have for each other is 100%, which means that Marcia loves both her boyfriends equally (50% each), and Cindy loves the boyfriend she is interested in equally (33%)."
"Response:  We know that Emily is older than Amy by 5 years and younger than James by 10 years. So we can start building our equation based on these two pieces of information.
Let E be Emily's age, A be Amy's age, J be James's age, and C be Corey's age.
We know that E > A + 5 (Emily is 5 years older than Amy) and E < J + 10 (Emily is 10 years younger than James).
Now we have two equations:
E > A + 5...(1)
E < J + 10...(2)
Can you solve for E using these two equations?"
"Response:  We know that Gerald can do it in 38 seconds, so he does one Viunzi every 38/4 = 9.5 seconds. Therefore, if Lee wants to do 400 Viunzis in the same time as Gerald, he would need to do them every 9.5 seconds.  
Therefore, the answer is 400 / 9.5 = 42."
Response:  We know that there are 12 cows in total and each cow has 6 calves, so there are 12 x 6 = 72 calves in total. Since we want to distribute these calves equally among the 3 men, each man will get 72 / 3 = 24 calves.
"Response:  We have 200 students in class 5 and we want to know how many girls are in the class. According to the information given, there are 2/5 of the students who are boys and 2/3 of the students who are girls. So, if we can find out how many boys are in the class, we can subtract that number from 200 to get the number of girls.
Let's start with the boys. If there are 2/5 of the students who are boys, then there are 2 x 4 = 8 boys in the class.
Now, let's find out how many girls are in the class. There are 200 - 8 = 192 students left. Since 2/3 of the students are girls, there are 2 x 192 = 384 girls in the class.
So, there are 384 girls in the class."
"Response:  We know that Harry is 9 years old and James is 2/3 of Harry's age. So we can start by finding out how old James is.  
We know that 1/3 of 9 is 3, so James is 3 + 2 = 5 years old. Therefore, Harry is 9 - 5 = 4 years older than James."
Response:  We know that Freda has 16 chickens and each chicken lays an average of 32 eggs per month. So, in total, Freda gets 16 x 32 = 512 eggs per month from her 16 chickens.
"Response:  We know that there are 30 cars on the road and each car takes 15 seconds to pass through the traffic light. So, in one minute, how many cars will have passed through the traffic light?  
To find out, we can use the formula: Number of cars passing through = Total number of cars x Time taken per car (in seconds)  
In this case, the total number of cars is 30, and the time taken per car is 15 seconds. So, we can calculate as follows:  
Number of cars passing through = 30 x 15 = 450 cars  
Therefore, in one minute, 450 cars will have passed through the traffic light."
Response:  We know that Mary has 18 eggs and she wants to distribute them equally among her friends and family so that each person gets 40 eggs. To do this, we need to divide 18 by 40. Can you help us with that calculation? The result is... (wait for the respondent to give their answer) Great! So, Mary will have 1 egg left over after distributing all 18 eggs.
"Response:  We know that Jerome had 4 friends and each friend gave him a gift worth $20. So, in total, Jerome received gifts worth $80 (4 x $20). Now, if the first friend gave him a gift worth $1 more than the second friend, and the third friend gave him a gift worth $1 less than the fourth friend, then we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Gift from first friend = Gift from second friend + $1
Gift from third friend = Gift from fourth friend - $1

We also know that the total value of all gifts is $80, so we can write another equation:

Total gifts = Gift from first friend + Gift from second friend + Gift from third friend + Gift from fourth friend

Now we have two equations and two unknowns ($1 and $60). Solving for $1, we get:

$1 = (Gift from second friend + $1) + (Gift from third friend - $1)

Simplifying, we get:

$1 = 2(Gift from second friend) + $1 - 2($3)

Solving further, we get:

$1 = 2(20) + $1 - 2(60)

$1 = 40 + $1 - 120

$1 = 51

So, the gift from the first friend was worth $51."
"Response:  We have 4 weeks to cover all the topics in the syllabus. If we allocate one week for each topic, we will need 4 weeks (1 week x 4 topics). However, since we have only 15 days left before the exam, we cannot afford to spend one whole week on each topic. So, let's divide the time allocated to each topic based on its importance and difficulty level. For example, we can allocate more time to the most important and difficult topics like Sayansi and Masomo ya Kijamii, and less time to the easier ones like Historia and Jiografia. After careful consideration, here is a suggested allocation of time per day for each topic:

Day 1-3: Sayansi - 3 days (1 day x 3 topics)
Day 4-6: Masomo ya Kijamii - 3 days (1 day x 3 topics)
Day 7-9: Historia - 3 days (1 day x 3 topics)
Day 10-12: Jiografia - 3 days (1 day x 3 topics)

Therefore, the daily allocation of time for each topic would be as follows:

Sayansi: 3 days x 6 hours/day = 18 hours
Masomo ya Kijamii: 3 days x 6 hours/day = 18 hours
Historia: 3 days x 6 hours/day = 18 hours
Jiografia: 3 days x 6 hours/day = 18 hours

Total time spent on all topics: 18 hours x 4 topics = 72 hours or 3 days."
"Response:  We know that John drinks water every day and he has to go to school every day. So, if we assume that John goes to school for 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), then he must be drinking water 5 times a week. Now, let's calculate how many glasses of water John drinks in a week.  
1 glass x 5 days/week = 5 glasses/week
Therefore, John drinks 5 glasses of water per week."
"Response:  We know that each jar of juice costs Ksh 10 and there are three jars in every pack (Ksh 3 x 3 = Ksh 9). So, if we want to buy one pack of juice for Ksh 42, how many packets will we need to buy?  
We can solve this problem using division. We divide Ksh 42 by Ksh 9 to get the number of packets we need:

Ksh 42 ÷ Ksh 9 = Number of packets

Solving for the number of packets, we get:

Number of packets = Ksh 42 ÷ Ksh 9
= 42 / 9
= 4

So, we need to buy four packets of juice at Ksh 3 each to cost Ksh 42."
Response:  If we have 1000 poppies and each one has 7 petals, then we have 1000 x 7 = 7000 petals in total. Now, if we want to know how many flowers we need to make 1 flower with 1000 petals, we can divide 1000 by 7 to get 143 flowers (1000 / 7 = 143). So, to make 1 flower with 1000 petals, we need 143 individual flowers.
Response:  If Amir has 5 cookies and he gives 2 to his friend, then he will have 5 - 2 = 3 cookies left. So, if we want to know how many more cookies Amir needs to buy so that they both have the same number of cookies, we need to find out how many cookies his friend has. In this case, his friend has 2 cookies. Therefore, Amir needs to buy 2 more cookies so that they both have the same number of cookies.
"Response:  We have;
Inchi 1 = 3 + 2 = 5
Inchi 2 = 5 + 2 = 7
Inchi 3 = 7 + 2 = 9
Inchi 4 = 9 + 2 = 11
Inchi 5 = 11 + 2 = 13
Inchi 6 = 13 + 2 = 15
Therefore, jumla ya nafasi ya ndani ya visanduku vyote 3 is 15."
"Response:  We know that Frankie watches television for 7 hours (Jumatanu, Jumanne, and Jamhuri) and rests for 30 minutes each day (Monday to Friday). Therefore, we can calculate the total number of minutes he spends watching TV as follows:

Total minutes = 7 x 24 (for each day) + 30 (rest time per day) x 5 (days)
= 168 + 150
= 318 minutes

So, Frankie spends 318 minutes watching TV every week."
"Response:  We know that Henry has eaten 15 cookies so far and there are 110 cookies in total. To find out how many more cookies Henry will eat, we can subtract the number of cookies he has already eaten from the total number of cookies. So, if we subtract 15 from 110, we get:

110 - 15 =?

Can you solve this subtraction problem to find out how many more cookies Henry will eat?"
Response:  If we have 10 gallons of milk at $3 each, then the total cost would be $3 x 10 = $30. However, if we deduct $0.20 per gallon for packaging, then the net cost would be $30 - $2 = $28. So, the person who bought 10 gallons of milk would pay $28.
"Response:  We know that Marcel has 3 apples and Beatrice has 24 - 3 = 21 apples. Now we need to find out how many apples they will have in total if they share them equally. To do this, we can use division.  
Marcel has 3 apples, so he will give 3/21 of the total number of apples to Beatrice.  
Beatrice has 21 apples, so she will give 21/2 = 10 apples to Marcel.  
Therefore, after sharing the apples equally, Marcel will have 3 + 10 = 13 apples, and Beatrice will have 21 - 10 = 11 apples."
"Response:  We know that Julia had 64 seconds to fill up her water bottle with water from the tap. She filled it up in 2 minutes and 30 seconds. So we can start by converting 2 minutes and 30 seconds into seconds.  
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

2 minutes = 2 x 60 = 120 seconds
30 seconds = 30

Total time taken = 120 + 30 = 150 seconds

Now, let's calculate how much of the 64 seconds Julia used for filling up her water bottle:

64 seconds - 150 seconds (total time taken) =?

Subtracting 150 from 64 gives us:

64 - 150 = -86

So Julia used 86 seconds less than the total time taken to fill up her water bottle!"
"Response:  We know that each teacher has 4 classes per day and teaches for 50 minutes in each class. So, if we multiply the number of classes by the duration of each class, we get:  
4 classes x 50 minutes/class = 200 minutes/day (total teaching time)
Now, let's calculate how much time each teacher spends on marking assignments per day:  
Each teacher has 4 classes x 20 students/class = 80 students per day.  
If each student submits one assignment per week, then the total number of assignments per day is:  
80 students x 1 assignment/student/week = 80 assignments/day.  
Assuming it takes 1 minute to mark each assignment, the total time spent on marking assignments per day is:  
80 assignments/day x 1 minute/assignment = 80 minutes/day
Therefore, each teacher spends 80 minutes per day marking assignments."
"Response:  We know that Ryan has 2 apples and he eats one apple every day for 15 days. So after 15 days, how many apples will be left with him?

We can use subtraction to find out. If Ryan has 2 apples and he eats 1 apple each day, then he will have 2 - 1 = 1 apple left after 1 day. Similarly, after 2 days, he will have 2 - 2 = 0 apples left. Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan will not have any apples left with him."
Response:  We know that Jamal can paint 6 pictures per day and each picture takes him 3 hours to complete. So he spends 3 x 6 = 18 hours painting every day. If Brittany can paint 50 pictures in one day, she must spend 50 / 3 = 17 hours painting every day. Since Jamal paints for 18 hours and Brittany paints for 17 hours, they both have the same amount of time to work on their art. Therefore, if Jamal can paint 1800 pictures, then Brittany can also paint 1800 pictures.
"Response:  We have two boxes of different sizes and prices. The smaller box (2 x 4 x 10) costs $10 per unit, while the larger box (4 x 4 x 10) costs $16 per unit. To find out how much money we will save if we buy the smaller box instead of the larger one, we need to calculate the total cost of both boxes first.

For the smaller box:
Total Cost = Number of units x Price per unit
= 10 x $10
= $100

For the larger box:
Total Cost = Number of units x Price per unit
= 16 x $16
= $256

Now, let's compare the total costs:
$256 (larger box) - $100 (smaller box) = $156
So, buying the smaller box instead of the larger one would save us $156."
Response:  We know that we have 120 grams of sugar and 75 grams of water in the ratio of 4:5. To find out how much sugar is needed to make 7 liters of juice, we need to first calculate how much water is needed. Since the ratio of water to sugar is 5:4, for every 4 parts of sugar, we need 5 parts of water. Therefore, if we want to mix 120 grams of sugar with water to make 7 liters of juice, we will need 5 x 120 = 600 grams of water. So, the total amount of liquid (water + juice) required would be 120 + 600 = 720 grams.
"Response:  We know that John has three children and each child needs $60 per month for their upkeep. To calculate the total amount of money needed for all three children, we can multiply the number of children by the cost per child. So, the total amount needed is:  
$60 x 3 = $180
Therefore, John needs $180 per month to cater for his three children's upkeep."
Response:  We know that each container has 5 items inside and there are 30 containers in total. So, if we multiply 30 x 5, we get 150 items in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 150.
"Response:  We know that Adrien and Lylah had $30,000 between them after one year, and they split it equally. So each of them had $15,000.  
Now, we are told that Adrien had $40,000 at the end of one year, so he must have earned $40,000 - $15,000 = $25,000 more than Lylah did. Therefore, Lylah had $15,000 + $25,000 = $40,000 at the end of one year."
"Response:  We know that there are 30 days in each month and we want to find out how many weeks there will be if we divide the number of days into weeks. To do this, we need to divide 30 by the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so let's divide 30 by 7:

30 / 7 =?

The result is:

30 / 7 = 4

So, there will be 4 weeks in one month if we divide the number of days into weeks."
"Response:  We know that Morisette has 5 apples and she gives 2 to Kael. So, how many apples does Morisette have left?  
We can use subtraction to find out. If Morisette had 5 apples and gave 2 to Kael, then she has 5 - 2 = 3 apples left. 
Therefore, Morisette has 3 apples left after giving 2 to Kael."
Response:  We know that Sadie has 8 chickens and each lays an average of 2 eggs per day. So in total, Sadie gets 8 x 2 = 16 eggs per day. Now, if she wants to increase her egg production by one egg per day, she will need to add one more chicken to her flock. Therefore, the number of chickens Sadie needs to have to produce 17 eggs per day is 9 (16 + 1).
"Response:  We know that Rosie can deliver milk in 3 minutes for every 10 bottles she delivers. So if she has to deliver 5 bottles, it will take her  5 x 3 = 15 minutes. Now, we are asked if she can deliver milk in 7 minutes for every 10 bottles she delivers. To find out, let's divide 7 by 3: 
7 ÷ 3 = 2 and some remainder. Since there is no remainder, Rosie can deliver milk in 2 x 3 = 6 minutes for every 10 bottles she delivers. Therefore, she can deliver 5 bottles of milk in 6 minutes."
"Response:  We know that there are 60 employees in total and Jennie is one of them. If 30 employees have already left the company before Jennie joined, then the number of employees remaining in the company would be:

60 - 30 = 30

So, there were 30 employees remaining in the company when Jennie joined."
"Response:  We know that Julia had 12 pieces of candy and she gave 5 to her friend. So, if we subtract 5 from 12, we get:

12 - 5 =?

Do you know the answer? It's 7!"
"Response:  We know that Dylan has 38 soseji for kuku and he wants to share them equally among 6 people, including himself. So, if we divide 38 by 7 (including Dylan), we get:

38 ÷ 7 =?

Do you want to try solving this problem yourself before looking at the solution?"
Response:  If Amy had 20 friends before Lily arrived and Lily has 50 friends now, then together they have 70 friends (20 + 50). So, if each of them has to divide their combined total of 70 friends equally among themselves, they will both end up with 35 friends (70 / 2 = 35).
Response:  We know that Dillon bought 4 packets of tikitimaji at $15 each, so he spent $60 on tikitimaji (4 x $15). He also bought 20 packets of pilipili at $15 each, so he spent $300 on pilipili (20 x $15). Additionally, he bought 10 packets of machungwa at $10 each, so he spent $100 on machungwa (10 x $10). In total, Dillon spent $960 ($60 + $300 + $100) on all three items.
"Response:  We know that the cost of treating patients at the two hospitals is as follows:
Hospital A charges $150 per day and Hospital B charges $200 per day.
We also know that each patient stays for 5 days, so we can calculate the total cost for each patient as follows:
For Hospital A:
$150 x 5 = $750
For Hospital B:
$200 x 5 = $1000
Now, let's find out how much money the hospitals will make from treating these 500 patients over a period of 24 hours.
For Hospital A:
$750 x 500 = $375,000
For Hospital B:
$1000 x 500 = $500,000
So, in this scenario, Hospital B would make more money than Hospital A, with a difference of $125,000 ($500,000 - $375,000)."
"Response:  We have 60 orphans and we want to distribute them among 10 groups of 5 each. To do this, we need to divide 60 by 10.  
60 ÷ 10 = 6 So, there will be 6 groups of 5 orphans in each group."
"Response:  We know that Joseph received $500 in May and $60 in June, so we can start by adding these amounts together to find his total earnings for the two months:

$500 + $60 = $560

Now, we are asked what the total amount was for the month of June only. To find this, we need to subtract the amount he earned in May from the total amount he earned for both months:

$560 - $500 = $60

So, Joseph earned $60 in the month of June alone."
"Response:  We have 3 people (Pam, Fred and Ali), each with their own schedule for the day.

1. Pam has to finish her work by 2 pm.
2. Fred has to finish his work by 4 pm.
3. Ali has no specific time limit.

Now, let's consider the total number of hours each person will work based on their schedules:

1. Pam: 2 pm - 8 am = 8 hours
2. Fred: 4 pm - 8 am = 6 hours
3. Ali: No specific time limit, so we'll assume she works for 8 hours like Pam.

Total hours worked by all three individuals:
8 + 6 + 8 = 22 hours

So, if everyone works for 22 hours today, and there are 6 tickets to be distributed among them, each ticket would represent 22/3 = 7.33 hours of work."
"Response:  We know that Jumatatu has 4 days and each day has 6 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours in Jumatatu is 4 x 6 = 24 hours. Now we need to find out how many minutes are in 24 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 
24 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes
Therefore, there are 1440 minutes in Jumatatu."
"Response:  If Tom has four cars and each car earns him $15 per day, then he will have earned in total:  
$15 x 4 = $60 per day.
If we multiply this amount by 30 days (assuming that is how long Tom wants to use each car), we get:
$60 x 30 = $1800 for one month.
So, if Tom uses all his cars for one month, he would have made:
$1800 x 4 = $7200 for the entire period."
"Response:  If Brian has 20 videos and he wants to watch only 5 of them, that means he will skip watching 15 videos (20 - 5 = 15). So, if Bobby is asking about the 5th video that Brian watched, then Bobby should ask ""What was the fifth video you watched?"" because Brian already skipped 15 videos before reaching the 5th one. Therefore, the correct answer is 5."
"Response:  We have 27 items in total and we need to divide them into two groups of 13 items each. To do this, we can use the greatest common divisor (GCD) algorithm. The GCD of 27 is 3, so we can divide 27 by 3 to get our quotient.  
Quotient = 27 / 3 = 9
Therefore, there are 9 items in each group."
"Response:  We know that Rory sold three items - sandwiches, chips, and biscuits. The cost of each item is as follows:
Sandwiches - $7.50 x 2 = $15.00
Chips - $1.50 x 2 = $3.00
Biscuits - $1.00 x 2 = $2.00
Total cost = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00
Now, we need to calculate the discount amount. Since the discount is 20%, we can calculate it as follows:
Discount percentage = 20%
Discount amount = (20% of total cost) x (1 - 0.20)
= (20/100) x (1 - 0.20)
= (2/10) x (1 - 0.20)
= (2/10) x 0.80
= $16.00
So, the discount amount would be $16.00. Now, let's subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the net price:
Net price = Total cost - Discount amount
= $20.00 - $16.00
= $4.00
Therefore, the net price of the items after applying a 20% discount would be $4.00."
"Response:  We know that Mark has to answer 75 questions in total and he needs 5 minutes for each question. So, if we divide 75 by 5, we get:

75 / 5 = 15

This means Mark will need 15 sets of 5 minutes each to answer all the questions. Now, let's consider the first set of 5 questions. If Mark answers these questions in 5 minutes, he will need an additional 5 minutes for each subsequent set of 5 questions, bringing the total time required for each set to:

5 + (5 x 2) = 5 + 10 = 15 minutes

Therefore, Mark will need a total of 15 x 15 = 225 minutes to answer all 75 questions. However, since he only has 8 hours available, he can only answer 225/8 = 28 questions per hour. This leaves him with 47 questions unanswered.

So, the number of questions Mark cannot answer is:

75 - 28 = 47"
Response:  If there are 22 pipes for every 12 inches of pipe length, then for 22 inches (which is equal to 2 feet), we would need 2 x 12 = 24 pipes. So, if we have 12 pipes that are 2 feet long, we will have 24 pipes in total.
"Response:  We have 20 items in total, and we want to divide them into groups of 12, 4, and the remaining items. To do this, we can use long division. Here's how it works out:

20 / 12 = 1 with 8 left over (12 x 1 + 8)
8 / 4 = 2 with 0 left over (4 x 2)

So there are 1 group of 12 items, 2 groups of 4 items, and 8 remaining items."
"Response:  We know that there are 700 cows in total and they give birth to calves every month. If we assume that each cow gives birth to one calf per month, then we can calculate how many calves are born in a month as follows:  
700 cows x 1 calf/cow/month = 700 calves/month
Now, if we want to find out how many calves are born in two months (i.e., 2 x 700 calves), we can simply multiply the number of calves born in one month by 2:  
700 calves/month x 2 = 1400 calves
Therefore, there would be 1400 calves born in two months."
Response:  If Jordan wants to earn $10 per month through watching videos, and he can watch 2 videos per day, then he needs to earn $5 per day from each video. Therefore, he needs to be paid $5 for every video he watches. So, if he watches 30 videos in a month (assuming 30 days), he will earn $150 ($5 x 30).
Response:  We know that John has 2, 3, and 4 dollar bills. He spends 2 dollars on chakula, so he has 2 - 2 = 0 dollars left. He then spends 3 dollars on chakula, so he has 0 - 3 = -3 dollars left. Finally, he spends 4 dollars on chakula, so he has -3 - 4 = -7 dollars left. Therefore, the total amount of money John spent on chakula is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 dollars.
"Response:  We know that the total cost of the house is $92 and we have two types of expenses: $2 for each square meter of land and $5 for each additional feature (such as plumbing or electricity). To find out how many square meters of land Kim needs to buy, we can divide the total cost by the cost per square meter: 
$92 / $2 = 46 square meters 
So, Kim needs to buy 46 square meters of land. Now, let's calculate the number of features she needs to add to her house: 
$92 - ($2 x 46) = $92 - $92 = $0 
Since there are no additional features, Kim doesn't need to pay anything extra. Therefore, the final amount Kim needs to pay is: 
$0 + $2 x 46 = $0 + $92 = $92 
Kim will pay a total of $92 for her house."
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare can produce 100 bags of maize. So, in total, John can produce 10 x 100 = 1000 bags of maize per year. However, we are also given that John wants to sell his maize after three months. Since there are four seasons in a year, let's assume that one season is equivalent to three months. Therefore, John can sell his maize twice a year, i.e., once during the first season and again during the third season. So, in total, John can sell 2 x 500 = 1000 bags of maize per year.
Response:  We know that Johnny has $500 in his savings account and he wants to buy a bike that costs $300. So, if he buys the bike, he will be left with $200. But then he is also given another $100 as change, so he will actually have $300 + $100 = $400. Therefore, the amount of money Johnny will have after buying the bike and receiving the change is $400.
"Response:  We know that Debra has 30 chickens and she wants to sell half of them in six weeks. So, if we divide 30 by 2, we get 15 (half of 30). Now, let's divide 15 by 6 (the number of weeks) to find out how many chickens Debra will sell each week.  
15 ÷ 6 = 2 
So, Debra will sell 2 chickens every week for six weeks."
"Response:  We know that Brittany spent $12 for adult tickets and $10 for child tickets. So she spent in total:

$12 x 1 = $12 (adult ticket) + $10 x 1 = $10 (child ticket) = $22

Now we are given that she received $8 back, so we can subtract it from what she spent:

$22 - $8 = $14

Therefore, Brittany spent $14 at the theme park."
"Response:  We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and James has more than 12 friends on Facebook. So we can start by listing out what we know:

Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook (C)
James has more than 12 friends on Facebook (J)

Now, let's use ""greater than"" symbol to represent ""more than"". We can write this as:

J > 12

This means that James has more than 12 friends on Facebook. Now, we want to find out how many more friends James has compared to Charlie. To do this, we can subtract the number of friends Charlie has from the number of friends James has:

J - C =?

We know that J is greater than 12, so we can substitute 12 for C:

J - 12 =?

Simplifying, we get:

J - 12 = J + 0

Solving for J, we get:

J = 24

Therefore, James has 24 friends on Facebook, which is 12 more than Charlie's 12 friends."
"Response:  We know that Steve can do a task in 3 minutes and Tim can do it in 2 minutes. So if they work together, how long will it take them to finish the task? To find this out, we need to add their times together.  
3 + 2 = 5 minutes
Therefore, it will take Steve and Tim 5 minutes to finish the task together."
"Response:  We have 5 people in total who want to water their plants with 25 liters of water each. So we need to find out how many trips they will make to the well if they go one by one and how many trips they will make if they go together in groups of three.

If one person goes to the well at a time, they will make 5 trips (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 5).

If three people go to the well together, they will make 3 trips (3 x 8 = 24).

So, the difference between going alone and going together is 25 - 24 = 1 trip.

Therefore, it is better for them to go together in groups of three to reduce the number of trips they need to make to the well."
"Response:  If Carl has $10 and he spends $0.10 on each cookie, how many cookies can he buy with $10?
We know that $10 / $0.10 = 100
So, Carl can buy 100 cookies with $10."
"Response:  We know that Dave had 3 bags of chips and he gave one bag to each of his three friends. So, if we represent the number of bags of chips as ""x"", then we can say that Dave had x = 3 bags of chips.
Now, let's consider what happened when Dave gave each friend a bag of chips. When he gave the first friend a bag, he was left with x - 1 bags of chips (since he gave one bag away). When he gave the second friend a bag, he was left with x - 2 bags of chips. And when he gave the third friend a bag, he was left with x - 3 bags of chips.
So, in total, Dave gave away x - 3 bags of chips to his three friends. But we also know that there were only two bags of chips left after everyone had their share. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x - 3 = 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 5
Therefore, Dave had 5 bags of chips in total before giving any to his friends."
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if we multiply 7 by 24, we get 168 hours per week (7 x 24 = 168). Now, let's consider how many hours Kimo spends on teaching each subject per week. We know that he teaches for 1 hour every day, so if we multiply 5 subjects by 1 hour each, we get 5 hours of teaching per day (5 x 1 = 5). Therefore, Kimo spends 5 hours per day teaching, which is equivalent to 35 hours per week (5 x 7 = 35). So, the correct answer is 35 hours.
"Response:  We know that bill has 300 shillings and wants to buy chocolate worth 120 shillings, bread worth 60 shillings, and he still needs some money for other things. So we can start by subtracting what he spent from his initial amount of money:  
300 - 120 = 180  
180 - 60 = 120  
So Bill has 120 shillings left after buying all those items."
"Response:  We have three quantities and we need to find out how many units of each quantity are needed for 2 months.
Quantity 1: Wanahitaji 200
For 2 months, we need = 2 x 200 = 400 units of this quantity.
Quantity 2: Wanahitaji 400
For 2 months, we need = 2 x 400 = 800 units of this quantity.
Quantity 3: Mtu wanahitaji 100 kila mwezi
For 2 months, we need = 2 x 100 = 200 units of this quantity.
Therefore, in total, we need:
400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 units."
Response:  We know that Blake ran for 15 minutes and covered 100 meters. That means he ran at a speed of 100/15 = 6.67 meters per minute. Now we need to find out how far Kelly ran in one minute if she ran at the same speed as Blake. So we can say that Kelly ran for 1 minute and covered a distance of 6.67 x 1 = 6.67 meters.
"Response:  We know that Raphael has $1.5 dollars and he wants to buy 2 books each costing $4. So, how much will he spend in total?
We can calculate as follows:
2 x $4 = $8
So, Raphael will spend $8 + $1.5 = $9.5
Therefore, Raphael needs $9.5 to buy the two books."
Response:  We know that there are 11 children in total and 6 of them have been chosen for the trip. This means we have 5 more spots available for the remaining 5 children. So, if we divide 5 among 11 children, each child will get approximately 0.45 (5/11) of a spot. However, since we need to round up to the nearest whole number, each child will actually get one full spot. Therefore, all 11 children can go on the trip!
"Response:  We know that there are 17 days between Juma Tatu and Juma Nane (Jumanne). And we also know that there are 7 more days of rain after Jumanne. So, if we subtract 7 from 17, we get:  
17 - 7 = 10  
Therefore, there are 10 days of rain during Jumanne."
Response:  We know that Anakin has 10 points in total and he loses 5 to Locsin. So, after losing 5 points, Anakin will have 10 - 5 = 5 points left. Now, we need to find out how many points Locsin gains from Anakin. According to the problem, Locsin gains 3 points for each of her three wins against Anakin. Therefore, she gains a total of 3 x 3 = 9 points from Anakin. So, the final score is Anakin with 5 points and Locsin with 9 + 5 = 14 points.
"Response:  We know that ikiwa bei mfuko wa marumaru ni $20 na bei hiyo huongezeka na 20% ya bei ya asili kila baada ya miezi miwili, which means that after one month (miezi miwili), the money will increase by 20%. So, if we start with $20, then after one month, the amount will be:

$20 x 1.20 = $24

So, the amount of money after one month is $24. Now, we are asked to find out how much the money will be after three months (baada ya miezi 36). To do this, we can multiply the amount after one month by 3:

$24 x 3 = $72

Therefore, the amount of money after three months is $72."
Response:  We know that the cost of one room is $4 and there are three rooms in total (vita). So, the total cost for all three rooms would be $4 x 3 = $12. Additionally, we know that there is an extra charge of $5 for the fourth room (mwanasesere), which brings the total cost to $12 + $5 = $17.
Response:  We know that Jackie has to work for 3 hours per day and earn $35 per hour. So she will have to work for 3 x 3 = 9 hours per week. Since she works only 3 days a week, her total weekly earnings will be 9 x $35 = $315. Subtracting $90 (the amount she spends on food) from $315 gives us $225 as her remaining income after paying for food.
"Response:  To calculate how much money Elvira needs to buy a computer and other expenses, we need to know her monthly income and what she spends it on. Based on the information provided, Elvira earns YURO 1500 per month and has a family of three (including herself). She wants to save YURO 1090 for buying a computer and other expenses. So, let's subtract the amount she wants to save from her monthly income:  
YURO 1500 - YURO 1090 = YURO 410  
This means that Elvira has YURO 410 left after saving YURO 1090 each month. Now, let's calculate how many months it will take for her to save enough money to buy the computer and other expenses. We can divide the total amount she wants to save (YURO 1090) by the amount she has left each month (YURO 410):  
YURO 1090 / YURO 410 = 2.68 months or approximately 2 months and 2 weeks. Therefore, Elvira needs to work for approximately 2 months and 2 weeks to save enough money to buy a computer and cover other expenses."
Response:  We know that Sandra has to work for 9 hours every day and she is paid $3 per hour. So, if she works for 9 hours, she will earn $27 (9 x $3). However, we are also given that she spends 15 minutes of her time each day doing something related to Spain. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 15 minutes is equal to 1/4 of an hour. Therefore, Sandra will spend 1/4 of her working time (9 hours) on activities related to Spain, which is equivalent to 2.25 hours (9 x 1/4). Now, let's calculate how much money Sandra will earn from her work excluding the time spent on activities related to Spain. To do this, we need to subtract the time spent on activities related to Spain from the total number of hours worked. In this case, we subtract 2.25 hours from 9 hours, which gives us 6.75 hours (9 - 2.25). So, Sandra will earn $67.50 (6.75 x $3) excluding the time spent on activities related to Spain.
Response:  We know that Seth is 2 years older than Brooke and they are both 28 years old now. So, we can say that Seth is currently 28 + 2 = 30 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy gives her $2, then she will have $8 + $2 = $10. So, Jimmy has $8 - $2 = $6 left.
Response:  We know that Pancho has 20 cows and he gives 10 to his friend as a gift. So, how many cows does Pancho have left? To find out, we need to subtract the number of cows given away from the total number of cows. 20 - 10 =? Yes, that's right! Pancho has 10 cows left.
"Response:  We know that each jar of coffee costs $25 and there are three jars (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). So, the total cost of all three jars is 3 x $25 = $75.
Now, we have to add the cost of one jacket which is $100 - $25 = $75 (since the cost of one jacket is $100 minus the cost of one jar of coffee). Therefore, the total cost of all four items (three jars of coffee and one jacket) is $75 + $75 = $150."
"Response:  We have three groups of animals - birds (wanyama), bees (walio), and butterflies (miguu). The number of each group is given as follows:

* Birds: 3 x 10 = 30
* Bees: 2 x 8 = 16
* Butterflies: 4 x 9 = 36

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of animals in Jake's collection:

30 + 16 + 36 = 72

So, Jake has 72 animals in his insect collection."
"Response:  We know that;
Sally two is 2 years older than granny red.
Granny red is 3 years younger than sally four.
Sally four is 32 years old and has been alive for 8 years more than Sally thirty-two.
We can start by calculating the age of Granny Red. Since she is three years younger than Sally Four, we subtract three from Sally Four's age to get her age:
Sally Four - Three = 32 - 3 = 29 years old.
Now let's calculate Sally Two's age. She is two years older than Granny Red, so we add two to Granny Red's age:
Granny Red + Two = 29 + 2 = 31 years old.
Finally, we can calculate Sally Thirty-Two's age. She is eight years older than Sally Four, so we add eight to Sally Four's age:
Sally Four + Eight = 32 + 8 = 40 years old.
Therefore, the sum of their ages is:
31 + 32 + 40 = 103 years old."
"Response:  We know that Jessica wants to increase her monthly income by 50%. So if she currently earns $300 per month, she would like to earn $450 per month (50% increase).

To calculate how much more she needs to charge for each item, we need to first find out how much she is charging now and then add the amount she wants to increase by.

For example, let's say she charges $200 for each item now. To find out how much she should charge to make $450 per month, we can add the amount she wants to increase by ($200 x 1.5 = $300) to what she is currently charging:

$200 + $300 = $500

So, Jessica should charge $500 for each item to make $450 per month."
"Response:  We know that Billy has been eating for 60 minutes and he still has 5 seconds left before his meal is over. So we can start counting from 60 to find out how many bites Billy took during his meal.

1. 60 - 5 = 55 (seconds)
2. 55 / 60 = 0.917 (approximately)
3. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert this to minutes as follows:
4. 0.917 x 60 = 55.1 minutes (approximately)

So Billy took approximately 55.1 bites during his meal."
"Response:  We know that Juan wants to buy lemons and sugar. He has $25 to spend. The cost of one lemon is $3, and the cost of one kilogram of sugar is $2. So if he buys only lemons, he can get:  
$25 / $3 = 8 lemons (since each lemon costs $3)  
But Juan also wants to buy sugar. If he spends all his money on sugar, he will have spent:  
$25 x 2 kg = $50 (since one kilogram of sugar costs $2)  
So Juan cannot afford to buy both lemons and sugar with his $25."
Response:  We know that there were 240 people in total and 80 of them were women. So, the number of men is 240 - 80 = 160. Now, we are told that 60 of these men were in team A. Therefore, the number of men who were not in team A is 160 - 60 = 100. Since all the women were in team B, the number of women in team B is 80. The number of players in team B (men + women) is therefore 100 + 80 = 180.
"Response:  We know that Zaid spends $200 per month on rent and utilities for her house. She wants to save up for a car, so she sets aside $700 each month towards this goal. If she has $6000 available every month, here's how much she would have left over after paying for her expenses:

$6000 - $200 = $5800 (left over)

Now, let's see how much of that amount is spent on the car fund:

$5800 - $700 = $5100 (available for the car fund)

So, if Zaid has $6000 available every month and spends $200 on rent and utilities, she would have $5100 left over for her car fund."
"Response:  We know that Monica is 4 years older than Rani and both are born in the same year. So, if Rani is x years old, then Monica will be x + 4 years old. Now we are given that Bo is 40 years old and has four children. Therefore, the sum of the ages of his children must be equal to 40. Let's write down the equation:
x + (x + 4) + (x + 4) + (x + 4) = 40...(1)
Now we can simplify this equation by combining like terms:
3x + 16 = 40...(2)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 12
So, Rani is 12 years old and Monica is 12 + 4 = 16 years old."
Response:  We know that Lloyd has $10 and he spends $2 at each of two shops. So, after buying from the first shop, he will have $10 - $2 = $8 left. After buying from the second shop, he will have $8 - $2 = $6 left. Therefore, Lloyd will have $6 left after buying from both shops.
"Response:  We have 80 students in class and we need to distribute them into groups of 3 or 4. To do this, we can use division. So, let's divide 80 by 3 (the number of students in each group).  
80 ÷ 3 =?
We get:
80 ÷ 3 = 26
So, there will be 26 groups of 3 students each. Now, if we want to find out how many groups of 4 students we can make, we can divide 80 by 4:
80 ÷ 4 =?
We get:
80 ÷ 4 = 20
So, there will be 20 groups of 4 students each. In total, there will be 26 + 20 = 46 groups."
"Response:  We know that Sandra has 200 shillings and she wants to buy something worth 11 shillings using only coins. She has pinkies of 5 shillings each. So, we can start by finding out how many pinkies she needs to buy the item.  
Let's divide 11 shillings by 5 shillings (the cost of one pinkie):
11 / 5 = 2
So, Sandra needs two pinkies to buy the item. Since she has 200 shillings, she will have enough money after buying two pinkies. Therefore, the remaining amount of money that Sandra will have is:
200 - 10 (cost of two pinkies) = 190 shillings.
Therefore, Fred should give Sandra 190 shillings instead of 11 shillings."
"Response:  We know that Mark is 5 years older than Jean and Jean is 30 years old. So we can start by finding out how old Mark is.  
Mark = Jean + 5 
Mark = 30 + 5 
Mark = 35 
So Mark is 35 years old."
Response:  We know that each member of the team has to work for 4 minutes and 40 seconds (4 x 40 = 160 seconds). If there are 4 members in the team, then together they will work for 160 + 160 = 320 seconds or 5 minutes and 20 seconds. So, if one person works alone, they will take 5 minutes and 20 seconds to do the same job.
Response:  We have three numbers to guess and each number has two possible values, so we need to try all possible combinations of values for each number. That means we need to try 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 different combinations. If we guess correctly, we win! So our chances of winning are 1/8 or approximately 0.125.
Response:  If Mamake has 20 cows and each cow gives 2 liters of milk per day, then in one day, Mamake will have 40 liters of milk (2 x 20). Now, if we assume that Mamake wants to give 1 liter of milk to each of her 5 children, she will have 4 liters of milk left over (40 - 5 = 4). So, the number of days Mamake can feed her 5 children with 1 liter of milk each is 4 days.
"Response:  We have 160 cows in total and we need to distribute them equally among 10 bands. To do this, we will divide 160 by 10 to get the number of cows each band should receive.

160 / 10 = 16

So, each band will receive 16 cows."
"Response:  If Mendy lent Benedict $100 for 3 months at an interest rate of 2% per month, how much will he pay back to Benedict after 3 months?

First, we calculate the total amount owed after one month:
$100 x (1 + 0.02) = $100 x 1.02 = $102

Now, let's calculate the total amount owed after two months:
$102 x (1 + 0.02) = $102 x 1.02 = $104.04

Finally, let's calculate the total amount owed after three months:
$104.04 x (1 + 0.02) = $104.04 x 1.02 = $106.08

Therefore, Mendy will have to pay Benedict $106.08 after three months."
Response:  We have been given that each chicken lays one egg per day and sells at $2. If we sell all the eggs of 10 chickens, we get $2 x 10 = $20 per day. Now, if we assume that each chicken consumes $3 worth of feed per day, then the total cost of feeding 10 chickens would be $3 x 10 = $30 per day. So, the daily profit would be $20 - $30 = $-$10 or negative ten dollars. Therefore, it is not profitable to raise chickens in this scenario.
Response:  We know that marafiki watatu (the three friends) spent $20.25 together and each one got $6.75 worth of food. So, if they went on two separate safaris, each safari would cost $33 x 2 = $66. Therefore, the total amount spent on both safaris is $66 + $66 = $132. If they shared the remaining $4.50 equally among themselves, each person would get $4.50 / 3 = $1.50.
"Response: 
1. John can do 3 tasks in 1 hour.
2. He takes 2 minutes to complete one task.
Now we need to find out how many tasks he can complete in 2 minutes.
To do this, we divide the number of tasks he can complete in 1 hour (3) by the time it takes him to complete one task (2 minutes).
So, John can complete 3/2 = 1.5 tasks in 2 minutes."
"Response:  If we have 3 and half (3.5) weeks to complete a project with a daily workload of 10 hours per day, then we can calculate as follows:  

Total working days = Total number of weeks x Number of working hours per day  
= 3.5 x 10  
= 35 working days  
Therefore, if we have 3 and half weeks to complete a project with a daily workload of 10 hours per day, we will have 35 working days to finish the task."
"Response:  We have;
Miti = 10,000 (given)
Kila Mwaka = 10 (given)
Anaanza na Miti = 50 (given)
After 10 years, 30% of the money is lost.
So, we need to find out how much money will be left after 10 years.
Let's start with the first year.
Year 1:
Miti = 10,000
Anaanza na Miti = 50
Now, 30% of the money is lost.
30/100 x 10,000 = 3,000
So, the amount left after the first year is:
Miti - 3,000 = 7,000
Repeat this process for each year until the tenth year.
Year 2:
Miti = 7,000
Anaanza na Miti = 50
Loss = 30% of 7,000
= 30/100 x 7,000 = 2,100
So, the amount left after the second year is:
Miti - 2,100 = 4,900
Year 3:
Miti = 4,900
Anaanza na Miti = 50
Loss = 30% of 4,900
= 30/100 x 4,900 = 1,470
So, the amount left after the third year is:
Miti - 1,470 = 3,430
Continue this process until you reach the tenth year.
Year 10:
Miti = 3,430
Anaanza na Miti = 50
Loss = 30% of 3,430
= 30/100 x 3,430 = 1,031
So, the amount left after ten years is:
Miti - 1,031 = 2,409
Therefore, after ten years, there"
"Response:  We know that there were initially 18 pink flamingos in the park (Sue's backyard). Then, one day, 18 more flamingos arrived, bringing the total number of flamingos to 36. However, we are asked how many flamingos have pink feathers. To determine this, let's count the number of flamingos with pink feathers among the original 18 and add it to the number of new arrivals who also have pink feathers.

Among the initial 18 flamingos, we can see that all of them have pink feathers, so the number of flamingos with pink feathers is 18. Among the new arrivals, we are told that only 18 out of 36 flamingos have pink feathers. Therefore, the total number of flamingos with pink feathers is:

18 + 18 = 36

So, there are 36 flamingos with pink feathers in Sue's backyard."
"Response:  We know that Violetta wants to buy 5 packets of crackers and each packet costs $2. So she needs to pay in total:  
5 x $2 = $10 + $20 = $30."
"Response:  We know that the cost of 1 pen is $1.20 and the cost of 1 notebook is $0.30. So if we buy 8 pens and 8 notebooks, how much will it cost in total?

Pens: 8 x $1.20 = $9.60
Notebooks: 8 x $0.30 = $2.40
Total Cost: $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00"
"Response:  We have 200 kg of maize flour and we want to know how much ugali (made from cornmeal) we can make with it if we use 40 liters of water. To start, let's convert the weight of maize flour from kilograms to grams: 
200 kg x 1000 g/kg = 200,000 g
Now, we need to find out how many cups of cornmeal we can get from this amount of maize flour. One cup of cornmeal is equal to approximately 150 grams, so:
200,000 g / 150 g/cup = 1333.33 cups
Finally, we need to calculate how much ugali we can make using 40 liters of water. Since each cup of cornmeal requires approximately 2 liters of water, we can calculate as follows:
1333.33 cups x 2 L/cup = 2666.67 liters
Therefore, we can make approximately 2666.67 liters of ugali using 200 kg of maize flour and 40 liters of water."
"Response:  We have 23786 people in total (men and women). Men are 8417 and women are 9092. Now we need to find out how many children there are. Children are the difference between men and women. So, if we subtract 8417 from 9092, we get:
Children = 9092 - 8417 = 675
Therefore, there are 675 children in Jiji la Soda."
"Response:  We know that Elaine had 20 Pokémon at first and then added three more in the second month. So, if she started with 20 Pokémon and added three more, how many does she have now?  
We can use addition to solve this problem. If Elaine had 20 Pokémon and added three more, she has a total of:
20 + 3 = 23
So, Elaine currently has 23 Pokémon."
"Response:  We know that Mark earns $5 for every sentence he writes and Publisher A pays him $1000 per week. If Mark writes 1000 sentences, then his total earnings would be:  

$5 x 1000 = $5000

So, Mark earns $5000 per week from Publisher A."
"Response:  We know that there are 5 liters of water consumed every morning and 6 liters of water consumed every evening. So, if we want to find out how much water is consumed daily, we need to add up both amounts. Therefore, the total amount of water consumed daily is:

5 + 6 = 11 liters per day."
"Response:  We know that John has $5000 and he wants to save it for five years at an interest rate of 5% per year. So, if we divide the total amount by the number of years, we get the annual interest.  
Annual Interest = Total Amount / Number of Years  
= $5000 / 5  
= $1000  
Now, let's calculate how much money John will have after each year.  
Year 1:  
Initial Investment + Annual Interest = $5000 + $1000  
= $6000 Year 2:  
$6000 + Annual Interest = $6000 + $1000  
= $7000 Year 3:  
$7000 + Annual Interest = $7000 + $1000  
= $8000 Year 4:  
$8000 + Annual Interest = $8000 + $1000  
= $9000 Year 5 (Final):  
$9000 + Annual Interest = $9000 + $1000  
= $10,000 Therefore, John will have $10,000 after five years, assuming an interest rate of 5% per year and no withdrawals or additional deposits."
Response:  We know that there are 10 cows in total and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. So, the total amount of milk produced daily is 10 x 5 = 50 liters. Since we want to calculate how much milk will be produced in one year (12 months), we need to multiply the daily production by 12. Therefore, the total amount of milk produced in one year is 50 x 12 = 600 liters.
Response:  We have 3 eggs for making omelette and we need to use them all. So, we will make 3 omelettes using all the eggs. Each omelette requires 1 egg. Therefore, we will use 3 eggs in total. Now, let's talk about the bread. We have 2 loaves of bread, each containing 8 slices. Since we want to make sandwiches with 2 slices of bread each, we can make 4 sandwiches in total (2 x 2 = 4). As for the remaining bread slices, we can use them to make another sandwich with 1 slice of bread left over. So, the total number of sandwiches we can make is 5 (4 + 1). Finally, let's count the number of jumbles we need to make. We have 8 jumbles in total (5 sandwiches x 2 jumbles per sandwich), so the answer is 8.
"Response:  We know that Janet has 22 beads in her bag and she gave 10 to Manjano. So, how many beads does Janet have left?  
We can use subtraction to find out. If we subtract 10 from 22, we get:  
22 - 10 =?  
The answer is 12! Therefore, Janet has 12 beads left in her bag."
"Response:  We know that Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in the five tests respectively. To find out which test he scored 93, we need to look at each test score and compare it with 93.

Test 1: 89 > 93 (89 is greater than 93)
Test 2: 71 < 93 (71 is less than 93)
Test 3: 92 = 93 (92 is equal to 93)
Test 4: 100 > 93 (100 is greater than 93)
Test 5: 86 < 93 (86 is less than 93)

Since none of the scores match 93, Brinley did not score 93 in any of the tests. Therefore, there is no test where Brinley scored 93."
"Response:  We know that Michael has to travel 25 miles in 3 hours and he is driving at a speed of 60 km/h. To find out how many kilometers he will cover in 3 hours, we can multiply his speed by the number of hours he will be driving. So,

60 km/h x 3 hrs =?

We know that there are 1 hour = 60 minutes, so

60 km/h x 3 hrs = 60 x 3 = 180 km

Therefore, Michael will cover 180 km in 3 hours."
"Response:  We know that each chocolate bar weighs 25 grams and there are 80 of them in total. So, if we multiply 25 grams by 80 bars, we get:

25 x 80 = 2000 grams

Now, we need to find out how many grams of the total weight is made up of just the chocolate bars. To do this, we subtract the weight of the chocolate bars from the total weight:

2000 - 25 x 80 = 2000 - 2000 = 0 grams

So, all 2000 grams of the total weight is made up of just the chocolate bars!"
"Response:  We have 4 days for Jumatatu and each day has 24 hours. Therefore, we can calculate as follows:  
Day 1 = 24 hrs x 1 = 24 hrs  
Day 2 = 24 hrs x 2 = 48 hrs  
Day 3 = 24 hrs x 3 = 72 hrs  
Day 4 = 24 hrs x 4 = 96 hrs  
Total hours for Jumatatu = 24 + 48 + 72 + 96 = 240 hrs  
Therefore, the total number of minutes for Jumatatu is 240 hrs x 60 min/hr = 14,400 min."
"Response:  We know that the total cost of the project is $6000 and we have to distribute this amount among 4 workers. So, each worker will get:

$6000 / 4 = $1500

Therefore, each worker will receive $1500 as their share of the project cost."
Response:  We know that Sara has to pay $30 for each of her two children and $20 for herself, so she needs to have $30 + $20 + $20 = $70 in total. However, she only has $10 left after buying food for her children, so we need to find out how many meals she can buy with $10. If she spends $5 per meal, then she can buy $10 / $5 = 2 meals. Therefore, Sara cannot afford to buy the jacket and feed her children for one day.
Response:  We know that Jerry eats 3 eggs in the morning and 5 eggs in the evening, so he consumes a total of 8 eggs per day (3 + 5). Now, if Jerry has 42 eggs, how many days will they last him? To find out, divide the number of eggs by the number of eggs consumed per day: 42 / 8 = 5 days. Therefore, Jerry's 42 eggs will last him for 5 days.
Response:  If he has to eat 3 meals per day and each meal takes 1.5 hours, then he will spend 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 hours eating per day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, he will have spent 4.5/24 = 0.19 (or 19%) of his time eating.
Response:  We know that Sloane has 100 shillings at first and then she spends 50 shillings on the first day. So, after one day, she will have 100 - 50 = 50 shillings left. On the second day, she will spend another 50 shillings, so she will be left with 50 - 50 = 0 shillings. Therefore, the total amount of money that Sloane spent during the two days is 50 + 50 = 100 shillings.
"Response:  We know that Jerry has 4 cups of water in his bucket and he wants to pour it into smaller buckets. He can do this in 4 minutes because there are 4 minutes left before the time is up. Now, let's see how much water Jerry will have in each small bucket after 4 minutes.  
1 cup = 8 ounces 
Therefore, since Jerry has 4 cups of water, he has 4 x 8 = 32 ounces of water in total. 
Now, let's divide the total amount of water among the 3 small buckets. Since each small bucket can hold 8 ounces of water, we can fill them as follows: 
Small Bucket #1: 32/3 = 10 ounces (since there are 3 small buckets)
Small Bucket #2: 32/3 = 10 ounces
Small Bucket #3: 32/3 = 10 ounces
So, after 4 minutes, Jerry will have 10 ounces of water in each of his three small buckets."
"Response:  We know that Lori has to pay $320 for the job and she will get $32 as her share of profit. So, if she works for one hour, how much will she earn?  
We can start by calculating the amount she will earn per minute:  
$32 / 1 hour = $32 / 60 minutes = $0.53 per minute  
Now, we need to calculate how many minutes she will work in one hour:  
$8 / 1 hour = $8 / 60 minutes = 0.13 minutes per hour  
So, if Lori works for one hour, she will earn:  
$0.53 x 0.13 hours = $6.94  
Therefore, Lori will earn $6.94 if she works for one hour."
"Response:  We know that Janeth has $2000 and she spends 10% of her money every month. To find out how much she will have after 12 months, we need to calculate how much she spends each month first.  
If she spends 10% of her money every month, then she spends $200 (10% of $2000). So, after one month, she will have $1800 ($2000 - $200) left.  
Now, let's calculate how much she will have after 12 months:  
After 1 year, she will have $1800 x 12 = $21,600."
"Response:  We have 4 warids in total and each has 7 dalias. So we can calculate as follows:  
Total number of dalias = 4 x 7 = 28 dalias. 
Therefore, there are 28 dalias in the entire chombo."
"Response:  We know that;
Umri wa Adrian = 30 - 5 = 25 (since Adrian is 30 years old and has been married for 5 years)
Umri wa Harriet = 21 + X (where X is the number of years Harriet will be married after 21 years)
Since Harriet is currently 21 years old and will be married for some number of years in the future, we can write:
Umri wa Harriet = 21 + X
Now, we know that:
Umri wa Zack = Umri wa Harriet + X (since Zack will be married for X years after Harriet)
Therefore, we can write:
Umri wa Zack = (21 + X) + X = 21 + 2X
So, the numeric answer would be:
Umri wa Zack = 21 + 2(21) = 21 + 42 = 63"
"Response:  We know that Jojo has 251 points and Naomi has 68 points. To find out how many more points Jojo has than Naomi, we can subtract their scores:  
251 - 68 = 183  
So, Jojo has 183 more points than Naomi."
"Response:  We have two tasks to complete:

Task 1: Solve the word puzzle (maneno panda) with 10 clues in 5 minutes.

Task 2: Solve the Sudoku puzzle (mafumbo 8) in 3 minutes.

To solve both tasks within the given time limits, we need to allocate our time wisely. Here's a possible plan:

* Spend 4 minutes on Task 1 (solving the word puzzle): 10 clues x 2 minutes per clue = 20 minutes.
* Spend 2 minutes on Task 2 (solving the Sudoku puzzle): 9x9 grid x 2 minutes per minute = 18 minutes.

Total time required: 4 + 2 = 6 minutes.

Therefore, we can complete both tasks within the given time limits of 5 and 3 minutes, respectively."
"Response:  We know that there are 120 liters of water in the tank (lita 120 ya maji). Celine has taken out 90 liters of water from the tank (kutoka kwa tangi hiyo kunyunyuzia shamba lake), leaving 30 liters of water in the tank (lita 90 ya maji kutoka kwa tangi hiyo). Now, if we want to calculate how much more water is needed for the second crop, we need to subtract the amount of water already used (90 liters) from the total amount of water available (120 liters): 
120 - 90 = 30 liters.
Therefore, Celine needs 30 liters more water for her second crop."
"Response:  We know that Andy has $90 and he wants to buy a bike that costs $40 more than the previous one. So we can start by finding out how much the previous bike cost. To do this, we subtract $40 from $90:

$90 - $40 = $50

So the previous bike cost $50. Now we know that Andy needs $40 more to buy the next bike, so we add $40 to $50:

$50 + $40 = $90

Therefore, the next bike will cost $90."
"Response:  We know that the camping needs $15,000 for one year and they have already spent $3,000. So, we need to find out how much money they will need for the remaining nine months. To do this, we can divide the total amount needed for one year by the number of months they have already spent the money. In this case, we can divide $15,000 by 9 (since they have already spent three months). Therefore, the amount of money the camping needs for the remaining nine months is:  
$15,000 / 9 = $1,666.67 per month."
"Response:  We know that Carlos earns $30 per month and Benji earns $18 per month. They both work for 3 months (Carlos) and 5 months (Benji). So we need to calculate how much money they will have earned in total.

For Carlos:
Monthly income = $30 x 3 = $90
Total income = $90 x 3 = $270

For Benji:
Monthly income = $18 x 5 = $90
Total income = $90 x 5 = $450

Therefore, the total amount of money that Carlos and Benji will have earned is:
$270 + $450 = $720"
"Response: 
1. Distance from New Jersey to Rochester = 350 miles (based on Google Maps)
2. Time taken to cover this distance at an average speed of 60 mph (assuming the car can maintain this speed throughout the journey):
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 350 miles / 60 mph
Time = 5.83 hours
So, it will take approximately 5 hours and 49 minutes to drive from New Jersey to Rochester at an average speed of 60 mph."
"Response:  We know that James has 30 Pokémon cards for each of his three starters - Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. That means he has a total of 90 cards.  
We also know that he has 20 cards for each of his other two Pokémon, which are Pikachu and Eevee. So, in total, he has 60 cards for these two Pokémon.  
Now, let's calculate how many cards James has altogether. He has 90 + 60 = 150 cards!"
"Response:  We know that we have to spend $6.50 in total for lunch and snacks. We also know that we spent $2.00 on drinks, $1.00 on fries, $1.00 on popcorn, and $0.25 on two candy pieces. So, how much did we spend on food? To calculate this, let's add up all of these amounts:

$2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.25 = $4.25

So, we spent $4.25 on food. Now, we need to find out how much change we should get back from our $5.00 allowance. To do this, we can subtract the amount we spent on food from our allowance:

$5.00 - $4.25 = $0.75

Therefore, we should receive $0.75 as change."
"Response:  We know that Kalinda can do 360 degrees in 4 minutes. So, if we divide 360 by 4, we get:

360 / 4 = 90

So, Kalinda can do one complete rotation (360 degrees) in 90 seconds or 1 minute and 30 seconds."
"Response:  We know that initially, Ashlyn had 120 tikitis and sold 30% of them at a profit of 3/4 of the price. So, she sold (30% x 120) = 36 tikitis. Now, we need to find out how much money she made from selling these tikitis.

Let's calculate the amount of money she made:

Amount of money made = Price per tikiti x Number of tikitis sold
= (3/4) x 36
= 9 x 36
= 324

So, Ashlyn made $324 from selling 36 tikitis."
"Response:  We have 12 garages and each one costs $20,000. So we need to find out how much money is needed in total for all of them. If there is a 10% discount on each garage, then we can calculate as follows:  
Total cost = (12 x $20,000) x 90% = (12 x $20,000) x 0.9 = $240,000  
Now, if each garage has a discount of $1000, then the total amount saved would be:  
$1000 x 12 = $12,000  
So, the net amount paid for all 12 garages would be:  
$240,000 - $12,000 = $228,000"
"Response:  We know that Kylie has 5 more children than Robert does. So if Robert has x children, then Kylie has x + 5 children.
We also know that Kylie has 20 children in total. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 5) = 20...(1)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 5 = 20...(2)
Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:
2x = 15...(3)
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
x = 7...(4)
Therefore, Robert has 7 children."
Response:  If there are 50 workers in the farm and each worker earns $10 per day, then the total daily income of all workers is 50 x $10 = $500.
Response:  We know that there are 36 people in total and they have to share the food equally among themselves. If we divide 36 by 4 (the number of meals), we get 9 as our quotient. So each person will get 9 portions of food for the day.
"Response:  We know that Steve has two children and each child drinks three glasses of milk per day. So, in total, Steve gives out 2 x 3 = 6 glasses of milk every day to his children. Now, if he wants to give one more glass of milk to each child, he will have to increase the number of glasses by 1 for each child. Therefore, the new amount of milk that Steve needs to buy is:

6 + 1 + 1 = 8 glasses of milk per day."
"Response:  We know that there are 20 people in total and each person can have at most 4 slices of pizza. So we need to divide 20 by 4 to find out how many groups of 4 people will be formed.  
20 / 4 = 5  
So, there will be 5 groups of 4 people. Now, let's calculate how many slices of pizza each group will get. Since each group has 4 people, they will get 4/4 = 1 slice of pizza per group.  
Since there are 5 groups, we multiply 5 by 1 to get the total number of slices of pizza needed:  
5 x 1 = 5  
Therefore, John needs to order 5 slices of pizza for all the 20 people."
Response:  We have 25 shillings and we want to divide it among three people so that each person gets an equal amount of money. If we divide 25 by 3, we get... (counting on our fingers)...8! Each person will get 8 shillings.
Response:  We know that Johnny gave Alice $20 and asked her to keep $10 for herself. So, if we subtract $10 from $20, we get $10 as the remaining amount. Therefore, the amount left with Alice after one month is $10.
"Response:  We know that Mary is 3 years older than Joan, and Joan is 2 years younger than Jessa. So if we let J be the age of Joan, then Mary's age would be J + 3. Also, since Jessa is 20 years old, her age at birth would have been 20 - 2 = 18. Therefore, the sum of their ages at birth would be:  
J + (J + 3) + 18 = J + J + 3 + 18 = 3J + 21  
Now we need to find out what value of J makes this equation true. To do so, we can set up the following equation:  
3J + 21 = 20  
Solving for J, we get:  
3J = 21 - 20 = 1  
J = 1/3  
So Joan is 1/3 years old, and Mary is 1/3 + 3 = 4/3 years old."
"Response:  We have 1000 students in total and we need to distribute them into three groups of equal size using the information given.

Group A has 30% of the students or 300 students (1000 x 30%).

Group B has 3/5 of the remaining students or 240 students (1000 - 300 = 700 x 3/5).

Group C has the remaining students or 460 students (1000 - 300 - 240 = 460).

Therefore, the number of students in each group is:

Group A: 300
Group B: 240
Group C: 460"
"Response:  We know that;
James has 6 more than Robert.
John has 2 more than Robert.
If John has 54, how many does he have more than James?
Let's start with what we know about James and Robert:
James has 6 more than Robert. So, if Robert has x, then James has x + 6.
Now let's look at what we know about John and Robert:
John has 2 more than Robert. So, if Robert has x, then John has x + 2.
We also know that John has 54. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:
x + 2 = 54... (1)
Now we need to find out how many more John has than James. To do this, we can substitute John's value into the first equation:
x + 2 = 54
Substituting x = x + 6 from the second equation:
x + 2 + 6 = 54
Combine like terms:
7 + 2 = 54
9 = 54
So, John has 9 more than James.
Therefore, if John has 54, he has 54 + 9 = 63 more than James."
"Response:  We know that Dolly has $10 and Pandora has $20. If they both spend their money together, how much will they have in total?
We can start by adding Dolly's money to Pandora's money:
$10 + $20 = $30
So, if Dolly and Pandora spend their money together, they will have a total of $30."
"Response:  We know that Mike has 5 friends and he wants to divide them into groups of 2 each. So we can start by writing down the names of his friends in two lists:

List 1 (Group 1):

1. Name 1
2. Name 2
3. Name 3
4. Name 4
5. Name 5

List 2 (Group 2):

1. Name 6
2. Name 7
3. Name 8
4. Name 9
5. Name 10

Now, let's see how many days it will take for Mike to meet with each group. Since there are 5 friends in total, and each group should have 2 friends, we can conclude that:

Mike will meet with Group 1 for 5 days (since there are 5 friends in this group).
He will meet with Group 2 for 5 days as well (since there are also 5 friends in this group).
In total, Mike will spend 10 days meeting with both groups.

So, the answer is 10 days."
"Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 coins and he spends 15 coins per day for 30 days. So, in total, he will spend 15 x 30 = 450 coins. Now, let's calculate how many coins he will have left after 30 days:  
1000 - 450 = 550 coins. Therefore, Jason will have 550 coins left after 30 days."
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 chips and gave 5 to Kyle. That means he has 19 chips left (24 - 5 = 19). Then, Billy took 2 more from Griffin, so now Griffin has 19 - 2 = 17 chips left. Finally, Ginger took 3 chips from Griffin, leaving him with 17 - 3 = 14 chips. So, if Griffin had 27 chips, Ginger would have taken 3 + 2 = 5 chips from him.
Response:  We know that there are 4 small fish in each of the two large fish (tangisamaki). So, if we multiply 4 by 2, we get 8. Therefore, there are 8 small fish in total. However, we also know that there are 32 small fish in all the tangisamaki combined. So, if we divide 32 by 8, we get 4. This means that there are 4 small fish in each of the tangisamaki.
"Response:  We know that Jean has to pay $250 per month for 6 months, which is equal to $250 x 6 = $1,500. Since she will be working for only 4 weeks out of the 6 months, we need to calculate how much she will earn during those 4 weeks. To do this, we divide the total amount she needs to pay ($1,500) by the number of weeks she will work (4), which gives us:  
$1,500 / 4 = $375 per week. Now, since Jean works for only 4 weeks, her total earnings for those weeks are:  
$375 x 4 = $1,500. So, after working for 4 weeks, Jean will have earned $1,500 and paid $1,500 towards the loan. Therefore, the remaining balance left on the loan after 4 weeks would be:  
$1,500 - $1,500 = $0. In other words, Jean will have fully repaid the loan of $250 per month within 4 weeks, leaving no remaining balance."
Response:  We know that Isabella has $12 for her monthly allowance and she spends $43 on school fees. That means she has $71 left ($12 - $43 = $71). She also spends $15 on transportation, leaving her with $56 ($71 - $15 = $56). Additionally, she spends $4 on lunch, leaving her with $52 ($56 - $4 = $52). Finally, she saves $22 in her piggy bank, so she ends up with $74 ($52 + $22 = $74).
"Response:  We know that each chicken costs $1.50 and there are 4 chickens in total. So we can calculate the cost of all the chickens as follows:  
$1.50 x 4 = $6.00
Therefore, the farmer needs to pay $6.00 for all four chickens."
"Response:  We know that Jumanne has eaten 4 more than Sue and each biscuit contains 200 calories. So if Sue has eaten x biscuits, then Jumanne has eaten x + 4 biscuits. Since both have eaten for 5 days, we can set up the equation as follows:  
x + (x+4) = 5 \* 200  
2x + 4 = 1000  
2x = 960  
x = 480  
So Sue has eaten 480 biscuits and Jumanne has eaten 480 + 4 = 484 biscuits. Therefore, Jumanne has consumed 484 * 200 = 96800 calories more than Sue."
