Explanation:
The first table has 2 rows and 4 columns, with each row containing 10 blocks of size 4x4. Therefore, there are in total 80 blocks (2 rows x 4 columns). The second table has 4 rows and 4 columns, with each row containing 10 blocks of size 4x4. Therefore, there are in total 160 blocks (4 rows x 4 columns). If Sasha buys all the tables, he will have to pay $16 for the second table, which is more than the price of the first table ($10). So, the final cost of both tables together is $320."

"Response: 375 (calculation below)

Step-by-step calculation:

1. First, we need to calculate the cost of one melon:
Melon cost = $6 x 4 = $24
2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of one pawpaw:
Pawpaw cost = $8 x 20 = $160
3. Then, we need to calculate the cost of one zoranj:
Zoranj cost = $10 x 5 = $50
4. Finally, we add up all these costs to get the total price:
Total cost = Melon cost + Pawpaw cost + Zoranj cost = $24 + $160 + $50 = $375
Therefore, the total price for 4 melons, 20 pawpaws, and 10 zoranjs is $375."

Response: 160 eskales of aquarium water would be needed to fill an aquarium with a volume of 32 eskales. If you want to know how many liters of water are in one eskale of aquarium water, you can use the conversion factor that 1 eskale = 50 liters (or vice versa). So if you have 160 eskales of aquarium water and you want to convert it to liters, you can multiply it by 50 to get 8,000 liters (160 x 50 = 8,000).
