Response:  We have to cover 60 meters in one week. If we divide this distance by the number of days in a week (7), we get an average speed of approximately 8.57 meters per day. So, yes, it is possible for someone to run 60 meters in one week if they can maintain an average speed of at least 8.57 meters per day.
Response:  We have to count how many seeds are in each of the 15 cups of corn and then add them up. Each cup has approximately 30-40 seeds, so we will assume an average of 35 seeds per cup. Therefore, there are 15 x 35 = 525 seeds in total. Now, let's calculate the number of seeds for the 25 bunches of corn. Each bunch contains approximately 10-12 ears of corn, and each ear has approximately 8-10 seeds. So, there are 25 x 10 = 250 ears of corn, and each ear has approximately 8-10 seeds, resulting in a total of 250 x 8 = 2000 seeds. Finally, let's subtract the number of seeds from the previous calculation (525) from the total number of seeds (2000), which gives us 1475 seeds left over after counting all the seeds.

Response:  We have to find out how many days are between Toulouse and Seattle. According to Google Maps, it takes approximately 13 hours and 57 minutes to fly from Toulouse to Seattle. Therefore, we can say that there are 13 hours and 57 minutes between Toulouse and Seattle. Now, let's calculate how many days are between these two cities. There are 86,400 seconds in a day, so we can divide the total time (13 hours and 57 minutes) by this number to get the number of days: 13 hours and 57 minutes / 86,400 seconds = 0.16 days. So, there are approximately 0.16 days between Toulouse and Seattle.
Response:  The user has a computer with 200 GB of storage space and uses it for 2 hours per day (1440 minutes). If we assume that the average file size is around 5 MB (which is a reasonable estimate), then the total amount of data stored on the computer would be approximately 720 MB per day (200 GB x 0.0006 = 1.2 GB per hour / 60 = 720 MB per day). Therefore, in one week (7 days) the total amount of data stored on the computer would be approximately 5 TB (720 MB per day x 7 days = 5 TB). So, to answer your question, no, there isn't enough time in a week to store all the videos recorded by the security cameras.
Response:  The first car travelled at a speed of 60 km/h for 3 hours, which means it covered a distance of 180 km (60 x 3). Then, the second car travelled at a speed of 40 km/h for 2 hours, covering a distance of 80 km (40 x 2). Finally, the third car travelled at a speed of 50 km/h for 1 hour, covering a distance of 50 km. So, in total, they covered a distance of 180 + 80 + 50 = 310 km. Therefore, the answer is yes, they did cover the same distance together.
Response:  We know that Eliza has worked for 40 hours at $10 per hour, which means she has earned $400. Now, we need to calculate how much money she would have earned if she had worked for 45 hours instead of 40 hours. So, we multiply $400 by 1.2 (which is the number of additional hours she worked), and we get $480. Therefore, Eliza would have earned $480 if she had worked for 45 hours instead of 40 hours.
Response:  The program has 60 participants and each participant will receive $150 for their participation. Therefore, the total amount of money that will be distributed is $9,000 ($150 x 60).

"Response:  We have to calculate how much money Jill will pay for each hour of cheerleading practice and then find out if she can afford it. 
* Jill pays $20 per session (hora) of cheerleading practice.
* She has to attend 50 sessions (semanas).
* Each session lasts 35 hours (horas).
* Therefore, Jill has to pay $1,100 ($20 x 50 sessions) for all the sessions.
* Now, let's check if Jill can afford it. If she makes $35 per hour as a cheerleading coach, she will work for 420 hours in total (35 hours/week x 13 weeks). So, after working for 420 hours, Jill will earn $14,600 ($35/hour x 420 hours). This is more than what she needs to pay for the cheerleading practices, so yes, Jill can afford it!"

Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  We know that Marissa travelled for 12 miles in 4 kilometers and then walked for another 2 kilometers. Therefore, her total distance traveled is 12 + 2 = 14 miles. Now, we need to calculate how many hours she took to cover this distance at a speed of 4 kilometers per hour. To do this, we divide the total distance traveled by her walking speed: 14 miles / 4 km/h = 3.5 hours. So, Marissa took approximately 3.5 hours to cover the distance of 14 miles.
"Response:  We have to find out if there are 24 liters of juice in total and then check if it matches with what we have available. So let's break down each quantity given in the question:

* 10 litros of naranja (orange) juice
	+ 10 litros x 3 = 30 liters (since there are 3 units of orange juice)
* 15 litros of piña (pineapple) juice
	+ 15 litros x 2 = 30 liters (since there are 2 units of pineapple juice)
* 1 liter of orange juice (chaymanta)
	+ 1 liter x 1 = 1 liter (since there is only one unit of orange juice)

Now let's add up all these quantities:

30 + 30 + 1 = 61 liters

So, unfortunately, no, there are not 24 liters of juice available. There are actually 61 liters of juice in total."

Response:  The question asks about how many clients have been served at the store since Monday. To find out, we need to know how many days have passed since Monday. There are currently 3 days left until Friday (Thursday). So, if 3 days have passed since Monday, and each day has approximately 24 hours, then the total number of hours that have passed since Monday can be calculated as follows: 3 days x 24 hours/day = 72 hours. Now, let's convert this time into minutes: 72 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 4320 minutes. Finally, let's divide the total number of minutes by the number of minutes in an hour to get the approximate number of customers served at the store: 4320 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 720 customers. Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, it is estimated that approximately 720 customers have been served at the store since Monday.
"Response:  We have to find out how many centimeters are in one hour and then multiply it with five hours to get the total number of centimeters that will be covered during those five hours. So, we need to calculate:

Chay k'anchayqa (centimeters per hour) = Sapa hora ruphaykuspa (hourly rate of growth) / Q'uñikun (number of hours)
= 2 centímetros (given) / 1 p'unchaymanta (one hour)
= 0.02 centímetros/hour

Now, let's multiply this value by five hours to get the total number of centimeters covered during those five hours:

Total number of centimeters = Chay k'anchayqa x P'unchaykama (number of hours)
= 0.02 centímetros/hour x 5 p'unchaykama (five hours)
= 0.1 centímetros

So, there will be approximately 0.1 centimeters of growth during each of the five hours mentioned in the question."
Response:  The book costs $19.50 and there is a 25% discount. So, we need to calculate 25% of $19.50. This gives us $4.875 (25% x $19.50). Now, subtract this amount from the original price to find out how much the book would cost after the discount: $19.50 - $4.875 = $14.625. Therefore, the value of the book after the discount is $14.625.

"Response:  We have to find out how many kilometers are between two points and then calculate if there are more than 60 kilometers between them.
Firstly, we know that the distance from point A (0 km) to point B (20 km) is 20 kilometers. Then, we need to find the distance from point B to point C (40 km). To do this, we subtract the distance from point B to point A (20 km):
Distance from B to C = 40 km - 20 km = 20 km
Now, let's check if the total distance between point A and point C is greater than 60 kilometers:
Total distance = Distance from A to B + Distance from B to C = 0 km + 20 km + 20 km = 40 km < 60 km
Therefore, yes, there are less than 60 kilometers between these three points."
Response:  The price of one pair of shoes is $5, and there are three pairs of shoes in total. Therefore, the total cost of all three pairs of shoes is $15 (3 x $5). Now, let's calculate how much each pair of shoes costs: $15 / 3 = $5 per pair. So, each pair of shoes costs $5.
"Response:  The question is asking for the number of days that have passed since Darrell Wanapitei started working at KASQANPIM. We are given two pieces of information to help us solve this problem:

* Darrell Wanapitei started working at KASQANPIM 7 months ago (nisqanpim).
* It has been 162 days since he started working there (watasninmanjina).

Now we need to find out how many days have passed between the start of his work and today. To do this, we subtract the number of days that have passed since he started working from the total number of days he has worked:

Days passed = Total days worked - Days passed since starting work
= 162 days - 7 months x 30 days/month
= 162 days - 210 days
= -48 days

So, Darrell Wanapitei started working at KASQANPIM 48 days ago."
"Response:  We have to calculate the total amount of money that Gunter has after selling his 80 shares of stock. If each share costs $100 and he sold them at a price of $80 per share, then the total amount of money he gained from selling those shares is:

$80 x 80 = $6,400

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the shares from the profit to get the net profit:

$6,400 - $4,000 = $2,400

So, Gunter made a profit of $2,400."
Response:  We have to find out how many hours are in one week. One week has 7 days, and each day has 24 hours. So, there are 7 x 24 = 168 hours in one week. Therefore, if we want to know how many hours are in 5 weeks, we multiply 168 by 5: 168 x 5 = 840 hours.

So, there are 9 points between them."
Response:  We know that Terry has 20 pieces of yogurt and each piece costs $5. So, Terry spent $100 on yogurt (20 pieces x $5 per piece). Now, we are asked if he can afford to buy 30 more pieces of yogurt with his remaining money. To find out, let's divide the amount of money left after buying the first 20 pieces ($100) by the cost of one piece of yogurt ($5): $\$100 / \$5 = 20$. Therefore, Terry can afford to buy 30 more pieces of yogurt with his remaining money.

* John bought 13 Lego sets at $15 each = $195
* He also bought 8 video games for $20 = $160
* Total amount of money spent by John = $195 + $160 = $355

So, there are no leftover Lego toys after buying the video games because the total amount of money spent was $355, which is greater than the cost of the video games ($160)."
Response:  The distance traveled in one hour is given as 60 kilometers. If he runs for 3 hours, then the total distance traveled will be 60 x 3 = 180 kilometers. So, there are 180 kilometers of running tracks that can be replicated.
Response:  The first part of the question asks for the distance traveled in 3 hours at a speed of 1 kilometer per hour. So, we have: Distance = Speed x Time = 1 km/h x 3 h = 3 kilometers. Now, the second part of the question asks how many kilometers are traveled in 6 hours if the speed remains constant at 1 kilometer per hour. We can use the formula again: Distance = Speed x Time = 1 km/h x 6 h = 6 kilometers. Finally, the last part of the question asks about the distance traveled in 3 kilometers per hour. To find this, we simply divide the distance by the speed: Distance = Speed / Time = 3 km/h / 3 h = 1 kilometer. Therefore, the answer to all three parts of the question is: Distance = 3 kilometers + 6 kilometers + 1 kilometer = 10 kilometers.
Response:  We have two numbers in the question: 1 and 50. If we multiply them together, we get 50 x 1 = 50. So, the answer to the question is 50.

"Response:  We have to find out how much money Marcy will get after 30 years of saving $50,000 with an interest rate of 5%.
Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount that Marcy will save in 30 years with an interest rate of 5%.
To do this, we can use the formula for calculating future value of an investment: FV = PV x (1 + r)^n
Where:
FV = Future Value
PV = Present Value (the initial deposit)
r = Interest Rate per year
n = Number of years
In this case, the present value is $50,000 and the number of years is 30. So, we can plug these values into the formula:
FV = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^30
FV = $786,975.60
Now, we know that Marcy will receive a 5% annual pension, which means she will get $39,348.50 each year. To find out how much money Marcy will have saved after 30 years, we need to subtract the annual pension from the total amount she will save:
$786,975.60 - $39,348.50 = $747,627.10
So, after 30 years, Marcy will have saved approximately $747,627.10 if she saves $50,000 at an interest rate of 5% per year."
Response:  The original price of the product is $140 and there is a discount of 10%. So, we need to calculate what percentage of the original price represents the discounted price. To do this, we divide the discounted price by the original price and multiply it by 100: Discounted Price = (Original Price x Discount Percentage) / 100 Discount Percentage = 10% Original Price = $140 Now, let's substitute these values in the formula above: Discounted Price = ($140 x 10%) / 100 Discounted Price = $136 So, the discounted price of the product is $136.
"Response:  We know that Sophia has driven for 100 kilometers and her fuel tank can hold up to 4 gallons (or 12 liters) of gasoline. So, we need to calculate how many kilometers she can drive with one liter of gasoline. To do this, we divide the volume of gasoline in liters by the distance traveled in kilometers:

12 L / 100 km = 0.12 L/km

So, if Sophia fills up her tank with 12 liters of gasoline, she will be able to drive approximately 100 kilometers. Therefore, the answer is 100 kilometers."
Response:  The question asks how many weeks of TV programming are needed to watch all the shows that will be broadcast in one year. To calculate this, we need to know how many weeks there are in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year (Monday through Sunday). Now, let's assume that each show has 60 minutes of content (including commercials and breaks), which means that in one week, you can watch up to 10 hours of TV (assuming 8 hours of prime-time programming + 2 hours of late-night programming). So, if you want to watch all the shows that will be broadcast in one year, you would need to watch approximately 52 x 10 = 520 hours of TV per year.

However, based on the information provided, it seems that the total number of precious stones in Chaypi's collection is 175 + 35 = 210. Therefore, the answer to the question ""Hayk'a t'ika t'ikachus chay arca ukhupi karqa?"" is yes, there are 210 precious stones in Chaypi's collection."
"Response:  The number of students in class 60 is given as ""sipaskuna"". If there are 5 teachers, then the total number of people in the school (students + teachers) is ""ima"" times 5 = 300. Therefore, the answer to the question is 300."
Response:  We know that Bailey has worked for 8 weeks and earned $40 per week, which is equal to $320. Therefore, if we subtract $320 from $500, we get $180. So, Bailey has earned $180 in total during those 8 weeks.
"Response:  We know that in one week there are 7 days (Saturday included), so we have:

Judyqa sapa p'unchay 5 horasta t'ikan = 5 x 24 = 120 hours
Semana 8 horastataq sábado p'unchaypi yachachin = 8 x 24 = 192 hours
Total hours in one week = 120 + 192 = 312 hours
Now, let's calculate how many hours per day:
Hours per day = Total hours in one week / Number of days in a week
= 312 hours / 7 days
= 46 hours/day
So, during one week, Judy has worked 46 hours per day."

"Response:  We have to calculate how much money Sheila has after 3 years with an annual interest rate of 2%.
First year: Sheila has $150 and earns $3 interest, so she has $153 at the end of the first year.
Second year: Sheila still has $153 and earns $6.50 interest (2% of $153), so she now has $169.50.
Third year: Sheila still has $169.50 and earns $8.75 interest (2% of $169.50), so she now has $178.25.
Therefore, if Sheila invests her $150 for 3 years with an annual interest rate of 2%, she will have $178.25 at the end of those 3 years."
Response:  The cost of one plant is $2.74, so if we buy 12 plants of calendula, it will be $30.88 (12 x $2.74). If we buy 9 plants of petunia, it will be $15.63 (9 x $1.87). And if we buy 17 plants of begonia, it will be $34.34 (17 x $2.12). So, in total, Artieqa will gain $70.85 ($30.88 + $15.63 + $34.34) from selling these plants at the farmers market.

Response:  We have 3 red flowers (Danqa) and each flower has 4 petals (Sach'akuna). Therefore, we have a total of 12 petals (Sach'aqa). Now, let's count how many yellow flowers there are. There are 25 yellow flowers (Rosasniyoj), so we multiply that number by 4 to get the total number of petals for all the yellow flowers, which is 100 petals (Sapa Rosaka). Finally, we subtract the number of red flowers from the total number of petals to find out if there are any remaining petals, which is 87 petals left over (Ch'ampayuqmi). So, yes, there are 87 remaining petals after counting all the flowers.
Response:  There are 22 players in each team, and we have to choose 8 of them to score goals. So, the probability of any player scoring a goal is 1/3 (or 0.33). Therefore, the probability that a particular player scores a goal is Machkha = 0.33^8 = 0.0067 or approximately 0.67%.

So, Christina would need $37.50 to buy all those regals of chicken."
Response:  The first part of the question asks how many pounds (libras) of potatoes Ted T-Rex has eaten in total. We know that each libra weighs approximately 3.4 kg or 7.5 lbs. So if Ted has eaten 10 libras of potatoes, he has eaten approximately 34 kg or 75 lbs of potatoes in total. Now let's move to the second part of the question. It asks us to calculate how many runs Ted made while eating those potatoes. Based on the information provided earlier, we know that Ted can eat one run per minute and that there are 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, if Ted ate 5 hours worth of potatoes (which is equivalent to 5 x 60 = 300 minutes), then he would have made 300 / 60 = 5 runs while eating those potatoes. So the final answer is 34 kg + 5 runs = 39 kg.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times ""maskhata"" appears in the text and then divide it by the total number of words. So, we count the number of appearances of ""maskhata"":

Jackson does not have any apples (hayk'a watayoqtaq).
Therefore, the answer is 7 apples."
Response:  We know that Gerald has traveled for 38 seconds and covered 400 meters. To calculate how many steps he took during this time, we can use the formula: Number of steps = Distance / Step length. In this case, the distance is 400 meters, and the step length is 0.25 meters (since each second is divided into 100 sub-steps). So, number of steps = 400 / 0.25 = 1600 steps. Therefore, Gerald took approximately 1600 steps in 38 seconds.
"Response:  The first part of the question ""Chaypi"" means ""How many"", so we have to count something. In this case, it seems that the speaker is asking how many times the word ""pisi"" appears in the text. Therefore, the answer is:

"Response:  We have:
Fredaqa = 16 onzas (470 grams) of tomatoes
Tomatosta ch'uyanchayta = 32 onzas (958 grams) of tomato sauce
Ch'uyanchayta ima = 0 onzas (0 grams) of tomato sauce
Ch'uspichachin = 0 onzas (0 grams) of mayonnaise
So, we can calculate the total weight of all ingredients as follows:
Total weight = Fredaqa + Tomatosta ch'uyanchayta + Ch'uyanchayta ima + Ch'uspichachin
= 16 + 32 + 0 + 0
= 48 onzas (1368 grams)
Therefore, there is no mixture of tomato sauce and mayonnaise in Fredaqa."
Response:  We have to find out how many cars can pass through the road in one hour and a half. To do this, we need to know how long it takes for each car to go through the road. According to the question, if there are 20 cars going through the road at the same time, it will take them 15 minutes to get through. So, if we divide 90 (the total number of minutes) by 20 (the number of cars), we get 4.5 minutes per car. Therefore, 30 cars can pass through the road in one hour and a half.

Response:  The cost of 10 gallons of gasoline is $30 (3 dollars per gallon). If we buy it at this station and use the card that gives us a 5% discount, we will save $1.50 ($30 x 5%). So, the final price would be $28.50 ($30 - $1.50).
Response:  We have to find out how many fruits are in total and then divide them equally among the three people. So, we can start with the number of fruits that Beatrice has (24). Then, we subtract the number of fruits that she gave away (14), which means she has 10 fruits left. Now, let's divide these 10 fruits equally among the three people: Marcellus, Beatrice, and the other person. Therefore, each person will get 3 fruits.
"Response:  We have to find out how many seconds are in one minute and then multiply it with the number of minutes given in the problem. So, we can calculate as follows:

One minute = 60 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute)

So, if we have 20 minutes, we have:

20 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 1200 seconds

Now, we need to convert the time from seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in 1 hour, so:

1200 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 0.3333333333333334 hours

Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.3333333333333334 hours."

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Johnqa will make from selling flip-flops. Since there are 2 pairs of flip-flops, and each pair costs $15, Johnqa will make $30 from selling flip-flops.
So, in total, Johnqa will make $180 + $30 = $210."
Response:  We have two containers of imported vehicles with each containing 5 vehicles. In total, we have 10 vehicles (2 containers x 5 vehicles per container). If we calculate the cost of importing these vehicles, it will be $30 per vehicle ($10 for each of the 30 carriers that transported them from Japan to our port). Therefore, the total cost of importing these vehicles would be $300 (10 vehicles x $30 per vehicle).
Response:  We know that Adrienpa and Lylahpa have 30% of the shares in Aswan Askha Qolqeta Jap'ishan, which means they own 30/100 = 0.3 x 100 = 30% of the company. Therefore, their share of the profits is also 30%. Now, we are told that the profit per year is $40,000, so the total profit for Adrienpa and Lylahpa is $40,000 x 0.3 = $12,000 each. So, Adrienpa has earned $12,000 from his 40% stake in the company.
Response:  The number of papers used to make one week's worth of drawings is 30 (papelkuna). Since each drawing takes up one sheet of paper, we can calculate the total number of sheets needed for one week as follows: 30 / 1 = 30 sheets per week. Therefore, there are 30 sheets of paper used to create one week's worth of drawings.

Therefore, the answer is 8 hours."
Response:  We know that Rosieqa ran for 10 kilometers in 3 hours and then rested for 2 hours. After that, she ran again for 8 kilometers in 1 hour. Now we need to find out how many kilometers she ran during the last 7 hours of her journey. So, we can calculate it as follows: Total distance = Total time x Speed (km/h) Total distance = 7 hours x 7 km/h = 49 km Therefore, there are 49 kilometers left to run after 7 hours of running.
Response:  We have to calculate how many cartwheels Jennie can do in one minute if she has 60 cartwheel techniques and each technique takes her 15 seconds (chay cartakunataj). Therefore, we multiply 60 by 15 = 900 seconds. Now, we divide this number by the time it takes for Jennie to perform one cartwheel (chaymantaqa) which is 30 seconds. So, Jennie can perform 900 / 30 = 30 cartwheels per minute.
"Response:  The question is asking about how many times Julia has said ""I don't know"" in response to different questions asked of her. To calculate this, we need to count the number of times she says ""I don't know"" for each of the 12 questions listed. So, let's do that:

Question 1: Julia said ""I don't know"" once.
Question 2: She said ""I don't know"" twice.
Question 3: She said ""I don't know"" three times.

Response:  The patient was in the emergency room for 24 minutes and there are 500 patients per day. So, we can calculate the total time spent at the hospital as follows: Total time = Number of patients x Time per patient Total time = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes Now, let's convert this value to hours: Hours = Minutes / 60 Hours = 12,000 / 60 = 200 hours Therefore, the patient spent 200 hours at the hospital.
"Response:  We have to find out how many elves are in total and then divide them into groups of 10. So, we can start with the first part of the question: ""Nissaqa 60 llank'aqkunata qhatun"". This means there are 60 elves in total. Now let's move on to the second part of the question: ""Santapa llaqtanpi, mallkipi, elfo-kunajina kanankupaq."" This means that among these 60 elves, some are skilled in magic (llanq'aq), some are strong warriors (llaqta), and some are wise leaders (malki). Finally, the last part of the question asks if there are any more elves who are not included in these three categories. Therefore, the answer is yes, there are additional 40 elves who do not fit into these three categories, so the total number of elves is 60 + 40 = 100."
Response:  If José has $500 to spend and he wants to buy something that costs $60, then he will have $440 left over ($500 - $60 = $440).
"Response:  The total number of passengers in the bus is 40 (Pamwan + Fredwan). Since there are 6 seats per row and 12 rows in total, we have:
Number of seats = 6 x 12 = 72
So, the number of passengers that can fit in the bus comfortably is:
Number of passengers = Total number of seats - Number of passengers already seated
= 72 - (Pamwan + Fredwan)
= 72 - 38
= 34
Therefore, there are 34 passengers that can fit in the bus comfortably."
Response:  On Monday (Lunes), there are 4 miles (purirqa) and Tuesday (Martes) is also Monday (Lunes). So, we have 2 times 4 = 8 miles (purirqa). Then, we add 8 + 4 = 12 miles (purirqa). Therefore, the answer is yes, there are 12 miles (purirqa) between Monday and Wednesday (Miércoles).
Response:  We have to calculate how much money Tom has after he pays for his dinner. The cost of the dinner is $15 dollars and Tom has $20 in cash. So, we can say that Tom has $5 left over after paying for his dinner. Therefore, the answer is $5.

"Response:  We have to find out if there are any Scottish unicorns that can make babies with Peruvian unicorns. To do this, we need to know how many Scottish unicorns and Peruvian unicorns exist in total. Then, we will divide them into groups based on their ability to mate. If they can produce offspring, then yes, there are warm-blooded unicorns of Scottish descent in Peru. Otherwise, no. So let's calculate!
Scottish unicorns: 10 + 5 = 15
Peruvian unicorns: 3 + 4 = 7
Total number of unicorns: 15 + 7 = 22
Now, let's group them according to their mating potential:
Mateable unicorns (Scottish x Peruvian): 15 - 7 = 8
Non-mateable unicorns (Scottish or Peruvian alone): 15 + 7 = 22
So, there are 8 unicorns that can potentially produce offspring between Scottish and Peruvian unicorns. Therefore, the answer is Yes, there are warm-blooded unicorns of Scottish descent in Peru."
Response:  The total cost of all items is $7.5 + $1.5 + $1 = $9.5. Since there are 20% discount, we need to subtract 20/100 x $9.5 = $7.8 from the total cost, so the final price would be $7.8. Therefore, the answer is $7.8.
Response:  The first part of the question asks for the result of multiplying 75 and 3, which gives us 225. Then we are asked to subtract 5 from that number, which leaves us with 220. Finally, we are told to multiply 100 by 4, which results in 400. Therefore, the correct answer is 220.

Response:  The cost of each game in dollars is $10. If there are 10 games, then the total cost would be $10 x 10 = $100. So, the answer is $100.
Response:  The total cost of the items is: Leche = $2, Huevos = $3, Bombillas = $3, Copas = $3, Tarqokuna = $4. Total cost = $15. If there is an 10% tax, the amount to pay is: Tax = $15 x 10% = $1.50. So, the final amount to pay is: Final Amount = $15 + $1.50 = $16.50.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Kimqa has earned from his three clients so far: $3 \times 10 = $30. Then, he has to pay $2 for each potential customer he talks to, which means he will pay a total of $2 \times 5 = $10. Finally, he has to pay $5 for the bottle of soda he bought, which brings the total cost to $82. So, the answer is $82.
"Response:  We have:

* 10 hectares of pineapples (Johnqa) = 100,000 square meters (since there are 10 hectares and each hectare is 10,000 square meters).
* 100 ananas (Juanqa) = 10,000 units (since there are 100 ananas and each anana is equal to 1 unit).
* 3 kilos of ananas (cosecha) = 30,000 grams (since there are 3 kilos and each kilo is equal to 1,000 grams).

Now we need to find out if Juanqa has enough ananas to fill 100 baskets. To do this, we divide the total number of ananas he has (10,000 units) by the number of baskets he wants to fill (100 baskets):

10,000 units / 100 baskets = 100 units per basket

So, yes, Juanqa has enough ananas to fill 100 baskets."
Response:  The number of blocks that Johnny has is 500. If he wants to build something with Lego, he will need at least 3 blocks for each row (since there are three rows in total). Therefore, the minimum number of blocks he needs is 1500 (500 x 3 = 1500). However, since he also mentioned that he wants to make it bigger, let's assume he needs more than 1500 blocks. For example, if we double the number of rows, then he would need 2 x 3 = 6 blocks per row, which means he needs a total of 1200 blocks (500 x 2 = 1000 + 200). So, the answer is between 1200 and 1500 blocks.
Response:  We have to count how many bees are in the hive during 6 hours of work and then calculate how much honey they produce. So, we will start counting from 8 am when the bees start working until 2 pm when they take their break for lunch. During this time, there are 15 bees working (Debraqa). Then, we will calculate that each bee produces approximately 4 grams of honey per day (jamun), so the total amount of honey produced would be: 15 bees x 4 grams/bee = 60 grams of honey per hour. Since they work for 6 hours, the total amount of honey produced would be: 60 grams/hour x 6 hours = 360 grams of honey. Therefore, the answer is 360 grams of honey.
Response:  We have $12 for Brittany and $10 for Rinku. So, if we subtract $10 from $12, we get $2. Now, let's divide $2 by 4 (the number of people) to find out how much each person will get. Therefore, each person will get $\$5$.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and he wants to find out how many of them are also friends with James. So, we need to count the number of friends that Charlie shares with James. To do this, we can use the following formula: Number of shared friends = Total number of friends - Number of friends who are not also friends with James. In this case, Total number of friends = 12 (Charlie's total number of friends) and Number of friends who are not also friends with James = 0 (since James is one of Charlie's friends). Therefore, Number of shared friends = 12 - 0 = 12. So, there are 12 friends that Charlie shares with James on Facebook.
Response:  We know that Stevewan has traveled 3 miles (450 meters) in 1 minute and 44 seconds. Therefore, he has covered an area of 450 x 60 = 27,000 square meters during this time. Now, we need to calculate how much distance Stevewan has covered in kilometers. There are 1000 meters in 1 kilometer, so we can convert the distance traveled by Stevewan from meters to kilometers as follows: Distance = Total distance / 1000 = 27,000 / 1000 = 27 kilometers. Finally, we need to determine who won the race between Stevewan and Patinata. Based on the information provided earlier, Patinata ran for 264 meters in 1 minute and 26 seconds, which means she covered an area of 264 x 60 = 15,840 square meters during this time. Since Stevewan traveled a greater distance than Patinata, he is the winner of the race.
Response:  The cost of one wheel is 25 cents, and there are five wheels in total (including the front and back ones). So, the total cost of all the wheels is 5 x 25 = 125 cents. Now, let's calculate the cost of each wheel again, taking into account that there are three wheels for the tricycle (front, middle, and back): 3 x 25 = 75 cents per wheel. Therefore, the answer to the question is 125 cents + 75 cents = 200 cents.
Response:  We know that one cookie costs $0.10 and we want to find out how many cookies Carl can buy with $10. So, we divide $10 by $0.10: $10 / $0.10 = 100 cookies. Therefore, Carl can buy 100 cookies with $10.
"Response:  The question asks if there are any fried potatoes left in the package after 5 people have eaten from it. So, we need to calculate how many fries each person would get if there were only 5 fries remaining in the package.
Let's assume that each person gets an equal number of fries (since they all ate together). Therefore, the number of fries each person got = Total number of fries / Number of people who ate from the package.
So, the total number of fries in the package initially was Paqueteta makisninmanta suwarpara (which means ""package of 10 fries""). Since 5 people ate from the package, the number of fries left after they ate = Total number of fries - Number of fries each person got x Number of people who ate from the package.
Now, let's calculate how many fries each person got:
Number of fries each person got = Total number of fries / Number of people who ate from the package = 10 fries / 5 people = 2 fries per person.
Since there were 5 people who ate from the package, the number of fries left after they ate = Total number of fries - Number of fries each person got x Number of people who ate from the package = 10 fries - (2 fries/person) x 5 people = 5 fries left in the package.
Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, there are still 5 fries left in the package."
"Response:  We know that Kimoqa has classes from Monday to Friday, and we also know that there are 16 weeks in a semester. So, if Kimoqa has classes every day of the week except for Sunday (which means they have no class on Sundays), then we can calculate the number of classes per week as follows:
Monday - 4 classes
Tuesday - 3 classes
Wednesday - 3 classes
Thursday - 2 classes
Friday - 2 classes
Total number of classes per week = 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 14 classes per week
Now, let's calculate the total number of classes in a semester: Total number of classes per semester = 14 classes/week x 16 weeks = 224 classes per semester
So, yes, Kimoqa does have classes every day of the week, including Saturday and Sunday."
"Response:  We have to calculate how many pieces of bread are in total and then divide them into different types based on their size. So, we can start with the total number of pieces of bread:

300 + 120 = 420 pieces of bread.
Now, let's find out how many small pieces of bread (less than 10 cm) there are:

420 x 0.6 = 258 small pieces of bread.
And now, let's find out how many medium-sized pieces of bread (between 10 and 60 cm):

420 x 0.3 = 126 medium-sized pieces of bread.
Finally, let's find out how many large pieces of bread (over 60 cm):

420 x 0.1 = 42 large pieces of bread.
So, the final answer is:

Small pieces of bread: 258
Medium-sized pieces of bread: 126
Large pieces of bread: 42"
"Response:  We need to calculate how many bunches of bananas each animal needs and then add them up to find out if there are enough bananas for all three animals together.

For the monkey, it needs 200 bananas per day, so we need 200 / 3 = 67 bunches of bananas per day. Since there are 5 days in a week, we need 67 x 5 = 335 bunches of bananas per week for the monkey.

For the sloth, it needs 400 bananas per day, so we need 400 / 3 = 133 bunches of bananas per day. Again, since there are 5 days in a week, we need 133 x 5 = 665 bunches of bananas per week for the sloth.

For the capuchin, it needs 100 bananas per day, so we need 100 / 3 = 33 bunches of bananas per day. Like before, we multiply this number by 5 to get the total amount of bananas needed per week: 33 x 5 = 165 bunches of bananas per week for the capuchin.

Now let's add up all these numbers to see if there are enough bananas for all three animals together: 335 + 665 + 165 = 1865 bunches of bananas per week. So yes, there are enough bananas for all three animals together!"
Response:  We know that Blake has covered 15 minutes and ran 100 meters. To calculate how far he has gone in total, we need to convert the time into meters per minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 15 minutes is equal to 900 seconds (15 x 60 = 900). Now, we divide the distance traveled by the time taken: 900 / 15 = 60 meters per minute. Therefore, Blake has covered a distance of 60 meters in 15 minutes.
Response:  The total cost of the books is $4 + $2 = $6. The total cost of the pencil is $20 - $4 = $16. So, the total amount that Rafael needs to pay is $6 + $16 = $22. Therefore, yes, Rafael does have enough money to buy all these things.
Response:  The question asks if there are any 11 people who have been able to climb all the way up to the top of Mount Everest (Finn q'a). We know that only a few people in history have successfully reached the summit of this mountain, and it requires a lot of skill, experience, and physical endurance to do so. Therefore, we can assume that the probability of finding 11 people who have accomplished this feat is very low. In fact, I would say it is almost impossible. So, the answer to the question is no, there are unlikely to be 11 people who have climbed to the top of Mount Everest.
Response:  The tank capacity is 5 meters cubed and it takes 7 meters to fill it up completely. If we divide this amount in three equal parts, each part will be 2.33 meters cubed (7/3). Therefore, there will be 1.67 meters cubed left over after filling the tank for the third time (2.33 - 0.67 = 1.67).
"Response:  We have to calculate the sum of all the numbers in each group and then add them up.
Anakinwan Locsinwan = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie paid $35 for the three hours of work she did as a cleaner (Jackiepa yapuyta chakruna 35 dollarsta). Then, we have to subtract the amount that Jackie earned from her work ($35) from the total amount that the company owes her ($90): $90 - $35 = $55. So, the amount that Jackie is left with after deducting what she earned from her work is $55.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of all the items that Elvira wants to buy: Computers (1090 €), monitor (286 €), keyboard (102 €), mouse (74 €), scanner (157 €), and printer (102 €). The total cost is: 1090 + 286 + 102 + 74 + 157 = 1610 €. Now, let's check if there are any discounts or promotions available for these products. If there were any, we could subtract them from the total cost to get the final price. However, since there are no discounts mentioned in the question, the final price would be the same as the total cost: 1610 €. Therefore, the answer is Yes, there is a possibility that the final price might be higher than the initial estimate of 1500 €.
"Response:  We have to calculate how many days are between each date and the current day (December 20th).
Sandraqa was born in 1987, so her age is 34 years old as of December 2021.
Qosanwan is 6 years older than Sandraqa, which means Qosanwan is 34 + 6 = 40 years old as of December 2021.
Ch'akiwan is 9 years younger than Qosanwan, which means Ch'akiwan is 40 - 9 = 31 years old as of December 2021.
Sapa Kuti Wawata Qhawananpaq is 15 years old as of December 2021.
Ch'akiwan Churasqa is 3 years older than Sapa Kuti Wawata Qhawananpaq, which means Ch'akiwan Churasqa is 15 + 3 = 18 years old as of December 2021.
Therefore, the answer to the question ""How old are Sandraqa, Qosanwan, 9 ch'akiwan, sapa kuti wawata qhawananpaq, ch'akiwan churasqa?"" is:

Response:  We know that Panchoqa has traveled 32 kilometers and wants to calculate how many kilometers he will have traveled in one week if he travels at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour. To do this, we must divide the distance traveled (32 kilometers) by the time taken to travel it (one hour). Therefore, the number of kilometers traveled in one week is: 32 / 1 = 32 kilometers.
"Response:  The cost of one uniform is $25, and there are three types of uniforms (A, B, C). For each type of uniform, we have to pay an additional $10 for the jacket and $5 for the pants. Therefore, the total cost per uniform would be:

Type A: $25 + ($10 x 3) = $75
Type B: $25 + ($10 x 3) = $85
Type C: $25 + ($5 x 3) = $65
So, the total cost for all 3 uniforms would be: $75 + $85 + $65 = $225."

"Response:  The first part of the question is ""Billyqa, papata q'eturan,"" which means ""How many potatoes does Billy have?"" So we can assume that Billy has some number of potatoes. Then comes the second part of the question, ""chaymantaqa papata salata ruwachinanta wakichin."" This means ""He wants to know how many potatoes he will get if he mixes them with salt and water."" Now let's calculate the total number of potatoes based on the information given in the question. We are told that there are 60 potatoes in total, and each potato is divided into 5 equal parts. Therefore, the total number of potatoes Billy will receive is 60 / 5 = 12. So the answer to the question is 12."
Response:  We have to calculate how much money Juan will get for each lemon he sells and then multiply it with the number of lemons he wants to sell. So, we can start by calculating the cost of one lemon: 3 dollars / 4 cups = $0.75 per cup. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Juan will get from selling all his lemons: 20 cups x $0.75 per cup = $15. So, Juan will get $15 for each lemon he sells. Therefore, if he wants to sell 20 lemons, he will get $300 ($15 x 20).

Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how much money Zaidqa has spent on fuel for his car in one month. According to the question, he spends $1/4 of his salary on fuel, which is equal to $250 per month (since his salary is $2000 per month). Secondly, we need to calculate how much money he has left after paying for fuel. In this case, he has $1350 left ($2000 - $250 = $1350). Thirdly, we need to calculate how much money he can spend on other things such as food and entertainment. Based on the question, he can afford to spend up to $700 per month on these expenses (since his remaining amount after paying for fuel is $1350, and he wants to save at least $200 per month). Finally, we need to calculate how much money he has left after paying for all his expenses. In this case, he has $550 left ($1350 - $700 = $550).
"Response:  The first part of the question is ""Raniqa, Monicmanta chunka mas ch'akiyuqmi,"" which means ""How many Monicmantas have Raniqa caught?""

Response:  We know that Mandyqa has $100 and wants to lend it to Benedictman with an interest rate of 2%. To calculate how much Benedictman will pay back to Mandyqa after one year, we can use the formula: Principal x Rate x Time = Interest. In this case, the principal is $100, the rate is 2%, and the time is 1 year (or 12 months). So, the interest paid by Benedictman to Mandyqa would be: $100 x 2% x 12 = $24. Therefore, Benedictman will pay back $100 + $24 = $124 to Mandyqa after one year.
Response:  The merchant has $20 to buy wheat flour and he buys it at $1 per kilogram. So, if he wants to buy 20 kilograms of wheat flour, he will spend $20.

"Response:  We have to calculate how much money Kim has spent in total and then find out if she has enough money to buy the manchitas. So let's start with calculating the amount of money Kim has spent:

Kim has spent 20 dollars + 25 cents = $20.25
Now we need to add the cost of the manchitas:
$20.25 + $3.00 (cost of 3 manchitas) = $23.25
So Kim does not have enough money to buy the manchitas because she only has $23.25 and the manchitas cost $4.50 each, so she would need $16.75 more to buy all 3 manchitas."

Sapa pʼunchaytaj 6 pachas = 20 x 6 = 120 litros (since there are 6 packs)
Now, let's find out how much water is left after consuming 5 and 6 packs:

Sapa ch'akipi 5 litro yaku kaptinqa = 100 - 50 = 50 litros (since 5 packs were consumed)
Sapa ch'akipi 6 litro yaku kaptinqa = 120 - 60 = 60 litros (since 6 packs were consumed)
Therefore, if 5 and 6 packs of bottled water are consumed, there will be 50 and 60 liters of water left, respectively."
Response:  The prize is $5000 and there is a 5% tax. To calculate how much money John will receive after paying the tax, we can use the formula: Tax = (Prize x Tax Rate).

Therefore, the answer is -10 minutes.
Response:  We have two tanks with different capacities: Tank A has a capacity of 120 liters and Tank B has a capacity of 90 liters. If we pour water from Tank A into Tank B until it is full (which means that Tank B will hold 90 liters), how much water will be left in Tank A afterward? So, the amount of water left in Tank A = Capacity of Tank A - Amount of water poured into Tank B = 120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters. Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in Tank A after filling Tank B to its capacity.

"Response:  We have to find out how many students answered option A, and then calculate the percentage of those who chose it. So we can start by calculating the number of students who chose option A:

Number of students who chose option A = Number of students who answered question 1 (1000) - Number of students who did not choose any of options A, B, or C (400).

So, the number of students who chose option A is:

1000 - 400 = 600

Now, let's calculate the percentage of students who chose option A:

Percentage of students who chose option A = (Number of students who chose option A / Total number of students) x 100

= (600 / 1000) x 100

= 60%

Therefore, 60% of the students chose option A."
"Response:  We have to find out how many days are between two dates. The first date is ""Jamesqa Robertmanta"" which means January 1st according to the Inca calendar and the second date is ""Johnqa Robertmanta"" which means July 29th according to the Gregorian calendar. So we need to subtract these two dates in days.
January 1st - July 29th = 183 days
Therefore, there are 183 days between Jamesqa Robertmanta and Johnqa Robertmanta."
"Response:  The first part of the question ""Dollyqa iskay"" means ""Dolly has book"". So we have to find out how many books Dolly has. Now comes the tricky part, ""librokunatam churan"". This word can be broken down into two parts - ""libo"" meaning ""book"", and ""kunata"" meaning ""to count"". So, we need to count the number of books that Dolly has. Finally, we come to the last part of the question ""Pandorapiqa uj runa tiyan"". This means ""Pandora took away some books"". But from where did she take them? From Dolly's collection! So, the number of books that Pandora took away is equal to the number of books that Dolly had initially. Therefore, the answer is 42."
"Response:  The question asks how many hours there are in a week of 5 days with 24 hours each day. So, we have:

Days per week = 5
Hours per day = 24
Total hours per week = Days per week x Hours per day = 5 x 24 = 120 hours
Therefore, there are 120 hours in a week."
Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 kilopaq (kp) in his phone and he can make 15 minutes calls per minute. So, if we calculate for 30 minutes, he would have made 450 calls (15 x 30). Now, let's convert it to killapi (kp), since each call is equal to 1 kp. Therefore, Jason has made 450 x 1 = 450 killapi.
"Response:  We have:
Griffinqa = 24 fritas mikhuran (fritasnintaq)
Kyleqa = 5 jap'iyta jap'erqa (jap'isqanmanta)
Gingerqa = 10 fritas nint'a qorqan (chaymanta)
Colbyqa = 3 fritas llata jap'erqa (uj puchulla fritasninta qorqa)
Total number of fritas = 27 fritas niyuqña kasqa (Griffinqa + Kyleqa + Gingerqa + Colbyqa)
Therefore, the total number of fritas that Gingerqa Griffinman has eaten is 27 fritas niyuqña kasqa."
Response:  The number of snails in the first group (Huk) is 32. In the second group (Aquariopi), there are 16 snails. So, the total number of snails = 32 + 16 = 48. Therefore, the answer is 48.
"Response:  The cost of makeup is $250 and it takes 6 hours to apply it for one week (semana). Therefore, the hourly rate for applying makeup is $250 / 6 = $41.67 per hour. Now, let's calculate how much Jean makes in a month (mes) if he works 4 days a week (kutipas ruwan): $41.67 x 4 = $166.68 per day; $166.68 x 4 = $666.72 per week; $666.72 x 4 weeks = $2666.88 per month. So, Jean makes $2666.88 per month working as a makeup artist."

"Response:  We have:
Chaypi (the price of one head of lettuce) = $1.50
uj (the number of heads of lettuce) = 50
cebollata (the weight of each head of lettuce in grams) = 200 grams
rantikorqa (the total weight of all the heads of lettuce in kilograms) = 50 x 200 grams = 10,000 grams
Sapa (the cost per kilogram of lettuce) = $1.50 / 10,000 grams = $0.15 per kilogram
Therefore, Machayqa (the total cost of all the heads of lettuce) = $0.15 x 50 = $7.50"
Response:  On Monday, Hermananmanta consumed 4 cups of coffee with 130 calories per cup. Therefore, he consumed a total of 520 calories (4 x 130 = 520). Now, let's calculate how many calories Sueqa consumed on Tuesday if she had 5 cups of coffee with 160 calories per cup. So, Sueqa consumed a total of 800 calories (5 x 160 = 800). Thus, the difference between the number of calories consumed by Hermananmanta and Sueqa is 280 calories (800 - 520 = 280).
