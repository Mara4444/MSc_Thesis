Response:  Jennet makes $16 per day from selling eggs and spends $3 on feed for each chicken. She has 30 chickens and sells an average of 4 eggs per chicken per day. So, she earns $48 per day from egg sales. Now, let's calculate how much money Jennet makes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Jennet earns $48 x 7 = $336 per week from egg sales alone. However, we also know that Jennet buys 3 kg of rice at $2 per kg every week to make nashte (a traditional Nepali dish). So, her total expenses come to $3 x 3 = $9 per week. Therefore, Jennet makes a profit of $336 - $9 = $327 per week.
Response:  We have two blue balls and half of them are safed fibers. So, we have total 2 x 1/2 = 1 ball of saffed fiber. Now, there are 3 red balls in the container. So, the total number of bolts is 3 + 1 = 4. Therefore, there are 4 bolts in the container.
Response:  Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then sold it for $130,000 after renovating it. So his profit is: Profit = Selling price - Purchase price = $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000. Therefore, he made a profit of $50,000.
Response:  Jamie threw three sprinters in one week. Each sprint is 60 meters long. So, total distance covered by Jamie in one week = Number of sprints x Distance of each sprint. = 3 x 60 = 180 meters. Therefore, Jamie covers a total distance of 180 meters in one week.
Response:  Vandi gives three meals to each of her mice every day, which includes beans, wheat, and vegetables. She provides them with three different meals in total. In the morning, she feeds them 15 capsules of churna (a type of Ayurvedic medicine). In the evening, she feeds them 25 capsules of churna and food. If there are 20 mice in Vandi's cage, how many capsules of churna does she need to give to each mouse in the last meal of the day?  To find out, we can use simple multiplication. Since Vandi gives three meals a day, each containing 3 types of food (beans, wheat, and vegetables), the total number of food items per day is 3 x 3 = 9. Then, if there are 20 mice, the total number of food items needed for all the mice is 20 x 9 = 180. Now, since Vandi gives 15 capsules of churna in the morning and 25 capsules in the evening, the total number of capsules given per day is 15 + 25 = 40. Therefore, to feed one mouse for the entire day, Vandi needs to give it 180 / 40 = 4.5 capsules of churna. So, she needs to give 4.5 capsules of churna to each of her 20 mice in the last meal of the day.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 gilas of chashma at $5 per gila: Total Cost = Number of Gilas x Price Per Gila = 16 x $5 = $80 So, Kailer needs to pay $80 for 16 gilas of chashma. Now, let's find out how much he will save if he buys each additional gila at a discounted price of 60% of the original price: Discounted Price = Original Price x Discount Percentage = $5 x 60% = $3 Discount Amount = Original Price - Discounted Price = $5 - $3 = $2 So, Kailer will save $2 on each additional gila he buys. Therefore, the total amount he will have to pay for 16 gilas of chashma is: Total Cost = $80 + (16 x $2) = $80 + $32 = $112
Response:  In Tuluz, there are 3 more beds than in Charles Town. So, in Charles Town, there will be 3 + 4 = 7 additional beds. Similarly, in Seatle, there are 20 beds more than in Charles Town, so in Seattle, there will be 7 + 20 = 27 additional beds. Therefore, the total number of beds in Tuluz, Charles Town, and Seattle is 3 + 7 + 27 = 47 beds.
Response:  We know that Carl has to download a file of size 200 GB, which is divided into two parts of 100 GB each. The downloading speed is 2 MB/minute, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time taken for downloading the first part (100 GB) = 60 minutes x 2 MB/minute = 120 minutes. Similarly, the total time taken for downloading the second part (100 GB) = 60 minutes x 2 MB/minute = 120 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken for downloading both parts = 120 + 120 = 240 minutes or 4 hours. Now, we need to calculate how much data will be downloaded during this period. Since the downloading speed is 2 MB/minute, the total amount of data downloaded during this period = Total time taken for downloading / Download speed = 240 minutes / 2 MB/minute = 120 MB. Therefore, Carl will have to wait for approximately 4 hours to download the entire file of size 200 GB, and he will only be able to download around 120 MB per minute.
Response:  John travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours and then turns back. In this time, he covers a distance of 180 miles (60 x 3 = 180). Now, in the next 4 hours, he moves at a speed of 40 miles per hour, covering a distance of 160 miles (4 x 4 = 160). So, in total, he has traveled a distance of 340 miles (180 + 160) during these 7 hours. Since he started from his home, we can assume that his destination is also at a distance of 340 miles from his home. Therefore, after turning back, he will be 340 miles away from his home.
Response:  Eliza works for 8 hours per day and earns $10 per hour. Therefore, her daily income is $80 ($10/hour x 8 hours). Since she works every day of the week, her total weekly income is $80 x 7 days = $560. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, then her total weekly income would be $560 + (45 hours x $10/hour) = $560 + $450 = $1010.
Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads.  In the second month, there were 90 downloads (60 + 30).  In the third month, there were 60 downloads again (90 - 30). So in total, there were 150 downloads (60 + 90 + 60) over three months.
Response:  Tulsi bought 3 drums of oil costing $68 per drum, 2 mini kegs of beer costing $80 per mini keg, and 6 mini cheese cubes costing $55 per mini cube. Therefore, the total amount spent by Tulsi is: Drums of oil x Cost per drum = $68 x 3 = $194 Mini kegs of beer x Cost per mini keg = $80 x 2 = $160 Minicubes of cheese x Cost per minicube = $55 x 6 = $330 Total amount spent = $194 + $160 + $330 = $684
Response:  First year (Year 1):  * Number of nuts produced = 7 nuts/tree x 3 trees = 21 nuts  * Revenue from selling nuts = $1.5 per nut x 21 nuts = $31.5  Second year (Year 2):  * Number of nuts produced = 7 nuts/tree x 3 trees = 21 nuts  * Revenue from selling nuts = $1.5 per nut x 21 nuts = $31.5  Third year (Year 3):  * Number of nuts produced = 7 nuts/tree x 3 trees = 21 nuts  * Revenue from selling nuts = $1.5 per nut x 21 nuts = $31.5  Fourth year (Year 4):  * Number of nuts produced = 7 nuts/tree x 3 trees = 21 nuts  * Revenue from selling nuts = $1.5 per nut x 21 nuts = $31.5  Fifth year (Year 5):  * Number of nuts produced = 7 nuts/tree x 3 trees = 21 nuts  * Revenue from selling nuts = $1.5 per nut x 21 nuts = $31.5 Sixth year (Year 6):  * Number of nuts produced = 7 nuts/tree x 3 trees = 21 nuts  * Revenue from selling nuts = $1.5 per nut x 21 nuts = $31.5 Seventh year (Year 7):  * Number of nuts produced = 7 nuts/tree x 3 trees = 21 nuts  * Revenue from selling nuts = $1.5 per nut x 21 nuts = $31.5 Eighth year (Year 8):  * Number of nuts produced = 7 nuts/tree x 3 trees = 21 nuts  * Revenue from selling nuts = $1.5 per nut x 21 nuts = $31.5 Ninth year (Year 9):  * Number of nuts produced = 7
Response:  Melani has sold one vacuum cleaner in Green House, two in Red House, and none in Yellow House. If Melani had 5 vacuum cleaners to sell initially, then she would have started with 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 vacuum cleaners.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students, 4 (20% of them) are in the dance category, and among those 4, 3 (75% of them) are in hip-hop dance. So, the total number of students in hip-hop dance is 3/4 = 0.75 x 20 = 15 students. Therefore, the percentage of students who are in hip-hop dance is (15/20) x 100 = 75%.
Response:  The investor has two options to invest - gold coins worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. According to their financial advisor, the price of gold coins in the market will increase by 2.5% per month, while that of electronic gadgets will increase by 1.2% per month. If the investor chooses to invest at the end of the month, what would be the maximum profit he could make?  To find out the maximum profit, we need to calculate the value of both options after one month and then compare them.  Value of Gold Coins After One Month = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125 Value of Electronic Gadgets After One Month = $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,160 Now, let's see which option gives us more profits. Maximum Profit = Higher of the Two Values = $8,160 > $5,125 Therefore, if the investor invests in electronic gadgets at the end of the month, they can expect a maximum profit of $3,035 ($8,160 - $5,125).
Response:  On day 1, both trains start from the same point and move in opposite directions. So, they meet after 80 miles (130 km). Now, on day 2, one train moves 150 miles (240 km) northward while the other train moves 150 miles southward. To find out how much distance each train covers in total, we need to subtract the distance traveled on day 1 from the total distance traveled on day 2. Therefore, the answer is: Distance covered by first train = 80 + (150 - 130) = 160 miles (257 km) Distance covered by second train = 80 + (150 + 130) = 290 miles (467 km)
"Response:  Firstly, we know that the monthly salary of the teacher is $20 per hour and the coaching fee is $30 per hour. So, if he works for 50 weeks in a year (i.e., 1 week = 7 days), his total annual income from teaching would be:

$20/hour x 50 weeks = $1000

Now, let's calculate his total annual income from coaching:

$30/hour x 35 hours/week x 50 weeks = $4500

So, his total annual income from both teaching and coaching would be:

$1000 + $4500 = $5500

Therefore, the person's annual income is $5500."
Response:  The clarion says she makes 3 sweets every morning for 5 days a week, which means she makes 15 sweets in total (3 x 5 = 15). Now, we need to calculate how many ants she will eat in 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, and she eats 15 sweets per week, she will eat 15 x 7 = 105 sweets in one month (4 weeks). Therefore, she will eat 105 x 4 = 420 ants in 4 weeks.
Response:  The distance traveled in 4 miles = 4/60 = 0.075 hours.  Similarly, the distance traveled in 2 miles = 2/60 = 0.033 hours.  So, if she wants to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles at her average speed of 0.075 miles per hour, it will take her = 8 / 0.075 = 108 minutes or 1 hour and 48 minutes.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of narangi pee and we want to mix it with 15 liters of anana pee in a ratio of 3:5 (three parts narangi pee to five parts anana pee). So, the total volume of the mixture will be:

10 liters x 3/7 = 4.286 liters

Now, when we add 1 liter of narangi pee to this mixture, the volume will decrease by 1 liter because of the expansion of water due to boiling. Therefore, the final volume of the mixture after adding 1 liter of narangi pee is:

4.286 liters - 1 liter = 3.286 liters

So, there are 24 liters of water in the mixture."
Response:  Remand was born 6 years before Samantha. If Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Remand was born when Samantha was 25 years old. So, Remand was born 6 + 25 = 31 years ago.
Response:  On Monday (Mangalwar), Bilie sold 3 DVDs to the first 3 customers. So, he earned $3 x 3 = $9. Then, he sold 2 DVDs each to the next two customers, earning $2 x 2 = $4 more. Finally, no customer bought any DVD from him in the last three customers. Therefore, Bilie earned a total of $9 + $4 = $13 on Monday.
Response:  We know that the bathtub fills up with water at a rate of 2 liters per hour. So in one hour (60 minutes), it will fill up to 60 x 2 = 120 liters. Now we need to find out how much water the bathtub will hold after 9 hours (from 1 pm to 5 pm). Therefore, we can calculate as follows: Total volume of water = Volume filled per hour x Number of hours = 120 liters/hour x 9 hours = 1080 liters.
Response:  The book was sold for $19.50 with a discount of 25%. So, we need to find out what was the original price of the book before applying the discount. We can do this by using the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage) Now, let's plug in the values given in the question: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26 Original Price = $26 Therefore, the original price of the book before applying the discount was $26.
Response:  Marry bought chicken for $12, milk for $3, apples for $1.50 each, and some pizza slices for $2 each. In total, Mary spent $50. If each box of pizza costs $8.50, how many boxes did Mary buy?  We can start by converting all the amounts to dollars: Chicken = $12 Milk = $3 Apples = $1.50 x 4 = $6 Pizza = $2 x 4 = $8 Total = $50 Now we know that Mary spent a total of $50, so if she bought each box of pizza for $8.50, then she must have bought $\boxed{\frac{Total}{Cost per box}} = \boxed{\frac{50}{8.50}} = 6$ boxes of pizza.
Response:  Firstly, Mishta bought three shirts for $16.50 each, so he spent a total of $ $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on shirts. Secondly, he purchased two pairs of pants for $22.50 each, which means he paid a total of $ $22.50 x 2 = $45.00 on pants. Lastly, he bought one pair of shoes for $42.00, and thus spent $42.00 on shoes. Therefore, in total, Mishta spent $ $49.50 + $45.00 + $42.00 = $136.50 on clothes.
Response:  Si...
Response:  Henery traveled for 60 miles and stopped twice during his journey. He stopped for the first time after traveling 20 miles and then resumed his journey. The second stop was made 15 miles before the end of the journey. So, let's calculate the distance he covered between each stop: Distance between stops = Total distance traveled - (Distance traveled before first stop + Distance traveled after second stop) = 60 miles - (20 miles + 15 miles) = 25 miles Therefore, Henry covered 25 miles between his two stops.
Response:  Gloria bought shoes worth $50 and received a discount of $10, so she paid $40 for them. Later, she got another pair of shoes worth $70 with a discount of $20, so she paid $50 for those. Now, if she wants to choose between these two pairs of shoes, she will have to pay $33 for one pair or $60 for the other. Therefore, the total cost of both pairs of shoes is $93 ($33 + $60).
Response:  We know that Darling is currently 7 years old and Ella is currently 162 years old. So, if we want to find out how old Ella will be after 10 years, we need to add 10 to her current age of 162. Therefore, Ella's age after 10 years will be 172 years old.
Response:  Guantar has asked his friends how many balls are in a jar. One friend says there are 80 balls in the jar, while another friend says there are more than half of the total number of balls in the jar (i.e., 50%). So, if there are 80 balls in the jar, then the total number of balls in the jar is:  Number of balls = Total number of balls in the jar x Percentage of balls that Guantar's friend said  Number of balls = 80 x 50/100 = 40 Therefore, the correct answer is 40.
Response:  John has 10 cats and each cat needs 0.5 hours of attention per day. Therefore, John spends 10 x 0.5 = 5 hours per day on attending to his cats. Now, in a week, there are 7 days, so John spends 5 x 7 = 35 hours per week on attending to his cats.
"Response:  We know that Grechen has 110 bags of rice and each bag contains 20 kg of rice. So, the total weight of rice in Grechen's possession is:

$$ \text {Total weight of rice} = \text {Number of bags} \times \text{Weight per bag} $$

= 110 $\div$ 20 $=$ 5.5 tons

Now, we are told that Chandi has 30 more bags of rice than Grechen. So, the total weight of rice in Chandi's possession is:

$$ \text {Total weight of rice} = \text {Number of bags} \times \text{Weight per bag} $$

= 80 $\div$ 20 $=$ 4 tons

Therefore, there are 5.5 tons + 4 tons = 9.5 tons of rice in Chandi's possession."
Response:  Siyoban has 2 less than Harun and Remand has 5 more than Harun. So, Harun has 31 gahane (since he has 2 less than Siyoban). Now, Remand has 36 gahane ( since he has 5 more than Harun). If Remand has 40 gahane, then Siyoban has 38 gahane.
"Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mickey scores 4 points. If he scores at this rate for the entire 40 minutes, then his total score will be:

Mickey's score in first 20 minutes = 4 points
Total time taken to complete the task = 40 minutes

So, Mickey's average score per minute = Total score / Time taken
= 4/20 = 0.2 points/minute

Now, let's find out how many points Mickey scored in the second 20 minutes:

Time taken to complete the task after first 20 minutes = Remaining time = 40 - 20 = 20 minutes
Average score per minute during second 20 minutes = Total score / Remaining time
= (25/100) x 20 = 5 points/minute

Therefore, Mickey scored a total of:

Total score = Average score per minute x Time taken
= 0.2 points/minute x 40 minutes + 5 points/minute x 20 minutes
= 8 points + 100 points
= 108 points

So, Mickey scored a total of 108 points in the given time frame."
Response:  We know that there are two apples in one day and they cost $5 each. So, the total cost of buying two apples per day is: $5 x 2 = $10 Now, we need to calculate how much money Teri will spend on apples over 30 days. To do this, we multiply the daily cost by 30: $10 x 30 = $300 Therefore, Teri will spend $300 on apples over 30 days.
Response:  John has 13 sets of video games to sell and each set contains 8 games, so he has a total of 13 x 8 = 104 games to sell. He sells each game for $20, so he will earn a total revenue of 104 x $20 = $2080 from selling all the games. Since he already sold 5 sets (or 40 games), he still has 104 - 5 = 99 games left to sell. Therefore, there are 99 sets of video games left with John.
Response:  John walks for 60 miles in one week. He walks for 3 days in that week. In each day, he walks for 3 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the afternoon. So, his total walking time per day is 3 + 2 = 5 hours. Now, to find out how fast he walks, we need to divide the distance he covers (60 miles) by the time taken to cover it (in hours). Therefore, John walks at a speed of 60 / 5 = 12 miles per hour.
Response:  Denna can run at a speed of 4 miles per hour, and she has been running for 3 hours so far. Therefore, she has covered a distance of 12 miles (4 miles/hour x 3 hours). Now, if she continues to run at this pace for another 3 hours, she will cover a total distance of 18 miles (12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles).
Response:  Ben's phone is 4 years old, and Suji's phone is 2 years old. If Suji's phone is 1 year old, then Ben's phone is 5 years old. Therefore, Brandan's phone is 5 years old.
Response:  We know that Poli can throw stones of weight up to 10 kg and reach a distance of 400 feet in one go. Now, we need to find out how far Poli can throw Stones after consuming Neelamani. As per the question, when Poli consumed Neelamani, its strength increased three times. So, now Poli can throw stones of weight up to 30 kg (3 x 10 kg). Moreover, since Poli has become stronger after consuming Neelamani, it can cover more distance with each throw than before. Therefore, the distance covered by Poli after throwing a stone will be 3 x 400 = 1200 feet. Finally, if Poli were to consume Ratna, which is even heavier than Neelamani, then it would increase Poli's strength further. However, as per the question, Poli cannot throw Ratna directly. But if Poli could somehow manage to pick up Ratna and throw it, then it would cover an additional distance equal to half the weight of Ratna multiplied by the distance traveled by the stone. Since Ratna weighs 50 kg, the additional distance covered by Poli would be 50 x 1200 = 60,000 feet. Thus, the total distance covered by Poli after throwing a stone containing Ratna would be 1200 + 60,000 = 61,200 feet.
Response:  Daadi Johns gave each of the five guests 8 cookies to start with. She then cut each cookie into four pieces, so each guest had 32 pieces of cookies in total (8 cookies x 4 pieces/cookie). At the end of the evening, when the guests took their leftover cookies, they had 14 pieces left (32 pieces - 18 pieces taken by guests = 14 pieces). Therefore, the number of cookies that the guests took was 18 (14 pieces left + 4 pieces given at the beginning).
"Response:  If one bag of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in each bag, then the total number of calories in 300 grams of chips is:

Calories per serving = Number of calories in one bag x Number of servings in one bag
= 250 x 5
= 1250 calories

Now, if you want to know how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie goal of 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories from chips earlier, we need to calculate the remaining amount of calories that you can consume:

Remaining calories = Daily calorie goal - Calories consumed so far
= 2000 - 1800
= 200 calories

Therefore, you can eat approximately 30 grams (200 / 1250) of chips based on your current calorie consumption."
Response:  If Charlie can make 10 moombattis with each pound of madhumakki and it costs him $10 to produce one pound of madhumakki, then he will have to sell each moombat for at least $10/10 = $1 per unit.  Since he is making 20 moombattis in total, if he sells them all at $1 per unit, his total revenue will be $20 (20 x $1).
Response:  Meredith is a free-lance blogger who writes about health topics and publishes one article every day. She spends approximately 4 hours writing each article. In the previous week, she wrote 5 articles on Sunday, 2/5 of an article on Monday, and none on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. On Friday, she wrote twice as many articles as she did on Monday. Therefore, in those three days (Friday to Sunday), she wrote a total of 3 times 5 = 15 articles.
Response:  Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse before she went to the coffee shop and bought a pack of 220 post-it notes. If she had 23 extra post-it notes left after buying the pack, then the total number of post-it notes she had is:  Number of post-it notes in the pack = 220 Post-it notes left after buying the pack = 23 Total number of post-it notes = Number of post-it notes in the pack + Post-it notes left after buying the pack = 220 + 23 = 243 post-it notes.
Response:  John bought two tires of red color worth $200 each, and their price difference is 50% more than that of Neil's tires (which are blue in color). So, if Neil's tire costs $100, then John paid $140 for each red tire ($200 x 50%). Therefore, John paid a total of $280 for both red tires.

$$ \boxed{8} \times \boxed{15} = 120 $$

Now, we are told that $3/4$ of the building has been occupied by the apartment complex. So, the total area of the building is:

$$ \boxed{3/4} \times \boxed{120} = 90 $$

Therefore, there are $90$ windows in the entire building."
Response:  The owner of the land has 100 acres of land and produces 252 pounds of gold per day. They sell each pound for $250 per ounce. So, they make $63,040 per day ($250 x 252 pounds). Now, let's calculate how much they make in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount made in a week is: $63,040 x 7 = $449,180 per week.
Response:  Tom can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour. In one hour, he will cover 10 miles. Now, let's calculate how much time it takes for him to travel 60 miles (which is equal to 6 hours). Time taken = Distance / Speed = 60 miles / 10 mph = 6 hours So, Tom takes 6 hours to travel from point A to point B and then return to point A again.
Response:  Urvashi has 15 pounds of books and each book weighs 1 pound. So, she has 15 pounds / 1 pound = 15 books. Now, if she wants to reduce her weight by 30 pounds, then she needs to get rid of 30 - 15 = 15 pounds of weight. Since each book weighs 1 pound, she will have to get rid of 15 books.
Response:  On Monday (Guruvar), Mechanic sold 6 truck tires and charged $60 each, earning him $360 in revenue. Similarly, he sold 4 car tires and earned $40 each, resulting in total revenue of $160. Therefore, his total revenue for Monday was $520.  Now let's move to Tuesday (Shukrawar). Since no cars were sold on this day, Mechanic only earned revenue from selling truck tires. He sold 12 truck tires at $60 each, which means he earned $720 in revenue. So, his total revenue for Tuesday was $1,240.  Finally, let's calculate the difference between the two days' revenues: $1,240 - $520 = $720. Therefore, Mechanic made an additional $720 in revenue on Tuesday compared to Monday.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, there are seven babies living with their mother at home. Their mother received a phone call from her husband (Doubtfire), who told her that he had two more children living with him. So, the total number of babies living with either of the parents is:

7 + 2 = 9

Therefore, there are nine babies living between the two families - the mother and the father (Doubtfire)."
Response:  Gen has 30 lilypops and wants to pack 2 lilypops in each of her two bags. So, she needs to pack 6 bags (2 x 2 = 6). Now, each bag can hold 5 lilypops, so Gen can fill 6 x 5 = 30 bags with lilypops. Therefore, Gen can fill 30 bags with lilypops.
Response:  We know that Peter has $70 to spend on tickets and popcorn every week. If he goes to the movies 4 times in a month, then he will have spent $70 x 4 = $280 on tickets and popcorn in that month. So, after one month, he will have $70 - $280 = -$210 left. Now, if we assume that he continues this habit for 7 weeks (a month has 4 or 5 weeks), then he will have spent a total of $280 x 7 = $1960 on tickets and popcorn in those 7 weeks. Therefore, he can go to the movies 7 times in a row without running out of money.
Response:  We know that the capacity of the tanker is 5000 pounds and it cannot take more than that from the pond. The delivery truck has a capacity of 15 tons (or 15 x 400 = 6000 pounds). So, there is a surplus of 1350 pounds in the tanker after unloading all the water from the pond. Now, we need to find out how many drums can be loaded on the truck if the maximum weight allowed on the truck is 3755 pounds. To do this, we will divide the surplus weight by the weight of each drum: Drums = Surplus weight / Drum weight = 1350 / 400 = 3.375 drums Now, since you cannot have a fraction of a drum, we round up to the nearest whole number: Drums = 4 Therefore, the truck can carry 4 drums of water after unloading all the water from the pond.
Response:  Firstly, Steffan paid an order of $40 to the delivery agent as the final bill amounted to $40. Since it was a dealer transaction, Steffan deducted 25% commission from the total amount and gave $3 as shipping fee to the delivery agent. Therefore, the final amount that Steffan had to pay after deducting the shipping fee is: $40 - ($40 x 25%) = $31. So, the final price that Steffan had to pay for the Kirana was $31.
Response:  We know that there are 20 fruits in one bunch and 6 bunches of fruits are present in each jhadi. So, the total number of fruits in all jhadis = 20 x 6 = 120 fruits. Now, we know that out of these 120 fruits, 67 are different types of fruits. Therefore, the remaining 53 fruits must be the same type (i.e., 67 - 53 = 14). So, there are 14 different types of fruits in all jhadis.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 Santas in total and we want to find out how many of them are good (i.e., better than average). So, let's calculate the number of good Santas as follows:

* 1 Santa is bad, so we can ignore it.
* 20% of 24 Santas are average or worse, which means 4.8 Santas are not good (since 24 x 0.2 = 4.8).
* There are 2 Khatta Santas, which means they are neither good nor bad.
* Therefore, the remaining 16.2 Santas are good (16 - 4.8 = 11.2).

So, there are 11 good Santas among the 25."
Response:  Jennet buys a beti for $500 and then spends another $800 to make it. After that, she pays 10% of the total amount as insurance, which is $80. So, in total, Jennet has spent $660 ($500 + $800 - $80).
Response:  If Mars Inc has been paying $50,000 per year to its employee for 40 years, then the total amount paid so far is:  $50,000 x 40 = $2,000,000  Now, after 20 years, the company pays an annual increase of 5% on the pension amount. So, the new pension amount will be:  $2,000,000 x 1.05 = $2,075,000  After 30 years, the employee retires and gets the pension amount. Therefore, the pension amount at that time will be:  $2,075,000 / (1 + 0.05)^30 = $1,689,500  Hence, the pension amount after 30 years of service is $1,689,500.
Response:  In one month, Elena pays $140 as subscription fee to the streaming service. If the company offers her a discount of 10% on the second year's subscription fee, then the amount she will pay in the second year is:  $140 x (1 - 0.10) = $126 So, over two years, Elena will have paid a total of: $140 + $126 = $266 for the streaming service.
Response:  Sohbia has traveled 100 miles and needs to fill her tank again after that distance. The manual of her car states that it takes 4 gallons of gas to fill the tank. Therefore, we can calculate how many miles she can travel with one gallon of gas as follows: Distance = Total fuel capacity / Fuel efficiency (mpg) x Speed (mph) Where: Total fuel capacity = 12 gallons (as stated in the manual) Fuel efficiency = Not given (assuming an average fuel efficiency for a car) Speed = Not given (assuming an average speed of 60 mph for a car) Substituting these values, we get: Distance = 12 / X x 60 = Y miles Now, we know that Sohbia has already traveled 100 miles, so the remaining distance she can travel with one gallon of gas is: Remaining distance = 100 - Y miles Therefore, Sohbia can travel approximately Y miles with one gallon of gas. Since she needs to fill her tank again after traveling 100 miles, she will need at least 4 gallons of gas to cover the remaining distance of 60 miles (Y miles).
Response:  The person watches TV for 2 hours and then goes to bed. They repeat this process thrice in a week. So, they spend 6 hours watching TV in a week (2 x 3 = 6). Now, let's calculate how much time they spend reading in a week. According to the question, they read for half an hour every day, which means they spend 1/2 \* 7 = 3.5 hours reading in a week. Therefore, the total time spent on leisure activities in a week is 6 + 3.5 = 9.5 hours.
Response:  There are four schools participating in the basketball tournament and each school has two teams (a boys team and a girls team). Each team consists of 5 players. Therefore, there are a total of 20 players (10 from each school) participating in the tournament. So, the answer is 20.
Response:  We know that there were 175 heaps of wheat in total and each heap contained 35 heaps of wheat. So, the total number of heaps was 175 x 35 = 6025 heaps. Now, we are told that out of these 6025 heaps, 2 heaps had more than twice as many pannas as the remaining heaps. Therefore, the total number of pannas in all the heaps except for those two is equal to half of the total number of heaps multiplied by the number of heaps with less than twice as many pannas as the remaining heaps.  Half of 6025 heaps is 6025 / 2 = 3012 heaps. The number of heaps with less than twice as many pannas as the remaining heaps is 2 heaps, since only two heaps had more than twice as many pannas as the remaining heaps. Therefore, the total number of pannas in all the heaps except for those two is 3012 - 2 = 2990 pannas.
Response:  We have to find out how many teachers are required for 60 girls and 5 boys. To do this, we need to divide the total number of students (60 + 5 = 65) by the number of students per teacher. Generally, it is assumed that one teacher can handle around 30-40 students at a time. So, let's assume an average of 35 students per teacher. Therefore, we need: Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher = 65 / 35 = 1.87 teachers. Since you cannot have a fraction of a teacher, we round off the answer to 2 teachers. Hence, there are 2 teachers in Dr. Vertz's school.
Response:  Belly starts with $1 and grows at a rate of $5 per week for 8 weeks. Therefore, after 8 weeks, Belly has grown to $40. Now, Belly continues to grow at the same rate for another 4 weeks, so it grows to $60 in total. So, Belly started with $1 and grew to $60 in total.
"Response:  We have to calculate how much money each student pays in one week and then multiply it with the number of students to get the total amount of money earned by the school in one week.  So, if we assume that there are 5 classes per day, and each class has 15 students, then the total number of students in the school is:

5 classes/day x 15 students/class = 75 students/day

Now, let's find out how much money each student pays in one week:

$15.00 charge/student/week x 75 students/day = $1,125.00/week

So, the school earns $1,125.00 per week."
Response:  In the first plan, there are 20 instructions in total. To prepare these instructions for Kalian, he will need to read them twice, which means he will spend 40 minutes reading those instructions (20 x 2 = 40). Now, let's move on to the second plan, where there are 10 fewer instructions than the first one. If Kalian reads each instruction once, it will take him 10 minutes less than the previous case, i.e., 30 minutes (20 - 10 = 30). Therefore, the total time taken by Kalian to read and understand both plans is 40 + 30 = 70 minutes.
Response:  Tom has 100 brownies and 50 muffins to sell. Each brownie costs $3 and each muffin costs $4. So, in total, Tom has $3 x 100 = $300 worth of brownies and $4 x 50 = $200 worth of muffins. Now, if Tom sells all these baked goods at $3 per brownie and $4 per muffin, he will make a total revenue of $3 x 100 = $300 from brownies and $4 x 50 = $200 from muffins, for a grand total of $500.
"Response:  Shilpa bought five phones for $150 each and paid 2% tax per phone. So she spent a total of:

$150 x 5 = $750 (cost of phones)
$750 x 2% = $15 (tax on phones)
Total cost to Shilpa = $765 ($750 + $15 tax)
Now let's calculate how much Shilpa will pay in three months:

Monthly installment = Total cost / Number of months
= $765 / 3
= $255 per month
So Shilpa will pay $255 per month for three months."
Response:  If Artie sells 12 marigolds at $2.74 per bunch, he will make $32.08 ($2.74 x 12). Similarly, if he sells 9 petunias at $1.87 per bunch, he will make $16.53 ($1.87 x 9). And if he sells 17 begonias at $2.12 per bunch, he will make $35.34 ($2.12 x 17). Therefore, in total, Artie will make $83.55 ($32.08 + $16.53 + $35.34).
Response:  We know that there are 4 stages of reef growth, and each stage has half the depth of the previous stage. So, if we assume that the deepest stage is 16 feet (as given in the question), then the height of each stage can be calculated as follows: Stage 1: Depth = 8 feet Stage 2: Depth = 4 feet x 0.5 = 2 feet Stage 3: Depth = 2 feet x 0.5 = 1 foot Stage 4: Depth = 1 foot x 0.5 = 0.5 feet Therefore, the total height of all four stages of coral reef growth would be: 8 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 = 11.5 feet.
Response:  Sesilia has bought a new pillow and according to its veterinarian, it will eat one cup of kibble every day for 180 days. Then, from that point onwards, it will eat two cups of kibble every day until the end of its life. If each cup of kibble weighs 110 grams, how many bags of kibble will Sesilia need in total during her lifetime?  Total number of days = 180 + (remaining days) = x Total number of cups of kibble eaten per day = 1 or 2 Depending on the remaining days, calculate the total number of bags of kibble needed = Total number of days x Total number of cups of kibble eaten per day / Number of cups in a bag = x x (number of bags per kilogram - 1) Where x is the unknown variable, which we are trying to find out. Solving for x, we get: x = 180 + (365 - 180) = 205 days So, Sesilia needs 205 bags of kibble in total during her lifetime.
Response:  If Remy wears half of David's clothes (which is 400 pounds), then he will wear 200 pounds of clothes. Since David has 4 times as many clothes as Remy, David will have 800 pounds of clothes (4 x 200 = 800). So, the difference between Remy and David in terms of clothes weight is 600 pounds (800 - 200).
Response:  If Vincent buys three packets of flowers for $2.50 each, he will spend $7.50 in total. Similarly, if he buys two packets of flowers for $1.00 each, he will spend $2.00 in total. Therefore, the cost of buying 18 flowers at better prices is: $7.50 + $2.00 = $9.50. So, Vincent can save $8.00 ($9.50 - $1.50) by buying 18 flowers instead of three or two packets.
Response:  John buys a puppy for $100 and then sells it to a new customer at a discount of 30%. So, the price that the new customer pays is: New Customer Price = Original Price x (1 - Discount Percentage) New Customer Price = $100 x (1 - 0.30) New Customer Price = $70 The cost that Grouper incurs is the difference between the original price and the price paid by the new customer: Cost = Original Price - New Customer Price Cost = $100 - $70 = $30 Therefore, the loss incurred by Grouper is $30.
Response:  We know that two girls received 24 liters of water and one boy received 6 liters of water. So, in total, 30 liters of water were distributed among them (24 + 6 = 30). Now, we need to find out how much water each person got. To do this, we divide the total amount of water by the number of people: 30 liters / 3 = 10 liters per person. Therefore, 10 liters of water remained with each girl after they shared it equally among themselves, and 6 liters of water remained with the boy after he received it.
Response:  Charlie had $10 at first and bought $21 worth of goods from a store for his birthday. So, he has $10 + $21 = $31 now. Then, he gave $9 to his wife as a gift, so he has $31 - $9 = $22 left with him. Therefore, there are $22 sticks remaining with Charlie.
Response:  We know that Greta weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs less than 125 pounds by 4 pounds. So, Alex's weight is 125 - 4 = 121 pounds.
Response:  We know that Dan has planted three apple trees and each tree bears 25 apples. So, in total, there are 3 x 25 = 75 apples. Now, we need to find out how many containers can hold these apples. As per the question, each container can hold 8 apples, so we can fill 75 / 8 = 9 containers with apples. Therefore, the answer is 9 containers.
Response:  We know that the football team played 22 matches and won more than half of them (i.e., 8 more). So, we can write an equation based on this information: Number of wins = Total number of matches x Percentage of wins Now, let's substitute the values given in the question into the equation: Number of wins = 22 x 0.58 (since they won 8 more matches) Substituting the value of 0.58 for percentage of wins, we get: Number of wins = 13 Therefore, the football team won 13 matches out of the total 22 matches they played.
Response:  We know that the old woman has one quilt and she gives it to her granddaughter every year. So, after 23 years, the number of quilts she has given is 23. Now, she is 34 years old, so in these 34 years, she has given 34 x 23 = 758 quilts. Therefore, the total number of quilts she has is 758.
Response:  The alarm rings three times in one day. When it rings, Greg doesn't turn it off immediately. Today is the first time this has happened, and the alarm rang for four times longer than usual. In the second instance, the alarm rang for three times as long as the first instance. In the third instance, the alarm rang for half as long as the second instance. So, if we calculate the total time the alarm rang in all three instances, it will be (4 + 3 + 1.5) = 8.5 minutes. Therefore, the alarm rang for 8.5 minutes in total.
Response:  The company gives each employee $600 per month as part of their salary package. According to the policy, every year for five years, the starting salary is increased by 10%. So, if an employee has worked in the company for more than five years, they will get a 10% increase in their annual salary. Now, let's calculate Silvi's salary after three years of service. If she joined the company in December last year (2022), then her three-year service period ends in December 2025. Her annual salary would be calculated as follows:  Starting Salary = $600 x 10% = $60 Percentage Increase = $60 / $600 = 10% New Annual Salary = Old Annual Salary + Percentage Increase = $600 x 1.10 = $660 Therefore, Silvi's annual salary after three years of service would be $660.
Response:  According to the given information, Marilyn Monroe sold $88,000 worth of records in her first 10 years as an artist. Now, we need to find out how many records Herald sold if he sold more than Marilyn. We know that Herald sold 10 times more records than Marilyn, so if Marilyn sold $88,000 worth of records, then Herald sold $\frac{10 \times 88,000}{10} = 880,000$ worth of records.
Response:  The total number of guests invited to the party is 75. Each guest will receive $2 as a gift, so the total amount spent on gifts is $2 x 75 = $150. Therefore, the cost of the party will be $150 + $2 (for each of the 16 friends) x 16 = $384.
"Response:  If there are 20 adults and 5 children in the picnic, then each adult will eat 10 pounds of rice (as per the given information). So, the total amount of rice required for all the adults is:

20 adults x 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds of rice

Now, since there are 5 children, they will eat half the amount of rice as compared to an adult. So, the total amount of rice required for all the children is:

5 children x 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds of rice

Therefore, the total amount of rice required for the entire group is:

200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds of rice."
Response:  We know that there are three animals in Mars and two animals in Siberia. If we have four animals in Siberia, then the total number of animals in both places is: 3 + 2 = 5 animals.
Response:  We know that Emily is 5 years older than Jack, so Emily is 5 + 5 = 10 years old.  Corie is 2 years younger than Jack, so Corie is 5 - 2 = 3 years old.  Jamie is 10 years old and 1 year older than Corie, so Jamie is 10 + 1 = 11 years old. Therefore, Jackson is 11 years old.
Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds, then Gerald with his improved endurance can cover that distance in how much less time?  We know that Gerald's endurance has increased by 10%, so he can cover the same distance in 35.2 seconds (38 x 1.10).
Response:  We know that there are 4 times more cats than dogs in the house. So, if there are x dogs, then there are 4x cats. Since each cat has 2 bills, and each dog has 1 bill, we can say that the total number of bills is equal to the sum of the number of bills of all dogs plus twice the number of bills of all cats. Therefore, the total number of bills = (60 + 2(4x)) = 60 + 8x. Now, we need to find out how many paws there are in total. As we know that each paw has 5 claws, so the total number of claws = Total number of paws x Number of claws per paw. Therefore, the total number of claws = 60 + 8x x 5 = 60 + 40x. Finally, we have to divide the total number of claws by the total number of paws to get the average number of claws per paw. Average number of claws per paw = Total number of claws / Total number of paws = 40x/60 = 20 claws per paw.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in class 5, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls. So, the number of boys is 40 (2/5 x 200). Now, we need to find out how many girls are not in the skateboarding club. Since there are 60 girls (2/3 x 200), and 40 boys are already in the club, the remaining 20 girls are not in the skateboarding club. Therefore, the correct answer is 20.
Response:  According to the question, Hairy slept for 9 hours last night. His friend James only slept for 2 hours more than Hairy. So, James slept for 11 hours (9 + 2). Therefore, Hairy slept for 9 - 11 = 2 hours less than James.
Response:  When Freda mixes 16 cups of dough with three tomatoes each, she will have 48 tomatoes in total (since there are 3 tomatoes per cup). Since Freda has 32 servings of soup, and each serving contains 48 tomatoes, we can conclude that Freda used 8 tomatoes for each serving of soup. Therefore, Freda used a total of 8 x 32 = 256 tomatoes to make her 32 servings of soup.
Response:  We know that there are 5 cars outside the line and they will move after every 15 minutes. So in the first 15 minutes, only 3 cars (out of 30) can move. In the next 15 minutes, 6 cars (out of 30) can move. Therefore, in total, 9 cars (out of 30) moved during the given time period.
"Response:  Marry has already planted 18 new trees in her garden out of which she wants to give one tree each to her friends and family members. So, the number of trees that Mary will have after giving them away is:

18 - (Number of friends and family members) =?

Since Mary has 40 friends and family members, we can calculate the number of trees left with her as follows:

18 - 40 = 22

Therefore, Mary will have 22 trees left in her garden after giving one tree each to her friends and family members."
Response:  The first friend took 20 turns to open the door, the second friend took 1/4 of the time taken by the first friend (i.e., 5 turns), and the third friend took 10 turns more than the second friend (i.e., 15 turns). Therefore, if the fourth friend takes 60 turns to open the door, then he will take 60 - 20 = 40 turns less than the third friend. So, the number of turns taken by the fourth friend to open the door is 40.
Response:  We know that Solon has to read 4 books - Vijnanapitha (4 pages), Samajik Adhyayan (20 pages), Itihas (7 pages), and Bhugol (8 pages). If he reads 15 pages in one day, then we can calculate how many days it will take him to finish reading all the pages of each book as follows:  Vijnanapitha: 4 pages / 15 pages per day = 0.26 days (approximately 1 day) Samajik Adhyayan: 20 pages / 15 pages per day = 1.33 days (approximately 2 days) Itihas: 7 pages / 15 pages per day = 0.47 days (approximately 1 day) Bhugol: 8 pages / 15 pages per day = 0.53 days (approximately 1 day) Therefore, if Solon wants to finish reading all the pages of these four books within 4 days, he will have to spend approximately 1 day reading each book.
Response:  John drinks water every day at noon and before sleeping. He also takes a sip of water during his work hours. So, in one week (7 days), he drinks water for 5 times (3 meals + 2 snacks). Therefore, John drinks 5 x 8 = 40 glasses of water per week.
Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover one mile (which is equal to 1609.34 meters). So, if we want to cover 42 miles (which is equal to 6754.88 meters), it will take 42 x 10 = 420 minutes or 7 hours and 20 minutes.
Response:  Popie has 100 tukdes of rice and she is keeping them in a basket. She takes out one tukda at a time to give it to her mother who keeps taking two tukdars at a time. So, after how many times will all the tukdars be taken from the basket? Solution: We can start counting from when Popie starts giving tukdars to her mother. After each time, there are 2 tukdars less in the basket. Therefore, the number of times Popie will take tukdars from the basket before all are gone is: Number of times = Total tukdars - Initial tukdars with Popie / 2 = 100 - 50 / 2 = 4 times. Hence, all the tukdars will be taken from the basket in 4 times.
Response:  If Amir has 3 more kukiz than Codey, and Amir has 5 kukiz in total, then Codey must have had 2 less kukiz than Amir initially. So, if Amir has 5 kukiz now, he must have had 7 kukiz initially (since 3 + 2 = 5). Therefore, Amir and Codey together have 10 kukiz (7 + 3).
Response:  We have three boxes of size 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches each. The total internal volume of all three boxes is: V = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches. Now, we need to find out how much space there is between the boxes. Since the dividers are 1 inch thick, the distance between any two adjacent boxes is: d = 1 inch. Therefore, the total distance between all three boxes is: D = 3 x d = 3 x 1 inch = 3 inches. So, the total internal volume of all three boxes plus the empty space between them is: V + D = 120 + 3 = 123 cubic inches.
Response:  On Monday (Somvar), he watched one episode of his favorite show for 30 minutes.  On Tuesday (Mangalwar), he watched another episode of the same show for 30 minutes.  On Wednesday (Budhwar), he watched some episodes of the show for 30 minutes each.  On Thursday (Guruwar), he finished his work early and watched an entire episode of the show for 60 minutes.  On Friday (Shukravar), he watched two episodes of the show for 30 minutes each.  If he had watched a total of 7 hours of TV that day, then how many episodes of the show did he watch in all?  We know that he watched 3 episodes on Somvar and Mangalwar, so their combined duration is 60 minutes x 2 = 120 minutes.  He watched 3 episodes on Budhwar, each lasting 30 minutes, so their total duration is 3 x 30 = 90 minutes.  He watched 1 episode on Guruwar, which lasted for 60 minutes.  So, the total duration of TV he watched that day is 7 hours - 120 minutes - 90 minutes = 40 minutes.
Response:  Henery has prepared 15 more kukiz than he had last year, which means he made 15 + 15 = 30 kukis this year.  Out of these, he has eaten 5 outside and thrown away 5, so he now has 30 - 5 = 25 kukis left. Therefore, Henery made 25 kukis this year.

Response:  Mars and Venus are playing a game of rock-paper-scissors. If they win, they get to eat one more roll than their opponent. If they lose, they have to eat two rolls less than their opponent. The current state of the game is as follows: Mars has eaten 3 rolls (chouudi) and Venus has eaten 24 rolls (lambi). If both players continue to play optimally, how many rolls will each player eat in total?  Solution:  To find out how many rolls each player will eat in total, we need to analyze the game mathematically. Since Mars has already eaten 3 chouudi rolls, it means that if he wins the next round, he will eat only 1 roll (since his opponent will be forced to eat 2 extra rolls). Similarly, if Venus wins the next round, she will eat only 19 rolls (since her opponent will be forced to eat 5 extra rolls). Therefore, the total number of rolls each player will eat can be calculated as follows: Mars: 3 + (if he wins) = 3 + 1 = 4 Venus: 24 - (if she loses) = 24 - 5 = 19 In conclusion, if both players continue to play optimally, Mars will eat 4 rolls in total, while Venus will eat 19 rolls in total.
Response:  We know that Julie was in her boat and traveled 10 feet away from the shore during this time. So, after 20 seconds, she had traveled a total distance of 20 x 10 = 200 feet away from the shore. Now, we are told that there is a 64-second delay between when Julie reaches the point where the water level is 1 foot deep and when the water starts flowing into the boat. Therefore, if we subtract 64 seconds from the total time taken to travel 200 feet, we get the time taken to travel the remaining distance (i.e., 200 - 64 = 136 seconds). Finally, since Julie can carry 10 liters of water per second, we can calculate the volume of water that entered the boat as follows: Volume of water = Time taken to travel distance / Time taken to fill the boat = 136 seconds / 20 seconds = 6.8 liters.
Response:  We know that there are 4 teachers and each teacher has to teach for 2 hours per day. So, in total, we have 8 teaching hours per day. Now, let's assume that the whiteboard is used 3 times in each hour. Therefore, the number of uses of the whiteboard in a day is 8 x 3 = 24. Hence, the whiteboard is used 24 times in a day.
Response:  We are given that Rajan plants two flowers in his garden every day and waits for 15 days to see how many of them have grown. If only 5 out of 20 (i.e., 5/20) flowers have grown after 15 days, then we can conclude that there were initially 15 flowers (20 - 5 = 15). So, the answer is 15.
Response:  We know that in Brittany's phone, there are more than 6 images of birds. So, we can say that the number of images of birds in Brittany's phone is greater than or equal to 6.  Now, let's consider Jamal's phone. In Jamal's phone, there are 1800 images. Since each image represents a bird, we can say that the total number of birds in Jamal's phone is also greater than or equal to 1800.  Therefore, if there are 1800 images of birds in Jamal's phone, then there must be at least 3200 birds (i.e., 1800 x 2) in his chicken coop.
"Response:  Firstly, Sasha has 10 x 2 = 20 boards of size 4 feet x 8 feet x 10 feet each, which she wants to sell. The cost price of each board is $10 per foot, so the total cost of these boards is:

$10/foot x 20 boards = $200

Secondly, there are 3 more sets of boards that Sasha has, each consisting of 5 boards of size 4 feet x 8 feet x 10 feet each. The cost price of each board in this set is also $10 per foot, so the total cost of these 3 sets of boards is:

$10/foot x 5 boards = $50

Total revenue from selling all the boards = $200 + $50 = $250

Now, let's calculate the profit that Sasha will make if she sells all the boards at $16 per foot. Profit = Revenue - Cost = $250 - ($200 + $50) = $150

So, Sasha will make a profit of $150 by selling all the boards at $16 per foot."
Response:  If he has taken 120 chammach chini and one cup of water, then we need to find out how many chammach chini are there in total. So, let's calculate it as follows: Total number of chammach chini = Number of chammach chini taken x (Total amount of liquid used / Amount of liquid per chammach chini) Total number of chammach chini = 120 x (120/5) = 600 chammach chini Therefore, there are 600 chammach chini in total.
"Response:  John has three children and he buys two pairs of shoes for each child at $60 per pair. So, the total amount spent by him is:

Total amount = Number of children x Cost per pair
= 3 x $60
= $180

Therefore, John spends $180 on buying shoes for his three children."
Response:  On day 1, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each = 10 vehicles in total.  On the next day, another container arrived with 5 more vehicles = 15 vehicles in total. So, the total number of vehicles at the port on the second day was 15.
Response:  Edrian earned $60,000 in year 1 and his salary increased by 30% every four years. So, in year 5, he earned $84,000 (60,000 x 1.3). Similarly, Lilah earned $40,000 in year 1 and her salary also increased by 30% every four years. Therefore, in year 5, she earned $56,000 (40,000 x 1.3). Now, if both Edrian and Lilah received an additional increase of 20% after four years, their new salaries would be: Edrian - $102,000 (84,000 x 1.2) Lilah - $67,200 (56,000 x 1.2) Total combined salary = $169,200 If they continued to work for another four years, their final salaries would be: Edrian - $160,000 (102,000 x 1.2) Lilah - $76,800 (67,200 x 1.2) Total combined salary = $236,800 Thus, the total amount earned by both Edrian and Lilah over the period of ten years is $236,800.
Response:  We know that Migule uses two sheets of paper per week for his drawings. If he has 30 sheets of paper in one pad, then he will use 60 sheets (2 x 30) per month. Therefore, he will use 720 sheets (60 x 12) per year.
Response:  Moriset has 5 seeds and Kael has 8 seeds. If they both planted their respective seeds equally well, then after some time, they would have gotten the following number of fruits:  Moriset - 5 x 2 = 10 fruits Kael - 8 x 2 = 16 fruits So, in total, there are 10 + 16 = 26 fruits.
Response:  On Sunday, Saadi slept for 8 hours. For the next two days, he slept for 2 hours less than the previous day, so he slept for 6 hours each day. Therefore, in total, Saadi slept for 6 + 6 = 12 hours during those three days. Now, if we compare these three days with the last seven days of the month, and assume that Saadi slept for 1 hour more each day, then in total, Saadi slept for 7 + 7 + 1 = 15 hours during those seven days. So, in total, Saadi slept for 12 + 15 = 27 hours during the entire week.
Response:  Rozi moves at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 30 miles (10 x 3 = 30). Then she slows down and covers the remaining distance of 50 miles in 4 hours (8 km/h), so her total distance covered is 80 miles (30 + 50 = 80). Therefore, Rosie can cover 80 / 7 = 11 miles in 1 hour.
Response:  Jenny has been helping her mother at her office for some time now and has collected 60 letters with seals on them. Of these, 30 letters have already been opened before she started working there. So, the number of letters that Jenny has helped her mother open is 30 (opened before) + 30 (newly arrived) = 60.
Response:  Julie had 5 chocolates in her bag when she started making stu. Then, her husband gave her 3 more chocolates. So, at this point, Julie had 8 chocolates (5 + 3). Later, while Julie was eating stu, she used up 3 of those chocolates. Therefore, now Julie has 5 chocolates left (8 - 3). Finally, when Julie went to bed, she had a total of 12 chocolates (5 + 7), which includes the ones she already had and the new ones her husband gave her later. So, the number of chocolates Julie bought was 7 (12 - 5).
Response:  We know that Delan wanted to buy more than one species of fish and chicken for his party.  He bought 38 chicken segments and 6 fish segments. So, in total, he bought 44 segments (38 + 6).
Response:  After the school was relocated, Emily made 20 more friends. So, Lilie had 50 - 20 = 30 friends before the move and now has 30 + 20 = 50 friends after the move. Therefore, Lilie and Emmy have 50 friends each.
Response:  The cost of one tamarind is three times that of one mirch (pepper), so the cost of one tamarind is $3 \times 3 = $9. Similarly, the cost of one santare (dried fruit) is five rupees less than the cost of one tamarind, so the cost of one santare is $9 - $5 = $4. Now, Delilah has to buy four tamarinds, twenty mirches, and ten santares. So, her total cost will be $4 \times 4 = $16 + $20 = $36 for tamarinds, and $16 + $10 = $26 for mirches and santares. Therefore, her total cost will be $36 + $26 = $62.
Response:  The hospital earns $150 per hour from each patient and treats 500 patients in a day, so it earns total revenue of $75,000 ($150 x 500) per day. Similarly, the doctor charges $200 per hour to the hospital for attending to patients, which means he/she earns total income of $30,000 ($200 x 150) per day. So, the net profit earned by the hospital after paying the doctor is $45,000 ($75,000 - $30,000).
Response:  Firstly, Niisa has employed 60 workers for his department store in Sant Nagar to play Elvis Presley games. After one of the twins (A) pulls off their ears, they throw away 10 more babies who were playing with them. So, the total number of babies that are left after this incident is 50.
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500.  In June, he spent $60 less than in May, so he spent $440 in June.  So, in total, Joseph spent $940 ($500 + $440) over those two months.
Response:  Pai...
Response:  Somwar ko (Sunday) se, woh 4 mile ki pasdaurri tak chal raha tha.  Mnaglavar ko (Monday) se usne Sunday ko jitni mili pasdaurri chali, uske liye 6 gunah (mile) ke badle 20% increase ho gaya.  Total distance traveled by him from Sunday to Monday = 4 miles x 1.2 = 4.8 miles.
Response:  Tom drives his car for four months in a year. So, he drives it for 4 x 3 = 12 months in a year. Since each month, he spends $15 on fuel, then in one year, he spends $15 x 12 = $180 on fuel. Therefore, Tom spends $180 on fuel in a year.
"Response:  Brain's friend Bob has 5 games that are less than 5 minutes long and 3 games that are longer than 5 minutes. If Brain had 20 video games in total but lost 5 times before reaching Bob's house, then the number of games left with Brain is:

Number of short games = 5 (as given)
Number of long games = 3 (as given)
Total number of games = Number of short games + Number of long games
= 5 + 3
= 8

Therefore, Brain has 8 video games left."
Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world and one of them is a Scottish unicorn living in Scotland. So, we have to find out how many Scottish unicorns there are among these 27 unicorns. Since all the unicorns are from different countries, each unicorn has its own unique country of origin. Therefore, the probability of any particular unicorn being Scottish is equal to the number of Scottish unicorns divided by the total number of unicorns. Using this logic, we can calculate the number of Scottish unicorns as follows: Number of Scottish unicorns = Total number of unicorns x Probability of being Scottish (Scottish unicorns / Total number of unicorns) = 27 x (1/27) = 1 So, there is only one Scottish unicorn among the 27 unicorns in the world.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total amount of money that Rori has received from Deliveroo. We know that she received two sandwiches for $7.50 each and four bags of chips for $1.50 each, so the total amount of money she received is:

$2 x 2 = $4 + $4 x 4 = $16

Now, we need to subtract the delivery fee that Rori paid to Deliveroo. According to the question, the delivery fee was 20% of the order value, which is:

$16 x 20% = $3.20

So, the total amount of money that Rori has after paying the delivery fee is:

$16 - $3.20 = $12.80

Finally, Rori wants to keep $5 as tip for the driver. So, the remaining amount of money that Rori has after giving the tip is:

$12.80 - $5 = $7.80"
Response:  In the first exam, Mark answered 5 questions in each of the 75 minutes, so he spent (5 x 75) = 375 minutes on that exam.  Now, if he had spent 8 hours on the previous exam and 6 hours on the next one, then the total time he spent on both exams is: 8 + 6 = 14 hours.  So, the number of questions he left unanswered can be calculated as follows: Total time taken for both exams = 14 hours Number of questions asked in both exams = 100 questions Therefore, the number of questions left unanswered = Total time taken - Time taken to answer all questions = 14 hours - (5 x 100) = 20 questions
Response:  We have 22 gambol balls in total, and each ball has 4 more than 12 neel gambols. So, if we have 12 neel gambols, then there are 22 - 12 = 10 additional gulabis. Therefore, there are 10 + 12 = 22 gulabis in total.
"Response:  We have 20 cars in total and we want to know what percentage of them are manual transmission.  So, let's count the number of manual transmission cars:

Manual Transmission Cars = 4

Now, let's calculate the percentage of manual transmission cars:

Percentage of Manual Transmission Cars = (Number of Manual Transmission Cars / Total Number of Cars) x 100
= (4 / 20) x 100
= 20%

So, out of the 20 cars, 20% are manual transmission cars."
Response:  We know that there are 700 madhumakhiyas in one ghonsla and each madhumakhiya has two shramik madhumakhiyas. So, the total number of shramik madhumakhiyas = 700 x 2 = 1400. Therefore, there are 1400 shramik madhumakkiyas in the given area.
"Response:  Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day and earns $10 per hour. If he spends all his time playing videos games instead of working, how much money will he make in a week?

Weekly income = Daily income x Number of days in a week
= $10/hour x 7 days/week
= $70/week

So, if Jordan spends all his time playing video games instead of working, he would make $70 per week."
Response:  We have to buy 3 cups of milk at $2 each, which is equal to $6. Then we have to buy 3 apples at $3 each, which is equal to $9. Next, we have to buy 3 oranges at $4 each, which is equal to $12. After that, we have to buy 3 bananas at $5 each, which is equal to $15. Finally, we have to buy 3 chocolates at $7 each, which is equal to $21. So, in total, we have spent $6 + $9 + $12 + $15 + $21 = $68. Therefore, the cost of all these items together is $68.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the items that Kim needs to purchase for each customer. The cost of two bottles of bleach is $2 x 2 = $4 per customer, and the cost of one packet of clothes is $5 x 1 = $5 per customer. Therefore, the total cost of goods sold (COGS) for each customer is $4 + $5 = $9 per customer.  Now, let's assume that Kim has 7 customers in total. So, the total COGS for all 7 customers would be $9 x 7 = $63.  Next, we need to calculate the revenue generated from these sales. If each customer purchases $92 worth of products every week, then the total revenue generated from all 7 customers would be $92 x 7 = $654 per week.  Finally, we can calculate the profit earned by Kim per week as follows: Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = $654 - $63 = $601 per week.  Therefore, the answer to the question is $601 per week.
Response:  John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare contains 100 ananas plants. John can harvest his ananas plants every 3 months. To find out how many ananas John will harvest in one year, we need to calculate as follows: Number of harvests per year = 12 (months) / 3 (harvesting period) = 4 So, John will harvest his ananas plants 4 times in one year. Now, let's calculate the total number of ananas he will harvest in one year: Total number of ananas = Number of harvests x Number of ananas per harvest = 4 x 100 = 400 ananas Therefore, John will harvest 400 ananas in one year.
Response:  John has placed 500 tukdars in one box and 3 more than that in another box. So, he has placed 503 tukdars in total (including both boxes). Now, we need to find out how many blocks of 1/4 tukdar each can be made from these tukdars. To do this, we will divide the total number of tukdars by 4. Therefore, the number of blocks of 1/4 tukdar each that John can make is: Number of blocks = Total number of tukdars / 4 = 503 / 4 = 125 blocks.
"Response:  Debara observed for 12 hours (from 8 AM to 8 PM) and saw 30 madhumakkhiyas come out of their holes during this time period.  During the first 6 hours (from 8 AM to 2 PM), she saw 20 madhumakkhiyas come out of their holes and then go back inside.  So, in these 6 hours, each madhumakkhiya came out once and went back once.  Now, let's calculate how many times each madhumakkhiya comes out and goes back in one day:

Total number of hours = 12 hours
Number of times each madhumakkhiya comes out = Total number of hours / Number of madhumakkhiyas that come out per hour
= 12 hours / 20 madhumakkhiyas
= 0.6 hours/madhumakkhiya

Similarly, we can calculate the number of times each madhumakkhiya goes back inside using the same formula:

Number of times each madhumakkhiya goes back = Total number of hours / Number of madhumakkhiyas that go back per hour
= 12 hours / 20 madhumakkhiyas
= 0.6 hours/madhumakkhiya

So, based on Debara's observation, each madhumakkhiya comes out of its hole approximately every 0.6 hours (or every 4 minutes) and goes back inside after spending around the same amount of time outside."
Response:  Britney and her mother went to the museum together. The entrance fee for adults is $12, while it is $10 for children. Britney's mother paid cashier $8 as change after buying a ticket for a child and another ticket for an adult. So, the amount of money that Britney's mother gave to the cashier is $8.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three more friends than Dorothy on Facebook. So, if Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook, then Charlie has 3 + 4 = 7 friends on Facebook. Now we are told that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy on Facebook. So, if Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook, then James has 4 x 4 = 16 friends on Facebook. Therefore, James has 16 - 7 = 9 more friends than Charlie on Facebook.
Response:  Steve and Tim are both leaving school at the same time (3 miles away). They have different speeds - Steve is traveling at 440 feet per minute, while Tim is traveling at 264 feet per minute. To find out when they will meet, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach their respective homes. For Steve, it will take him 15 minutes to reach his home (3 miles x 440 ft/min = 13600 ft / 60 min = 226.67 ft/min), so he will arrive at his home in 15 + 226.67 = 241.67 minutes. Similarly, for Tim, it will take him 18 minutes to reach his home (3 miles x 264 ft/min = 7920 ft / 60 min = 131.71 ft/min), so he will arrive at his home in 18 + 131.71 = 149.71 minutes. Since Steve starts later than Tim, he will overtake Tim after 149.71 minutes, which means that Steve will arrive at his home before Tim does. Therefore, the correct answer is B - Steve arrives at his home before Tim does.
"Response:  Firstly, Shondra said that each tire costs $25 to fill. Since there were 10 people in total, and they filled two tires each, the cost of filling all ten tires would be:

$25 x 2 = $50

Now, let's calculate how much money each person made that day. There were 3 people who filled their own tires, so the total amount they saved is:

$50 / 3 = $16.67

So, each person made $16.67 that day."
"Response:  Carl buys 10 packets of cookies from Kukiz, and each packet contains 6 cookies. The price of each cookie is $0.10. If Carl pays with a $10 note, how much change will he get?

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies that Carl bought:
Total Cost = Number of Packets x Price per Packet
= 10 x $0.10
= $1.00

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount paid by Carl:
Change = Amount Paid - Total Cost
= $10 - $1.00
= $9.00

Therefore, Carl will receive $9.00 in change if he pays with a $10 note."
Response:  When Dev bought the package from French Frise, there were 5 francs inside it.  When three cats fought over the package and one of them got injured, they left behind three francs.  Then, when Racket took two francs from the last French Fry, there were five francs left in the package. So, finally, there were 5 + 3 = 8 francs in the package.
Response:  On Somvar, Budhavar and Shukravar, there are three periods of 1 hour each. So, in total, they have 3 hours of classes per day.  On Mangalvar and Guruvvar, there are two periods of 2 hours each. So, in total, they have 4 hours of classes per day.  Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends 4 x 16 = 64 hours in class.
"Response:  Bill has 300 rolls of tape, each measuring 4 inches long. Each roll covers an area of 12 square inches (since there are 4 inches in a roll). So, the total area covered by all 300 rolls is:

300 rolls x 12 square inches/roll = 3600 square inches

Now, let's consider the size of each cross-sectional piece of tape. Since each roll measures 4 inches long and there are 6 inches in a foot, we can calculate the length of each piece of tape as follows:

Length of each piece of tape = Distance between two adjacent rolls / Number of pieces per roll
= 6 inches / 300 pieces
= 0.02 feet (or 2 inches)

So, the total length of all 300 pieces of tape is:

Total length of all pieces = Length of each piece x Number of pieces
= 0.02 feet x 300 pieces
= 6 feet

Finally, since each bag contains 60 bags, and each bag holds 2 pieces of tape, we can calculate the total number of pieces of tape held by all 60 bags as follows:

Total number of pieces of tape held by all bags = Total length of all pieces / Number of pieces per bag
= 6 feet / 2 pieces/bag
= 3 feet

Therefore, if Bill had placed all the used tapes together, they would have stretched for approximately 3 feet in length."
Response:  The owner of the chicken coop feeds all the hens in the coop twice a month. If they want to feed 200 kele (chicks) for 2 months, Gorrila wants to feed 400 kele for 2 months, and Baboon wants to feed 100 kele every month, how many ordeals will they need to make in total?  We know that there are 4 weeks in each month, so we can calculate the number of ordeals needed as follows:  For Chicken Coop:  Total number of days = 8 weeks x 2 months = 16 days x 200 kele = 3200 ordeals  For Gorilla:  Total number of days = 8 weeks x 2 months = 16 days x 400 kele = 6160 ordeals  For Baboon:  Total number of days = 8 weeks x 2 months = 16 days x 100 kele = 1600 ordeals  Therefore, in total, the three animals will need 3200 + 6160 + 1600 = 11960 ordeals to eat their food for 2 months.
Response:  Black moves forward for 15 minutes and then turns back. In total, he has moved a distance of 100 meters (100 x 2 = 200 meters). Now, Kelli starts running from the same point as Black and runs in one direction for 40 meters before turning back. So, she covers a distance of 40 meters. Since Black turned back after moving 200 meters, he is now 160 meters ahead of Kelli (200 - 40 = 160 meters). Therefore, the difference between their positions after 15 minutes is 160 meters.
Response:  Firstly, Raffle bought four pens for $1 each, so he spent a total of $4. Then, he bought two notebooks for $3 each, so he spent an additional $6. Finally, he bought one ring band paper for $20, so he spent a total of $28. Therefore, Raffle spent a total of $50 in all.
Response:  Initially, Fin saw 11 tadpoles in the pond. Suddenly, he noticed that among them, 6 were hiding underneath a lily pad below. Then, he observed that out of these 6, 2 had slipped beneath another lily pad. Now, how many tadpoles can Fin see in the pond?  Solution:  After the first observation, Fin could see 6 tadpoles (out of 11) in the pond. Out of these 6, 2 more tadpoles had hidden beneath another lily pad, leaving him with 4 visible tadpoles. Therefore, Fin can currently see 4 tadpoles in the pond.
Response:  On Somavara (Monday), the water level in the tank was 17 feet higher than the normal level. So, the normal level of water in the tank is 17 - 7 = 10 feet below the top of the tank.  Now, let's find out how much water is there in the tank on Budhavara (Thursday). We know that the water level in the tank increased by 2 feet from Monday to Thursday, so the water level on Thursday is 10 + 2 = 12 feet above the normal level. Therefore, the water level in the tank on Budhavara (Thursday) is 12 feet.
Response:  Enakin caught 10 sea creatures (including fish and other marine animals), while Locsin caught fewer than half of that number - exactly 5 less. So, if Enakin caught 10 sea creatures, then Locsin caught 5 sea creatures.
Response:  The price of one bag is $20 initially and increases by 20% every two months. So after 36 months (or 2 years), the price will be: $20 x (1 + 0.2) ^ 36 = $48. Therefore, the price of one bag after 36 months will be $48.
Response:  We have five cars (red, blue, green, yellow, and black), three figures (elephant, lion, and tiger), and one toy (teddy bear). The price of each car is given as follows: Red - $10, Blue - $8, Green - $9, Yellow - $7, Black - $6. So, the total cost of all five cars is: $10 + $8 + $9 + $7 + $6 = $40. Now, we are asked how much one figure costs. Since there are three figures, their total cost is $3 x $5 = $15. Finally, we are asked how much the teddy bear costs. As it is the only toy among all these things, its cost is $1. Therefore, the answer to the question is: One figure costs $15, and the teddy bear costs $1.
Response:  If Jackie decides to do her own accounting work for 3 hours per day, she will earn $35 per hour ($120 / 3 hours). Since there are 8 working hours in a day, she will earn total of $280 per day from accounting work ( $35 x 8 hours). Now, if she spends $90 as chargers for an accountant, then her net income from accounting work will be $190 per day ($280 - $90).
Response:  Elvira has $1500 to spend and wants to buy a computer with a screen, keyboard, mouse, scanner, burner, printer, and other accessories. The total cost of these items is $1090. So, she will have $410 left after buying all these things ($1500 - $1090 = $410).
Response:  Sandra has to take care of her daughter every time she sees her, and she gets paid $9 for each time she does so. To make a Spanish fan, she needs $3. If Sandra is given the task of making 15 fans for school funds every time she sees her daughter, how many times will she see her daughter in total?  Total number of times Sandra sees her daughter = Number of fans made / Payment per time = 15 x $9 / $3 = 47 times
Response:  We know that Seth is twice as old as Brody and will be 28 years old in two years. So, Seth's current age is:  Seth = 2 x Brody + 16 = 34 years old (since Brody is currently 16 years old) Therefore, Seth's age after two years will be:  Seth = 34 + 2 = 36 years old
Response:  Jim has $10 more than Ethel. So, if Ethel has $8, then Jim has $10 + $8 = $18.
Response:  Pancho walks for 20 miles in one day and then rests for seven days. So, he doesn't walk at all during these seven days. Now, let's calculate how much distance he covers in one week.  During the first week (7 days), Pancho didn't walk any mileage since he was resting. Therefore, his total walking distance is still 20 miles from Day 1 to Day 7.  Now, let's move on to Week 2. Since Pancho walked 10 miles per day during Week 1, we can assume that he will continue to walk at the same pace of 10 miles per day during Week 2 as well. This means that he covers an additional 70 miles (10 x 7 = 70) during Week 2.  In summary, Pancho covered a total distance of 90 miles (20 + 70 = 90) over two weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each topi costs $25 and each jacket costs $3 more than the topi. So, the cost of one jacket is: $25 + ($3 x 1) = $28. Now, we have to find out how many jackets can be purchased with the total amount given to each vardi. From the question, we know that the total amount given to each vardi is Rs 1000. Therefore, the number of jackets that can be purchased with this amount is: $\frac{Rs 1000}{Rs 28} = 37$ jackets. Finally, we need to add the cost of all the topis and jackets to find out the total cost for each vardi: $25 x 37 = $925$.
Response:  The first part of the question is about 80 macdies being seen through 8 pairs of eyes. So, the number of people seeing those 80 macdies is 8 x 8 = 64. Now, in the second part of the question, there are 90 kittens being seen through 6 pairs of eyes. So, the number of people seeing those 90 kittens is 6 x 6 = 36. And finally, there are 3 durable umbrellas being seen through 10 pairs of eyes. So, the number of people seeing those 3 durable umbrellas is 10 x 10 = 100. Therefore, the total number of people who can see all these objects (80 macdies + 90 kittens + 3 durable umbrellas) is 64 + 36 + 100 = 200.
Response:  We know that there are four animals in front of Salim and his mother-in-law. Two of them are old enough to have three children each, while two others are young enough to be eight years old. So, we can write down the information as follows:  Animal 1 (Salim): Age = 30 years Old enough to have three children Youngest child age = 8 years Animal 2 (Mother-in-law): Age = 60 years Old enough to have three children Youngest child age = 8 years Animal 3 (First animal in front of Salim): Age = x years Old enough to have three children Youngest child age = y years Animal 4 (Second animal in front of Salim): Age = x years Young enough to be eight years old Now, let's find out what 'x' and 'y' represent. Since both animals are old enough to have three children each, their ages must add up to 90 years. Therefore, we can write: x + y = 90 years Now, since one of these animals is Salim's mother-in-law, her age must be at least 60 years older than Salim's age. So, we can write: x - y = 60 years Finally, we can substitute all this information into the equation for the total age of the four animals: Total age = x + y + z + w Where 'z' represents the age of the first animal in front of Salim, and 'w' represents the age of the second animal in front of Salim. Substituting our values, we get: Total age = x + y + z + w = 30 + 8 + x + y = 90 + 60 = 150 years Thus, the total age of the four animals is 150 years.
Response:  Jessica wants to pay off all of her debts in one year. She has three types of debt: student loans, credit card debt, and bond debt. The minimum payment for each type of debt is as follows: Student loans - $300 per month Credit card debt - $200 per month Bond debt - $500 per month If Jessica wants to pay off at least 50% more than the minimum payment for each type of debt, she will have to pay: Student loans - $420 per month ($300 x 1.5) Credit card debt - $300 per month ($200 x 1.5) Bond debt - $750 per month ($500 x 1.5) In total, Jessica will have to pay $1,470 per month to pay off all of her debts in one year.
Response:  Bilie takes 1 minute to chop 60 almonds and 5 seconds to cut each almond. So, in total, it will take Bilie 60 x 1 = 60 minutes to chop all the almonds.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Juana and Carlitos sell each gallon of water for $0.50 and each gallon of milk for $2. So, if they sold 25 dollars worth of goods, then they must have sold:

Water (gallons) = Total revenue / Price per gallon = $25 / $0.50 = 50 gallons
Milk (gallons) = Total revenue / Price per gallon = $25 / $2 = 12.5 gallons
Therefore, Juana and Carlitos together sold 50 gallons of water and 12.5 gallons of milk."
Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total and they belong to two teams - Japanese and Chinese.  The Japanese team has 80 members, and we want to find out how many girls are in the Chinese team. So, let's assume that among the remaining 160 people (i.e., those who are not Japanese), 60 are boys. Now, we need to convert this information into a percentage of the total number of people. To do so, we can use the formula: Percentage = (Number of Boys / Total Number of People) x 100 So, the percentage of girls in the Chinese team is: Percentage = (60/160) x 100 = 37.5% Therefore, there are approximately 37.5% girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, Jaiad earns $6000 per month as salary. Out of this, he spends $1500 on his personal expenses and gives $300 to his wife as dowry. He also spends $200 on his daughter's education. Therefore, his total monthly expenditure comes out to be $1800. Now, let's calculate how much money Jaiad has left after meeting all his expenses. = ($6000 - $1800) / $6000 x 100 = 28.3% So, Jaiad has 28.3% of his salary left after meeting all his expenses.
Response:  Rani has 12 more monkeys than Moni. So, Rani has 12 + 4 = 16 monkeys in total. Moni has 4 less monkeys than Rani, so Moni has 16 - 4 = 12 monkeys in total. Now, if Bo has 40 monkeys, then Rani and Moni together have 16 + 12 = 28 monkeys. Therefore, the total number of monkeys among Rani, Moni, and Bo is 28.
Response:  In one week (7 days), there are 10 hours in total. So, if he worked for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week, then the total number of hours worked is: Total hours = 5 + 8 = 13 hours. Therefore, he made $13 x 10 = $130 in one week.
Response:  We know that there are two candidates running for the post of class representative and they have received 3/4 votes each. The total number of students in the class is 80. Now, we need to find out how many votes the losing candidate got. Since the winning candidate has received 3/4 votes, the losing candidate must have received 1/4 votes. So, the number of votes the losing candidate got = Total number of votes cast - Number of votes won by the winner = 80 - (3/4) x 80 = 80 - 60 = 20 votes. Therefore, the losing candidate got 20 votes.
Response:  Sandra has given Fred 40 red roses and he wants to sell them at his shop. However, there is a problem as the flowers will not last beyond 5 pm due to the heat. To make matters worse, Sandra has also given him 200 white lilies that are equally valuable but have a shorter lifespan than the roses. So, if Fred wants to keep his business running smoothly, how many white lilies should he sell between 5 pm and 10 am the next day to compensate for the lost time?  Based on this information, we can calculate the number of white lilies Fred needs to sell as follows: Total value of white lilies = 200 x 5 = 1000 Value of each white lily = 1000 / 20 = 50 Each white lily sold = 50 / 5 = 10 per hour Now, let's find out how much time passes from 5 pm to 10 am the next day: Time passed = 10 am - 5 pm = 7 hours Therefore, Fred needs to sell 10 x 7 = 70 white lilies during these 7 hours to compensate for the lost time.
Response:  We know that Gen is 2 years older than Mark and Jan. So, if Mark is currently 30 years old, then he was 28 years old 2 years ago (i.e., at the time when Gen was born). Therefore, Gen must have been born 2 years before Mark, which means she was born 28 + 2 = 30 years ago. Hence, Gen's age is 30 years.
Response:  We know that Team A has four members who can run 400 meters in 55 seconds each, and Team B has three members who can run 400 meters in 60 seconds each.  To find out how many seconds it will take for Team B to complete their race, we need to calculate the time taken by each member of Team B to cover 100 meters (since they are running 400 meters).  The distance between two consecutive members of Team B is 100 meters, so the time taken by each member to cover this distance is: Time = Distance / Speed = 100 m / 60 s = 1.67 s Now, let's consider the total time taken by all three members of Team B to cover 400 meters: Total Time = Time taken by first member + Time taken by second member + Time taken by third member = 1.67 s + 1.67 s + 2.33 s = 5.67 s Therefore, it will take Team B 5.67 seconds to complete their race.  Since Team A has already completed their race in 55 seconds, we can conclude that Team B will finish their race in 5.67 - 55 = 49.33 seconds slower than Team A.
Response:  We know that there are six birds in total and each bird has two eggs. So, we have a total of $6 \times 2 = 12$ eggs. Now, we want to find out how many eggs can be rolled by one bird in one pankti (i.e., round number). Since there are three birds rolling eggs simultaneously, we need to divide the total number of eggs by $3$. Therefore, the number of eggs that one bird can roll in one pankti is $\frac{12}{3} = 4$.
Response:  Jenna and her mother together have 40 seeds in their garden (since Jenna has more than half of them). If they get 20 additional seeds, then:  Jenna gets 10 seeds (as she already had 15) + 20 = 30 seeds. Her mother gets 20 seeds. So, in total, they have 30 + 20 = 50 seeds.
Response:  We know that there are 4 types of animals in the shop - cats, dogs, horses and hamssters. Each type has its own box with a certain number of pieces inside.  The cat box contains 3 pieces, the dog box contains 6 pieces, the horse box contains 20 pieces and the hamster box contains 5 pieces.  Now, let's assume that there are x pieces of each type of animal in total. Since we know that the total number of pieces is less than or equal to 160, we can write an inequality equation as follows:  x + 3x + 6x + 20x <= 160  Simplifying the equation, we get:  x + 3x + 6x + 20x = 160  Combining like terms, we get: 7x = 160  Dividing both sides by 7, we get:  x = 22  Therefore, there are 22 pieces of each type of animal in the shop.
Response:  Mandi gave Benedic $100 with an agreement of 2% monthly interest for 3 months. To calculate how much Benedic should give to Mandi after 3 months, we need to use the formula: Total amount = Principal x (Interest rate / Number of periods) So, in this case, the principal is $100, the interest rate is 2%, and the number of periods is 3 months. Therefore, the total amount that Benedic should give to Mandi after 3 months is: Total amount = $100 x (2% / 3 months) = $100 x 0.067 = $6.70 So, Benedic needs to give $6.70 to Mandi after 3 months.
Response:  The farmer sells each bag of wheat for $20, and the wholesaler buys all bags at $30 per bag. So, the total amount paid to the wholesaler is: Total Amount = Number of Bags x Price Per Bag = 20 x $30 = $600 Now, if the wholesaler makes a profit of $100 on each bag (i.e., $40 per bag), then the total profit made from selling all bags is: Profit = Total Amount x Profit Per Bag = $600 x $40 = $2400 Therefore, the wholesaler sold 24 bags in total.
Response:  Three friends have spent $20.25 each for three tickets. So they have collectively spent $61.75 ($20.25 x 3). Now, they have spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, so they have spent $57.25 on food ($61.75 - $4.50 = $57.25). Since they are equally divided among themselves, each friend has spent $19.08 on food ($57.25 / 3 = $19.08).
Response:  John can eat three meals in one hour. So he eats 3 x 1 = 3 meals per hour. Now, he can eat two meals in one minute. Therefore, he eats 2 x 60 = 120 meals per hour. Since he eats for 3 hours, he eats a total of 3 x 3 = 9 meals.  Hence, John eats 9 meals in total.
Response:  We know that bats need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per day to survive. If there are 10 bats in total, then they will need to eat 35 pounds (10 x 3.5) of insects per day.
Response:  Tom plants 10 trees every year and cuts down 2 trees each year. So after 10 years, he has planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees. After another 10 years (i.e., 20 years since he started), he has cut down 2 x 20 = 40 trees, leaving him with 100 - 40 = 60 trees. Now, in the next 10 years (i.e., 30 years since he started), 30% of the remaining trees die, which is 60 x 0.3 = 18 trees. Therefore, after 30 years, Tom has 60 - 18 = 42 trees left.
Response:  On Saturday (Shukravar), 18 red plastic flowers were placed in front of Su.  On Monday (Ravivar), 18 more red plastic flowers were taken from Su and given to the new red plastic flower that was brought back. So, there were 36 red plastic flowers outside Su's house at Ravivar evening.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many pents she wants to buy. Since she has mentioned that she wants to buy 5 different colored pens, and each pen costs $2, then she needs to spend $10 (5 x $2). So, there will be a change of $10.
Response:  We know that one penny costs $0.01 and one rubber band costs $0.003. So, if we want to find out how many pennies it takes to equal the price of one rubber band, we can divide their prices: $0.01 / $0.003 = 333 pennies. Therefore, 8 pens cost $8 x $0.01 = $0.80, which is less than the price of one rubber band ($0.003). So, you would need more than 8 pens to equal the price of one rubber band.
Response:  We have 40 restaurants in a certain city and each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of gas per day. So, the total amount of gas required for all 40 restaurants is 800 pounds (40 x 2 = 80). Now, we are told that only 200 pounds of gas will be available. Therefore, 60 restaurants (800 - 200 = 60) will not get any gas.
Response:  We know that there are 23786 people living in Sooda city and among them, 8417 are males and 9092 are females. Since the number of children is less than half of the total population, we can say that the number of children = (Total Population / 2) x (Number of Males + Number of Females). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Children = (23786 / 2) x (8417 + 9092) = 1589 Children Therefore, there are approximately 1589 children living in Sooda city.
Response:  Initially, Ellen had 20 Pokemon cards. After one month, she added three more cards to her collection, making it 23 cards in total. Then, in the next month, she sold 15 of those cards, leaving her with 8 cards. Finally, in the third month, she bought back 5 of the cards she previously sold, bringing her total number of Pokemon cards to 13. So, the final number of Pokemon cards that Ellen has is 13.
Response:  Mark edits 1000 words per week and each word is priced at $0.05. Therefore, Mark earns $50 per week (1000 x $0.05). Now, let's calculate how much Mark earns in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so Mark earns $200 per month ($50 x 4). Finally, to find out how much Mark earns in a year, we multiply his monthly income by 12 months. So, Mark earns $2400 per year ($200 x 12).
Response:  The water tank can hold 50 liters of water at a time. So, in one day, it will receive 5 x 2 = 10 liters of water in the morning and 6 x 2 = 12 liters of water in the evening. Therefore, the total amount of water received by the tank in a day is 10 + 12 = 22 liters.
Response:  John earned $2000 in one week and received a bonus of $5000 once a year. The bonus amount has been increased by 5% every year. So, if he earned $2000 in one week for 52 weeks in a year, his total earnings would be: Total earnings = Weekly income x Number of weeks in a year = $2000 x 52 = $104,000 If he received a bonus of $5000 once a year, his total earnings including the bonus would be: Total earnings including bonus = Total earnings + Bonus = $104,000 + $5000 = $109,000 Therefore, John earned $109,000 in that particular year.
Response:  We know that Josie has 10 acres of land and produces 5 tons of potatoes per acre per year. Therefore, she produces 50 tons of potatoes (5 x 10) per year from her entire land area. Now, we are told that each ton of potatoes yields 2 barrels of liquor. So, the total amount of liquor produced from all the potatoes grown in Josie's 10 acres is:  Total liquor production = Number of tons of potatoes x Number of barrels of liquor per ton = 50 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of liquor per year.
Response:  We know that in one week, he took three sandwiches for lunch every day and two slices of pizza per sandwich. So, in total, he had 3 x 7 = 21 sandwiches during the week. Now, we need to find out how many slices of pizza he had. Since each slice of pizza was larger than an apple, he had 8 slices of pizza per sandwich. Therefore, the total number of slices of pizza he had is 21 sandwiches x 8 slices/sandwich = 168 slices of pizza.
Response:  Jennet had 22 green and 10 pink notes initially. Then he bought 6 green bags containing 9 notes each and 2 red bags containing 6 notes each. So, in total, Jennet has 22 + 6 = 28 green notes and 10 + 2 = 12 pink notes.
Response:  Shri Bart gives exams to students every semester and awards scores based on their performance in each exam. The maximum score that Shri Bart can award is 100. If Brainy scores less than or equal to 86 in any of the first five exams, he will get a chance to take the sixth exam to try to improve his score. So, if Brainy scores exactly 86 in any of those exams, then he cannot take the sixth exam to improve his score further. Now let's analyze the given information:  Exam 1: Brainy scored 89 out of 100. This means that Brainy has already reached his maximum score of 100 in this exam. Therefore, he cannot take the sixth exam to improve his score further.  Exam 2: Brainy scored 71 out of 100. This means that Brainy still has a chance to improve his score in the sixth exam.  Exam 3: Brainy scored 92 out of 100. This also means that Brainy still has a chance to improve his score in the sixth exam.  Exam 4: Brainy scored 100 out of 100. This means that Brainy has already reached his maximum score of 100 in this exam, just like in the first exam. Therefore, he cannot take the sixth exam to improve his score further.  Exam 5: Brainy scored 86 out of 100. This means that Brainy still has a chance to improve his score in the sixth exam. Based on these observations, we can conclude that Brainy needs at least 14 marks (i.e., 100 - 86) to pass the sixth exam and achieve a total score of 100. Therefore, the required number of marks for Brainy to pass the sixth exam is 14.
Response:  In one week (7 days), Michael rode his bike for a total of 5 times or 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers. Then he took a break of 3 days and resumed riding again for another 4 days, covering a distance of 4 x 60 = 240 kilometers. So in total, Michael covered a distance of 125 + 240 = 365 kilometers during the entire period of 8 days.
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candies in the bag. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candy, so the weight of each chocolate bar is 40 grams x 2 = 80 grams. Therefore, the total weight of all the items in the bag is:  Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 x 80 = 2000 grams Total weight of candies = 80 x 1 = 80 grams Total weight of both = 2000 + 80 = 2080 grams So, the weight of one candy in grams is:  Weight of one candy = Total weight of both / Number of candies = 2080 / 80 = 26 grams
Response:  On Monday (Somvar), she bought 4 kg of sugar. On Tuesday (Mangalwar), she went to another shop and bought 3 more kg of sugar. So, in total, she bought 7 kg of sugar on these two days (Monday + Tuesday). Now, let's calculate how many kg of sugar she bought on each of the next three days (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday):  On Wednesday, she didn't go to any shop, so she didn't buy anything. On Thursday, she went to another shop and bought 5 kg of sugar. So, in total, she bought 5 + 7 = 12 kg of sugar on these four days (Wednesday + Thursday + Monday + Tuesday). Finally, on Friday, she bought 3 more kg of sugar, so in total, she bought 12 + 3 = 15 kg of sugar during these five days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each drum costs $ 1200 and is sold for $ 6000. So, the profit per drum = Selling price - Cost price = $ 6000 - $ 1200 = $ 4800. Now, to find out how much money the company saves by buying one drum instead of two, we need to calculate the cost of buying one drum at a time. The cost of buying one drum = Profit per drum x Number of drums saved = $ 4800 x 1 = $ 4800. Therefore, the total amount saved by buying one drum instead of two = Total cost of buying two drums - Cost of buying one drum = $ 12000 - $ 4800 = $ 7200.
Response:  Firstly, Sara has $30 to spend on the jacket and two pairs of shoes. She wants to buy them from four different sellers at different prices.  The prices are given as follows:  Jacket - $30 Shoe A - $20 Shoe B - $25 Shoe C - $35 So, if she buys one item from each seller, her total cost will be: Jacket + Shoe A + Shoe B + Shoe C = $30 + $20 + $25 + $35 = $130 Now, let's assume that she bought all these items before she started babysitting. If she had $10 earlier, then she spent $30 on the jacket and $20 on the first pair of shoes, leaving her with $50. Then, she spent $25 on the second pair of shoes, leaving her with $25. Finally, she spent $35 on the third pair of shoes, leaving her with nothing. Therefore, the number of times she could have bought an item from each seller is: Number of times she could have bought from each seller = Total amount left after buying each item / Price of the item = $25 / $20 = 1.25  x 4 = 5 times Number of times she could have bought from each seller = 5 So, Sara could have bought five items from each of the four sellers.
Response:  We know that in every day, Jerry eats 42 ants.  And we also know that lizards eat 3 ants each day and bees eat 5 ants each day. So, if there are more than two lizards or bees in front of Jerry, then he will have to share his food with them. Now, let's calculate how many lizards and bees are in front of Jerry. If there are x lizards in front of Jerry, then he has to share his food with them, so he will have (42 - 3x) ants left for himself. Similarly, if there are y bees in front of Jerry, then he has to share his food with them too, so he will have (42 - 5y) ants left for himself. Now, we can set up the equation: (42 - 3x) + (42 - 5y) = 0... (1) Now, we need to find out what values of x and y satisfy this equation. To do this, we can use algebraic manipulation and solve for x and y. Solving for x, we get: x = 6... (2) And solving for y, we get: y = 8... (3) Therefore, if there are 6 lizards and 8 bees in front of Jerry, then he has to share his food with them, so he will have 30 ants left for himself.
Response:  The distance of the path is 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles. If it takes 3 minutes to cover each mile, then it will take 9/3 = 3 minutes to cover the entire path. So, the person can walk for 3 minutes.
Response:  On day 1, Slone allowed 100 customers to enter the store. If he had 50 more customers than the previous day, then the number of customers on day 2 = 100 + 50 = 150. Now, if there were 500 customers in total over the three days, then the number of customers on each day = Total customers / Number of days = 500 / 3 = 167. So, on the third day (day 3), Slone allowed 167 customers to enter the store.
Response:  At first, there were two pots with equal capacity (4 gallons each). In one pot, water increased by 2 gallons in 4 minutes, and in the other pot, water decreased by 1 gallon in 4 minutes. Now, in the big pot, there are 4 gallons of water more than the small pot. So, the current amount of water in the small pot is 3 gallons (4 - 1 = 3).
Response:  Lorrie wants to buy a pair of shoes worth $320 and a belt worth $32. The total cost is $352. Since she gets paid per hour, let's assume her hourly wage is $75 (which is a rough estimate). Now, we need to calculate how many hours she will work before buying the items. We can do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage: Number of hours = Total Cost / Hourly Wage = $352 / $75 = 4.6 hours So, Lorrie will have to work for approximately 4.6 hours to afford the shoes and the belt.
Response:  Jennet has given $2000 to someone and promised an additional 10% of that amount as interest for 12 months at a monthly rate of $165. So, after 12 months, the total amount due to the person would be: Total Amount = Principal + Interest = $2000 + ($2000 x 10%) + ($2000 x 12% x 12) = $2320 + $240 + $2768 = $5338 Now, if Jennet pays back $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount paid back would be: Total Paid Back = Monthly Payment x Number of Months = $165 x 12 = $2000 So, the remaining amount due to the person after paying back $2000 is: Remaining Amount Due = Total Amount - Total Paid Back = $5338 - $2000 = $3338
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the vase and seven more outside it, making a total of eleven flowers in the room (four + seven = eleven). So, the answer is eleven.
Response:  Age of Edrian = 3 years more than age of Heirite.  Age of Heirite = 21 years old (as given in the question). So, Age of Edrian = 24 years old.
Response:  We know that there are four students - नाओमी (Namoi), यूरी (Urry), ब्रायना (Brainna), and जोजो (Jojo).  We also know that they played a board game and scored a total of 251 points.  Of these, Namoi scored 68 points, Urry scored 10 more than Namoi, Brainna scored 17 more than Namoi, and Jojo scored the remaining points. So, we can write an equation based on this information as follows:  Namoi + Urry + Brainna + Jojo = 251  Now, let's solve for Jojo's score. Since Urry scored 10 more than Namoi, Urry's score is 68 + 10 = 78 points. Similarly, since Brainna scored 17 more than Namoi, Brainna's score is 68 + 17 = 85 points. Therefore, Jojo's score is equal to the remaining points minus the scores of Urry and Brainna: 251 - 78 - 85 = 98 points. So, Jojo scored 98 points in the board game.
Response:  Karmen took 10 minutes to complete one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to complete one Sudoku puzzle. In a week, he completed 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles. Therefore, the total time taken by Karmen to solve all these puzzles in a week is: Total Time = (Number of Crossword Puzzles x Time per Puzzle) + (Number of Sudoku Puzzles x Time per Puzzle) Total Time = (3 x 10) + (8 x 5) Total Time = 30 + 40 Total Time = 70 minutes.
Response:  Initially, the tank was filled with 120 liters of water. Then, Selina took out 90 liters of water from the tank to fill her small pots. So, the remaining amount of water in the tank is: 120 - 90 = 30 liters. Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank.
Response:  We have to find out how many flowers will be planted in total if 90 jerrycans and 40 petunias are used. So, we need to calculate the number of flowers that can be planted in each jerrycan and then multiply it with the number of jerrycans used.  To do this, we first need to know how much space each flower takes up. According to the information given in the passage, one jerrycan contains 120 plants of marigold or 60 plants of petunia. Therefore, we can assume that one jerrycan has a capacity of 120/60 = 2 plants of petunia or 3 plants of marigold. Now, let's calculate the total number of flowers that can be planted in 90 jerrycans: Total no. of jerrycans = 90 No. of plants per jerrycan = 2 (for petunia) or 3 (for marigold) So, total no. of plants = Total no. of jerrycans x No. of plants per jerrycan = 90 x 2 = 180 plants for petunia or 90 x 3 = 270 plants for marigold Finally, we need to convert these numbers into actual flowers. Since there are approximately 5-6 flowers in every pot, we can estimate that around 30-40 flowers will be planted in each jerrycan. So, the total number of flowers that will be planted is: Total no. of flowers = Total no. of plants x Number of flowers per plant = 180 (petunia) or 270 (marigold) x 30-40 = 5400-7400 flowers (approximately) Therefore, based on the calculation above, the answer to the question is approximately 5400-7400 flowers.

Response:  Karlos takes 30 dollars per hour to operate his canoe and Benji takes 18 dollars per hour to operate his kayak. If Karlos works for 3 hours and Benji works for 5 hours, their total earnings will be: Karlos's earnings = $3 x 3 = $9 Benji's earnings = $18 x 5 = $90 Total earnings = $9 + $90 = $99 So, they will earn a total of $99 between them.
Response:  The distance between Andhra Pradesh and Rochester is approximately 1500 km (as per Google Maps). Now, if they take 6 days to travel from Hyderabad to New Jersey and then another 3 days to reach Rochester, it means they will cover a total distance of 1800 km in 9 days (6 + 3 = 9). So, the person will have traveled for approximately 200 km per day (1800 km / 9 days) during their road trip.
Response:  We know that Jamie has 30 cards of different types - water, fire, earth, air, and wood. Each card represents one element. So, if he gives away 8 water cards, he will have 30 - 8 = 22 cards left. Similarly, if he buys 14 cards of earth type, he will have 22 - 14 = 7 cards left. Now, we need to find out what percentage of the original number of cards Jamie has is left with him after giving away some cards and buying new ones. To do this, we can use the formula: Percentage = (Remaining cards / Original number of cards) x 100% The original number of cards was 30, so we can plug in the values: Percentage = (22 / 30) x 100% = 73.33% Therefore, Jamie has 73.33% of his original number of cards left with him after giving away some cards and buying new ones.
Response:  The total cost of the meal is $6.50 + ($2 x 2) = $8.50.  He has already paid $2 for additional meat and vegetables, so he still owes $6.50 - $2 = $4.50. Since he has a gift card worth $5, he can pay the remaining amount of $4.50 using the gift card, leaving him with no balance due. Therefore, he is not indebted anymore.
Response:  Kalinda has to make 360 piles of 4 tukdes each in one minute. Her mother can do it in half a minute (1/2) = 90 seconds per pile. So, total time taken by Kalinda is: Total Time = Number of Piles / Time taken to make one pile x Speed = 360 / 90 x 4 = 72 minutes.
Response:  We know that 120 babies were born in a farmland and out of them, 30% (36) were ready for cultivation after two months. So, the number of babies ready for cultivation was 36. Now, we are told that three babies died after being taken home. Therefore, the remaining number of babies ready for cultivation was 36 - 3 = 33. Finally, we are asked how many babies were not ready for cultivation after two months. Since all the babies who died were not ready for cultivation, the answer is 33 - 3 = 30. Therefore, there were 30 babies not ready for cultivation after two months.
Response:  Mark buys 12 cars for his company at an average price of $20,000 each. Therefore, he spends a total of $240,000 (12 x $20,000).  Then, he applies a discount of 10% to all the cars and reduces their prices by $20,000 each, resulting in a new price of $18,000 per car ($20,000 - $2,000 = $18,000). So, he pays a total of $216,000 (12 x $18,000) for the cars.  After that, he gives a further discount of $1,000 to each car and pays $17,000 ($18,000 - $1,000 = $17,000) for each one. In total, he pays $232,000 ($17,000 x 12) for all 12 cars.
Response:  On Sunday (Kailee), Robert scored 5 more goals than Kailee. So, Kailee scored 20 goals.  On Monday (Mangalwar), Kailee scored twice as many goals as she did on Sunday (Somvar). Therefore, Kailee scored 40 goals on Mangalwar.  Hence, the answer is 40.
Response:  We know that there are 50 chickens in the farmer's field and each chicken lays an average of 2 eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs laid by all the chickens in one day is:  Number of chickens = 50  Average eggs per chicken per day = 2  Total number of eggs laid per day = Number of chickens x Average eggs per chicken per day = 50 x 2 = 100 eggs Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid by all the chickens in the farmer's field over a period of time (e.g., a week). Suppose it takes 7 days for all the chickens to lay their eggs. Then, the total number of eggs laid by all the chickens in the farmer's field over a week is: Total number of eggs laid per week = Total number of eggs laid per day x Number of days in a week = 100 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 700 eggs So, there are approximately 700 eggs laid by all the chickens in the farmer's field over a week.
Response:  There are 36 penguins in total. Among them, one goes to sea and comes back at night to eat its dinner. Another one goes inside an iceberg and stays there for some time. So, out of these 36 penguins, how many are still in the water? We can assume that all the penguins who went to sea or inside the iceberg will come back after their respective activities. Therefore, the number of penguins still in the water is equal to the original number minus the number of penguins that went to sea or inside the iceberg. In this case, the original number of penguins was 36, so we need to subtract the number of penguins that went to sea or inside the iceberg from 36. Since one penguin went to sea and came back at night to eat its dinner, the number of penguins that went to sea is 1. Similarly, since another penguin went inside an iceberg and stayed there for some time, the number of penguins that went inside the iceberg is also 1. Therefore, the total number of penguins that left the water is 2 (1 + 1). Now, let's calculate the number of penguins still in the water: Number of penguins still in the water = Original number - Number of penguins that left the water = 36 - 2 = 34 So, out of the initial 36 penguins, 34 are still in the water.
Response:  Steve has eaten more than 10 tomatoes and has made up his mind to eat them every day. He shares his love with his wife, who also loves tomatoes. They both eat 2 tomatoes each per day. If one ball can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then how many balls are required to fulfill their demand of tomatoes? Solution: To calculate the number of balls needed to fulfill their demand of tomatoes, we need to divide the total daily requirement of tomatoes (2 x 2 = 4 tomatoes) by the production capacity of each ball (3 tomatoes/week). Therefore, the number of balls required is: Number of balls = Total daily requirement of tomatoes / Production capacity of each ball = 4 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/week = 1.33 balls So, approximately 1.33 balls are required to fulfill their demand of tomatoes.
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends and John wants to distribute 4 slips each among them. Since pizzas are available in 8 slices only, we need to divide 4 into 8. So, John needs to distribute 5 pizzas (4 / 8 = 5).
Response:  Ram has 5 pennies and he uses them to make a complete rupee coin. Now, if he buys 25 pens worth Rs. 10 each, how many pens will he have after that transaction?  We know that one pen costs Rs. 10 / 5 = Rs. 2, so 25 pens cost Rs. 2 x 25 = Rs. 50. Therefore, after buying 25 pens, Ram will have (Rs. 50 - Rs. 5) = Rs. 45 left with him.
Response:  John had $20 in his pocket and gave $10 to someone else. So he has $10 left with him. Now, after one year, if the amount of money that he invested grew at a rate of 3 times, then the total amount of money he had after one year would be $30 (3 x $10). Therefore, after one year, John had $30 in his pocket.
Response:  Maari's age is less than two years, and Jesa's age is five years more than twice Maari's age. So, Jesa's age = 2 x Maari's age + 5 =?  Now, we know that Jesa's age is 20 years. Therefore, Maari's age = 18 years (since Jesa's age - Maari's age = 20 - 18 = 2).
Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in the school and they have to go out through three gates - gate A, gate B, and gate C.  After a meeting, 30% of the students went out through gate A, which means 300 students went out through gate A.  Now, we need to find out how many students went out through each of the remaining two gates (gate B and gate C).  Since 70% of the students did not go out through gate A, the number of students who went out through gate B is 70% of 900 = 630 students. Similarly, since 40% of the students did not go out through gate B, the number of students who went out through gate C is 40% of 630 = 252 students. Therefore, the total number of students who went out through gate C is 252 students. So, the total number of students who went out of the school after the meeting is 300 + 630 + 252 = 1182 students.
Response:  James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, if James has x candies, then Robert has x - 6 candies.  Now, we are told that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, if John has y candies, then Robert has y / 2 candies.  Finally, we are told that John has 54 candies in total. Therefore, the number of candies John has is 54 = y / 2 + (x - 6). Solving for x, we get x = 30. So, John has 30 + 6 = 36 more candies than James.
"Response:  We know that Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book. If they both read each other's books as well as their own books, then the total number of books they will have read at the end is:

Dolly's books + Pandora's book = 2 + 1 = 3

So, in total, Dolly and Pandora will have read 3 books each."
Response:  We know that there are 5 friends and they write letters to each other once in 7 days. So, in one week, they will write 5 x 7 = 35 letters. Since each letter is of 5 pages long, in one week, they will write 35 x 5 = 175 pages. Now, we know that each friend writes for 6 minutes per day. In one week, therefore, each friend will have written 175 pages / 6 minutes/day = 2916 minutes worth of content. Therefore, in one week, each friend will have written approximately 2916 minutes or 48 hours worth of content.
Response:  Jesson has 1000 minutes in a month and he spends 15 minutes per day talking to his boss. So, he talks for 15 x 30 = 450 minutes in a month with his boss. Now, there are 30 days in the month, so he has 450 / 30 = 15 minutes extra each day that he can use for other activities or calls. Therefore, Jesson has 15 + 15 = 30 additional minutes per day, which is equivalent to 450 minutes in a month.
Response:  Grifin had 24 franchises initially and Kalil took 5 of them away from him. Billie gave Grifin back 3 more franchises than what Kalil took. Colby then took 3 fewer franchises from Grifin than what Kalil took. If Grifin had 27 franchises at the end, then Jinjer gave him how many franchises?  Solution:  We can start by using the information that Kalil took 5 franchises away from Grifin initially. So, Grifin had 24 - 5 = 19 franchises left. Then, Billie gave Grifin back 3 more franchises than what Kalil took, so she gave him 3 + 5 = 8 additional franchises. Finally, Colby took 3 fewer franchises from Grifin than what Kalil took, so he took 3 - x = 4 franchises (where x is the number of franchises taken by Kalil). Therefore, the total number of franchises Grifin had at the end is 19 + 8 + 4 = 31 franchises. Now, if Grifin had 27 franchises at the end, then Jinjer gave him 27 - 31 = -4 franchises.
Response:  In one mansion, there are 4 birds and in another mansion, there are 32 birds. If we compare the number of birds between both mansions, then the difference is 32 - 4 = 28 birds. So, each mansion has 28 birds.
Response:  Genius Makeup Artist charged $250 per hour for his services. For one film, he needed to work for 6 hours per day and 4 days in a week, making it a total of 24 hours per week. Since the film took 5 weeks to complete, the makeup artist worked for a total of 120 hours (24 x 5). Now, since the makerup artist gave a discount of 10%, he earned $9600 ($1200 x 80%) as total payment from the client. So, the amount that Genius Makeup Artist received was $9600.
Response:  * Ishabel gave Rs. 12 as gift for party expenses (including decoration, cake, and gifts). So, she spent Rs. 12 x 3 = Rs. 36 on her sister's birthday celebrations.  * She also spent Rs. 43 on gifts for her sister's friends, which is equal to Rs. 43 / 3 = Rs. 14 per person. Since there were three friends, she spent a total of Rs. 14 x 3 = Rs. 42 on gifts.  * For her mother's birthday, she spent Rs. 15 on sweets, which is equal to Rs. 15 / 3 = Rs. 5 per person. Since there were three mothers, she spent a total of Rs. 5 x 3 = Rs. 15 on sweets.  * She spent Rs. 4 on invitation cards, which is equal to Rs. 4 / 3 = Rs. 1.33 per person. Since there were three parties, she spent a total of Rs. 1.33 x 3 = Rs. 3.99 on invitation cards.  * Finally, she spent Rs. 22 on goodie bags for the guests, which is equal to Rs. 22 / 3 = Rs. 7.33 per person. Since there were three parties, she spent a total of Rs. 7.33 x 3 = Rs. 21.99 on goodie bags. Therefore, in total, Ishabel spent Rs. 36 + Rs. 42 + Rs. 15 + Rs. 3.99 + Rs. 21.99 = Rs. 108.87 on her sister's birthday celebrations.
Response:  The shelf has bought 4 bags of pajamas, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of all four bags is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since one pound of pajamas costs $1.50, the total cost of all four bags would be 4 x $1.50 = $6. Now, if the shelf has bought 4 bags, then it means that he has spent $6 to buy those bags. Therefore, the answer is $6.
Response:  On Sunday (Somvar), Soham consumed 4 more kukis than his sister. Therefore, he consumed 4 + 4 = 8 kukis in total.  On Monday (Mangalwar), he consumed 2 more kukis than his sister, so he consumed 2 + 4 = 6 kukis in total.  In total, Soham consumed 8 + 6 = 14 kukis.  Now, if one kuki contains 200 calories, then Soham consumed 14 x 200 = 2800 calories more than his sister.
