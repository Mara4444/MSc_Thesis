Response:  We know that Janet lays 16 eggs per day. She eats three eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends four times a day. So she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left after breakfast. Then we have 13 eggs x $2/egg = $26 daily income from selling at the farmers market. Therefore, Janet earns $26 per day on the farmers market.
Response:  We know that en kappe (a cap) requires two blue fibers and half of the white fiber. So, we need to find out how many blue fibers are required first. Since there are 10 blue fibers in total, we can say that one blue fiber is equal to 2/10 = 0.2 bolts. Therefore, we need 0.2 x 2 = 0.4 bolts of blue fibers for the cap. Now, since the white fiber is half of what it takes for the blue fibers, we need 0.4 x 0.5 = 0.2 bolts of white fiber. So, the final answer is 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6 bolts.
Response:  The original price of the house is $80,000 and he spent $50,000 on repairs, so the total amount he invested in the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. After making the repairs, the increased value of the house is 150%, which means that the new value of the house is $150,000 / 150% = $100,000. So, the profit he made from selling the house is $100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000.
"Response:  If James runs three sprints per week and each sprint is 60 meters long, then he will run a total distance of:

3 x 60 = 180 meters per week

So, in one week, James will have run a total distance of 180 meters."
"Response:  We know that each day Wendi feeds her chickens with three bowls of mixed feed containing grains, vegetables, and proteins to keep them healthy. She divides the food into three meals per day. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she adds another 25 bowls of food. To calculate how many bowls of food Wendi should give her chickens in the last meal of the day if her flock consists of 20 chickens, we need to use the information provided in the question. So, the number of bowls of food Wendi should give her chickens in the last meal of the day is:

15 + 25 = 40

Therefore, Wendi should give her chickens 40 bowls of food in their last meal of the day."
"Response:  If one glass costs $5, then each subsequent glass costs $\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$ dollars. Therefore, if Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will pay:

$$16 \times 2.5 = 40\text{ dollars}$$
So Kylar will pay $40 for the 16 glasses of wine."
Response:  We know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston and four times as many as Seattle. So if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Toulouse has 4 x 2 = 8 sheep more than Seattle. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is: 8 + 20 + 20 = 68 sheep.
"Response: 
Carla can download 2 GB per minute, so it will take her:

$ \text{Time = Total size / Download rate} $

Total size of the file is 200 GB, so:

$$\text{Time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute} = 100 minutes $$

Therefore, Carla needs to start downloading the file from the beginning in approximately 100 minutes."
"Response: 
Step 1 (John drives for three hours with a speed of 100 km/h):
Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/h x 3 hours = 300 km
Step 2 (John turns around and heads back home after realizing he forgot something important):
Time spent driving backwards = 2 hours
Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 2 hours = 60 miles
New total distance = Total distance from Step 1 + Distance from Step 2 = 300 km + 60 miles = 360 kilometers / 1.60934 miles per kilometer = approximately 225 miles
Therefore, John is approximately 225 miles away from his destination after four hours of driving."
Response:  We know that Elisa's time rate per hour is $10 and she receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly wage. If she worked 45 hours in this week, we can calculate her total income as follows: Total Income = Time Rate x Number of Hours Worked + Overtime Pay x Number of Hours Worked So, Total Income = $10 x 45 + ($10 x 45) x 1.2 = $450 + $540 = $990 This means that Eliza's total income for this week is $990.
Response:  In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. If in the second month, it had three times as many downloads (i.e., 180 downloads), then in total, it would have 240 downloads (60 + 180). However, if in the third month, there was a 30% decrease in downloads, then the number of downloads would be 172 (240 x 0.7 = 172). Therefore, the program had 172 downloads in all during those three months.
"Response: 
Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen = $204.
She also bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen = $160.
Finally, she bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen = $330.
So, in total, Toula spent $690 on all the pastries."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree over its lifespan. The cost of planting is $90, plus $3 per year for maintenance = $93. Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling citrons. Each year, seven citrons will be produced, and each one can be sold for $1.50. So, the annual revenue is $10.50 (7 x $1.50). To find out how many years it will take to break even, we divide the initial investment ($93) by the annual revenue ($10.50): $$ \frac {93}{10.50} = 9 \text{ years} $$ Therefore, it will take approximately 9 years for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree.
Response:  We know that Melanie sold one third of her vacuum cleaners to Green House, two to Red House and half of what was left to Orange House. So, if she had five vacuum cleaners left, then she must have started with 15 (5 x 3 = 15).
Response:  We know that out of 20 students in the dance class, 20% are signed up for modern dance and 25% of the remaining students are signed up for jazz dance. This means that 20/100 = 20% of the students are signed up for jazz dance. Therefore, the number of students signed up for hip hop is equal to 100 - (20 + 20) = 100 - 40 = 60%. So, 60% of the students in the dance class are signed up for hip hop.
"Response:  If we assume that the market price of jewelry will increase by 2.5% and the market price of electronic devices will increase by 1.2% within the same month, then...
Step 1: Calculate the new prices of each item after the expected price increase.
Jewelry: $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125
Electronic Devices: $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,192
Step 2: Compare the new prices of both items to determine which one would provide the highest profit margin if purchased.
Highest Profit Margin = Highest Selling Price - Lowest Purchase Price
For Jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
For Electronic Devices: $8,192 - $8,000 = $192
Therefore, based on these calculations, it would be more profitable for the merchant to purchase electronics worth $8,192 instead of jewelry worth $5,125, resulting in a higher profit margin of $300 ($192 - $125)."
"Response:  On day one, both trains travel westward and cover 130 kilometers (80 miles). The next day, they travel northward and cover 150 miles (241 kilometers). So, the distance traveled by each train in two days is:
Day 1: 130 km + 130 km = 260 km (162 miles)
Day 2: 150 mi + 150 mi = 300 mi (483 kilometers)"
"Response: 
Jill works as an instructor and a coach for 35 hours per week. Her hourly wage is $20 for teaching and $30 for coaching. If she works 50 weeks per year, her total annual income would be:
Annual income = Total hours worked x Hourly wage
= 35 hours/week x $20/hour + 15 hours/week x $30/hour
= 700 hours x $20/hour + 450 hours x $30/hour
= $14,000 + $13,500
= $27,500 per year
Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $27,500."
Response:  If Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning for breakfast, she will have eaten 3 x 21 = 63 eggs in one week (7 days). Therefore, over 4 weeks (28 days), she will have eaten 63 x 4 = 252 eggs.
Response:  We know that Marissa walked for 12 miles in total and it took her one hour to walk the first four miles. So, she walked at a pace of 4 km/h during those four miles. Then, she walked another two miles in one hour, which means she walked at a pace of 3 km/h during those two miles. Therefore, if she wants to maintain an average speed of 6 km/h throughout her journey, she needs to walk at a pace of 5 km/h during the remaining distance of eight miles.
Response:  We have 10 liters of apple juice that is two-thirds water and 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three-fifths water. When we mix them together, we get a total volume of 29 liters (10 + 15). If we then pour out one liter of the mixture, we are left with 28 liters (29 - 1). So there are 28 liters of liquid remaining in the container after pouring out one liter.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Raymond was born six years before Samantha. So, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond must have been born when Samantha was 25 years old (6 + 25 = 31).
Now, we know that Raymond had a son who is 23 years old. So, the difference between their ages is 23 - 25 = -2 years.
Therefore, Raymonde's son must have been born two years ago (i.e., at the age of 23)."
"Response: 
Step 1: The first three customers buy one each, so that's 3 DVDs total.
Step 2: The next two customers buy 2 each, so that's another 4 DVDs total (for a total of 7).
Step 3: The last three customers don't buy any DVDs, so there are no additional sales for a total of 7 DVDs sold on Tuesday.
Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
Response:  The smelter burns with a speed of 2 cm/min. If it starts burning at 13:00 and ends at 17:00, then we have a total time of 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00). So, in total, the smelter will move 4 x 2 = 8 cm during this period. Therefore, the answer is 8 cm.
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the latest bestseller for $19.50 with a 25% discount. To find out what was the original price of the book, we can use the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage). Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $78.00 So, the original price of the book before the discount was $78.00.
"Response:  We know that Marie paid $50 for her groceries and we have the following prices:

* Chicken meal: $12
* Package of milk: $3
* Apples: $1.50 each
* Pizza (per box): $8.50

We can start by finding out how much money Marie spent on chicken meals:

$12 x 5 = $60

Now let's find out how much money Marie spent on milk:

$3 x 5 = $15

Next, let's find out how many apples Marie bought:

$1.50 x 5 = $7.50

Finally, let's find out how many boxes of pizza Marie bought:

$8.50 x 5 = $42.50

So, Marie bought 4 boxes of pizza."
"Response: 
Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, which cost $16.50 x 3 = $49.50.
She also bought 3 pairs of pants, which cost $22.50 x 3 = $67.50.
Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes, which cost $42 x 3 = $126.
Therefore, in total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 dollars on all the clothes."
Response:  We know that Cynthia buys ice cream with 15 portions of ice cream in each case at a price of Kr. 1 per portion. Therefore, she will spend a total amount of money equal to the number of portions of ice cream she buys multiplied by the price of one portion. So if she buys 90 portions of ice cream (3 x 30), her total cost would be 90 x Kr. 1 = Kr. 90. After 60 days, she will have spent a total amount of money equal to this value.
Response:  We know that Henry stopped after 20 miles (which means he traveled for 40 miles before his first stop). Now we need to find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops. So, the distance between his first and second stops is equal to 40 - 15 = 25 miles. Therefore, the answer is 25 miles.
Response:  The first pair of heels costs $50, and the second pair costs twice as much, or $100. So, if we subtract $50 from $150 (the total cost of both pairs), we get $100. Therefore, the cost of the stilettos is $100.
Response:  We know that Darrel is 7 times older than Allen, so Darrel's age is 7x = 7 \* 11 = 77 years old. Now, we are told that their combined age is 162 years. So, Allen's age now would be 162 - 77 = 85 years old.
"Response: 
Günter has asked his friends to guess how many marmalade jars are in a jar. One of them says there are 80 jars, another one says there are 20 more than half of the first person's guess, and a third one says there are 25% more than the first person's guess.
Let's represent their answers as x, y, and z respectively. Since they all gave different numbers, we can write:
x + y + z = 80 (the total number of jars)... (1)
y > x/2 (since the second friend said there are 20 more than half of the first person's guess)... (2)
z > x + y/4 (since the third friend said there are 25% more than the first person's guess)... (3)
Now we have three equations and three variables. Can you solve for x, y, and z using substitution or elimination method?"
"Response:  Since each dog spends half an hour taking care of its business, and there are ten dogs in total, then...
Step 1: Calculate how long it takes each dog to take care of its business per day.
Time taken by each dog = Half an hour / Dog (10) = 0.5 hours/dog/day
Step 2: Now calculate the total time spent by all ten dogs taking care of their businesses per day.
Total time = Number of dogs x Time taken by each dog/dog (10 x 0.5 hours/dog/day) = 5 hours/day
Step 3: Finally, calculate the number of hours per week that John spends taking care of his dogs.
Number of hours per week = Total time/7 days (5 hours/day x 7 days/week) = 35 hours/week
Therefore, John spends approximately 35 hours per week taking care of his ten dogs."
Response:  We know that there are 110 coins in total and 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let x be the number of gold coins, we can write an equation based on the information given: 110 = x + 30 (silver coins). Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 40 (since there are 40 silver coins): x = 27. Therefore, Gretchen has 27 gold coins.
"Response:  We know that Aaron has five more juveniles than Raymon... (read more)

Solution: Let's think step by step. We know that Aaron has five more juveniles than Raymond, which means that Aaron has 5 + 40 = 45 juveniles in total. Therefore, Siobhan has 45 - 2 = 43 juveniles."
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, so he scored an average of 0.2 points per minute (4/20). Now, in the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the previous period, which means he scored (1.25 \* 0.2) = 0.25 points per minute more. Therefore, his total score is: 0.2 + 0.25 = 0.45 points. So, Mike scored 45 points in 40 minutes.
Response:  If Terry buys 4 yogurts per day and each costs $5.00, then he will spend $20.00 per day on yogurt. To find out how much he spends in 30 days, we can multiply the daily cost by 30: $20.00 x 30 = $600.00. Therefore, Terry spends $600.00 on yogurt in 30 days.
Response:  If he sold all his Lego sets and used the money to buy video games, then he would have spent $13 x 13 = $169 on Lego sets. Since he has $5 left over after buying the video games, that means he spent $169 - $5 = $164 on Lego sets. So, he still has 13 Lego sets.
"Response: 
Day 1: He runs for 3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes
Day 2: He runs for (half of 180) + (half of 180) = 90 + 90 = 180 minutes
Day 3: He runs for (half of 180) + (half of 180) = 90 + 90 = 180 minutes
Total time per week = Total time per day x Number of days = 180 minutes/day x 3 days = 540 minutes/week
Therefore, he runs at a speed of 540 minutes/week / 7 days/week = 77 minutes/day."
"Response:  If she can run four times faster than she can walk and she can jump with half of her running speed, then we know that if she runs for x hours, she will cover y miles. We are also given that she jumps at 3 miles per hour. So, in six hours, she will cover z miles if she spends three-fourths of the time running and one-fourth of the time walking.
We have two equations:
x = 4y (from the first equation)
z = 3t (given)
Now, we need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of x and t.
Solving the system of equations, we get:
x = 12t/5
t = 6h/5
So, Dana can travel 72 miles in six hours if she spends three-fourths of the time running and one-fourth of the time walking."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone and Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Suzy's iPhone. So if Suzy's iPhone is one year old, then Brandon's iPhone would be (4 x 1) = 4 years old. Therefore, the answer is 4 years old.
Response:  If Polly holds the first stone and throws the spear at a distance of 400 feet from the dragon, she can hit it three times farther than when she doesn't hold the stone. So if she hits it 1200 feet away (3 x 400 = 1200), then with the second stone, she will be able to throw the spear 1800 feet away (1200 + 600). And finally, with the third stone, she will be able to throw the spear 2400 feet away (1800 + 600). Therefore, if Polly holds the last stone, she will be able to stand 2400 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with her gold spear.
Response:  We know that five apples were cut into eight pieces each, so we have 5 x 8 = 40 apple pieces in total. Then, four guests took some of these apple pieces and put them on the buffet table for everyone to serve themselves. So, there are now 40 - 4 = 36 apple pieces left. Finally, after everyone had taken their share and put them back on the table, there are 14 apple pieces left. Therefore, the number of apple pieces that each guest took is 14 / 4 = 3.5 per guest. Since you can't take a fraction of an apple piece, each guest must have taken exactly three apple pieces.
Response:  We know that one serving of chips has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a 300g package. So, if you want to calculate how many grams of chips you can eat while staying within your daily calorie limit of 2000, we need to divide the total number of calories in the package (5 x 250 = 1250) by your daily calorie goal (2000). Therefore, you can eat approximately 1250 / 2000 = 0.625 kg or 625 grams of chips.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many stearin lights Charlie can make from one kilogram of beeswax. Since each kilogram of beeswax allows him to create 10 conical stearin lights, he can make 10 x 10 = 100 stearin lights from one kilogram of beeswax. Now let's assume that he sells each stearin light for $2. Therefore, if he sells 20 stearin lights, his total revenue will be 20 x $2 = $40. However, since he paid $10 per kilogram of beeswax, his cost is $10 x 20 = $200. So, his net profit is $40 - $200 = -$160.
"Response: 
Meredith wrote 7 articles last week (3 days).
Day 1: Monday - 5 articles took her 4 hours each = 20 hours
Day 2: Tuesday - 2 articles took her 8 hours each = 16 hours
Day 3: Wednesday - 3 articles took her 4 hours each = 12 hours
Total time spent writing articles = 20 + 16 + 12 = 48 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 48 hours writing articles last week."
Response:  We know that Candice had 80 Post-it notes in her bag before she went to work at the coffee shop. Then, when she was walking to work, she bought a pack of Post-it notes containing x sedlers. After buying the pack and using one note per cup of coffee (220 cups), she has x - 23 = 207 Post-it notes left. So, the number of Post-it notes in the pack is x = 207.
Response:  We know that John buys double the number of red shirts as blue shirts. So if he bought x blue shirts, he bought 2x red shirts. Since each red shirt costs $1 more than each blue shirt, the total cost of the red shirts is $1x + $40 = 1.1x. Therefore, John spent $1.1x on shirts in total.
"Response:  We know that Tracy used one meter of thread to support the tomato plants in her garden. Since each piece of thread was 15 cm long, we can calculate how many pieces she got as follows:

Number of pieces = Length of thread / Length of each piece
= 1 m / 0.15 m
= 7

Therefore, Tracy received 7 pieces of thread."
Response:  We know that Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. This means there are 120 apartments (15 x 8) in total. Now, we are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means 75 apartments are currently rented out (3/4 x 120 = 90). So, there are 25 vacant apartments left (120 - 75 = 25).
"Response:  If Lloyd has an egg farm and his hens produce 252 eggs per day, then he will sell them at $2 per dozen. So, how much does Lloyd earn from eggs in one week?
Weekly Egg Sales = Daily Egg Production x Number of Days in a Week
= 252 eggs/day x 7 days/week
= 1808 eggs/week
Now, let's calculate Lloyd's weekly income from eggs:
Weekly Income from Eggs = Total Number of Eggs Sold x Selling Price per Dozen
= 1808 eggs/week x $2/dozen
= $3616/week
Therefore, Lloyd earns $3616 per week from his egg sales."
"Response:  If Tom can sail with an average speed of 10 miles per hour during the daytime (from 13:00 to 16:00), he will cover a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 4 hours = 40 miles

Now, let's calculate the time it takes him to return:

Time = Distance / Speed = 40 miles / 6 miles/hour = 7 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 7 hours to come back."
Response:  If we remove 5 kg from Uriah's bag of toys, it will be lighter by that amount. Then, if each of his comic books and toys weighs half a kilogram, he will have removed 2.5 kg (half of 5) worth of items. So, if he removes 30 comics, he will need to remove 60 kg (30 x 2.5) of other items from his bag.
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired six truck tires and four car tires, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 in revenue from truck tire repair and $4 x 4 = $16 in revenue from car tire repair, for a total of $52. On Friday, the mechanic did not repair any truck tires but repaired twelve car tires, so he earned $4 x 12 = $48 in revenue from car tire repair. Therefore, the difference in income between the two days is $52 - $48 = $4 more.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question, Doubtfire-søstrene have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother then calls them to inform them that their two cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. The information provided is as follows:
Patchy has had three times as many adoptive kittens as Trixie.
Trixie has had 12 kittens.
So, if we multiply the number of kittens that Patchy has had (3 x 3 = 9) by the number of kittens that Trixie has had (12), we get the total number of kittens that Doubtfire-familien now has: 9 + 12 = 21. Therefore, Doubtfire-familien now has 21 kittens."
Response:  If Jean has 30 candies and eats two of them, he will have 28 candies left. To pack these candies into bags, he can fill each bag with 28/2 = 14 candies. Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 on tickets and $7 on popcorn each time he goes to the cinema, then he will have spent a total of $14 per trip ($7 + $7). Since he wants to know how many times he can go to the cinema with $42 in total, we need to divide $42 by $14. So, if he has $42 to spend on going to the cinema, he can go there approximately 3 times ( $42 / $14 = 3).
Response:  We know that the maximum weight of the bridge is 5000 pounds (En træbro kan ikke bære mere end 5000 pund). The total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds (Den samlede vægt af chaufføren og den tomme lastbil er 3755 pund). Now we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. To do this, we will divide the weight limit of the bridge by the weight of each box: 5000 pounds / 5 kg = 1000 boxes. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 1000 boxes.
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Stephen had $40 as his last calculation before taxes and delivery charges were added. Then, he was charged an additional 25% of $40, which is equal to $10. So, the total amount paid by Stephen after taxes was $50 ($40 + $10).
Next, we are told that there was an extra charge of $4 for drinks. Therefore, the final price of Stephen's daily necessities would be $54 ($50 + $4)."
Response:  We know that each cluster of six has 20 fruits and there are 6 clusters in total. So, we have 6 x 20 = 120 fruits from all the clusters combined. Additionally, there are 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the bush. Therefore, the total number of hindberries is 120 + 67 = 187.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 apples in total and we want to find out how many of them are good. From the information given, we can conclude that:

* 1 apple is bad (dårlig)
* 20% of the apples are unripe (u modne)
* 2 apples are sour (sur)

So, if we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour apples from the total number of apples, we will get the number of good apples.

Number of good apples = Total number of apples - Number of bad apples - Number of unripe apples - Number of sour apples
= 25 - 2 - 4 - 2
= 17

Therefore, there are 17 good apples in the curved."
"Response: 
Janet pays $500 for the material to make the bracelet and then an additional $800 to the jeweler to build it. Therefore, she paid a total of $1,300 ($500 + $800) for the bracelet.
Then, as a percentage of the total cost, she pays 10% or $130 (10% of $1,300). So, in total, Janet paid $1,430 for the bracelet ($1,300 + $130)."
Response:  If Marcy works for 40 years and then gets an annual pension of $50,000, that means she has worked for a total of 40 x 1 = 40 years. After 20 years, she has worked for a total of 40 + 20 = 60 years. Therefore, her pension after 20 years is 5% of $50,000 per year, which is equal to $2,500 per year. Now, let's calculate her annual pension after 30 years: 60 - 20 = 40 years working for the company. So, her annual pension after 30 years is $50,000 \* (1 - 0.05) = $47,500 per year.
"Response: 
First half of year (Jan - Jun): $140 x 6 = $840
Second half of year (Jul - Dec): $840 x 95/100 = $792
Total amount paid throughout the year: $840 + $792 = $1,632"
Response:  Since Sophia has driven 160 km since she last filled up and had to fill up four liters of gasoline to refill her tank, we can calculate how many kilometers she can drive on one full tank as follows: Distance = Total distance traveled / Amount of fuel left in the tank = 160 km / 40 liters = 4 km/liter So, if Sophia fills up her tank with 40 liters of gasoline, she can drive approximately 4 x 40 = 160 km. Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 160 km on one full tank of gasoline.
"Response:  If Jim watches TV for half an hour and then decides to go to bed and read for half an hour, he will spend a total of 1 hour per day watching TV and reading.
If he does this three times a week (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), he will spend 3 x 1 = 3 hours per week watching TV and reading.
Over four weeks, he will have spent a total of 3 x 4 = 12 hours watching TV and reading."
"Response:  We know that there are four schools competing in the tournament and each school has sent one boys' team and one girls' team with five players each. Therefore, we have:
Boys' teams: 4 schools x 1 boy's team per school = 4 boys' teams
Girls' teams: 4 schools x 1 girl's team per school = 4 girls' teams
Total number of people: 4 boys' teams x 5 players per team + 4 girls' teams x 5 players per team = 20 + 20 = 40 people
Therefore, all the skolers have sent a total of 40 people to compete in the tournament."
Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds in total and 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, if we assume that each of these stones has a fixed value (which is not true), then the total value of all diamonds would be $175 x 2 = $350. Similarly, the total value of all rubies would be $35 - $35 = $0. Now, let's calculate the number of smaragders as follows: Since there are double the number of smaragders as rubies, the number of smaragders must be twice 35 = 70. Therefore, the total number of ædelstene in the chest is 175 + 70 = 245.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz' school. So if there are 60 girls, then there are 120 boys (twice as many). If each teacher has 5 students, then there are 30 teachers (60 / 5 = 30). Therefore, there are 30 teachers at Dr. Wertz' school.
Response:  If Bailey gets an weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, she will receive a total amount of $40 (5 x 8 = 40). So if she has $100 initially, she will have $60 left after receiving the allowance ($100 - $40 = $60). Therefore, Bailey had $60 at the end of the period.
"Response: 
Judy teaches in 5 dance classes per day and 8 dance classes on Saturday, so she teaches a total of 5 + 8 = 13 dance classes per week.
Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students Judy teaches per week is 13 x 15 = 195 students.
If each student pays $15 per lesson, then Judy earns $15 x 195 = $2,725 per week from teaching dance classes."
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions, so Kelian needs to read 20 instructions to prepare that dish. Since the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions (2 x 20 = 40) to prepare both dishes. Therefore, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions in total to prepare both meals.
Response:  If Tommy sells 43 brownies and each brownie costs $3, then he will make $13 (43 x $3). Similarly, if he sells 23 pieces of cheesecake and each piece costs $4, then he will make $98 ($23 x $4). Therefore, Tommy will have made a total of $111 ($13 + $98) in revenue from his baking sale.
Response:  The total cost of five mobile phones is $750 (5 x $150). If there is a 2% tax per unit, then the monthly payment will be calculated as follows: Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Number of Installments x Rate of Interest. In this case, the number of installments is three months and the rate of interest is 2%. So, we can calculate the monthly payment as follows: Monthly Payment = $750 / 3 x 2% = $225 per month. Therefore, Sheila will pay $225 per month for three months to own the five mobile phones.
"Response:  If we assume that each pot of flowers is sold for $1 less than its original price (since Artie has no money), then...

* Guldgulve: Original price = $2.74, sale price = $1.74 x 12 pots = $20.88
* Petunier: Original price = $1.87, sale price = $0.87 x 9 pots = $7.53
* Begonier: Original price = $2.12, sale price = $1.12 x 17 pots = $18.36

So, if Artie sells 12 pots of guldgulve, 9 pots of petunier, and 17 pots of begonier, he will earn a total of $20.88 + $7.53 + $18.36 = $56.77."
"Response:  If Luke builds a sandcastle with $n$ levels, each level has half of the area of the previous level, so the area of each level is $\frac{A}{2^n}$, where $A$ is the total area of the castle. Since the top level has an area of $16$, we can write:
$$\frac{A}{2^n} = 16$$
Now, we can solve for $A$ by raising both sides to the power of $2$:
$$A = (2^n) \cdot \frac{A}{2^n}$$
Simplifying and rearranging, we get:
$$A = 2^{2n + 1}$$
So, the average area of each level in the sandcastle is:
$$\text{average area} = \frac{A}{n + 1} = 2^{2(n + 1) - 1}$$
Therefore, if Luke builds a sandcastle with $4$ levels, the average area of each level is:
$$\boxed{\text{average area} = 2^{8 - 1} = 256}$$"
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Cecilia needs to feed her whale calf with dog food for the first 180 days. The doctor recommends giving the whale calf one cup of dog food per day during this period. Therefore, we need to calculate how many cups of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year.

Cecilia will use (180 days) x (1 cup/day) = 180 cups of dog food in the first year. Since each package contains 110 cups of dog food, Cecilia will go through 6 packages of dog food in the first year (180 cups / 110 cups/package = 6 packages)."
"Response:  If Raymond washes half of Sarah's clothes and Sarah washes four times as much as David, then we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry they are doing as follows:
Raymond washes half of Sarah's clothes = 1/2 x 400 pounds (Sarah's clothes) = 200 pounds
David washes 4 times as much as Sarah = 4 x 400 pounds (Sarah's clothes) = 1600 pounds
So, the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
200 pounds - 1600 pounds = -1400 pounds"
Response:  If he buys three bunches of flowers for 2.50 kr each, then he pays a total of 7.50 kr (3 x 2.50 = 7.50). Now, if he buys two bunches of flowers for 1 cr each, then he pays a total of 2 cr (2 x 1 = 2). So, by buying 18 bunches of flowers, he saves 5 cr (7.50 - 2 = 5).
Response:  The cost of taking the dog to the groomer without any discount is $100. If John gets a 30% discount as a new customer, he will pay $70 (30% of $100). So, the total cost would be $70.
"Response:  If one-sixth of the total water (24 liters) is equal to 6 liters for each boy, then we can write an equation as follows:

$ \boxed{\frac{24}{6} = x} $

Here, $x$ represents the number of liters of water left after the boys drank their respective amounts.

Now, we need to solve this equation to find out how many liters of water were left after all the boys had finished drinking. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by $\frac{6}{1}$, which gives us:

$$\boxed{\frac{24}{6} = x \Rightarrow \frac{24}{1} = \frac{x}{6}} $$

Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $\frac{6}{1}$ to get rid of the fraction:

$$\boxed{\frac{24}{1} = \frac{x}{6} \Rightarrow 24 = \frac{x}{3}} $$

So, there are $\frac{x}{3}$ liters of water left after all the boys have finished drinking. Since one boy got $\boxed{6}$ liters of water, we know that $\boxed{x = 20}$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{20}$ liters of water left after all the boys have finished drinking."
Response:  We know that Charlie had 10 stickers initially and bought 21 more in the shop. So, he now has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he has 31 - 9 = 22 stickers left. Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate a card, leaving him with 22 - 28 = 4 stickers remaining. Therefore, Charlie has 4 stickers left.
"Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs less than 125 pounds. So, their combined weight is equal to Grace's weight minus Alex's weight. Therefore, their total weight in kilograms can be calculated as follows:
Grace's weight = 125 pounds x 0.453592 (conversion factor from pounds to kg) = 56.7 kg
Alex's weight = x pounds (less than 125 pounds) x 0.453592 = x/2 kg
Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex in kilograms is:
56.7 kg + (x/2) kg = 56.7 + x/2 =?
Solve for x to find out the value of Alex's weight in kilograms."
Response:  We know that there are three rose bushes and each bush has 25 roses. Therefore, the total number of roses is 3 x 25 = 75 roses. Since each rose has 8 thorns, we can calculate the total number of thorns as follows: Total number of thorns = Number of roses x Number of thorns per rose Total number of thorns = 75 x 8 = 600 thorns. So, there are 600 thorns in all.
Response:  If they won 8 more than they lost, that means they have won x games and lost y games. So we can write an equation: 8 = x - y. Now we know that x is equal to 22 (the number of games played) minus y (the number of games lost). Therefore, the answer is 22 - 8 = 14.
"Response: 
Gene has been taking four vacations per year since he was 23 years old. He is now 34 years old. Therefore, he has taken 11 vacations (4 x 29 = 110).
Each vacation creates one quilt block. So, in total, Gene has created 110 quilt blocks.
Since each quilt block can be made up of multiple t-shirt pieces, we don't know exactly how many t-shirt pieces Gene has used to create his quilt blocks. However, based on the information provided, it seems that Gene has at least 110 t-shirt pieces from all his vacations."
Response:  The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang three times as long as the first time. So the third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second time, which is three times. Therefore, the alarm rang 4 + 3 = 7 times in total.
"Response: 
Year 1 (December): $600 x 10% = $60
Year 2 (December): $600 x 10% = $60 + $600 = $660
Year 3 (December): $660 x 10% = $66 + $660 = $726
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three years of service is $726."
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold ten times as many records as Harald. So if Marilyn sold x records, then Harald sold x/10 records. Since they together sold 88,000 records, we can set up the equation: x + (x/10) = 88,000. Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = 72,000. Therefore, Harald sold 72,000 - 72,000 = 0 records.
Response:  We know that Christina is planning a birthday party and needs 75 gift boxes per invited guest since 25% of guests will not come. She invited 16 friends, so she needs 16 x 75 = 1200 gift boxes in total. Each gift box costs $2, so the total cost would be 1200 x $2 = $2400.
Response:  If an adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad and a child eats half of that, then an adult will eat 10/2 = 5 pounds of potato salad. Since there are 20 adults and 5 children attending the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed is 20 x 5 = 100 pounds. So, Ted should bring 100 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.
Response:  We know that Jan has three pets more than Marcia. So, if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets. Additionally, we know that Cindy has four pets and that Marcia has two pets more than Cindy. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 3x = 4 + 2. Solving for x, we get x = 6. Thus, Jan has 3(6) = 18 pets.
"Response:  We know that Amy is five years older than Jackson and two years younger than Corey. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Amy - 5 = Jackson + 2
We also know that James is one year younger than Corey, so we can add another equation:
James - 1 = Corey + 2
Now let's solve for Jackson's age using the first equation:
Jackson = Amy - 5 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9
So, Jackson is nine years old."
Response:  We know that Lee can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds if he runs without any obstacles in 25 seconds (since 38 / 2 = 19). Now, we are given that Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in 40 seconds if he doesn't change his diet. If Gerald changes his diet and improves his speed by 10%, then he will be able to run 400 meters with obstacles in x seconds, where x is the percentage increase in his speed due to the improved diet. So, x = 10% of 40 = 4 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in 36 seconds (x + 40) = 40 + 4 = 44 seconds.
Response:  If there are 12 fewer canines than dogs and cats combined, then the number of dogs is 60 - 12 = 48. Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 48 x 2 = 96. Therefore, there are 96 kæledyr (dogs + cats) in total in the neighborhood.
Response:  We know that out of 200 students in class 5, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 are girls in Girl Scouts. So, the number of girls not in Girl Scouts is (2/3) x 140 = 90 girls. Therefore, there are 90 girls who are not in Girl Scouts.
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 8 hours and James slept for 6 hours. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Harry's sleep time = 8 hours
James's sleep time = 6 hours
Now, let's find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:
Difference between Harry's and James's sleep times = 8 - 6 = 2 hours
So, Harry slept for 2 hours more than James. Therefore, the correct answer is: Harry slept for 10 hours (2 hours more than James)."
"Response:  We know that when Freda cooks tomatoes in a can, they lose half of their volume. So if she uses 16-ounce cans of tomatoes and each can contains three tomatoes, then...

Step 1: Convert the volume of the can from ounces to grams. There are 100 grams in 1 fluid ounce (fl oz), so...

16 fl oz = 16 x 100 g = 1600 g

Step 2: Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the weight of the last tomato sauce. Since the sauce weighed 32 grams, and there are 3 tomatoes per 16-ounce can...

Number of tomatoes = weight of sauce / weight of one tomato
= 32 g / 75 g (weight of one tomato)
= 0.42 tomatoes

So, Freda used approximately 0.42 tomatoes for her last batch of tomato sauce."
"Response:  The total number of cars initially is 30. In the first 15 minutes, some cars passed through the traffic jam (but we don't know how many). Then, in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars passed through the traffic jam. Finally, 5 cars took an exit and didn't pass through the traffic jam. So, the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is:

Initially: 30 cars
Passed through in the first 15 minutes: x cars
Passed through in the remaining 15 minutes: 20 cars
Took an exit: 5 cars
Total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam: x + 20 + 5 = 45 cars
Therefore, 45 cars passed through the traffic jam in the given time period."
"Response: 
Mary has already planted two plants in each of the 40 windowsills in her big house. That means she has planted 80 plants so far (2 x 40 = 80).
Now, she received 18 new plants from her favorite nursery. So, after receiving these new plants, Mary will have 80 + 18 = 98 plants in total.
Therefore, Mary will have 98 - 80 = 18 pottery plants left for her friends and family."
Response:  The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 of 20 = 5 times more than the first friend. Therefore, the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend, which means they pressed it 5 + 10 = 15 times more than the first friend. Finally, if the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, then they pressed it 60 - 20 = 40 times more than the first friend.
Response:  We know that Han has four days to read his entire book. If we divide the total number of pages in each subject area by four, we get the following numbers of pages per day for each subject area: Nature science - 40 pages/day (4 x 10 = 40), Social science - 20 pages/day (4 x 5 = 20), History - 7 pages/day (4 x 1.75 = 7), Geography - 8 pages/day (4 x 2 = 8). So, Han should read 15 pages on Monday and then continue reading according to these daily page counts for each subject area until he finishes all four books.
"Response: 
John drinks one glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day, so he drinks 3 glasses of water per day (1 x 3 = 3).
Since he also drinks a glass of water before going to bed every night, he drinks an additional 1 glass of water per night (1 x 7 = 7), making it a total of 10 glasses of water per week (3 + 7 = 10)."
"Response:  The distance from the ocean front to the opposite inland side of the city is 42 miles. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles, we can calculate how many minutes it will take to cover the entire city as follows:
Minutes = Distance / Speed (in miles per minute) x Time (in minutes per mile)
= 42 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes x 10 minutes/mile
= 780 minutes
Therefore, it will take 780 minutes or approximately 13 hours and 20 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city."
"Response: 
Poppy has solved 1000 puzzle pieces and put 750 of them on the board. Her mother then puts 250 more pieces on the board. So, in total, there are 750 + 250 = 1000 puzzle pieces on the board now."
Response:  If Amir eats 5 cakes and Cody eats 3 times as many cakes as Amir, then Cody will eat 15 cakes (3 x 5 = 15). So together they will eat 20 cakes (5 + 15 = 20).
Response:  The volume of each box is given as 15cm x 15cm x 15cm = 2700 cubic centimeters (or cubic meters). Since there are three boxes, their total internal volume is 3 x 2700 = 8100 cubic centimeters or cubic meters.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours. He watched one hour on Monday and Tuesday each night, so he saw two episodes (one hour each) in total. On Wednesday, he watched some few parts of a 30-minutes program, but we don't know how many parts that was. Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour-long program and another 30 minutes program. Friday, he stayed up late, so he watched two 1-hour programs. Therefore, if he watched 7 hours of TV in total, then he must have seen 4 30-minute programs (2 x Monday + 1 x Thursday + 1 x Friday).
Response:  Last year, Henry baked x kager and earned twice as much money as last year. So this year he will earn 2x money. Since he has baked 110 kager now, he must have baked x + 15 kager last year. Therefore, x = 95.
Response:  If someone buys 10 gallons of gasoline at a local station that charges $3 per gallon and gets $20 cash back per gallon, they will save $20 x 10 = $200 in total. So their final cost for 10 gallons of gasoline would be $3 x 10 = $30 + $200 = $230.
"Response: 
Marcell had 3 times as many rolls as Beatrice (3 x 24 = 72), and Beatrice had twice as many rolls as Marcell (2 x 14 = 28). So, if they both ate their entire portion, Marcell would have eaten 72 / 3 = 24 rolls, and Beatrice would have eaten 28 / 2 = 14 rolls. Therefore, in average, Marcell ate 24/2 = 12 rolls per person, and Beatrice ate 14/2 = 7 rolls per person."
Response:  The boat took in two liters of water for every meter it traveled while out on the sea. Since it was 20 feet (or 6 meters) away from shore when the leak occurred, and it took 16 seconds to row back to shore, we can calculate that the boat took in 128 liters of water during its journey (2 liters/meter x 6 meters). Now, since it took 64 seconds to reach shore after the leak occurred, we know that the boat had 128 liters of water less than it did initially, which means it had taken in 64 liters of water (128 - 64 = 64 liters). Therefore, when Julia reached shore, the boat had 64 liters of water remaining.
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 lessons per day, there will be 8 lessons in total per day (4 x 2 = 8). If the blackboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then it will be cleaned 24 times per day (8 x 3 = 24). So, the answer is 24.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Ryan planted 20 bulbs in his garden and expected that after 15 days, he would have 30 blooms (20 x 1.5 = 30). However, only 5 of them actually grew, so Ryan will have 30 - 5 = 25 blooms after 15 days.
Response:  We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 images and Brittany's phone can hold 6 times as many images as Jamal's phone. Therefore, we can say that Brittany's phone can hold 1800 x 6 = 10,800 images. Now, we are told that the maximum number of images that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo of ducks in the zoo. So, if Jamal's photo has X ducks, then the maximum number of images that Brittany's phone can hold is 50X. Finally, we are asked how many ducks Jamal can see on his picture of ducks in the zoo. If Jamal's picture has Y ducks, then we can find out how many images Brittany's phone can hold by using the equation above: 10,800 = 50Y. Solving for Y, we get Y = 216. Therefore, Jamal can see 216 ducks on his picture of ducks in the zoo.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the lumber that Sasha has left after buying some new ones. The total cost is:

$10 x 10 = $100 (for the ten 2x4x10 boards)
+ $16 x 5 = $80 (for the five 4x4x10 boards)
= $180

Next, let's find out how much money she will get from selling all these boards. If she sells them at their original price, her profit would be:

Profit = Original Price - Selling Price
= $180 - ($100 + $80)
= $20

Therefore, if Sasha sells all the lumber she has left, she will make a profit of $20."
Response:  If Katy used 7 parts of sugar to every 13 parts of water (which is equivalent to a ratio of 7:13), then she used 7/13 x 120 = 84 teskefulde sukker in total. Therefore, Katy used 84 teskefulde sukker.
Response:  If John buys two pairs of shoes for each of his three children, he will buy a total of 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Since each pair costs $60, John will pay a total of 6 x $60 = $360.
"Response:  On day one, there were two containers with imported cars, each containing 5 cars. So, in total, there were 10 cars (2 containers x 5 cars/container). Now, let's assume that more containers arrived on the second day, bringing the total number of cars to 30. Therefore, the number of containers that arrived on the second day is:

Number of containers = Total number of cars / Number of cars per container
= 30 / 5
= 6

So, six containers arrived on the second day."
"Response:  We know that Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Lyla's four years ago. So, if we assume that their salaries grew at the same rate, then:
Adrian's current salary = $40,000 (four years ago) x 1.3 (30% increase) = $52,000
Lyla's current salary = $40,000 (four years ago) x 1.2 (20% increase) = $48,000
Therefore, the total combined salary of Adrian and Lyla four years later is:
$52,000 + $48,000 = $100,000"
Response:  If he uses 15 sheets of paper per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he will use 60 sheets of paper per month (15 x 4 = 60). Since there are 30 sheets of paper per block, he will go through one block every two months (60 / 30 = 2). Therefore, he will use 2 blocks of paper per month.
Response:  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 pears, so together they have 13 fruit (5 + 8 = 13). Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which means he brought 10 more apples than Morisette (2 x 5 = 10). So, Kael brought a total of 10 + 8 = 18 fruits.
"Response:  If she slept 8 hours on Monday and then reduced her sleeping time by 2 hours each day after that, she would have slept for:
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 6 hours (8 - 2 = 6)
Wednesday: 4 hours (6 - 2 = 4)
Thursday: 2 hours (4 - 2 = 2)
Friday: 0 hours (2 - 2 = 0)
Saturday: -2 hours (-2 = -4)
Sunday: -4 hours (-4 = -6)
Total sleep time in the week: 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 + (-2) + (-4) = 18 hours
Therefore, Sadie slept for 18 hours in total during the week."
Response:  If Rosie can run 10 miles in an hour, then she can run 30 miles in 3 hours (since there are 2 hours after the first hour). Now, if she runs 8 kilometers per hour, then she can run 48 kilometers in 3 hours (since there are 2 hours after the first hour). So, Rosie can run 30 + 48 = 78 kilometers in 7 hours.
Response:  If there are currently 30 breve in the pile of already stamped letters and Jennie has been working for x hours, then we can calculate how many letters she has helped to stamp during that time as follows: Number of letters helped = Total number of letters - Number of already stamped letters = 60 - 30 = 30. So, if Jennie began working after 2/3 of the total number of letters had already been stamped (i.e., 60 / 3 = 20), then she would have helped to stamp 10 letters (30 - 20 = 10).
Response:  Julia had 3 skeers left after she used them to taste the food in the pot. Then her husband gave her 5 new skeers, so she now has 8 skeers in total (3 + 5 = 8). Since she started with 10 skeers and lost 3, there are 7 skeers left in the original pack (10 - 3 = 7). Therefore, there were 7 skeers in the original package that Julia bought.
Response:  We know that Dylan bought more than just chicken and fish curds to make sausages. So let's call the number of chicken curds he bought x. Then we know that he bought 38 - x chicken curds in total. Similarly, we can say that he bought y fish curds, where y is the difference between the number of fish curds he bought and the number of chicken curds he bought (y = 6 - x). Now we have two equations: x + y = 38 (total number of curds) and x + y = 6 (number of fish curds). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us x = 24 and y = 4. Therefore, Dylan bought 24 chicken curds and 4 fish curds in total.
Response:  If Amy got 20 more friends than Lily, that means Lily had x friends initially. Since Amy has 20 + x friends now, we can set up the equation: Amy = Lily + x. Now we know that Amy has 50 friends in total, so we can substitute this value into our equation: 50 = Lily + x. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 30. So Lily had 30 friends and Amy has 30 + 20 = 50 friends.
Response:  The cost of one water melon is three times that of each pepper, so the cost of one water melon is $3x. Since there are four water melons, the total cost of water melons is $3x x 4 = $12x. Similarly, since each apple costs $5 less than a water melon, the cost of ten apples is $10 - ($12x / 5) = $6x. Therefore, the total amount Dylan will spend is $12x + $6x = $18x.
"Response:  The number of patients per day is 500, and each patient spends an average of 24 minutes at the hospital. Therefore, the total time spent at the hospital in one day is:

500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

Now, let's calculate how much doctors earn from these visits:

Lawyers take $150/hour from the hospital, so they earn:

$150/hour x 150 doctors (assuming there are 150 doctors working at the hospital) x 8 hours/day = $120,000/day

Next, we need to calculate how much the hospital itself earns from these visits:

The hospital takes $200/hour from patients, so it earns:

$200/hour x 500 patients/day x 8 hours/day = $400,000/day

Therefore, the total amount earned by the hospital from these visits is:

$120,000 + $400,000 = $520,000/day"
"Response:  If 3/5 of the elves give up when children throw snowballs at them and 2/5 of the remaining elves give up when children kick them in the shins, then we can calculate how many elves are left using basic multiplication.
Let X be the total number of elves initially (60).
Then, 3/5 of X = 40 elves gave up when children threw snowballs at them.
And 2/5 of 40 = 20 elves gave up when children kicked them in the shins.
So, there are 40 - 20 = 20 elves left."
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. To find out how much he spent in June, we need to subtract the amount he spent in June from what he spent in May. So, if he spent $60 less in June than in May, that means he spent $500 - $60 = $440 in June. Therefore, Joseph spent a total of $500 + $440 = $940 over the two months.
"Response: 
Pam took two turns on the roller coaster and Fred took four turns. So far, they have used 2 + 4 = 6 tickets.
Then, they decided to take two turns in a sleigh, which costs 6 tickets per turn. Therefore, they will use an additional 6 tickets for their sleigh ride.
So, in total, Pam and Fred used 6 + 6 = 12 tickets that day."
Response:  On Monday, he walked 5 miles (miles = kilometers x 0.62). On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as on Monday, so he walked 31 miles (31 x 0.62 = 19 miles). Therefore, his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles / 3 = 13.67 kilometers. So, on Wednesday, he walked 13.67 kilometers.
"Response:  If Tom gets four car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, then he pays:
4 car washes/month x $15/car wash = $60/month
So, Tom pays $60 per month for his four car washes."
Response:  If Brian has 20 video games and lost 5 just before the comparison was made with Bobby, then Brian had 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Now, we know that Bobby has fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, so if Bobby has x video games, Brian has 15 / 3 = 5 x video games. Therefore, Bobby has 5x - 15 = 9 video games more than Brian.
Response:  We know that there are 27 stags in the world and two-thirds of them are in Scotland (i.e., 19 stags). Since all the Scottish stags are females, we have 19 female stags in Scotland. Therefore, the number of female Skottish stags is 19.
"Response: 
Rory wants to buy 3 sandwiches at $7,50 each, so that will be $22,50 total.
For the potato chips, she wants to buy 1 bag of 1 kg at $1,50 per kilogram, so that will be $1,50 x 1 = $1,50 total.
For the small cakes, she wants to buy 2 boxes of 6 pieces each at $1,00 per box, so that will be $1,00 x 2 = $2,00 total.
Total cost of all items = $22,50 + $1,50 + $2,00 = $25,50
Since there is a 20% handling fee, the final cost with the handling fee included will be: $25,50 x 20% = $5,100
So, Rory's delivery order will cost her $5,100 in total."
"Response:  If Mark took 75 questions in 5 minutes, then he answered each question in 15 seconds (75/5 = 15). Now, let's calculate how many questions he left unanswered in the first test:
Time taken to complete the first test = 8 hours
Number of questions in the first test = 75
Speed at which Mark answered questions = 15 seconds per question
Unanswered questions in the first test = Number of questions x Speed / Time taken
= 75 x 15 / 8
= 37.5
So, Mark left 37.5 questions unanswered in the first test.
Now, let's move on to the second test with 100 questions. We know that Mark took 6 hours to complete this test, so we can use the same formula to find out how many questions he left unanswered:
Time taken to complete the second test = 6 hours
Number of questions in the second test = 100
Speed at which Mark answered questions = 15 seconds per question
Unanswered questions in the second test = Number of questions x Speed / Time taken
= 100 x 15 / 6
= 43.75
So, Mark left 43.75 questions unanswered in the second test."
Response:  If there are 22 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, and there are 12 blue gumballs, then there must be 264 (22 x 12) pink gumballs.
Response:  There are 20 cars that can be rented and we know that 12 of them are automatic, which means there are 8 non-automatic cars (manual or semi-automatic). So, the percentage of hal...
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in the hive and twice as many worker bees as queen bees. So, if there are x queen bees, then there are 2x worker bees. Therefore, we can write an equation: 700 = x + (2x) = 1400. Solving for x, we get x = 700. So, there are 700 worker bees in the hive.
"Response:  If Jordan plays video games for two hours every day and works part-time for $10 per hour, he will earn:

2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week playing video games
$10/hour x 14 hours/week = $140/week working part-time

So, in one week, Jordan would earn a total of $140 + $140 = $280."
"Response: 
John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, apples for $3, copper for $3, and chocolate cake for $4. If there is a 10% tax on non-food items, how much will everything cost in total?
Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item without taxes.
Milk: $2
Eggs: $3
Apples: $3
Copper: $3
Chocolate cake: $4
Total cost without taxes: $12
Step 2: Calculate the tax amount for each item that is not food.
Non-food items (copper): Tax rate = 10%
Tax amount = $3 x 10% = $0.30
Non-food items (chocolate cake): Tax amount = $4 x 10% = $0.40
Step 3: Add the tax amounts to the original prices of the non-food items.
Copper: New price = $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
Chocolate cake: New price = $4 + $0.40 = $4.40
Step 4: Sum up all the new prices to get the total cost with taxes.
Total cost with taxes = Copper ($3.30) + Chocolate cake ($4.40) = $7.70
Therefore, if there is a 10% tax on non-food items, John will pay a total of $7.70 for all the items he bought."
"Response: 
Kim has already three clients, so he will sell 3 x 2 = 6 bottles of bleach solution per week. And each package of clothes costs $5, so he will sell 3 x 5 = 15 packages of clothes per week.
Total revenue = 6 x $2 + 15 x $5 = $92 per week.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $92 -? (cost of goods sold) =?
So, Lucas will make a profit of $92 - ($6 + $75) = $18 per week."
"Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of land for growing pineapples and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the total number of pineapples grown by John is:

10 hectares x 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every third month, we need to divide the total number of pineapples by the number of months he can harvest them in a year:

1000 pineapples / 3 months = 333 pineapples per month

Therefore, John can harvest approximately 333 pineapples per month."
Response:  The first set has 500 pieces, so if Johnny collects all of them, he will have collected 500 pieces. The second set has three times as many pieces as the first set, which means it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. Finally, the third set has one-fourth of the total number of pieces, which is (1500 / 4) = 375 pieces. Therefore, in total, Johnny has collected 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 pieces.
Response:  We know that out of the total number of bees that came to the hive during the first 6 hours, half returned within the next 6 hours (since she saw double the number of bees leaving than arriving). So, the number of bees that left the hive and did not return is equal to half of the original number of bees that arrived. Therefore, the number of bees that returned after 12 hours = Number of bees that arrived x 2 - Half of the number of bees that arrived. Now we need to find out how many bees arrived initially. According to the problem statement, Debra observed 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Since she saw twice as many bees leaving as arrived, the total number of bees that arrived must be twice 30 = 60. So, the number of bees that returned after 12 hours = 60 x 2 - 30 = 120 bees.
Response:  If Brittany and her mother go to the museum together, then the total cost of their tickets is $12 + $10 = $22. Since Brittany's mother gave the cashier $8 in change, that means she paid $22 - $8 = $14 for both tickets. So, the answer is $14.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy and James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So if Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, then Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends. And if James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, then he has 4 x 4 = 16 friends on Facebook. Therefore, James has 16 - 4 = 12 friends on Facebook.
"Response: 
Steve has to cycle from school and it takes him 440 feet per minute to cover that distance. Since he lives 3 miles away from the school, it will take him 3 x 440 = 1320 feet to get home.
Tim can skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. Since he lives 2 miles away from the school, it will take him 2 x 264 = 528 feet to get home.
Since both Steve and Tim are racing to get home, we need to find out who will arrive first. To do this, we can divide the distance between them (528 - 1320) by their respective speeds (264). This gives us:
(528 - 1320) / 264 = -792/264 = -3.02
So, Tim will arrive home before Steve by approximately 3 minutes and 2 seconds."
"Response: 
Day 1: 5 people came to get both tires inflated, so they paid $25 x 5 = $125.
Day 2: 3 people came to get their three-wheeled bike tires inflated, so they paid $25 x 3 = $75.
Total income from Day 1 and Day 2 is therefore $125 + $75 = $200."
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of cookies and each package contains six small cookies, then he will buy 6 x 10 = 60 small cookies in total. Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl will pay $60 / $0.10 = $600 for all the cookies. So, Carl will get $600 back from the cashier if he pays with a $10 bill.
"Response: 
Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the bag from him. The seagull ate half of the remaining fries (7). Then three ducks came and ate three fries each (9). A washbowr bird took two-thirds of the remaining fries (5). Finally, a mouse took one last fry (1). So, in total, there were 7 + 9 + 5 + 1 = 22 fries left in the bag when Dave bought it. Therefore, there were initially 22 x 14 = 308 fries in the bag."
Response:  On Monday, Tuesday and Friday, Kimo has three 1-hour classes per day, so he has 3 x 1 = 3 hours of class per day. On Wednesday and Thursday, he has two 2-hour classes per day, so he has 2 x 2 = 4 hours of class per day. In total, Kimo has 3 + 4 = 7 hours of class per week. Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends 7 x 16 = 112 hours in class per semester.
"Response: 
We know that Bill makes 300 small cakes, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day.
The length of each roll is 15 cm, so there are 15 x 300 = 4500 cm of rolls in total.
The length of each croissant is 20 cm, so there are 20 x 120 = 2400 cm of croissants in total.
The length of each baguette is 60 cm, so there are 60 x 60 = 3600 cm of baguettes in total.
In total, we have 4500 + 2400 + 3600 = 10500 cm of bread in total.
Since Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 10500 cm long if he places them all together."
Response:  We know that all the monkeys in the zoo need a total of 500 bananas per month (200 + 400 + 100 = 500). To keep them fed for two months, we will need to buy twice as many bananas: 500 x 2 = 1000 bananas. So, he should order 1000 bananas each month.
"Response: 
Step 1: Distance covered by Blake = distance of 100 meters x number of times he ran back and forth = 100 x 15 = 1500 meters
Step 2: Distance covered by Kelly = distance of 40 yards (which is approximately 36 meters) x number of times she ran from one end to the other and back = 36 x 34 = 1288 meters
So, the winner, Kelly, covers a total distance of 1288 meters, while the loser, Blake, covers a distance of 1500 meters. Therefore, the difference in distance between them is 212 meters (1288 - 1500)."
Response:  We know that Raphael bought four pens for $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on pens. He also bought two notebooks for $4 each, so he spent $8 on notebooks. Finally, he bought a pack of paper for $20. Therefore, in total, Raphael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 on school supplies.
Response:  At first, Finn saw 11 frogs swimming in the pond. Then, he suddenly saw 6 of them come out from their hiding place under a lily pad. Finally, he saw 2 of them hiding under a stone. So, now Finn can see a total of 11 + 6 + 2 = 19 frogs in the pond.
Response:  On Monday, the depth of water in the tank was 5 meters. On Tuesday, it increased by 2 meters, so now it is 7 meters deep (Tuesday +2=7). On Wednesday, one-third of the water remained in the tank, which means that the depth of water left in the tank is 7/3 = 2.33 meters (Wednesday). So, the depth of water in the tank on Wednesday is 2.33 meters.
"Response: 
Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish.
Locsin caught 5 fewer small sea stars than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.
So, if we add up all the fish that both of them caught, we get:
10 + 6 + 3 = 19 (starfish)
5 - 3 = 2 (small sea stars)
3 - 3 = 0 (seahorses)
2 + 2 = 4 (clownfish)
Therefore, they fished out a total of 19 small sea stars, 2 seahorses, and 4 clownfish."
Response:  If one marble cost $20 initially, then after one month it would cost (1 + 20%) = $24. After two months, it would cost (1 + 20%)^2 = $28. And so on... So, after 36 months, the price of one marble would be (1 + 20%)^36 = $79.
"Response:  We know that there are 5 red cars, and each car costs $4. Therefore, the total cost of all the red cars is:

5 x $4 = $20

We also know that there are 3 action figures, and each one costs $5. So, the total cost of all the action figures is:

3 x $5 = $15

Finally, we know that the doll cost $3. So, the total cost of all the toys is:

$20 + $15 + $3 = $38

Therefore, the value of all the toys is $38."
Response:  If she pays taxes herself, she will save $35 per hour worked and lose $35 per hour worked. The accountant takes $90. So if she works 3 hours less, she will save $105 ($35 x 3 hours) and pay $90 to the accountant, for a total savings of $195.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elvira spent €1090 on the new computer with monitor, keyboard and mouse. Then she bought a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102, making a total of €1423. So, if we subtract this amount from her initial budget of €1500, we get €77 left over for clothes.
"Response:  If Sandra gives her nanny a curved with nine eggs each time she watches their daughter, and to make a Spanish omelette, she needs three eggs, then we can calculate how many times Sandra will have to babysit to make 15 Spanish omelettes.
To do this, we need to divide the number of eggs needed (9 x 3 = 27) by the number of eggs given per babysitting session (9). So, Sandra will have to babysit 27 / 9 = 3 times. Therefore, the answer is 3."
Response:  According to the problem statement, Seth is currently double Brooke's age, which means that Seth is 2x = 2 \* 16 = 32 years old now. In two years, Seth will be 32 + 2 = 34 years old. So, the correct answer is 34.
Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy has x dollars, then we know that Jimmy has more than Ethel because he has x > 8. So, Jimmy has at least $x - $8 = $2 more than Ethel.
Response:  On weekdays (Monday to Friday), Pancho goes for a run of 30 kilometers per day. Therefore, he covers a distance of 30 x 5 = 150 kilometers in a week. However, on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he only runs 10 miles or 16 kilometers per day. So, over the weekend, he covers a distance of 16 x 2 = 32 kilometers. In total, therefore, Pancho covers a distance of 150 + 32 = 182 kilometers in a week.
"Response:  The cost of each component is given as follows:
Hat: $25
Jacket: $X (where X > $25)
Pants: $\frac{X}{3}$ (since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat)
Given that the total cost of the uniform is equal to the sum of these components, we can write an equation:
$25 + X + \left(\frac{X}{3}\right) = Total Cost$
Solving for X, we get:
X = $75
So, the cost of each uniform is:
Hat: $25
Jacket: $75
Pants: $\frac{75}{3} = $25
Therefore, the answer is:
Hat: $25
Jacket: $75
Pants: $25"
"Response: 
Jake sees 80 edderkopper with 8 legs each, so he sees 8 x 80 = 640 legs.
He also sees 90 insects with 6 legs each, so he sees 90 x 6 = 540 legs.
Finally, he sees 3 rare mutant worms with 10 legs each, so he sees 3 x 10 = 30 legs.
In total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that there are four birds at Caboose and their ages can be represented as follows:
Sally 1 = x years old
Granny Red = 2x years old (since she is twice as old as Sally 1)
Sally 2 = 3x years old (since she is three times as old as Sally 1)
Sally 3 = 4x years old (since she is four times as old as Sally 1)
Now, according to the question, we know that Sally 4 is on the same age level as Sally 32. So, we can write an equation based on this information:
Sally 4 = Sally 32
Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
x + 3x = 32
Simplifying the equation, we get:
4x = 32
Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get:
x = 8
So, the combined age of all the birds at Caboose is 8 years old."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica has to pay each month for her loans and credit card debt. The total amount she needs to pay is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 per month. Now, if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will have to pay $1000 x 1.5 = $1500 per month. So, in one year, she will have paid $1500 x 12 = $18,000 towards her debts.
"Response: 
1. It takes Billy approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds to skrælle one kartoffel (60 kartoffler x 1 min 30 sec/kartoffel = 9 minutes).
2. It takes Billy approximately 5 seconds to skære each kartoffel (60 kartoffler x 5 sec/kartoffel = 300 seconds).
Therefore, it will take Billy altogether 9 + 300 = 309 seconds or approximately 5 minutes and 4 seconds to complete all 60 kartoffler."
"Response:  We know that they sold x liters of lemonade and made $25 in profit. Since they sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per liter, we can write an equation based on this information:

$x \times 0.50 = 25

Now, let's use the given information to find out how much they spent on lemons:

Juan and Carlos paid $3 per gallon for lemons, so they paid $3x gallons for all their lemons. Since they used 1 gallon of juice to make every 4 liters of lemonade (since there are 4 liters in a gallon), we can calculate the number of gallons they used as follows:

$3x = $3(4) = $12

So they spent $12 on lemons. Now, we can solve for x using the first equation:

$x \times 0.50 = 25

$x = 50

Therefore, Juan and Carlos sold 50 liters of lemonade and made $25 in profit."
Response:  We know that there were 240 Asians in total and 80 Japanese among them. Now we need to find out how many Chinese were there. Since there were 60 boys among the Chinese team, we can assume that there are also 60 girls among them. So, the number of Chinese players (both boys and girls) is equal to 80 - 60 = 20. Therefore, there were 20 Chinese players in the game, including both boys and girls.
Response:  We know that Zaid spends $1/4 of his income on housing ($6000 \div 4 = $1500), $1/3 on fuel for his car ($6000 \div 3 = $2000), and gives away half of the remaining amount to charity ($6000 - $3000 = $3000). He also gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for daily necessities and other household items. So, after all these expenditures, he has $300 left over. Therefore, the correct answer is $3000 + $200 + $700 = $5900.
Response:  We know that Rani has 10 crabs more than Monica and Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, if Bo has 40 crabs, then Rani has 40 + 10 = 50 crabs and Monica has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Therefore, together they have 50 + 36 = 86 crabs.
Response:  In week 1, Lloyd taught for 5 hours, so he earned $10/hour x 5 hours = $50 in Week 1. In Week 2, he taught for 8 hours, so he earned $10/hour x 8 hours = $80 in Week 2. Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $50 + $80 = $130 over the first two weeks.
"Response:  The number of candidates running for class representative is given as x. If the winner got 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted in the class, we can write an equation based on this information:

x = (number of votes won by the winner) / (total number of votes cast)

We are told that the total number of votes cast was 80, so we can plug this value into our equation to solve for x:

x = (3/4) x 80

Now we need to simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

x = 60

So, if there were 80 students in the class and 3/4 of them voted, the winner received 60 votes."
"Response: 
Sandra has ordered four times as many red roses as white lilies (4 x 200 = 800). In addition, she has ordered 5 times as many lysered callas as white lilies (5 x 200 = 1000). So, in total, Sandra has ordered 1800 flowers (800 + 1000).
To meet Sandra's demand and avoid losing her business, Fred must deliver 1800 flowers before 17 o'clock."
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
Jean is older than Mark.
For two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan.
If Jan is 30 years old now, then how old is Jean?
Let's analyze the situation:
Mark is older than Jean.
Two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan.
So, if we divide 5 by 2, we get 2.5 years.
Now, add this amount to Jean's age, and we get his current age.
Therefore, Jean is 32.5 years old (30 + 2.5)."
"Response:  The first team has four runners who each complete their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so their total time is 2200 seconds (55 s x 4). Now, let's calculate the time of the second team based on the information provided:
Their first runner completes their 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means they have covered a distance of 600 meters (400 m x 1.5). Then, their next three runners will cover a distance of 390 meters each (since each runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one), for a total distance of 1170 meters (600 + 390 + 390 + 390). Therefore, the total time of the second team is:
2200 + 1170 = 3370 seconds
Since we are asked how many seconds the fastest team will win, we can simply subtract the time of the slower team from that of the faster team:
3370 - 2200 = 1170 seconds
Therefore, the fastest team will win by 1170 seconds or approximately 1 hour and 17 minutes."
Response:  The probability of Jerry casting two consecutive numbers is equal to the probability that he casts an odd number followed by another odd number. Since there are 10 odd numbers less than or equal to 10, the probability of this event occurring is 1/2 = 50%. Therefore, the probability of Jerry casting a number greater than 3 in a row is twice as high, which is 100% - 50% = 50%.
Response:  If Jenna and her mom picked half as many apples together, then they picked 10 apples (half of 20). So, Jenna picked 5 apples.
Response:  We know that there are 10 bur with hamsters, each getting 5 pieces of hay. So, total number of hamsters = 10 x 5 = 50. Now, we have to find out how many rats are in each cage. Since there are 3 cages for rats, and each cage has 6 rats, so total number of rats = 3 x 6 = 18. Finally, we need to calculate the number of rotters. As per the problem, each rat gets 6 pieces of hay, so total number of rotters = Total number of rats x Number of pieces of hay per rat = 18 x 6 = 108. Therefore, there are 108 rats in the given situation.
Response:  The monthly interest rate is 2%, so after three months, the total amount owed would be: $100 x (1 + 0.02) ^3 = $104. So, Mandy should pay Benedict $104.
"Response:  We know that the cost of transporting one bag of wheat is $2, so if he sold x bags of wheat, then the total cost of transportation would be $2x. 
We also know that he earned $400 in total after selling all the bags of wheat, and each bag was sold for $30, so the number of bags he sold can be found using the equation: 
$400 = $2x + $2(x)
Simplifying this equation we get: 
$400 = $2x + $4x
$6x = $400
$10 = $6x/5
x = 10/6 = 1.67
So, the handelsman sold approximately 1.67 bags of wheat."
Response:  The three friends spent $20.25 on tickets and used $4.50 less than they did on food. So, if they split their expenses equally among themselves, each person would pay $67.13 ($20.25 + (4.50 / 3) = $67.13).
"Response:  If John can collect freshener in 3 hours and he can collect two fresheners per minute, then we need to calculate how many minutes it takes him to collect one freshener.

Minutes = Hours / 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
Minutes = 3 / 60 = 1/2 hour or 30 minutes

Now that we know it takes John 30 minutes to collect one freshener, we can multiply this number by the total time he has available (3 hours) to find out how many fresheners he can collect in total:
Freshener collected = Number of minutes x Total time available
Freshener collected = 30 minutes x 3 hours = 90 minutes
Therefore, John can collect 90 minutes worth of freshener in 3 hours."
"Response:  If one Enker needs to eat 2.5 kg of insects per week to survive, and there are ten Eckers in total (a flok), then we need to divide the total amount of insects needed among them. So, the number of kilograms of insects each Ecker needs per day is:

2.5 kg / 10 Eckers = 0.25 kg/Ecker per day

Therefore, the answer is 0.25 kg of insects per day for each Ecker in the flock."
Response:  We know that Tom has 10 trees per year and he also falls two trees per year. So after 10 years, he will have 10 x 10 = 100 trees. Now, we are told that after 10 years, 30% of the trees die, which means that 30 out of 100 trees die. Therefore, Tom has 70 trees left (100 - 30).
Response:  On Friday morning, neighbors placed 18 red plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard. Then, on Saturday morning, they took back one-third of those flamingos and painted them white. They then placed these newly painted white flamingos on Sue's front yard. Finally, on Sunday morning, they added the original 18 red plastic flamingos to their collection. So, there were 18 + (1/3) = 24 white flamingos and 18 red flamingos on Sue's front yard by Sunday afternoon. Therefore, there were 24 - 18 = 6 more white flamingos than red flamingos on Sunday afternoon.
"Response: 
Violetta wants to buy new color pencils and she has $20 to spend. Each color pencil costs $2. So, if she buys 5 different colors of pencils, she will need to pay $10 (5 x $2). That means she will have $10 left after buying the pencils ($20 - $10 = $10)."
"Response:  We know that one pencil costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, we can calculate how much 8 pens cost as follows:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60 (for 8 pencils)
$0.30 x 8 = $2.40 (for 8 erasers)
Total cost of 8 pens = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00
Therefore, 8 pens cost $12.00."
"Response:  If there are 40 restaurants and each restaurant receives half a kilogram of gingerbread (500 grams), then we have:

Number of gingerbread = Total amount of gingerbread / Amount per restaurant
= 200 pounds / 0.5 kg/restaurant
= 400 kg

So, 400 kilograms of gingerbread will not be used."
Response:  We know that there are 8417 men and 9092 women in Soda, so together they make up 17509 people. Since we also know that the rest of the population consists of children, we can calculate the number of children as follows: Children = Total Population - Men + Women = 17509 - 8417 + 9092 = 8000 Therefore, there are 8000 children in Soda.
Response:  In the first month, Elaine had 20 Pokémon cards. Then in the second month, she collected three times as many cards as before, so she got 60 new cards (3 x 20 = 60). Now, in the third month, she collected twice as many cards as in the previous two months combined, which means she got 120 new cards (2 x (60 + 20) = 120). So, after three months, Elaine has a total of 180 Pokémon cards (20 + 60 + 120 = 180).
"Response: 
Mark redigerer 1000 sætninger hver uge for two different publishers, and each publisher pays him a different amount per sentence. Publisher A pays him $0.05 per sentence, while Publisher B pays him double that amount, or $0.10 per sentence. So, how much does Mark earn in total per week?
To find out, we need to multiply the number of sentences he edits (1000) by the amount each publisher pays him ($0.05 or $0.10).
For Publisher A, Mark earns $50 per week ($1000 x $0.05).
For Publisher B, Mark earns $100 per week ($2000 x $0.10).
So, in total, Mark earns $150 per week ($50 + $100)."
"Response: 
Hence, we know that Baldur gets 5 spands of water in the morning and 6 spans of water in the afternoon. So he will get a total of 5 + 6 = 11 spans of water per day. Since each span contains 5 liters of water, therefore, Baldur will get a total of 11 x 5 = 55 liters of water per day."
"Response:  If John wins a prize of $5000 with an annual salary increase of 5%, then his weekly income will be:

Weekly Income = Annual Salary x (1 + Percentage Increase) / Number of Weeks in a Year
= $2000 x (1 + 0.05) / 52
= $2080

Now, let's find out how much money he made during the year if he got the prize on the first day of the year:

Money Made During the Year = Prize Money + Weekly Income for Rest of the Year
= $5000 + ($2080 x Number of Days Left in the Year after First Day)
= $5000 + ($2080 x 364 days)
= $5000 + $73680
= $78680

Therefore, John made a total of $78680 during the year if he won the prize on the first day of the year."
Response:  If each hectare gives 5 tons of grapes per year and each ton gives 2 tons of wine, then we can calculate the total amount of grapes produced as follows: Total grape production = Number of hectares x Amount of grapes per hectare Total grape production = 10 ha x 5 tons/ha = 50 tons of grapes per year Now, let's convert the total number of tons of grapes to tonnes of wine using the conversion rate of 2 tonnes of wine per ton of grapes: Total wine production = Total grape production / Conversion ratio Total wine production = 50 tons of grapes / 2 tons of wine/ton = 25 tonnes of wine per year Therefore, Josie's farm produces 25 tonnes of wine per year.
Response:  We know that Carl likes to eat an egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast every day this week, so he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. He also made three omelets with more than one slice of cheese per omelet, so let's say he used 1.5 times as many slices of cheese in each omelet compared to his sandwiches (since he had more eggs). Therefore, he used 3 x 1.5 = 4.5 slices of cheese in total for his omelets. Additionally, he ate macaroni and cheese several times during the week, using 8 slices of cheese per serving. So, altogether, Carl used 4.5 + 8 = 12.5 slices of cheese throughout the week.
Response:  We know that Janet had initially 22 green and 10 yellow pencils. Then she bought 6 packs of blue pencils containing 9 pencils each and 2 packs of red pencils containing 6 pencils each. So in total, Janet now has 22 + 6 x 9 = 138 pencils (green) and 10 + 2 x 6 = 24 pencils (yellow). Therefore, the total number of pencils Janet has is 138 + 24 = 162 pencils.
Response:  If Brinley has scored 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on her first five tests, then she has a total score of (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 458. Since Mr. Bert allows her to remove the lowest score from her overall average, Brinley can subtract her lowest score of 71 from her total score of 458, which gives her an updated total score of 387. To find out what Brinley needs to get on the sixth test to have an overall average of 93, we can divide her updated total score of 387 by 6 (the number of remaining tests), which gives us an average score of 64.67 per test. So, if Brinley scores 95 or higher on the sixth test, she will have an overall average of 93.
"Response: 
Week 1:
* He rode 5 times/week x 25 km/ride = 125 km/week
Total distance in week 1 = 125 km

Week 2-4:
* He rode 3 times/week x 60 km/ride = 180 km/week
Total distance in weeks 2-4 = 180 km x 4 weeks = 720 km

Total distance Michael rode = Total distance in week 1 + Total distance in weeks 2-4 = 125 km + 720 km = 845 km
Therefore, Michael rode a total of 845 kilometers."
Response:  We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as an apple. So if one chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, two chocolate bars would weigh 80 grams (since they are double). And since there are 25 chocolate bars in total, the weight of all the chocolate bars is 25 x 80 = 2000 grams. Now, let's find out how many apples are in the bag. Since there are 80 candied apples and each apple weighs 16 grams, the total weight of all the apples is 80 x 16 = 1280 grams. Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy is 2000 + 1280 = 3280 grams.
Response:  Monday she bought four cakes in one store. Tuesday she went to another store and bought three times as many cakes as Monday (so 12 cakes). Wednesday she went to yet another store and bought five times as many cakes as Tuesday (so 60 cakes). So, after all three days, she bought a total of 72 cakes.
"Response:  We have to calculate the cost of each copper pot and then add them up to find out the total cost. So, we can start with the first part of the problem:
Cost of one copper pot = $1200 - $150 (discount) = $1050
Since there are 12 copper pots in total, the cost of all copper pots is: $1050 x 12 = $12,600
Now, let's move on to the second part of the problem:
Cost of half dozen talliers = $6000 / 6 = $1000 per tallier
So, the total cost of buying half a dozen talliers is: $1000 x 3 = $3000
Therefore, the total cost of buying both copper pots and half a dozen talliers is: $12,600 + $3000 = $15,600"
"Response: 
Sara has already saved $10 before she starts babysitting. She earns $5 per time she babysits and her parents pay her $4 per time she cuts the grass.

To buy the jacket and shoes, Sara needs $30 + $20 = $50 in total.

So, let's calculate how many times Sara needs to babysit or cut the grass to save enough money for the jacket and shoes:

$50 / ($5 per babysitting + $4 per grass cutting) = 12.5 times

Therefore, Sara needs to babysit or cut the grass 12.5 times to save enough money for the jacket and shoes."
Response:  We know that the red hens produce 3 eggs per day and the white hens produce 5 eggs per day. So, in total, Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Now, if he has two more white hens than red hens, it means that for every additional egg produced by a white hen, there are two fewer eggs produced by a red hen. Therefore, the number of eggs produced by each red hen is half as much as the number of eggs produced by each white hen. In other words, the ratio of eggs produced by red hens to eggs produced by white hens is 1:2 or 1/2. So, if the number of white hens is x, then the number of red hens is (x/2).
"Response:  The distance around the local park is $1.5 \text{ miles} \times 6 \text{ miles} = 9 \text{ miles}$. Since he walks with $5 \text{ km/h}$, we can calculate how many hours it takes him to walk around the park as follows:
$$\therefore \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{9 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ km/h}} = 180 \text{ minutes}$$"
Response:  On day one (Sloane says he had 100 customers), and then on day two (he said there were 50 more customers than on day one). So, if we assume that these numbers are accurate, then on day three, they would have had 150 customers in total (100 + 50 = 150). Therefore, she counted 150 customers on the third day.
Response:  The big pool has twice as much water as the small pool, so it had 8 gallons of water (2 x 4 gallons). After four minutes, the big pool lost half of its water, which is equal to 4 gallons. So now the big pool has 8 - 4 = 4 gallons of water left. Since the small pool also loses water at the same rate, it will have 4 / 2 = 2 gallons of water left after four minutes. Therefore, the small pool currently has 2 gallons of water.
"Response:  We know that Lori wants to buy shoes for $320 and a belt for the same price. To calculate how many hours she needs to work, we need to divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage. So, let's do that:

Total cost = Shoes + Belt = $320 + $320 = $640
Hourly wage = $8/hour
Number of hours needed to work = Total cost / Hourly wage
= $640 / $8/hour = 80 hours
Therefore, Lori needs to work for 80 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and belt."
Response:  If Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to pay back with an additional 10% of the amount, then she will owe $2200 (2000 + 10% of 2000). To calculate how much she will have to pay each month, we can divide the total amount owed by the number of months she has to pay it off in. In this case, if she has to pay $165 per month for 12 months, she will have paid a total of $2040 ($165 x 12) after making all the payments. So, Janeth will still owe $196 ($2200 - $2040) when she finishes making all the payments.
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the vase and seven more daisies than roses in the vase. So, if there are x daisies in the vase, then there are 4 + 7x = 11 flowers in total in the vase. Therefore, the answer is 11.
Response:  We know that Adrian is three times older than Harriet, so Adrian's age can be represented as 3H + X, where X is Harriet's age. Since Harriet is 21 years old now, we can write an equation based on this information: 3H + X = 54 (Adrian's current age). Now, since Harriet is half as old as Zack, we can write another equation: H = Z/2 (Zack's age in relation to Harriet's age). Substituting these two equations into each other and solving for H gives us the final answer: H = 27. So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after three years will be 3(27) + X = 81 + X, where X is Harriet's future age.
Response:  We know that Jojo scored x points in total. Since Naomi scored 68 points and Yuri scored more than half of Naomi's score (which is 39 points), we can say that Naomi's score was 68 + 39 = 107 points. So, Jojo scored at least 251 - 107 = 144 points.
"Response: 
Carmen spent 10 minutes solving one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes solving one Sudoku puzzle. Therefore, she spent a total of 15 minutes (10 + 5) solving both types of puzzles.
If she solved three crossword puzzles and eight Sudoku puzzles during the weekend, then she spent a total of 3 × 15 = 45 minutes on crosswords and 8 × 5 = 40 minutes on Sudokus."
Response:  We know that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. Now, she can collect double the amount of rainwater as there was left in the tank before. So, if there were 120 liters of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, then there are now 120 x 2 = 240 liters of water in the tank. Therefore, there are 240 liters of water in the tank now.
"Response: 
Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 smaller petunias than geraniums. So he has 90 + (40 - 30) = 120 plants in total."
Response:  In year one, the company spends $15,000 on advertising. Since it spends a third of that amount in the second year, we can assume that it spends $5,000 on advertising in the second year (since $15,000 / 3 = $5,000). So, the total amount spent on advertising over both years is $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
"Response: 
Carlos pays $30 per hour to rent the canoe, so he will pay:
$30 x 3 hours = $90
Benji pays $18 per hour to rent the paddleboat, so he will pay:
$18 x 5 hours = $90
So both of them will pay $90 in total."
"Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and half that time (3 days) to return by car, then we can calculate the total number of days as follows:
Total days = Bus journey + Car journey / 2
= 6 + (3/2)
= 8
Therefore, if Andrew plans to take a trip from New Jersey to Rochester with a combination of bus and car, he will need to spend 8 days for the entire trip."
Response:  We know that James has 40 water-type cards initially. If he loses 8 of them, he will have 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards left. Now, if he buys 14 more water-type cards, he will have 32 + 14 = 46 water-type cards in total. So, the probability of an randomly drawn card being water type is 46/90 or approximately 0.505 (rounded to nearest whole number).
"Response: 
Chad ordered a ""build your own burrito"" for breakfast and it cost him $6.50. He added extra meat for $2, extra cheese for $1, avocado for $1, and two sacks of tortilla chips for $0.25 each. Then he decided to upgrade his meal for an additional $3, which included chips and a drink. Finally, he used his $5 gift card to pay for the remaining balance. So, how much does Chad owe?
Total cost = $6.50 + $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.25 x 2 = $9.75
Gift card amount = $5
Final payment = $9.75 - $5 = $4.75"
"Response: 
Kalinda can add 4 pieces in one minute, so she will be able to complete 24 pieces (4 x 6) in an hour.
Her mother can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is 12 pieces per minute. So her mother will take 2 hours to complete the puzzle (12 x 60).
Therefore, it will take them a total of 4 hours to complete the puzzle."
Response:  We know that out of 120 baby watermelons, 30 were ready for harvest after two months (Ashlyn took them home). So, there are 90 remaining watermelons (120 - 30 = 90). Then, when Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest (meaning 75 watermelons were left, since 3/4 is equal to 75/4 = 18.75). Therefore, there were 18 watermelons not yet ready for harvest after those two weeks (75 - 18 = 57).
"Response: 
Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars at a cost of $240,000 ($20,000 x 12).
He pays 10% of the sales tax on each car, which is $2,000 ($20,000 x 10%).
Additionally, he pays $1,000 for registration fees per car, so that's another $12,000 ($1,000 x 12).
Therefore, Mark pays a total of $262,000 ($240,000 + $2,000 + $12,000) for all 12 cars."
Response:  On Monday (Mandag), Kylie collected 5 shells more than Robert, which means she collected 30 shells in total (5 + 20 = 30). Now, on Tuesday (Tirsdag), Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collects 60 shells (30 x 2 = 60). Therefore, Kylie collects 60 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  If there are 50 myrs in the garden and each myr finds half as many insects as it does, then the total number of insects found by all the myrs is 50 x (1/2) = 25 insects. Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 50 + 25 = 75 insects.
Response:  We know that 36 penguins are sunbathing in the snow. Two-thirds of them (24) go into the cave to eat their lunch. So, there are 12 penguins left outside to sunbathe. Therefore, the correct answer is 12.
Response:  If Steve eats double the amount of tomatoes than his girlfriend and he eats six times a day, then he eats 6 x 2 = 12 tomatoes per day. Since one plant can produce three tomatoes per week, Steve will need 4 plants (12 / 3 = 4).
Response:  We know that there are 20 friends in total and each friend wants to have 4 slices of pizza. Since pizzas can only be sold in 8 portions, we need to divide 8 by 4 to find out how many portions of pizza John needs to buy. So, John needs to buy 2 portions of pizza (answer: 2).
Response:  If he can save money by mixing ink from five empty pens to one full pen, then we know that each full pen contains 1/5 of the total amount of ink. Therefore, if he buys 25 kuglepenne and uses them all up, he will have used up 25 x 1/5 = 5 full pens of ink. So, he will get 5 kuglepenne back after using them all up.
Response:  If Johnny had $20 in his pocket and added another $10, he would have a total of $30. Then, if he invested this amount and it tripled over the course of a year, he would have $90 after one year ($30 x 3 = $90).
Response:  We know that Mary is younger than Joan and Joan is older than Jessa. So, we can start with Joan's age: Joan - 5 = 15 years old (Joan is 15 years old). Then, we know that Jessa is 20 years old, so Jessa's age is 20. Finally, we add up all their ages: 15 + 20 = 35 years old. Therefore, the sum of the three girls' ages is 35 years old.
"Response:  We know that 30% of students left through entrance A, so there are 700 students remaining in the hall (1000 - 30%). Then, we have:

* 3/5 of the remaining students left through entrance B, which means 600 students left through entrance B (700 x 3/5).
* The remaining 400 students left through entrance C.

So, the total number of students who left through entrance C is:

400 = 700 - 600

Therefore, the answer is 280 students (700 - 400) who left through entrance C."
"Response:  We know that James has 6 more sweets than Robert and John has twice as many sweets as Robert. So, if John has 54 sweets, then Robert has x sweets (since John has double the number of sweets). Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:

James has 6 more sweets than Robert, so James has x + 6 = 54 sweets.
Solving for x, we get:
x = 48 sweets.
So, John has 2(48) = 96 sweets more than Robert."
Response:  If both Dolly and Pandora have one book each, then together they will read 2 books. If they also read their own books, then the total number of books they will read is 4 (2 + 2). Therefore, the answer is 4.
"Response: 
Mike is no longer pen pals with two of them, so he sends out five letters in total each week. Each letter is six pages long, and he can write one page every 6 minutes. Therefore, he writes for 36 minutes per week (5 letters x 6 pages/letter x 6 minutes/page = 36 minutes)."
Response:  We know that Jason has 1000 minutes in total per month. He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, which is equal to 15 x 30 = 450 minutes. Additionally, he spent 300 extra minutes talking to other people this month, which brings us to a total of 450 + 300 = 750 minutes used so far. Therefore, Jason has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left for the rest of the month.
"Response:  We know that:
Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her French fries, which means she gave him at least 5 French fries (since a handful is typically considered to be around 5 items).
Colby took 3 fewer French fries than Kyle took. So if Kyle took x French fries, then Colby took x - 3 French fries.
Griffin had 27 French fries left after everything happened. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x + (x - 3) = 27
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x - 3 = 27
Adding 3 to both sides gives us:
2x = 30
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
x = 15
So Ginger gave Griffin at least 5 French fries, and Colby took 3 fewer French fries than Kyle did, so together they took 8 French fries from Griffin."
"Response:  We know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in these two aquariums is twice as large as the number of fish in both aquariums. So if both aquariums have the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium? 
We can start by using the information given in the question:
Let x be the number of fish in the first aquarium. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice as large as the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write:
x + 4 = 2(32)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
x + 4 = 64
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:
x = 60
So there are 60 fish in the first aquarium and 32 fish in the second aquarium."
"Response: 
Jeans makes $250 per hour as a makeup artist. Since she needs to do her makeup every day for 6 hours (which is equivalent to 48 hours in total), and since the movie takes 5 weeks to complete, we can calculate how much money Jean earns during that time as follows:
Week 1-3: 48 hours/week x $250/hour = $11,700
Week 4-5: 48 hours/week x $250/hour = $11,700
Total amount earned by Jean = $23,400
Since Jean does the same work four times a week, she works a total of 160 hours (4 times 48 hours) during those five weeks. So, her total earnings are:
$23,400 x 160 hours = $3,696,000
After completing the movie, Jean gives 10% discount to Jean, which means she gets $3,356,800 ($3,696,000 x 10%)."
Response:  We know that Isabella spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on birthday gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on party favors for guests. Since she divided the cost equally among three people (her two parents), each person had to pay $10 x 3 = $30. So, each person paid $30 towards the total cost of $100.
Response:  The cook bought 4 packages of potatoes. Each package weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of all the potatoes is 200 pounds (4 packages x 50 pounds per package). Since each pound of potatoes costs $1.50, the total cost of all the potatoes is $300 ($1.50 per pound x 200 pounds). Therefore, the cook spent $300 on potatoes.
Response:  On Monday, Sue and her sister each ate x kager. Since Sue ate more than her sister, she ate x + 5 kager. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many kager as her sister, so she ate (x + 5) × 2 = 2x + 10 kager. In total, Sue ate x + 5 + 2x + 10 = 4x + 15 kager. Since her sister ate 5 kager on Monday, she ate a total of 5 + 13 = 18 kager. So, Sue ate 4x + 15 - 18 = 7kager more than her sister.
