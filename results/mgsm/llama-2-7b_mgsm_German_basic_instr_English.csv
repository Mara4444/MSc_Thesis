Explanation:
In the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times. In the second month, it was downloaded 3 x 60 = 180 times (thrice as much). In the third month, it was downloaded 60 - 30% of 60 = 42 times (30% less than in the second month). Therefore, the total number of downloads during these three months is: 60 + 180 + 42 = 210."

Explanation: To calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to earn money with his lemon tree, we need to consider two factors: the cost of planting and maintaining the tree, and the revenue he can generate from selling lemons. Let's assume that Carlos plants the tree today and starts selling lemons immediately. In the first year, he will have to spend $90 on planting and maintenance costs, but he will only receive $10 (7 x $1.50) in revenue. Therefore, the net profit in the first year is $80 ($90 - $10).
In subsequent years, the situation is as follows:
Year 2: Planting and maintenance costs remain at $90, while revenue increases to $14 (7 x $2.00). Net profit is $76 ($90 - $14).
Year 3: Planting and maintenance costs increase to $108 ($90 + $18), while revenue remains at $14. Net profit is $94 ($108 - $14).
And so on. Using this pattern, we can calculate the total net profit over time as follows:
Total net profit = ($90 x 70) + ($108 x 68) + ($136 x 66) +...
where n is the number of years since planting. Solving for n, we get approximately 62 years. Therefore, it will take Carlos about 62 years to break even on his investment and start making a profit from his lemon tree."

"Response: 7436.92
Explanation: To calculate the expected value of the two options, we need to use the Black-Scholes model. Let's assume that the risk-free interest rate is 2%, and the volatility of both markets is 20%. Using these inputs, we can calculate the option prices using the Black-Scholes formula. For the gold market, the price of the call option with a strike price of $5,000 and a time to expiration of one month is approximately $25.67. For the electronics market, the price of the call option with a strike price of $8,000 and a time to expiration of one month is approximately $14.33. Since the Händler wants to make the maximum profit, he should choose the option with the higher price. Therefore, the expected value of the two options is: Expected Value = ($25.67 + $14.33) / 2 = $7436.92."

Explanation: To find out how much water is left after adding 10 liters of orange juice to 24 liters of water and then spilling one liter of it, we need to subtract the amount of water that was spilled from the total volume of liquid available for mixing. In this case, there are 23 liters (24 - 1) of liquids available for mixing. Since three-fifths of these liters are equal to 15 liters of ananas getränk with two-thirds water, we can calculate the remaining water as follows: 23 - 15 = 8 liters of water remain in the container."

Therefore, if she covers 3 miles per hour while hopping, she will cover 6 miles (2 x 3 = 6) in an hour. Since she has six hours to complete the task, she will be able to cover a total distance of 6 x 6 = 36 miles."

This means that with the Sapphire stone, Polly can throw the spear 3 x 400 = 1200 feet (365 meters) beyond the range of the dragon's flames. Since the dragon's flames only reach up to 1000 feet (305 meters), this means that Polly could stand at a distance of 800 feet (243 meters) from the dragon and still hit it with the golden spear even if the dragon is firing its flames."

"Response: 16 hours
Explanation: To calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over three days, we need to multiply the number of articles written each day by the time taken to write each article.

Day 1 (Monday): Number of articles = 5; Time per article = 4 hours
Total hours = 5 x 4 = 20 hours

Day 2 (Tuesday): Number of articles = 2/5 = 0.4; Time per article = 4 hours
Total hours = 0.4 x 4 = 1.6 hours

Day 3 (Wednesday): Number of articles = 2; Time per article = 4 hours
Total hours = 2 x 4 = 8 hours

Adding up all these hours gives us a total of 20 + 1.6 + 8 = 39.6 hours. Therefore, Meredith has spent approximately 39.6 hours writing articles over the three days."

Explanation: To find out how many toys he needs to take out of his bag, we need to subtract the weight of the comics from the total weight of the bag. The bag weighs 15 pounds (lb), and each comic book weighs 1/4 lb. Therefore, the number of comics he can remove is 15 / 1/4 = 60 comics. Since each toy weighs 1/2 lb, he has to remove 60 / 1/2 = 60 toys from the bag."

Since no last wagon tires were repaired on Friday, the mechanic only earned money from car tire repair, which is $12 x 12 = 144 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money the mechanic made that day is $520 + $144 = 380 dollars."

"Response: 32 kits
Explanation: To find out how many kits the truck can carry without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we need to subtract the total weight of the truck and its driver from the maximum weight that the bridge can handle. The calculation is as follows:
Maximum weight of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Total weight of truck and driver = 3755 pounds (given)
Number of kits the truck can carry = Maximum weight of the bridge - Total weight of truck and driver
= 5000 - 3755
= 1245 pounds
Since each kit weighs 15 pounds, the number of kits the truck can carry is equal to the remaining weight in pounds divided by the weight of one kit:
Number of kits = Remaining weight / Weight of one kit
= 1245 / 15
= 83 kits
So, the truck can carry up to 83 kits without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. However, since you cannot divide a whole number of kits into fractional parts, the maximum number of kits the truck can carry is rounded down to 32 kits."

Explanation: To calculate the total amount that Aleena will pay for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to find the monthly cost for each half of the year and then add them up. For the first half of the year (January to June), the original price of $140 is charged, so the total amount paid in this period is $140 x 6 = $840. For the second half of the year (July to December), the discounted price of $130 is charged, so the total amount paid in this period is $130 x 6 = $780. Therefore, the total amount that Aleena will pay for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $780 = $1620."

After that, she must feed him 2 tins of dog food per day for the rest of his life. Since there are 110 portions in each tin, and Cecilia must feed her puppy 1 tin per day for 6 months, she will use 6 x 110 = 660 portions of dog food in total during the first year.

"Response: 15
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. This means that if Marcia has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets.
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. So, if Cindy has y pets, then Marcia has y + 2 pets.
The total number of pets among all three is equal to the sum of their individual pet numbers. Therefore, we can write an equation based on the above information:
3x = y + 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 7
So, Jan has 3(7) = 21 pets, Marcia has (7 + 2) = 9 pets, and Cindy has 4 pets. Therefore, the total number of pets among all three is 21 + 9 + 4 = 34 pets."

"Response: 7500$/day
Explanation:
The number of patients per day is given as 500. Each patient takes an average of 24 minutes for the examination, so the total time spent on examinations per day is:

500 patients x 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes/day

Since each doctor charges $150/hour and there are 24 hours in a day, the revenue from doctors' consultations per day is:

12,000 minutes/day x $150/hour = $360,000/day

Similarly, the hospital charges each patient $200/hour, and there are also 24 hours in a day, so the revenue from hospital consultations per day is:

$360,000/day x $200/hour = $720,000/day

Adding up the revenues from both sources gives us the total daily profit of the hospital:

$360,000 + $720,000 = $1,080,000/day

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $1,080,000 per day from these consultations."

So, the total number of bees in the hive is 700 + 700 + 700 = 2100 bees. However, since we were asked how many worker bees there are, we can subtract the number of baby bees from the total to get our answer: 2100 - 700 = 1400 worker bees."

Explanation: If Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day and works part-time for 5 days a week (assuming he has one day off), then he would work for 20 hours per week (5 days x 4 hours/day). At $10/hour, he would earn $200 per week from his job. Subtracting this amount from the total time spent playing video games (2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week) gives us the total time spent playing video games without working: 14 hours/week x 2 hours/day = 28 hours/week. Therefore, Jordan would spend approximately 28 hours/week playing video games without working, which is equivalent to $80/week based on the hourly wage of $10/hour."

"Response: 1750
Explanation: The first Lego set has 500 parts, and since Johnny has placed all of them on the ground, he has lifted 500 klotses (or pieces). The second set has three times as many pieces as the first one, so Johnny has lifted an additional 1500 pieces (3 x 500 = 1500). Finally, the third set has only 1/4 of the number of pieces in the first two sets combined, which is 1250 pieces (500 + 1500 - 1250 = 1250). Therefore, Johnny has lifted a total of 1750 clotses (500 + 1500 + 1250 = 1750)."
"Response: 90
Explanation: According to the passage, each of the first 6 hours saw 30 bees leave and return, for a total of 180 bees (30 x 6). Since there were twice as many bees that left but did not return as there were bees that returned, there must have been 4 times as many bees that left as there were bees that returned, or 720 bees (4 x 180). However, since some of these bees had already returned by the end of the day, the number of bees that actually returned during the last 6 hours was 90 (720 - 180 = 90)."

Explanation: To find out how much money Carl will get in change, we need to calculate the total cost of the 10 Kekspackungen he bought. Since each pack contains 6 Kekse and each Keks costs $0.10, the total cost of one pack is:

6 Kekse x $0.10 = $0.60 per pack
Since Carl bought 10 packs, the total cost of his purchase is:

$0.60 x 10 = $6.00
Therefore, Carl will receive $6.00 in change."

"Response: 578 feet
Explanation:
To find out how long all of Bill's bread is, we need to multiply the number of each item by its length. So, for example, if he has 300 brötchen, each of which is 4 inches long, that means they are 300 x 4 = 1200 inches long. Similarly, if he has 120 croissants, each of which is 6 inches long, that means they are 120 x 6 = 720 inches long. And if he has 60 baguettes, each of which is two feet long, that means they are 60 x 2 = 120 feet long.
Adding up these lengths gives us a total of 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, this means that Bill's bread is 2040 / 12 = 167 feet long."
"Response: 600 bananas
Explanation: To determine how many bananas the zookeeper must buy for two months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required by all the monkeys in the zoo over that period. The gorillas require 400 bananas per month, so they will consume 800 bananas (400 x 2) during the two-month period. Similarly, the pavians require 100 bananas per month, so they will consume 200 bananas (100 x 2) during the same period. Therefore, the total number of bananas required by all the monkeys in the zoo is:

Total banana requirement = 800 + 200 = 1000 bananas
Since the zookeeper buys bananas from a local farm every two months, he needs to buy twice as many bananas to last for two months:

Number of bananas to be bought = Total banana requirement / 2 = 1000 / 2 = 500 bananas
Therefore, the zookeeper must buy 500 bananas to ensure that all the monkeys in the zoo are fed for two months."

On the other hand, Kelly ran once from the 40-yard line to the opposite end zone and back, which is a distance of 40 + (40 - 40) = 80 yards. Since Kelly ran less than Blake, Blake is the winner and has run further than Kelly by a distance of 1500 - 80 = 1420 yards."

"Response: 25 feet
Explanation:
The tank had 7 feet more water than it did on Monday, so its depth on Wednesday is:
Wednesday = Monday + 7 = 17 + 7 = 24 feet
Then, we are told that the depth of the tank on Wednesday is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:
Depth of tank on Wednesday = (Tuesday depth / 3) x 2/3
Substituting the given values, we get:
Depth of tank on Wednesday = (24 / 3) x 2/3 = 25 feet
Therefore, the depth of the tank on Wednesday is 25 feet."

"Response: 1847$
Explanation: To calculate how much Jessica will pay each month, we need to find out her total debt and then divide it by the minimum payment required for each loan. Let's assume that she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each loan. So, if the minimum payment for her student loan is $300 per month, she will pay $450 ($300 + (50% of $300)) = $450 per month. Similarly, if the minimum payment for her credit card is $200 per month, she will pay $300 ($200 + (50% of $200)) = $300 per month. And if the minimum payment for her mortgage is $500 per month, she will pay $675 ($500 + (50% of $500)) = $675 per month. Now, let's calculate how much she will pay in a year: For her student loan, she will pay $450 x 12 = $5400 per year. For her credit card, she will pay $300 x 12 = $3600 per year. And for her mortgage, she will pay $675 x 12 = $8100 per year. Therefore, Jessica will pay a total of $16,100 in a year."

Explanation:
To find out how long it will take Billy to prepare all 60 kartoffsels, we need to calculate the time he needs for each kartoffel and then multiply that by the number of kartoffeln.
Since he needs approximately 1.5 minutes to shael one kartoffel and only 0.05 minutes to chop them small, he will need:

1.5 minutes/kartoffel x 60 kartoffeln = 90 minutes (or 1 hour and 30 minutes)
So, Billy will need about 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete the kartoffel preparation task."

Explanation: According to the question, Sandra had four times as many red roses as white narcissus in her order. Therefore, if Fred does not deliver the missing red roses by 5 PM, Sandra will switch suppliers and Fred will lose the order. To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 PM to keep the order, we can divide the number of red roses that Sandra originally ordered (4 times the number of white narcissus) by 5. This gives us 80 red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 PM to retain the order."

"Response: 60%
Explanation: A six-sided die has two numbers less than or equal to 3 and four numbers greater than 3. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 4/6 = 2/3. Since two consecutive even numbers are always even, the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is 1/6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 after rolling an even number is (2/3) \* (1/6) = 20%. Similarly, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 after rolling an odd number is also 20%. Thus, the probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 after rolling either an even or odd number is 40% (20% + 20%)."

Explanation: To determine how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford her shoes and belt, we need to calculate her total earnings from her part-time job. Her hourly wage is $8, so if she works for x hours, her total earnings will be $x \times 8 = 8x. We know that the cost of the shoes is $320, and the cost of the belt is $32, so together they cost $352. Therefore, Lori needs to work enough hours to earn at least $352 - $8 = $344. Since $344 / $8 = 42.5 hours, Lori needs to work for approximately 42.5 hours before she can afford her shoes and belt."
"Response: 13748.92
Explanation: To calculate Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of paying $165 per month, we need to use the formula:
Remaining Balance = Initial Amount - (Monthly Payments x Number of Months)
In this case, the initial amount is $2000, and the number of months is 12. The monthly payments are $165. Therefore, the calculation would be as follows:
Remaining Balance = $2000 - ($165 x 12) = $13748.92
So, Janeth's restguthabe will be $13748.92 by the end of 12 months."

Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
* Vier Schüler erzielten eine Summe von 251 Punkten in einem Brettspiel. (This means that the total number of points scored by all four students is 251.)
* Naomi erzielte 68 der Punkte. (So Naomi scored 68 points out of the total 251 points.)
* Yuri erzielte 10 Punkte mehr als halb so viele wie Naomi. (Yuri scored 10 more points than half of Naomi's score, which is equal to 68/2 = 34 points.)
* Brianna erzielte 17 Punkte mehr als Naomi. (Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi, which is equal to 68 + 17 = 85 points.)
* Jojo erzielte x Punkte. (We are asked to find out how many points Jojo scored.)

From the above information, we can set up the following equation:
x = 251 - (68 + 34 + 85)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 43

Therefore, Jojo scored 43 points in the game."

Explanation: To calculate the probability of drawing a Water-type card when James has 8 Water-type cards and buys 14 Plant-type cards, we need to use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B).
In this case, A represents ""drawing a Water-type card"" and B represents ""buying 14 Plant-type cards.""
We know that James already has 8 Water-type cards, so P(A ∩ B) = 8/30 = 0.267 or approximately 26.7%.
The total number of cards he bought is 14 + 8 = 22, so P(B) = 22/50 = 0.44 or approximately 44%.
Therefore, the probability of drawing a Water-type card is: P(A|B) = 0.267 / 0.44 = 0.60 or approximately 60%."

Explanation: To calculate the total cost of the fleet of cars for Mark's company, we need to consider three factors: the purchase price of each car, the tax rate applied to the cars, and the registration fee per car.

Purchase price of each car = $20,000 x 12 = $240,000
Tax rate = 10% of $240,000 = $24,000
Registration fee per car = $1,000 x 12 = $12,000
Total cost of the fleet of cars = Purchase price + Tax + Registration fees
= $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000
= $376,000
Rounded to two decimal places, the total cost of the fleet of cars is $376,000."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* ""Es gibt 36 sich sonnende Pinguine im Schnee."" means that there are 36 penguins basking in the snow.
* ""Ein Drittel davon springt hinein und schwimmt im Ozean."" means that one-third of the basking penguins (12 penguins) jump into the ocean.
* ""Ein weiteres Drittel geht in die Höhle, um zu Abend zu fressen."" means that another third of the basking penguins (12 penguins) go to the cave to eat dinner.

Now, let's calculate the number of basking penguins left:

Initially, there were 36 basking penguins.
After one-third jumped into the ocean, there were 36 x 0.3 = 12 less basking penguins.
So, the remaining basking penguins are 36 - 12 = 24.

Therefore, there are 24 basking penguins still present in the area."

He spends 15 minutes per day talking to his boss, which amounts to 45 minutes per week (since there are 7 days in a week). This means he uses up 45 minutes of his total allowance each week.
Since this month has 30 days, Jason uses up 1350 minutes (45 x 30 = 1350) of his total allowance during the month.
This leaves him with 645 minutes (1000 - 1350 = 645) remaining at the end of the month."

Explanation: According to the question, Kyle took 5 Pommes frites from Griffin, which means that Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 Pommes frites left. Then, Billy took double the number of Pommes frites that Kyle took, which is 2 times 5 = 10 Pommes frites. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 Pommes frites left after Billy took his share. Next, Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her own Pommes frites, which is not specified in the question but could be assumed to be a small amount (e.g., 3-4). Finally, Colby took 3 Pommes frites less than the number that Kyle took, which is 3 - 5 = -2 Pommes frites. Therefore, Griffin ended up with 9 + 3 = 12 Pommes frites. Since Ginger gave Griffin an additional 8 Pommes frites, Griffin had a total of 12 + 8 = 20 Pommes frites at the end."

Explanation: Let's call the number of fish in each aquarium x and y respectively. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums, we can write:
x - y = 2(y)
Now, if both aquariums have the same number of fish (i.e., x = y), then we can substitute this value for y in the above equation:
x - y = 2(y) --> x - 2y = 0
Solving for x, we get:
x = 16
Therefore, there are 16 fish in each aquarium."

Explanation: On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, which means she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, she doubled that amount and ate 2 x 20 = 40 cookies. In total, Sue consumed 20 + 40 = 60 cookies. Since each cookie contains 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 60 x 200 = 12,000 calories more than her sister."
