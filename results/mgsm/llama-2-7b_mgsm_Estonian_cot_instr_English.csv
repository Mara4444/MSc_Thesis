Response:  The number of days in January is 31. If there are 4 weeks in each month and 7 days in a week, then there are 28 days in a week. So, if we have 16 Mondays in January, that means we have 16 x 7 = 112 days left for the rest of the month. Now, let's calculate how many parties Farmer John can attend per day: he has 4 hours to spend with his friends every day, so he can attend 4/60 = 0.007 parties per day. Since there are 112 days left in the month after the first 16 Mondays, Farmer John can attend 112 x 0.007 = 0.794 parties in total during the remaining days of January.
Response:  If we have two blue balls and want to know how many of them can fit in a small box, we need to consider the volume of each ball and compare it with the volume of the box. The volume of a sphere (such as a ball) is given by the formula V = (4/3) \* π \* r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere. Since we don't know the exact size of the box, let's assume it has a volume of 1 cubic meter. Now, if we divide the volume of the box by the volume of one ball, we get the number of balls that can fit in the box: Number of balls = Volume of box / Volume of one ball ≈ 1000 / (4/3) \* π \* (r)^3 ≈ 267.59 balls. So, approximately 268 blue balls can fit in a small box with a volume of 1 cubic meter.
Response:  If Maya has $80,000 in her account and she withdraws $50,000 for repairs, then her remaining balance is $30,000 ($80,000 - $50,000). Since the repair cost increased the value of the property by 150%, we can calculate the new value of the property as follows: New Value = Old Value x (1 + Percentage Increase) New Value = $30,000 x (1 + 150%) New Value = $45,000 So, if Maya spends $50,000 on repairs, her remaining balance will be $30,000, and the value of the property after repairs will increase to $45,000.
Response:  If James can run 3 sprints in 3 kilometers per day, then he will cover a distance of 9 km (3 x 3) during one day. To calculate how many meters he will have covered in one day, we need to convert the distance from kilometers to meters. There are 1000 meters in 1 kilometer, so James will have covered a total distance of 9000 meters (9 km x 1000 m/km) during one day.
"Response:  If Iga can make 3 baskets of apples every day, and each basket contains 4-6 apples, then in one week (7 days) she will have made:

* 3 x 7 = 21 baskets of apples per week

If she has already made 15 baskets of apples, then she still needs to make:

* 21 - 15 = 6 more baskets of apples this week

So, if Wendi's horse is able to carry 20 baskets of apples, then Iga will be able to sell all her apples this week."
"Response:  The cost of one class is $5, and each higher class has a price that is 60% more than the previous one. So, the cost of the next class will be:
$5 + ($5 x 60%) = $5 + $3 = $8
The total cost for all 16 classes would be:
$8 x 16 = $128"
Response:  We know that there are more than four bridges in Charleston compared to Seattle because we were told that Charleston has 4 times as many bridges as Seattle. Therefore, if there are x bridges in Charleston, then there will be 4x bridges in Seattle. Now, we are asked how many bridges there are in Toulouse. Since Toulouse has twice as many bridges as Charleston, and Charleston has 4 times as many bridges as Seattle, we can conclude that Toulouse has 8x bridges (2 x 4 x x). Finally, since Seattle has 20 bridges, we can say that Toulouse has 8x - 20 = 6x bridges. So, the answer is 6x.
Response:  The total amount of data to be transferred is 200 GB. If we can transfer 2 GB per minute, it will take approximately 40 minutes (200 / 2 = 40) to transfer the entire dataset. However, as you mentioned that there are some issues with Windows installation and it takes around 20 minutes to complete the installation process for each time, then Carla needs to perform the initial transfer at least 4 times (20 / 4 = 5). Therefore, the number of times Carla needs to perform the initial transfer is 5.
Response:  Firstly, John walked for 3 hours and then rested for 2 hours. After that, he walked again for another 2 hours and covered 30 miles. Finally, he took a break of 1 hour before walking for 4 more hours to cover additional 80 miles. Therefore, the total distance John traveled is 110 miles (80 + 30).
"Response:  If Eliza works for 40 hours per week and earns $10 per hour, then her total income in one month is: 
$10/hour x 40 hours/week = $400/week
If she works for 45 days in a month, then her total income in that month would be:
$400/week x 45 days/month = $18,000/month
So if Eliza works for 45 days in a month, her total income will be $18,000."
Response:  The first time (period), the total amount of listening was $60, and there were 4 people who listened to it. So, each person heard $15 worth of content ($60 / 4). Now, let's assume that in the second period, the number of listeners increased by 20%, which means they are now 5 people who listened to the content (instead of 4). However, since the total amount of content available is still $60, the average amount of content each listener got decreased by 30% (from $15 to $10). Therefore, each listener in the second period heard $10 worth of content ($60 / 5). In the third period, there were again 5 listeners, but this time, the total amount of content available had been reduced to $40 (since some of it was already consumed in the previous periods). So, each listener in the third period heard only $8 worth of content ($40 / 5). Finally, we have $8 as our answer for how much content each person could consume during the three-period experiment.
Response:  The total cost of the three large cupcakes is $68 + $80 = $148. And the total cost of six small juice boxes is $55. So, in total, they spent $148 + $55 = $203.
Response:  The total amount of money that Carlos has is $90. If he spends $7 on each of the next 9 years, then in the 9th year he will have spent a total of $63 ($7 x 9 = $63). So, after 9 years, Carlos will have $27 left ($90 - $63 = $27). Now, let's calculate how much time it takes for Carlos to save up enough money to buy the apple. Since he can save $3 per year, it will take him approximately 8 years to save up enough money to buy one apple ($27 / $3 = 8.67 years). Therefore, Carlos will be able to buy his first apple in the 8th year.
Response:  We know that there are five apples in total (Melanie has three and her friend has two). So, if Melanie gives one apple to her friend, then she will have four apples left. If she gives another apple to her friend later, she will have three apples left. Therefore, the number of apples Melanie had at the end is 3 + 2 = 5.
Response:  According to the question, out of 20 students who took part in dance lessons, 20% chose jazz as their favorite style and 25% preferred hip hop. This means that 5 students (20% x 25%) prefer hip hop. Therefore, more than half of the students (5/10) prefer hip hop.
Response:  If the investor wants to maximize their profits and has $5000 available for investment or $8000 available for investment, they will choose the option that gives them the highest return. The interest rate for the savings account is 2.5%, while the interest rate for the electronic shares is 1.2%. To calculate the maximum amount of money the investor can make with each option, we need to use the formula: Maximum profit = (Initial investment x Interest rate) / Number of years. For example, if the investor puts $5000 into a savings account at an interest rate of 2.5%, after one year they will have earned $125 in interest ($5000 x 2.5%). So the total value of the investment now is $5125. If the investor chooses to put this money into electronic shares instead, they will earn $64 in interest over two years ($5125 x 1.2%), bringing the total value of the investment to $5189. Therefore, the investor should choose the option that offers the higher return, which is the electronic shares.
"Response:  The distance traveled in one day is equal to the total distance divided by the number of days. In this case, the total distance is 80 miles and there are 7 days. So, the distance traveled each day is:

Distance = Total distance / Number of days
= 80 miles / 7 days
= 11.43 miles per day (approximately)"
"Response:  If Jill worked as an educator for 50 years and spent 35 years teaching and 15 years coaching, then we can calculate her annual income based on those numbers. So, if she earned $20 per hour as an educator and $30 per hour as a coach, here is how much money she made over those 50 years:
Educator income (35 years x $20/hour) = $700 per year
Coach income (15 years x $30/hour) = $450 per year
Total income over 50 years = $1,150 per year"
Response:  We have 3 eggs and we want to make 4 omelets. So, we need 12 eggs in total (3 x 4 = 12).
Response:  If Marissa takes 12 minutes to walk one mile and wants her average pace to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk for more than 3 hours to cover 8 miles. So, if she walks for 5 hours, she will have covered 20 miles (2 x 10 miles).
Response:  We have 10 liters of apple juice and we want to add 15 liters of orange juice. If we mix them equally, then there will be 3 liters of water in total (since water is approximately 87% of the volume). So, if we take away 3 liters of water from the 10 liters of apple juice, we get 7 liters of pure apple juice left. Now, let's assume that we want to mix this 7 liters of apple juice with 24 liters of water. Since we know that the mixture will contain 3 liters of water already, we can calculate the remaining amount of water as follows: 24 - 3 = 21 liters of water. Therefore, after mixing these two liquids together, we will have 7 + 21 = 28 liters of liquid in total.
Response:  According to the information given in the question, Raymon...
Response:  The first client will buy one DVD, so there are 7 left (7 - 1 = 6). The second client will buy two DVDs, leaving 5 left (6 - 2 = 5). The third client will also buy two DVDs, leaving 3 left (5 - 2 = 3). Finally, the last three clients will not buy any DVDs, leaving zero (3 - 0 = 0) in total. Therefore, Billy has 0 DVDs at the end of the day.
"Response:  If we have two sentences with 5 words each and we want to know how many words are left after reading one of them, then...

1. The first sentence has 5 words: ""Küünal sulab 2 sentimeetrit"".
2. After reading the first sentence, there are 4 words left: ""sulab 2 sentimeetrit"".
3. Now let's read the second sentence: ""IGA tunni jooksul, mis see põleb"".
4. After reading the second sentence, there are 3 words left: ""tunni jooksul"".

So, in total, there are 7 words left after reading both sentences: 4 + 3 = 7."
Response:  The original price of Kyle Ostos's eco-friendly travel bag was $19.50. If we get a 25% discount, the new price will be $14.375 ($.875 x $19.50). So, the amount saved is $5.125 ($19.50 - $14.375).
Response:  We know that Marie has $12 worth of canned goods (which costs $12), $5 worth of packaged juice ($5), and $4 worth of cheese ($4). In total, she has spent $21. So far, so good! Now we need to calculate how much money she has left after buying these items. If she had $50 initially, and she spent $21, then she has $29 left ($50 - $21 = $29). Finally, if she wants to buy more cheese, each unit costs $8.50, so if she buys x units, she will spend $x \* 8.50 =? dollars.
Response:  We know that one pair of shoes costs $16.50 and three pairs cost $49.50. One single shoe costs $22.50 and three singles cost $67.50. So, if Mishka buys all these shoes, she will spend a total of: $16.50 + $49.50 = $66 for two pairs of shoes $22.50 + $67.50 = $90 for three pairs of shoes Therefore, Mishka spends a total of $66 + $90 = $156 dollars.
Response:  If Cynthia buys 15 portions of ice cream at $4 each and she has to pay for it within 60 days after purchasing, then...
Response:  The total distance traveled is given as 60 miles (pikkune). Henry walked for 20 miles (miili) before he reached his destination. So, the remaining distance to cover was 40 miles (miili). Now, we need to find out how much of this distance Henry covered during the first leg of his journey. We know that he covered 15 miles (miili) before reaching the halfway point (reisi lõppu), so he covered 15/40 = 37.5% of the remaining distance during the first leg of his journey. Therefore, the percentage of distance covered during the second leg of the journey is (1 - 37.5%) = 62.5%.
Response:  The first pair of shoes costs $60 and the second pair costs $33. So in total, they cost $93. Now let's see how much money each person has left after buying these two pairs of shoes. If the first person had $100 and spent $60 on the first pair of shoes, then they have $40 left. And if the second person had $70 and spent $33 on the second pair of shoes, then they have $37 left. Therefore, there is a difference of $23 between their amounts of money ($40 - $37 = $3).
"Response:  The time difference between Darrelli and Alleni is 7 minutes. If their past experiences are 162 years apart, then we can calculate how old Allen is relative to Darrelli as follows:
Allen's age = Darrelli's age + (162 - 7) years
Therefore, Allen is 155 years older than Darrelli."
Response:  The first jar contains 80 grams of jam, and the second jar has 20 grams less than that (60 grams). So, the difference between the two jars is 20 - 80 = -60 grams. Since there are three jars in total, we can calculate their average weight as follows: Average weight = Total weight / Number of jars = (-60 + 80 + 60) / 3 = 140 grams per jar. Therefore, the middle jar contains 140 grams of jam.
Response:  The time taken to complete one round of the race is 1.5 hours and there are 7 rounds in total. Therefore, the total time taken for all 7 rounds would be 7 x 1.5 = 10.5 hours.
Response:  We know that Gretchen has 110 coins and she wants to give some of them to her friend. If she gives 30 coins less than what she has, then we can calculate how many coins Gretchen has left. So, let's subtract 30 from 110: 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, Gretchen has 80 coins left after giving some to her friend.
Response:  We know that Aaron has more calligraphy pieces than Siobhan does. If Aaron has 6 more calligraphy pieces than Raymon...
"Response: 
Mike played table tennis for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the remaining time of 20 minutes, he scored at least 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:
4 + (25% of 20) = 4 + 5 = 9 points."
"Response:  Terry buys two yogurts for $2 each. If he wants to buy four yogurts that cost $5 each, how many days will it take him to save enough money if he spends $30 every 30 days?
Time taken = Total amount needed / Amount spent per time period
= $5 x 4 / $30
= 167 days
Therefore, Terry will be able to buy four yogurts in 167 days."
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, John bought $15 worth of LEGO sets and spent $20 on video games. This means he had $5 left over. To find out how many LEGO sets John bought, we can divide the amount of money he spent on LEGO sets ($15) by the cost of one set ($15 / 1 = 15). So, John bought 15 LEGO sets.
Response:  If John walked 60 miles in one day, he would have walked 20 miles per day on average for the next three days (since he walked 3 times as much on the first day). Therefore, John walked at a speed of 20/3 = 6.67 miles per hour.
Response:  If Dana takes 4 hours to walk from point A to point B and then back to point A again, how long will it take her to walk 3 miles if she walks at a constant speed of 2 miles per hour? If she can walk for 5 minutes without getting tired, how many times can she walk 0.6 miles in one minute before getting tired?
Response:  If Beni iPhone is two years older than Suzy iPhone and Suzy iPhone was born in January, then Beni iPhone was born in January of the previous year. So, if Suzy iPhone was born in January, then Beni iPhone was born in December of the previous year. Therefore, Beni iPhone is one year older than Suzy iPhone.
Response:  If we assume that the dragon has 1000 jalas of gold coins and it gives 400 jalas to Polly, then Polly will have 600 jalas left (1000 - 400 = 600). Now if Polly buys a silver necklace for 300 jalas, she will have 300 jalas left (600 - 300 = 300). And if she buys another silver necklace for 200 jalas, she will have 100 jalas left (300 - 200 = 100). So in total, Polly will have 100 jalas of gold coins and 100 jalas of silver necklaces.
Response:  If Vanamea served 8 courses for each of the 5 tables, and there were initially 40 people at the event (including Vanamea), then the total number of people who had eaten something was 40 + 200 = 240. Since there were still 14 plates left over after everyone had finished eating, we can deduce that 240 - 14 = 226 people had eaten something.
Response:  We know that one serving of tofu contains 250 calories and we have 300 grams of tofu. If we divide it into 5 portions, each portion will contain 60 grams (300/5) of tofu. Now let's calculate how many calories are in each portion. The total number of calories for all five portions is equal to the total number of calories in one serving multiplied by the number of portions, so: Calories per portion = Total calories / Number of portions = 250 x 5 = 1250 calories. Therefore, if you consumed 1800 calories today and you had already eaten 1250 calories from tofu, then you still have 550 calories left to consume (1800 - 1250 = 550).
Response:  If Charlie sells each bunch of 10 stems for $10, then he will make $100 from selling 10 bundles. Now, if he has 20 bunches and he sells them at $2 per bundle, he will make $40 from those 20 bunches. So, in total, Charlie will make $140 from both sets of bunches.
Response:  The blogger writes 1-3 articles per week and spends about 4 hours per article. In total, she spends around 16-20 hours per week on writing articles. If we assume that she works 4 weeks in a month (which is a reasonable assumption), then her monthly workload would be around 64-80 hours per month.
Response:  We know that there are 80 Post-its in total and Candice bought 23 of them. So, we can calculate the number of Post-its per package as follows: Number of packages = Total number of Post-its / Number of Post-its per package = 80 / 23 = 3.48 packages (round to nearest whole number). Therefore, Candice bought approximately 3 packages of Post-its.
Response:  The cost of one pair of shoes is $100, and there are two pairs of shoes in total. So, the total cost of both pairs of shoes is $200. Since the second pair of shoes costs more than the first pair, we can say that the cost of the second pair is $80 (which is 50% more than the cost of the first pair). Therefore, if John buys 3 pairs of shoes, he will spend a total of $600 ($200 + $200 + $200).
Response:  We know that Tracy has 30 marbles in total and she gave 15 of them away. So, now Tracy has 30 - 15 = 15 marbles left. Therefore, the number of marbles that Tracy received is 15.
Response:  We have 15 courtyards and each courtyard has 8 windows. So we have 15 x 8 = 120 windows in total. Since 3/4 of the houses are occupied, we can assume that 3/4 of 120 = 90 windows are occupied. Therefore, there are 90 vacant windows out of 120 windows in total.
Response:  The cost of one mound of manure is $2. If Lloyd has sold 252 mounds of manure, then he has earned $2 x 252 = $504.
Response:  Tomi can walk at most 10 miles (16 kilometers). He has already walked for 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) so far. If he continues to walk at a speed of 5 km/h, it will take him approximately 2 hours to cover the remaining distance of 6 miles (9.7 kilometers). Therefore, Tomi will reach his destination in 2 + 4 = 6 hours.
Response:  If we have 15 balls of different weights and each ball has a weight of either 1 kg or 2 kg, then in total we have 15 x 2 = 30 kg of weight. So if we take 30 balls, then the total weight will be 30 x 1 kg + 30 x 2 kg = 60 kg.
Response:  The difference between the mechanic and car repair prices is $20 per unit ($.60 - $.40). If the mechanic repairs 6 cars in one day, he earns $60 (6 x $10), and if he repairs 4 cars, he earns $40 (4 x $10). On Wednesday, the mechanic repaired 8 cars, so he earned $80 ($10 x 8). Since he did not repair any more than 5 extra cars, his total income for that day was $90 ($80 + $10).
"Response:  We know that there are 7 children in total and they have adopted 5 cats. So, we can calculate the number of cats each child has adopted as follows:
Patchy (the first cat) has adopted 3 cats, since he is the only one who hasn't shared his cats with anyone else. Therefore, Patchy has 3 cats.
Trixie (the second cat) has adopted 4 cats, since she has shared her 2 cats with 2 other children. So, Trixie has 4 cats.
Now, let's count how many cats each child has adopted:
Child 1 has adopted 0 cats, since they haven't adopted any cats at all.
Child 2 has adopted 1 cat, since they have adopted Patchy's 1 cat.
Child 3 has adopted 2 cats, since they have adopted both Trixie's 2 cats.
Child 4 has adopted 3 cats, since they have adopted Patchy's remaining 2 cats.
Child 5 has adopted 4 cats, since they have adopted Trixie's last cat.
So, the final answer is:
Doubter (the fifth child) has adopted 5 cats."
Response:  Jean has 30 lemons and gives two to his friend. So he has 30 - 2 = 28 lemons left. Then, he buys two lollipops for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops Jean has is 28 + 2 = 30 lollipops.
Response:  If Peter spends $7 every day and $7 every evening, he will spend in total $14 per day (7 + 7). If there are 42 days in summer, then Peter will have spent altogether $584 ($14 x 42).
"Response:  We have to find out how much wood can be cut from each tree and then calculate the total amount of wood that can be obtained from all trees. The diameter of each tree is given as 50 cm, which means that there are 50 holes in every tree. Each hole has a volume of π/6 = 0.7854 cubic centimeters (cm³). Therefore, the total volume of wood in one tree is:

V = 50 x 0.7854 = 39.27 cm³

Now we need to know how many trees are available for cutting. There are 15 trees in total, but some of them are already cut down. So, let's assume that only 10 trees are left for cutting. The total volume of wood that can be obtained from these 10 trees is:

Vtotal = 10 x 39.27 = 392.7 cm³

Finally, we need to divide this total volume by the number of workers who will work together to get the maximum amount of wood that can be obtained per worker:

Maximum amount of wood per worker = Vtotal / Number of workers
= 392.7 / 3 = 130.9 cm³

So, the maximum amount of wood that can be obtained per worker is approximately 130.9 cm³."
Response:  Firstly, Stephen spent $40 on internet services. Then he got a discount of 25%, which means he paid $30 for those services instead of $40. Additionally, he was charged $4 in taxes, bringing the total cost to $34. So, Stephen's final cost for the internet services was $34.
Response:  We know that there are 6 clusters of apples and each cluster has 20 apple pieces. So, in total, we have 6 x 20 = 120 apple pieces. Now, let's find out how many big apples (marjas) are in this amount. There are 67 small apples (üksikut), so if we divide the number of big apples by the number of small apples, we get 120 / 67 = 1.85 big apples per small apple. Therefore, one big apple is equal to approximately 1.85 small apples.
Response:  We know that korvis has 25 apples and he gives 1 to millest. So, korvis has 24 apples left. Then, he gives 20% of his remaining apples (i.e., 24 x 0.2 = 4.8) to küpsed. So, korvis now has 24 - 4.8 = 19.2 apples left. Finally, he gives 2 apples to haprad and ülejäänud. So, korvis now has 19.2 - 2 = 17.2 apples left on his head. Therefore, the number of apples on korvis's head is 17.
Response:  The total cost of materials is $500 + $800 = $1300. If we take 10% off that amount, it will be $1300 x 0.9 = $1170. So the remaining amount after discount is $1170.
Response:  The person has worked for 40 years and will receive $50,000 per year in retirement. After 20 years of retirement, they will have received $100,000 ($50,000 x 2). If they continue working until age 60 (after 30 years), their total retirement savings would be $150,000 ($100,000 + $50,000).
Response:  The cost of the first pair of shoes is $140 and the discount for buying two pairs is 10%. So we need to calculate how much money she saved when buying two pairs. First, let's find out how much one pair costs after applying the discount: $140 x (1 - 0.10) = $126. Then, we can calculate the total amount of money she saved by multiplying the number of pairs she bought with the saving per pair: $126 x 2 = $252. Therefore, the final answer is $252.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sophia has driven for 160 kilometers after filling up her car with 4 gallons of gasoline. Therefore, she has used 160/4 = 40 gallons of gasoline during this drive. Since her car's fuel tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline, we can calculate how much is left in the tank as follows: 12 - 40 = 8 gallons. So, there are 8 gallons of gasoline left in Sophia's car tank.
Response:  If Jim takes two days to walk one kilometer and then rests for three days, he will cover a distance of 2 km in total during those four days. So, if he walks at this pace for 4 days, he will cover a distance of 8 km (2 x 2 = 4).
Response:  There are four schools and each school has five students. Therefore, there are 4 x 5 = 20 students in total. Now let's assume that every student has two teachers. So, there are 20 students x 2 teachers per student = 40 teachers in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 175 teemants in total and 35 of them are rubies. That means we have $ \frac{35}{175} = 0.2$ rubies per teemant. Now, let's count how many smaragdes there are: There are $ \frac{140}{175} = 0.8$ smaragdes per teemant. So, the number of smaragdes is $ 0.8 \times 175 = 140$. Therefore, the number of calligraphy stones needed to write the word ""Varanduse"" with the given proportions of rubies and smaragdes is: $$ \boxed{140} $$"
Response:  We have 60 students and 5 teachers. Each teacher can teach at most 12 students (since there are only 5 teachers). Therefore, we can accommodate up to 60/5 = 12 students per teacher. So, in total, we can accommodate 60 x 12 = 720 students.
Response:  If Bailey earns $6 per hour and works for 8 hours a day, then he earns $6 x 8 = $48 per day. Since he works for 5 days in a week, his total weekly income is $48 x 5 = $240. Therefore, if Bailey has been working for 100 days, his total income would be $240 x 100 = $24,000.
Response:  If Judy teaches for 5 days a week and has 8 classes per day, she will have 40 classes per week (5 days x 8 classes/day). If each class lasts for 45 minutes, then Judy spends approximately 1800 minutes teaching per week (40 classes x 45 minutes/class). Now, if Judy earns $15 per student per lesson, her total income from teaching per week is $750 ($15 x 50 students). Since Judy teaches for 4 weeks in a month, her total monthly income from teaching is $3000 ($750 x 4 weeks).
Response:  If there are two recipes for each of the three dishes (Kilian has 6 recipes), and Teisel has 4 more recipes than Kilian (Teisel has 10 recipes), then we can calculate that Teisel has 3 times as many recipes as Kilian (10/6 = 3). So, Teisel has 3 x 2 = 6 additional recipes to share with Kilian.
Response:  Tommy has $3 for brownies and $4 for cookies. If he buys 43 cookies and 23 cookie sandwiches, how much money does he have left? He will spend $3 + $4 = $7 on cookies. So, after buying cookies, Tommy will have $3 - $7 = $-4 left. Therefore, Tommy has $0 left.
Response:  Sheila has $150 to spend on mobile phones and she wants to buy three of them. Each phone costs $50, so she needs to spend $150 / 3 = $50 per phone. Since interest is 2%, let's calculate how much she will pay for each phone including interest: $50 x (1 + 0.02) = $51. So, if she buys three phones, she will pay a total of $153 ($51 x 3).
Response:  If Artie buys 12 pots of kalanchoe for $2.74 each, he will spend a total of $32.08 (12 x $2.74). Similarly, if he buys 9 pots of petunias for $1.87 each, he will spend a total of $16.53 ($1.87 x 9). And if he buys 17 pots of begonias for $2.12 each, he will spend a total of $35.34 ($2.12 x 17). So in total, Artie will spend $83.95 ($32.08 + $16.53 + $35.34) to buy all three types of plants.
Response:  If we have a 4-layer liivakambri with a cell size of $ \sqrt{2} $ and each layer has a number of cells equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ of the total number of cells in the next higher layer, then the number of cells in the topmost layer is $\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the ratio of the area of the topmost layer to the area of one square meter is $\frac{1}{8}$. So, if we want to find out how many square meters there are in a liivakambri with a height of $h$, we can use the formula: Area = Number of layers $\times$ Area per layer $\times$ Height. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{8} \times h}$.
Response:  If Cecilia has only one cat and it eats 180 grams of food per day, then she will need to feed her cat 2 times a day, since she wants to know how many bags of food she needs to buy for 3 months. So, if we assume that each bag contains 110 grams of food, then Cecilia will need to buy 3 bags of food in total (2 x 2 = 4 feedings/day x 3 months = 12 feedings). Therefore, the answer is 12 bags of food.
Response:  We know that Sarah has 400 neckties and she gives 25 of them to Raymond. So, we can say that Sarah gave 25% of her neckties (i.e., 25/400) to Raymond. Now, let's calculate how many neckties David received from Sarah. Since Sarah gave 25% of her neckties to Raymond, then David received 75% of her neckties (i.e., 75/400). Therefore, David received 175 neckties (i.e., 75% of 400).
Response:  If Vince can buy three kilograms of rice for $2.50 or four kilograms for $3.00, then he buys one kilogram for $2.50/4 = $625 per kilogram. So if he saves money by buying in bulk, he will save $6.25 per kilogram. Therefore, if he buys 18 kilograms more, he will save $110 ($6.25 x 18).
Response:  The interest rate is 30%, and the initial amount is $100. If you deposit money for one year, you will get $130 after one year (100 x 1.3 = 130). So if you withdraw $70 after one year, then your new balance would be $60 ($130 - $70 = $60).
Response:  We have two parts to this problem: finding out how many liters of water Kaks can carry in one trip and then dividing it among six people. So, if Kaks can carry 1/6 of 24 liters per trip, that means he can carry 24 / 6 = 4 liters per person. Therefore, the total amount of water each person got was 6 x 4 = 24 liters.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 10 balls in total. He gives away 21 balls to his friend at the beach and gets 23 of them back as souvenirs. So he has 9 balls left with him. Now, he uses 28 cards to decorate his beach house. How many balls does Charlie have left after using the cards? Therefore, Charlie has 9 - 28 = -19 balls left.
Response:  The total weight of all three people is equal to 120 kg (Grace + Alex + Naela). Since Grace weighs 40 kg and Alex weighs 30 kg, their combined weight is 70 kg. Therefore, Naela weighs 50 kg.
"Response:  We know that Dan has 3 suitcases (roosikarjas). Each suitcase can hold 25 items (roosi) in total. So, if we multiply the number of suitcases with the maximum capacity per suitcase, we get...

$$ \text{Number of items} = \text{Number of suitcases} \times \text{Maximum capacity per suitcase} $$
= 3 \times 25 = 75

So, there are 75 items in Dan's suitcases."
Response:  The number of players in each team is given as 22. If one team won more than eight corners, then we know that they have won at least 8 + x corners, where x is the difference between their score and the other team's score. So, if Team A won 10 corners more than Team B, then Team A won 10 + 8 = 18 corners.
Response:  The person was born in 1987 and is now 34 years old. Therefore, their age at present is 34 - 1987 = -1645 years.
Response:  The first cord is 3 meters long, and for each subsequent cord, it grows by half the length of the previous one. So, the second cord is 4.5 meters long (half of 3), the third cord is 6.75 meters long (half of 4.5), and so on. Therefore, the length of the nth cord is given by the formula: L = 3 + (n-1) \* 0.5.
Response:  The company has to pay $600 to each of its employees every month. If the policy is to reduce the salary of each employee by 10% every year for 5 years, then after 5 years, the salary will be reduced by 50%. So, if an employee was paid $600 per month initially, their salary would be $300 per month after 5 years ($600 x (1 - 0.1) ^ 5 = $300). Now, let's calculate how much Sylvie earned in total during her 5-year period at the company. She worked for the company for 3 years before the policy was implemented, so she earned $600 x 3 = $1800 during those 3 years. After that, she worked for another 2 years under the policy, earning $300 x 2 = $600 in total during those 2 years. Therefore, Sylvie earned a total of $1800 + $600 = $2400 during her 5 years at the company.
"Response:  If Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harry, and each record sold by Marilyn was worth $88, then...

Let M be the number of records sold by Marilyn (in millions)
Let H be the number of records sold by Harry (in millions)
We know that M = 10H
So we can write:
M = 10H
Substituting the value given in the question:
M = 10(88000) = 880000
Therefore, Marilyn sold 880,000 records more than Harry."
"Response:  The number of people invited to the party is given as 75, and each person has been asked to bring $2 as a contribution. So, the total amount collected from all guests will be:

$2 x 75 = $150

Therefore, if 1/4 of the guests (which is equal to 16) do not come, then the total amount collected will be:

$150 - ($16 x 1/4) = $136

So, the correct answer is $136."
Response:  We know that there are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 children at the picnic. Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pieces of bread, and each child eats as much as an adult. Therefore, the total amount of bread eaten by all dinosaurs is 20 x 10 = 200 pieces. Additionally, since there are 5 children, they eat a total of 5 x 10 = 50 pieces of bread. So, in total, 200 + 50 = 250 pieces of bread were eaten at the picnic.
Response:  We know that Marcia has two more lemurs than Cindy. So if Cindy has four lemurs, then Marcia has six lemurs (2 + 4 = 6). Therefore, if Cindy has twice as many lemurs as Kolm, then Kolm has half as many lemurs as Marcia (2 x 6 = 12). Finally, we can conclude that if Kolm has 12 lemurs and each lemur is worth $50, then Kolm has a total of $600 (12 x $50 = $600)
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackon and 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can write:
Amy = Jackson + 5
And also:
Corey = Jackson - 2
Now, we are told that James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey. So, we can write:
James = Corey - 1
Substituting these equations into each other, we get:
Amy = Jackson + 5
= (Jackson + 5) + (-2)
= Jackson + 3
So, Jackson is 3 years older than Amy. Therefore, Jackson is 3 + 5 = 8 years old.
Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Amy is 8 + 5 = 13 years old.
Similarly, Corey is 2 years younger than Jackson, so Corey is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.
Finally, since James is one year younger than Corey, James is 6 - 1 = 5 years old."
Response:  If Lee can run 400 meters in 38 seconds when he has been training for 2 months, and if Gerald reduces his diet by 10% which means that Gerald can run 400 meters in 44 seconds (since he reduced his weight by 10%). Then we have to find out how many seconds it takes Gerald to run 400 meters after reducing his diet. So, let's calculate the time difference between Lee and Gerald running 400 meters: Time difference = 38 - 44 = -6 seconds. Therefore, Gerald needs more than 38 seconds to run 400 meters after reducing his diet.
Response:  We have to find out how many lemming pairs are in total and then divide it by two because each pair has two kids. So, we can calculate as follows: Total number of lemmings = Number of lemming pairs x Number of kids per pair = 12 x 2 = 24 lemmings. Therefore, there are 24 lemmings in total.
Response:  We have 200 students in total and they are divided into two groups of 100 each. Each group has to choose either 3 or 4 leaders among them. If we assume that all the students in one group choose the same number of leaders (let's call it x), then the total number of leaders chosen by both groups is equal to twice x. Therefore, if x = 3, then there will be 6 leaders (2 times 3) and if x = 4, then there will be 8 leaders (2 times 4). So, the answer is 6 or 8, depending on whether the students in Group A chose 3 or 4 leaders respectively.
Response:  We know that Harry has 9 marbles and James has 2/3 of them, which means he has 6 marbles (since 2/3 is equal to 6). So, Harry has 9 - 6 = 3 more marbles than James. Therefore, Harry has 3 + 6 = 9 marbles in total.
"Response:  We know that Freda has 16 large tomatoes and she uses three of them for each dish. Therefore, the number of dishes Freda can make is:

Number of dishes = Number of tomatoes / Number of tomatoes used per dish
= 16 / 3
= 5
So, Freda can make 5 dishes with the given amount of tomatoes."
Response:  We have 20 cars that can pass through in 15 minutes and 5 cars that cannot pass through at all. So, we need to find out how many cars can pass through in total. The total number of cars is 20 + 5 = 25 cars.
Response:  Mary has 18 small animals and she wants to divide them equally among her four children so that each child gets an equal number of animals. Since there are 40 baskets in total, each basket will contain 4/5 of an animal (since 4 x 5 = 20). So, if we assume that one basket contains 1/5 of an animal, then Mary will have 18 / 5 = 3.6 animals left over after dividing them among her children. Therefore, the answer is 3.
Response:  The first bird flew 20 kilometers before Jerome opened his window, so the second bird flew 1/4 of that distance (5 kilometers) more than the first bird. Therefore, the third bird flew 3 times as far as the first bird (60 kilometers). So, there are $ \frac{60}{5} = 12 $ birds in total.
Response:  If there are 4 books for social studies, and each book has 20 pages, then in total we have 4 x 20 = 80 pages of social studies material to read. Similarly, if there are 3 books for history, and each book has 20 pages, then in total we have 3 x 20 = 60 pages of history material to read. For geography, there are 8 books with an average of 10 pages per book, so in total we have 8 x 10 = 80 pages of geography material to read. Therefore, if you want to read all the materials within one week (Monday to Sunday), you would need to read approximately 80 + 60 + 80 = 220 pages per day.
Response:  John has to clean the classroom every day, including sweeping and dusting. He takes about an hour for each task. So in one week, he spends 7 hours (1 hour x 7 days) cleaning the classroom.
Response:  The ocean is expanding at a rate of 3 millimeters per year. If it takes 10 minutes for one millimeter to reach the shore, how long will it take for 42 millimeters (the height of the wave) to reach the shore?
Response:  The number of ways to solve the puzzle is equal to the number of possible combinations of moves that can be made. Since there are 3 rows and 4 columns in the grid, we have 3 x 4 = 12 different positions where pieces can be placed. However, some positions may not lead to a valid solution, so let's subtract out those possibilities. For example, if we place a piece in the top left corner, it cannot overlap with any other piece, so there are only 11 remaining positions for the second piece. Similarly, if we place the second piece in the bottom right corner, it cannot overlap with the first piece, leaving us with 10 possible positions for the third piece. Therefore, the total number of ways to solve the puzzle is 12 - (11 + 10) = 1.
Response:  If Amir has 5 cups and gives some to Cody, then Cody will have x cups. Since Cody can hold at most 3 cups in his hands, we know that x is less than or equal to 3. Therefore, the number of cups Cody will have after receiving from Amir is between 0 and 3 inclusive.
Response:  The total amount of money is 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 tolli. Since one part is already paid (1 tolli), we have 15 - 1 = 14 tolli left for the three parts. So, each part will get 14 / 3 = 4.67 tolli.
Response:  On Monday, Frankie works for 4 hours and watches one episode of his favorite show. On Tuesday, he spends 2 hours working and watches another episode. On Wednesday, he works for 5 hours and watches an additional episode. On Thursday, he finishes work at noon and watches an hour-long episode before starting to prepare dinner. Finally, on Friday, he has free time after finishing dinner and watches another episode. So, how many 30-minute episodes does Frankie watch during the week? Answer: 7 x 30 = 210 minutes.
Response:  Last year, Henry made 95 cups of coffee. If he wants to make twice as many cups this year, then he will make 190 cups (2 x 95 = 190). However, if he stops making cups after 10 minutes and takes a break for 5 minutes, then he will have made 110 cups in total (10 + 5 = 110). So last year, Henry made 95 cups.
"Response:  The cost of one gallon of gasoline is $3, and the tax per gallon is $20. If we buy 10 gallons of gasoline, the total cost will be:

$3 x 10 = $30 (cost of 10 gallons) + $20 (tax per gallon) = $50
So, if you buy 10 gallons of gasoline, the total cost will be $50."
Response:  We know that Beatrice has 24 more pounds than Marcel, so Beatrice weighs 24 + 14 = 38 pounds. Therefore, Marcel weighs 38 - 24 = 14 pounds.
Response:  The water level in the bucket increases by 2 liters every time Julia pours it from her jug. Since there are 10 buckets, and each bucket can hold 1 liter of water, then after 5 pourings (since Julia poured half of the water), the total amount of water in the buckets will be: 2 liters x 5 = 10 liters. Now let's calculate how much water is left in Julia's jug: 10 - 10 = 0 liters. So Julia has no more water to pour into the buckets. Therefore, she cannot fill any more buckets.
Response:  We have four teachers who are going to teach their students in different rooms. Each teacher will use one hour for each class and there are three classes per day. If we divide the total time (24 hours) among the teachers equally, then each teacher will get 8 hours of teaching time per day. Now, let's calculate how many minutes each teacher will get per student. Since there are 3 classes per day, each teacher will get 8 hours / 3 classes = 2.67 hours of teaching time per day per student. Finally, if we multiply this value with the number of students they will teach (4 students), we get 10.68 hours of teaching time per day for each teacher.
Response:  If Ryan has two apples and gives one to Lili, he will have 2 - 1 = 1 apple left. If he then gives another apple to Lili, he will have 0 apples left. Therefore, if it takes 15 days for an apple to grow back after giving one to Lili, there will be no apples left after 15 days. So, the answer is 0.
Response:  We know that Brittany has taken 50 more photos than Jamal. So if Jamal took 1800 photos, then Brittany took 1800 + 50 = 1850 photos. Therefore, there are approximately 1850 photos in total.
Response:  Firstly, we have $50 for the remaining pairs of shoes that Sasha wants to buy. Since each pair costs $10, Sasha can buy 5 pairs with the remaining money ($50 / $10 = 5). Now, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes Sasha has in total. If Sasha buys 5 pairs and each pair contains 4 shoes (since there are 4 tiles in each pair), then Sasha has bought a total of 5 x 4 = 20 shoes. Finally, if Sasha has 20 shoes and she gave away 10 shoes earlier, then she has 20 - 10 = 10 shoes left.
"Response:  We have 7:13 hours in a day and we want to know how many cups of tea can be made with 120 tea bags using 1 liter of water. To calculate this, we need to divide the number of hours by the time it takes to make one cup of tea (let's assume it takes 5 minutes). So, if it takes 5 minutes to make one cup of tea, then we can make:

7:13 / 5 = 142 cups of tea per day

Therefore, based on the given information, you can make approximately 142 cups of tea per day using 120 tea bags and 1 liter of water."
Response:  If John has three pairs of king size pajamas and each pair costs $20, then he has spent a total of $60. So, if he wants to know how much he can spend for 60 dollars, we need to subtract the amount he already spent from the given budget of $60, which is equal to $60 - $30 = $30. Therefore, John can spend up to $30 for 60 dollars.
Response:  On Monday, there were 2 containers with 10 boxes each (total of 20 boxes). On Tuesday, more containers arrived and there were now 4 containers in total (with 20 boxes in total). So, the number of boxes on Wednesday was 30 - 20 = 10.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Adriene's income was $30% more than Lily's income for three years before they both invested their savings and earned interest at an annual rate of 4%. After three years, Lily had saved $8000, while Adriene had saved $12000. If they then invested their savings and earned interest at an annual rate of 4%, how much would they have after five years? To find out, we need to calculate the total amount that each person saved over those five years and add it up. For example, if Lily saved $8000 in year one, $16000 in year two, $24000 in year three, $32000 in year four, and $40000 in year five, her total savings over those five years would be $8000 + $16000 + $24000 + $32000 + $40000 = $192000. Similarly, if Adriene saved $12000 in year one, $24000 in year two, $36000 in year three, $48000 in year four, and $64000 in year five, his total savings over those five years would be $12000 + $24000 + $36000 + $48000 + $64000 = $278000. So, after five years, Lily would have $192000 plus $64000 (the difference between what she saved and what Adriene saved) = $256000, while Adriene would have $278000 minus $64000 = $214000. Therefore, the difference between what Lily and Adriene had after five years is $256000 - $214000 = $42000.
Response:  If Migel has two papers to read every day and each paper has 30 pages, then he will have to read 60 pages (2 x 30) per day.

Response:  If Sadie had $8 in her wallet at first and lost $2 every day for 2 days, then she would have $6 left after those two days. So if she continued to lose money each day, how much would she have after 3 days?
"Response:  Rosie walked for 10 miles in 3 hours at a speed of 8 km/h. To find out how many kilometers she walked per hour, we can divide the distance traveled (in miles) by the time taken (in hours):

Distance = 10 miles / 3 hours = 3.33 miles/hour
Now, to find out how many kilometers she walked per hour, we need to convert the distance traveled from miles to kilometers:

Distance = 3.33 miles x 1.60934 kilometers/mile = 5.26 kilometers/hour
Therefore, if Rosie walks at a speed of 8 km/h, she will cover 7 tundi (or 7 x 5.26 = 36.52 kilometers) in one hour."
Response:  If there are currently 60 books in Jennie's collection and she adds 15 new ones every month, then after 3 months, there will be 60 + 15 = 75 books in her collection. So, if Jennie already had 30 books before adding the new ones, then she now has a total of 30 + 75 = 105 books in her collection.
Response:  Julia has prepared 8 servings of her famous soup, which she wants to share with her guests. She bought 3 bags of frozen peas, each bag containing 5 cups of peas. Since one serving requires 1/4 cup of peas, Julia needs 8 / 4 = 2 bags of peas for 8 servings. However, since she already used 3 bags, there are only 5 bags left. Therefore, the number of bags of peas that Julia bought is 5.
Response:  Dylan bought 38 cana- and 6 Kalavorstits more than cana-vorstits. So he bought a total of 44 vorstits (38 + 6).
Response:  If Amy got $20 more than Lily, then Lily had $50 - $20 = $30. So, if Lily has $30 and Amy has $50, then they have a total of $80 together.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one cup of coffee costs $3, and one apple costs $2. So, if Dylan buys four cups of coffee, he will spend $3 x 4 = $12 on coffee. Similarly, if he buys two apples, he will spend $2 x 2 = $4 on apples. Therefore, the total cost of what Dylan buys is $12 + $4 = $16.
Response:  The number of patients treated per hour is given as $500 \div 24 = 20$ patients/hour. Now, we need to find out how many hours each doctor worked. For this, let's assume that there are $n$ doctors and they all work for $x$ hours together. Therefore, the total number of patients treated by all doctors is $\frac{n x}{20} = \frac{nx}{40}$ patients. Since there were $150$ dollars spent on each patient, the total amount spent on all patients is $\frac{nx}{40} \times 150 = \frac{n x}{40} \times 150$. Finally, since there were $200$ dollars spent on each patient by Haiglas, the total amount spent by Haiglas is $\frac{n x}{40} \times 200 = \frac{n x}{40} \times 200$. To find out how much Haiglas made from these treatments, we simply subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned: $\boxed{\frac{n x}{40} \times 200 - \frac{n x}{40} \times 150 = n x \times (200 - 150)}$.
"Response:  If Nissa has 60 employees working at her store and she wants to know how many of them will be able to pay their rent next month if 10 of them are not paid, then we can calculate it as follows:
Let X be the number of employees who will not get paid (in this case, 10). Then, the total number of employees who will get paid is 60 - X.
So, the number of employees who will be able to pay their rent next month is 60 - X."
Response:  In June, Joe spent $60 less than he did in May. So if Joe spent $500 in May, then in June he spent $500 - $60 = $440. Therefore, Joe spent $440 more than he did in May.
Response:  Pam and Fred have 4 and 5 cards respectively after they exchange them. If each of them can hold at most 6 cards, then...
Response:  On the first day (esmaspäev), Walter drank 4 liters of water. On the second day (teisipäev), he drank 6 more liters than on the previous day, which is equal to 4 + 6 = 10 liters. Therefore, on the third day (kolmapäev), Walter drank 31 liters of water (41 - 10).
Response:  If Tom can sell 6 cars at $15 each, then he will make $90 in total ($15 x 6 = 90). Now, if he wants to know how much money he will make in a year (assuming he sells cars all year round), we need to multiply the amount he makes per month by 12 months. So, Tom will make $1080 in a year ($90 x 12 = $1080).
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 videos and 5 of them are shorter than 3 minutes. So, there are 15 videos longer than 3 minutes (20 - 5 = 15). Now we need to find out how many videos Bobbi has. According to the question, Bobbi has 4 times as many videos as Brian. Therefore, if Brian has 15 long videos, Bobbi has 15 x 4 = 60 long videos.
Response:  We have 27 villages in total and we know that three of them are located in Saaremaa. So, there are 27 - 3 = 24 villages outside of Saaremaa. Now, let's count how many of these villages have more than 100 inhabitants. There are two such villages in Saaremaa, so if we subtract those from the total number of villages outside of Saaremaa, we get the number of villages with more than 100 inhabitants outside of Saaremaa. Therefore, the answer is 24 - 2 = 22 villages with more than 100 inhabitants outside of Saaremaa.
"Response:  We have $2 \times 7 = 14$ dollars for Rory and $2 \times 3 = 6$ dollars for Suppi. So far, we have $14 + 6 = 20$ dollars. Now, let's calculate the change for each of them: For Rory, we have $14 - 2 = 12$ dollars; for Suppi, we have $6 - 2 = 4$ dollars. So, the total amount of money that they will get is $12 + 4 = 16$ dollars. Therefore, the final answer is $16$."
Response:  If Mark took 8 minutes to complete the first test and 6 minutes to complete the second test, then he completed 24 questions in total (8 x 3 = 24). So, out of the remaining 100 questions, Mark did not finish 76 questions (100 - 24 = 76).
Response:  We have 22 red balls and we want to know how many more than 12 blue balls there are. So, if there are x blue balls, then the total number of balls is 22 + x. Since there are 12 blue balls, we can conclude that the total number of balls is 34 (22 + 12). Therefore, the answer is 34.
Response:  If there are 20 rented cars and 4 manual cars, then the total number of cars is 20 + 4 = 24. Now, if 12 of these cars are automatic, then the percentage of automatic cars among all cars is (12/24) x 100% = 50%. So, more than half of the cars are automatic.
Response:  We have three quantities - $K$, $T$, and $R$. From the problem statement, we know that $K = 2 \times 10^3$ and $T = 4 \times 10^3$. Now, let's find out what is the value of $R$. According to the problem statement, $R = 2 \times 10^3 + 6 \times 10^2$. Therefore, $R = 8 \times 10^3$. Finally, we can calculate the number of seals as follows: $\text{Number of seals} = \frac{K}{R} = \frac{2 \times 10^3}{8 \times 10^3} = 250$. So, there are 250 seals in total.
Response:  If Jordan works for 2 hours every day and earns $10 per hour, then in one month he will have earned $30 x 30 = $900. So if he spends all of his money on video games, he will have $900 - $10 = $890 left at the end of the month.
Response:  If John earned $2 less than Piia, and Piia earned $3 more than Lambipirne, then John earned $5 ($2 - $3 = $5). If Tassi also earned $3 more than John, then Tassi earned $8 ($3 + $5 = $8). Finally, if Prussakaraka earned $4 more than Tassi, then Prussakaraka earned $12 ($4 + $8 = $12). Therefore, there are $12 - $4 = $8 more than John earned compared to all others combined.
Response:  The total cost of all clients is $92 (4 x $22). If each client buys 2 packs and one extra item for $5, then the total amount spent by each client is $67 ($22 + $45). Since there are three clients, the total amount spent by all clients is $381 ($67 x 3). Therefore, the profit per day is $381 - $92 = $289.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 hectares of land with ananas (John has 100 hectares in total). If John can work for 3 months, then we need to divide the number of hectares by the time he works. So, the number of hectares John can work on per month is:

10 hectares / 3 months = 3.33 hectares per month

So, John can work on approximately 3.33 hectares of land every month."
Response:  If Johnny has collected 500 complete Lego sets and he wants to divide them equally among his three children, each child will get 167 sets (500 / 3 = 167). Now let's assume that one set contains 1/4 of a brick. So if Johnny has 167 sets, then he has a total of 41 bricks (167 x 1/4 = 41). Therefore, Johnny has 41 bricks in total.
Response:  The first 6 hours after Debra started picking mushrooms, she picked 30 mushrooms. If we assume that she worked continuously during those 6 hours without any breaks, then in total she picked 30 x 6 = 180 mushrooms. Since there were more than two cord of mushrooms left to be picked, and since Debra already picked some before the 6-hour mark, let's estimate that she picked around 2/3 of the remaining mushrooms, which is approximately 2/3 x 2 cords = 1.33 cords. So, Debra picked around 1.33 cords of mushrooms within the last 6 hours.
Response:  If Brittany buys $12 for an adult ticket and $10 for a child ticket, then she has spent a total of $22. Now, if she gets a discount of $6 on each ticket, then she will pay $16 for the adult ticket and $10 for the child ticket. So, in total, Brittany will have paid $26 to visit the museum.
Response:  We know that Charlie has 3 more friends than Dorothy on Facebook. So, if Charlie has x friends on Facebook, then Dorothy has x - 3 friends. Since Charlie has 12 more friends than James on Facebook, we can write an equation as follows: x = 12 + (x - 3). Now, we need to solve for x. Substituting x = 12 into this equation gives us x = 15. Therefore, Charlie has 15 friends on Facebook more than James does.
Response:  If Steve takes 3 minutes to eat one bite of his sandwich and he eats for 440 minutes in total, then he has eaten 140 bites (3 minutes/bite x 440 minutes). Since Tim took twice as long to eat his sandwich, he has eaten half as many bites as Steve, which is 70 bites (2 times 140 bites = 280 bites / 2 = 70 bites). Therefore, if Tim starts eating after Steve finishes, it will take him 70/2 = 35 minutes to eat his entire sandwich. So, before Kaotaja can win the game, Tim must have been eating for at least 35 minutes.
Response:  The first person gave $10 to the fundraising campaign and received $25 back as a reward. Then, three more people donated money, each receiving $25 as a reward. Finally, one person donated $100 and received nothing as a reward. Therefore, the total amount of money that was collected during this period is: $10 + ($25 x 3) = $10 + $75 = $85. So, $85 dollars were collected that day.
Response:  If Carl sells $k$ packages of chocolates and each package contains $6$ pieces of chocolate, then he earns total revenue of $\$k \times \$6 = \$36$. Now if he wants to sell $10\times$ more than before, he will have to sell $\$36 \times 10 = \$360$ packages of chocolates. So, his new revenue will be $\$360$.
"Response: 
Dave bought 3 bags of apples and gave one bag to each of his three friends. So he had 3 bags left after giving them away. Then he went to the store again and bought 2 more bags of apples. He now has 5 bags of apples in total (3 + 2 = 5). His friend took one bag from him, so he has 4 bags left (5 - 1 = 4). Now his friend took another bag from him, leaving him with 3 bags (4 - 1 = 3). Therefore, Dave had 3 bags of apples when his friend took the last bag from him."
"Response: 
Kolledžiõpilane Kimo has three types of days in his schedule: esmaspäevadel (weekdays), kolmapäevadel (Monday and Tuesday), and reedel (Wednesday). Each type of day lasts for two hours. Therefore, we can calculate how many hours Kimo spends on each type of day as follows:
Esmaspäevadel = 3 x 2 = 6 hours/day
Kolmapäevadel = 2 x 2 = 4 hours/day
Reedel = 1 x 2 = 2 hours/day
Now let's calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends on these days per week:
Total hours/week = Esmaspäevadel + Kolmapäevadel + Reedel
= 6 + 4 + 2
= 12 hours/week
Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo spends a total of:
Total hours/semester = Total hours/week x Number of weeks in a semester
= 12 hours/week x 16 weeks
= 192 hours/semester
Therefore, Kimo spends approximately 192 hours in a semester."
Response:  We know that Bill has 300 roles of pasta, which is equal to 300 x 1 = 300 grams. He also has 120 chocolate croissants, which is equal to 120 x 0.5 = 60 grams (since each croissant weighs half a gram). Finally, he has 60 bagettes, which is equal to 60 x 0.1 = 6 grams (since each bagette weighs one tenth of a gram). So in total, Bill has 300 + 60 + 6 = 366 grams of food. Since there are 100 grams in a kilogram, this means that Bill has approximately 3.66 kg of food.
Response:  We have three animals - Gorilla, Penguin and Chimpanzee. Each animal has its own weight in bananas as follows: Gorilla - 400 bananas, Penguin - 100 bananas, and Chimpanzee - 200 bananas. Now we want to know how many kilograms of bananas each animal can carry if they all together have 2000 bananas. So, let's calculate it: Gorilla can carry 400/5 = 80 kg, Penguin can carry 100/5 = 20 kg, and Chimpanzee can carry 200/5 = 40 kg. Therefore, the total weight of bananas that each animal can carry is 80 + 20 + 40 = 140 kg.
"Response: 
Blake is running at a speed of $15 \text{ minutes/km}$ and Kelly is running at a speed of $20 \text{ minutes/km}$. They are running in opposite directions on a circular track with a radius of $100 \text{ meters}$. After $15$ minutes, Blake has traveled a distance of $900 \text{ meters}$, while Kelly has traveled a distance of $675 \text{ meters}$. Since they started running at the same time, we can say that Kelly has run for $900 - 675 = 225 \text{ meters}$ more than Blake during this period. Therefore, Kelly has covered a total distance of $225 + 675 = 900 \text{ meters}$ during the $15$ minutes. So, if Blake runs for $x$ minutes, then Kelly will cover a distance of $x + 225 \text{ meters}$. Now, since Blake ran for $15$ minutes and Kelly ran for $100 - 15 = 85 \text{ minutes}$, we have:
$$\therefore x = \frac{85}{2} = 42.5 \text{ minutes}$$
So, Kelly covers a distance of $42.5 + 225 = 267.5 \text{ meters}$ during the $15$ minutes, which means that she travels faster than Blake by $\boxed{267.5 - 900 = -632.5 \text{ meters}/minute}$."
Response:  The total cost of all four items is $1 + $4 + $1.5 + $4 = $13. So Raphael spent at most $13.
Response:  There are 11 stones in total. If we take 4 of them to the top, there will be 7 left at the bottom. Now let's assume that each stone can hold 3 other stones. So if we put 2 more stones on top, there will be 5 left at the bottom. Therefore, the number of stones Finn has now is 5.
Response:  On Thursday (17th of Jalga), Veepaak had 3 meetings and drank 4 cups of water. On Friday (2nd of Meetrit), he had 2 more meetings than on Thursday. So, on Friday, Veepaak had 5 meetings in total. Therefore, Veepaak drank 9 cups of water on Friday (4 + 5).
Response:  Anakin has 10 merits, 6 more than Locsin. So, Locsin has 4 merits (10 - 6 = 4). Then, Anakin has 3 more merits than Locsin, so Locsin has 7 merits (4 + 3 = 7). Finally, Locsin has 2 less clunks than Anakin, so Locsin has 5 clunks (7 - 2 = 5). Therefore, Anakin has more kala than Locsin.
"Response:  If the price of one marble increases by $20 every year for 10 years and then stays at that level for another 10 years, how much will it cost in total after 20 years? To calculate this, we need to use a formula that takes into account both the annual increase and the number of years the price remains constant. Here is the calculation:
Year 1-10: Price = $20 x (1 + $20/year) = $40 x (1 + $20/10) = $80
Year 11-20: Price = $80
Total cost after 20 years = $80 x 20 = $1600
Therefore, if the price of one marble increases by $20 every year for 10 years and then stays at that level for another 10 years, it will cost approximately $1600 after 20 years."
Response:  We have 3 cars and 4 houses that cost $100 each. So, we have spent a total of $300 for buying those houses. Now, we have $20 left after paying for the houses. Next, we buy one more car that costs $50. So, now we have $150 left. Finally, we spend $4 on gas for all the cars, leaving us with $146. Therefore, the answer is $146.
Response:  If Jackie earns $12 per hour and works for 3 hours, she will make $36. If she spends $35 on lunch, then she has $9 left after buying lunch. So if she makes more than $90, she can buy lunch. Therefore, the answer is yes.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate how much money Elvira has spent on gifts for her mother's 30th birthday party. According to the information given in the question, she bought presents worth €1500 and also paid €1090 for a machine that can be used to make candles, cookies, and other things. Therefore, the total amount of money Elvira spent is:

€1500 + €1090 = €2590

Now, let's find out if Elvira had enough money left after buying all these items. We know that she had €1000 initially, so let's subtract the amount she spent from it:

€1000 - €2590 = €-1590

Since the result is negative, it means that Elvira did not have enough money left after buying all the items mentioned in the question."
Response:  If Sandra has 9 bags of corn and each bag contains 4 kilos, then she has 9 x 4 = 36 kilos of corn in total. Now, if she wants to sell these corn at 15 euros per kilo, how much money will she make? So, her profit is 36 kg x 15 €/kg = 540 euros.
Response:  If Seth is older than Brooke by two years, and they were born in different years (Seth was born in '97 and Brooke was born in '01), then their age difference is 4 years. So, if Seth is currently 25 years old (born in '97), he would be 3 years older than Brooke (born in '01). Therefore, Seth is 28 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8 and Jimmy has twice as much money as Ethel, then Jimmy has $16. So, if Jimmy has more than Ethel, he has $10 more than Ethel ($16 - $8 = $8).
Response:  If Pancho can walk 20 miles in 5 hours, then he walks at a rate of 4 miles per hour (20/5). Now, if he walked for 10 hours, he would have covered a distance of 40 miles (4 x 10).
Response:  The new form is worth $25, and each cord can be sold for at most $3 more than the previous one. If we sell 4 cords, then the total value of the sale will be $100 (4 x $25). So, if we have more than 4 forms, we can sell them for even more money. Therefore, the maximum number of forms that can be sold is 5 or higher.
"Response:  We know that there are 80 large beetles, 90 small beetles and 3 mutant beetle legs in total. So, we can calculate the number of beetle legs as follows: Large beetles have 6 legs each (since they are ""large""), so their total number is 80 x 6 = 480 legs. Small beetles also have 6 legs each, so their total number is 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, the three mutant beetle legs have 12 legs each (since they are ""mutant""), so their total number is 3 x 12 = 36 legs. Therefore, the total number of beetle legs Jake sees is 480 + 540 + 36 = 1056 legs."
Response:  We know that Sally is 4 years older than Red. So, if Red is 8 years old now, then Sally is 12 years old (4 + 8 = 12). Now we know that Sally is 12 - 2 = 10 years older than her younger sister, who is 8 years old. Therefore, Sally is 10 + 8 = 18 years old.
Response:  If Jessica wants to pay more than $500 in one year, she needs to make at least $1000 - $500 = $500 in purchases per year. Since her credit card minimum is $200 per month and there are 12 months in a year, she would need to spend at least $2400 ($200 x 12) per year to meet the minimum payment requirement of her credit card. Therefore, if Jessica wants to pay more than $500 in one year, she should aim to spend around $2400 or more each year.
"Response:  Billy has to cook 60 burgers in total, and each burger takes him approximately 5 minutes to prepare. If he spends only 5 seconds preparing each burger, then he will have enough time to cook all 60 burgers in:

Time = Number of burgers x Preparation time per burger
= 60 x 5
= 300 seconds
= 5 minutes
Therefore, Billy will have enough time to cook all 60 burgers in 5 minutes."
Response:  The total cost of juice is $18 (3 dollars per gallon x 6 gallons). If they buy 2 gallons at $2 each, then their total cost for those two gallons will be $4. So, in total, they have spent $22 ($18 + $4) on juice. Now, if they want to know how much they can save if they buy more than 6 gallons, we need to find out how many gallons they are buying beyond the 6th gallon. They are buying 20 gallons beyond the 6th gallon, so let's call that amount X. Then, we can calculate the total cost of these additional gallons as follows: Total Cost = Number of Gallons x Price per Gallon - Discount Amount (in this case, 50 cents per gallon) Total Cost = 20 x $2 = $40 - $10 (discount amount) = $30 So, they can save $30 by buying more than 6 gallons of juice.
Response:  We know that there were 240 students in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of non-Japanese students is 240 - 80 = 160. Since each group had 60 people, we can conclude that there were 160 / 60 = 2.67 groups of non-Japanese students. Therefore, there were approximately 2.67 groups of non-Japanese students.
Response:  Firstly, Zaid will spend $1/4 of his income on entertainment and $1/3 on clothes. Therefore, he will have $200 left for other expenses after spending money on these two categories. Secondly, he will give away $700 to charity. So, if Zaid has more than $800 left after giving away this amount, then he will have at least $800 - $700 = $100 left over. Finally, if Zaid has $100 or more left over after paying all of his bills, then he will not be able to save any money because he will already have spent everything he had. Thus, we can conclude that Zaid will not be able to save any money if he spends more than $800 per month.
"Response:  We have to find out how many crabs are in total and then calculate what percentage of them are left for each group. So, let's start with the total number of crabs:
Total number of crabs = 40 + 30 + 20 = 90
Now, we need to find out how many crabs are left for each group:
For Rani'l: Number of crabs left = Total number of crabs - (Rani'l's share / 100)
= 90 - (40 / 100)
= 50
For Monicil: Number of crabs left = Total number of crabs - (Monicil's share / 100)
= 90 - (30 / 100)
= 60
For Bol: Number of crabs left = Total number of crabs - (Bol's share / 100)
= 90 - (40 / 100)
= 50
So, there are 50 crabs left for Rani'l, 60 crabs left for Monicil, and 50 crabs left for Bol."
Response:  If Lloydy teaches math for 10 days in one month and then takes 2 months off, he will have taught for a total of 5 + 8 = 13 months. So, Lloyd has taught for approximately 1 year and 3 months.
"Response:  The number of students in each class is given as $k$. Since there are three classes, we have $k+1$ candidates for each class. Therefore, the total number of candidates is $\sum_{i=1}^{3} (k+1) = 3(k+1)$.
Now, let's find out how many candidates got at least $3/4$ of the highest score. We know that $x$ candidates got exactly $3/4$ of the highest score, and $y$ candidates got more than $3/4$ but less than $5/4$ of the highest score. So, we can write:
$$\begin{aligned} x + y &= \frac{3}{4}k \\ y &= \frac{7}{4} - x \end{aligned}$$
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
$$\begin{aligned} x + (\frac{7}{4} - x) &= \frac{3}{4}k \\ x + \frac{7}{4} &= \frac{3}{4}k \end{aligned}$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$2x + \frac{7}{4} = \frac{3}{4}k$$
Subtracting $\frac{3}{4}$ from both sides gives us:
$$2x = \frac{7}{4} - \frac{3}{4}k$$
Dividing both sides by $2$, we get:
$$x = \frac{7}{8} - \frac{k}{2}$$
So, there are $\frac{7}{8} - \frac{k}{2}$ candidates who got at least $3/4$ of the highest score."
Response:  We know that Sandra had 4 cards of red suits and 3 cards of black suits. So, in total she had 7 cards (4+3=7). Now we are asked how many cards Fred would have if he took all the remaining cards from Sandra. Since there were 200 cards left after Sandra took her 7 cards, Fred would have taken 193 cards (200-7=193). Therefore, the correct answer is 193.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question, we know that:
Jean is 2 years older than Mark (given).
Mark was 5 years younger than Jan (given).
Jan is currently 30 years old (given).
Now, let's calculate the age of Jean:
Age of Jean = Age of Mark + (Time passed since Mark became older - Time passed since Jan became older)
= 2 + (-5 + 30)
= 2 + (-45)
= 67
Therefore, Jean is 67 years old."
"Response:  The first team can run 400 meters in 55 seconds, and each member of the second team runs for 3 seconds less than the previous one. Therefore, the time taken by the second team to run 400 meters is:

Time taken by the second team = Time taken by the first team + (Time taken by the first team - Time taken by the last member of the first team)
= 55 seconds + (55 seconds - x seconds)

Where x is the time taken by the last member of the first team. Since the last member takes 3 seconds less than the previous one, we have:

x = 52 seconds

Therefore, the time taken by the second team to run 400 meters is:

Time taken by the second team = 55 seconds + (55 seconds - 52 seconds)
= 107 seconds

So, the second team takes 107 seconds to run 400 meters."
Response:  We have to find two numbers whose product is greater than 3 and add them together with their sum being equal to 6. So we can take any two numbers that multiply to give us a result of more than 3. For example, if we choose 4 and 5, then 4 x 5 = 20, which is greater than 3. Therefore, the answer is 4 and 5.
"Response:  If Jenna and her mother together collected 30 pieces of wood (Jenna had 15 and her mother had 15), then they must have collected them in the following ratio:

Jenna collected 15/4 = 3 7/8 pieces of wood.
Her mother collected 15/4 = 3 7/8 pieces of wood as well.
So, the total number of pieces of wood collected is: 3 + 3 = 6 pieces of wood."
"Response:  We have to find out how much oil is needed for each group of rabbits and then calculate how many groups can be fed with the total amount of oil available.

Group 1 (3 rabbits): Each rabbit needs 6 tbsp of oil, so they need 18 tbsp in total.

Group 2 (4 rabbits): Each rabbit needs 5 tbsp of oil, so they need 20 tbsp in total.

Group 3 (5 rabbits): Each rabbit needs 6 tbsp of oil, so they need 30 tbsp in total.

Total amount of oil needed = 18 + 20 + 30 = 78 tbsp

Since we have 10 hampsters, we can feed them 78 / 10 = 7.8 groups of 3 rabbits each.

So, there are approximately 7.8 groups of 3 rabbits that can be fed with the total amount of oil available."
"Response:  If Mandy pays $100 after 3 months with an interest rate of 2%, then we can calculate the amount she will pay as follows:

$100 x (1 + 0.02/1) ^ 3 = $104.69

So, if Mandy paid $104.69 for the $100 after 3 months, then Benedict has earned $4.69 in interest ($104.69 - $100). Therefore, Benedict has earned $4.69 / $100 = 0.0469 or 4.69% interest on the $100."
Response:  The total cost of transporting one ton of cargo is $20 per kilometer. If each container costs $2 to move and the truck can carry up to 40 containers, then the total cost of transportation for one trip would be: $2 x number of containers = $40. So if the truck makes four trips with a maximum load of 400 dollars, then it will make: $40 x 4 = $160 in revenue.
"Response:  The total cost of 3 packs is $69 + $75 + $85 = $229. If they spent less than $4.50 per pack, then the number of packs they bought is:
$229 / ($4.50 per pack) = 51 packs
So, they bought 51 packs of candy."
Response:  John has 4 virsikkes (colts). He wants to know how many minutes it takes for two of them to grow into horses. To find out, we need to calculate the time it takes for each colt to grow into a horse. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so if John has 4 colts and each colt grows into a horse in 1 hour, then he will have 4 x 60 = 240 minutes until all his colts become horses. Therefore, the answer is 240 minutes.
Response:  If we eat 3.5 kg of meat per day and there are 10 days in a week, then we will consume 35 kg of meat in one week (3.5 x 10 = 35).
Response:  The total amount of wood is 10 cubic meters and Tom starts with 50 cubic meters. After 10 years, he has used 30% of the total amount which means that he has used 30/100 = 0.3 x 50 = 15 cubic meters. So, there are still 85 cubic meters left (50 - 15 = 85).
"Response:  The number of red plastic flamingos added to Sue's collection is equal to the number of white plastic flamingos subtracted from it. At first, there were 18 red plastic flamingos in Sue's collection. Every day, three white plastic flamingos were taken away and replaced with new ones. Therefore, after 7 days, the total number of flamingos in Sue's collection was:

18 + (3 x 7) = 42

So, after 7 days, there were 42 flamingos in Sue's collection, including both red and white ones."
Response:  The total cost of buying all five books is $10 + ($4 x 3) = $35. Since each book costs at most $2, we can buy at least 17 books for $35. Therefore, the number of books that Violetta can buy with $20 is at least 17.
Response:  If one plate costs $1.20 and the discount is $0.30 per plate, then if you buy 8 plates, how much will it cost? So, the total cost of 8 plates = (8 x $1.20) - (8 x $0.30). Therefore, the total cost of 8 plates = $9.60 - $2.40 = $7.20.
"Response:  We have 200 people who want to eat at one of four restaurants. Each restaurant can accommodate two people per table. How many tables will be needed if each person wants to eat alone?
Solution: To determine how many tables are needed, we need to divide the total number of people (200) by the number of people that can sit at each table (2). So, we need:

200 / 2 = 100 tables
Therefore, 100 tables will be needed if each person wants to eat alone."
Response:  The total number of people living in Soda is given as 23786. Of these, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. If there are many children living in Soda, how many children would be?
Response:  We know that Elaine has 20 Pokémon cards and she gave 3 of them to her friend Kati. So, Elaine now has 17 Pokémon cards left (20 - 3 = 17). Then, Kati received 5 more Pokémon cards from Elaine, so Kati now has 8 Pokémon cards (5 + 3 = 8). Now, we need to find out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has after giving some to Kati. To do this, we subtract the number of Pokémon cards given to Kati from the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine had initially: 17 - 3 = 14. Therefore, Elaine currently has 14 Pokémon cards in her collection.
"Response: 
Mark edited 800 lines per day and the other author wrote 5 sentences per line. If Mark edited for 10 days, he would have edited 800 x 10 = 8000 lines in total. Since the second author wrote 5 sentences per line, they wrote a total of 5 x 10 = 50 sentences in those 10 days. So, if Mark edited more than the other author, then the number of sentences edited by Mark is greater than 50. Therefore, the answer is (greater than 50)."
"Response:  If there are 6 water jugs and each jug contains 5 liters of water, then how much water can one person get in total per day?

Step-by-step calculation:

1. First jug contains 5 liters of water x 6 jugs = 30 liters of water
2. Second jug contains 5 liters of water x 6 jugs = 30 liters of water
3. Third jug contains 5 liters of water x 6 jugs = 30 liters of water
4. Fourth jug contains 5 liters of water x 6 jugs = 30 liters of water
5. Fifth jug contains 5 liters of water x 6 jugs = 30 liters of water
6. Sixth jug contains 5 liters of water x 6 jugs = 30 liters of water
Total amount of water that one person can get per day = 30 liters + 30 liters + 30 liters + 30 liters + 30 liters + 30 liters = 180 liters
Therefore, one person can get 180 liters of water per day."
Response:  The initial investment is $5000 and the annual interest rate is 5%. If you make an investment every year for 20 years, then in total you will have earned $1000 per year (interest + principal). So after 20 years, your total earnings would be $20,000 ($10,000 x 2). Therefore, at the end of the 20th year, you will have $7000 left in your account ($20,000 - $13,000 = $7,000).
Response:  The total amount of wine that will be produced in one year is 5 tons (10 acres x 0.5 tons/acre). Since each ton of grapes produces approximately 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate how many barrels of wine will be produced in one year as follows: Number of barrels = Total amount of wine / Amount of wine per barrel = 5 tons x 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels So, in one year, 10 barrels of wine will be produced at this vineyard.
Response:  On average, Carli makes 3 eggs per day and uses 2 egg yolks for each meal. Therefore, she uses 6 egg yolks in total every day. Now, let's calculate how much egg yolk she used during those 5 days. She made an omelette with 4 egg yolks on the first day, which means she used 4/6 = 0.67 egg yolks that day. For the other 4 days, she used 1/6 = 0.17 egg yolks per day. In total, then, Carli used 0.67 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 = 2.97 egg yolks during those 5 days.
Response:  We know that Janet has 22 rolls and 10 small plates. She bought 6 blue and 2 red plates. The number of big plates Janet had before buying is equal to the number of small plates she bought multiplied by the number of colors she bought. So, we can write an equation: Number of big plates = (Number of small plates x Number of colors) / 2. In this case, Number of small plates = 10, Number of colors = 3 (blue + red), so we get: Number of big plates = (10 x 3) / 2 = 15. Therefore, there are 15 plates in total, including both big and small ones.
Response:  If Brinley got 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 in his first five tests, then he has already scored more than half of the maximum points (5 x 90 = 450). So, to get an average score of at least 93 in the sixth test, he needs to score at least 450 - 6 = 444 points.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Michael can dig a hole in 4 days and he takes 1 day off between each digging session. So, he works for 3 days straight and then takes 1 day off. Therefore, he will take 7 days to dig one hole (4 days of work + 1 day off). Now let's calculate how many holes he can dig in total. If he takes 7 days to dig one hole, it means that he can dig 60 holes in 7 x 60 = 420 days. Since he has 3 years to complete this task, he can dig 420 / 3 = 140 holes per year.
Response:  If Joe has 25 chocolates and each one weighs 80 grams, then he has a total of 25 x 80 = 2000 grams of chocolate. Now, if each chocolate is divided into four pieces, then Joe will have 2000 / 4 = 500 grams of chocolate per piece. So, if Joe gives away 30 pieces of chocolate, he will have 500 grams - 30 x 500 = 1500 grams left for himself. Therefore, Joe has 1500 grams of chocolate left after giving away 30 pieces.
Response:  On day 1 (Rose), she bought one big cookie and three small cookies. On day 2 (Teisi), he bought two big cookies and four small cookies. On day 3 (Teisi again), he bought three big cookies and five small cookies more than on day 2. So, if we calculate the total number of cookies that Teisi bought during these three days, it will be: 2 + 4 + 5 = 11. Therefore, Teisi bought a total of 11 cookies during those three days.
Response:  The total cost of all taxes is $1200 less than the total cost of all purchases. If the total cost of all purchases is $6000, then the cost of all taxes must be $4800 ($6000 - $1200).
Response:  Firstly, Sara has $30 to spend on jackets and $20 to spend on Kingi's clothes. Secondly, she buys two jackets for $60 (including tax). Thirdly, she spends $5 on each of the remaining three jackets, so she pays a total of $15 for those. Fourthly, she spends $4 on each of the remaining four shirts, so she pays a total of $16 for those. Fifthly, she already had $10 in her pocket before going shopping, which means she now has $46 left after buying everything ($30 + $20 - $60 - $15 - $16 = $46). Finally, since she spent more than she had, she owes money to the store, which is equal to the difference between what she spent and what she had ($46 - $10 = $36). Therefore, Sara owes $36 to the store.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Jerry has 42 days of work left and he can do either 3 or 5 days of work per week. If he works for 3 days per week, then he will have 13 weeks of work left (42 days / 3 days/week = 13 weeks). Similarly, if he works for 5 days per week, then he will have 8 weeks of work left (42 days / 5 days/week = 8 weeks). Therefore, there are 13 + 8 = 21 weeks remaining in Jerry's work period.
Response:  The volume of the container is given as 1.5 x 6 = 9 cubic meters. If we take out 3 cubic meters, then how much space will be left in the container? So, there will be 9 - 3 = 6 cubic meters of space left in the container.
"Response:  If there were initially $100 clients and now there are 50 remaining after 3 days, then the total number of clients over those 3 days is:

$100 + ($50 x 2) = $100 + $100 = $200

So, in total, there were 100 clients for the first 2 days, and then 50 clients remained for the third day. Therefore, the total number of clients over the entire period (including both days) is:

$100 + $50 = $150

Now, if each client spent an average of $300 per day, the total amount spent by all clients over the entire period would be:

$150 x $300 = $45,000

Therefore, the answer to the question is $45,000."
Response:  The first train has 200 liters of water per minute and takes 4 minutes to fill the small tank. Therefore, the small tank will hold 800 liters (200 L x 4 min). Now, the big tank can hold twice as much water as the small tank, so it will hold 1600 liters (2 x 800 L). Finally, since the big tank is four times larger than the small tank, it will hold 4 times as much water as the small tank, or 3200 liters (4 x 800 L). So, there are currently 3200 liters of water in the big tank.
"Response:  Lori has $320 to spend and wants to buy something that costs at most $32. If she works for 8 hours and earns $8 per hour, how much time does she have to work before she can afford the item?
Time = Total amount spent / Hourly wage
= $320 / $8
= 40 hours
Therefore, Lori needs to work for 40 hours before she can afford the item."
"Response:  If Janet lends $2000 to someone at an annual interest rate of 10%, then after 12 months, the amount owed will be:
$2000 x (1 + 0.10) = $2200
So if Janet gets back $165 from the person after 12 months, her remaining balance will be:
$2200 - $165 = $1935"
Response:  The number of apples is given as 4, and the number of oranges is given as 7. So, the total number of fruits is 4 + 7 = 11. Therefore, Lili has 11 kilograms of fruit in her bag.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Kolm is currently 5 years old and will be 8 years old in 3 years. Therefore, the average age of Kolm and Harriet during these 3 years will be (8 + 5) / 2 = 6.5 years.
Response:  We know that Nelja õpilaste (the fourth student) scored 251 points. Naomi scored 68 points less than Nelja õpilaste. Therefore, Naomi scored 251 - 68 = 183 points. Yuri scored more than Naomi but fewer than Brianna. So Yuri scored between 183 and 249 points. Finally, Jojo scored 17 points more than Yuri. Thus, Jojo scored 249 + 17 = 266 points.
Response:  The time taken to solve 10 riddles is 10 minutes, and for solving 5 Sudokus it takes 5 minutes. If we have 3 hours of leisure time, then we can solve at most 20 riddles (3 hours / 10 minutes per riddle) and 8 Sudokus (3 hours / 5 minutes per Sudoku). Therefore, if we spend more than 3 hours on these activities, we will exceed the limit.
Response:  Veepaak has 120 liters of water and uses 90 liters for his aquarium. So he has 30 liters of excess water left over (120 - 90 = 30). Therefore, there are currently 30 liters of water in the aquarium.
Response:  We know that Andy has 90 geraniums and 40 petunias. To find out how many more geraniums he has than petunias, we can subtract the number of petunias from the number of geraniums: 90 - 40 = 50. So, Andy has 50 more geraniums than petunias.

Which option do you choose?"
Response:  If Carlos spends $30 for one trip and Benji spends $18 for one trip, then if they take trips together, their total cost will be $30 + $18 = $48.
Response:  If it takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and back, then if you plan to go there and return in one day, how many times will you take the bus and car? Therefore, the answer is 7 trips (bus + car).
Response:  If we take away 8 vehicles from James' card and buy 14 robotic arms, it means that the number of vehicles has decreased by 8 and the number of robotic arms has increased by 14. So, after these transactions, the total value of James' card will be: 30 - 8 = 22 + 14 = 36. Therefore, the probability that James' card is a vehicle is 36/70 = 0.5 or 50%.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Chad has spent on his meal. The total cost of the meal is $6.50 + $2 + $1 + $1 = $10. Then, he paid $3 for drinks and dessert, so the remaining amount he spent is $10 - $3 = $7. Finally, he used his King Card that costs $5, leaving him with $7 - $5 = $2. Therefore, Chad has $2 left after buying his meal.
Response:  If Kalinda takes 4 minutes to complete each task and she has 360 tasks in total, then it will take her approximately 1440 minutes (or 24 hours) to finish all of them.
Response:  The initial number of watermelons was 120 and after 4 months, 30% were ready for harvesting, which means that 36 watermelons (30% of 120) were ready. When another 2 months passed, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, which is 90 watermelons (75% of 120). So, in total, 126 watermelons (90 + 36) were ready for harvesting within 6 months.
Response:  If Mark buys an OMA for $12,000 and he wants to make a down payment of 10%, then he will have to pay $1,200 as a down payment. To find out how much he has left after registering all 5 cars, we can subtract the down payment from the total cost of the OMA: $12,000 - $1,200 = $10,800. So, if he pays more than $10,800, he will not be able to register all 5 cars. Therefore, the maximum amount that Mark can pay is $10,800.
Response:  On the first day (esmapäev), Kylie heard 5 more sounds than Robert. So, Kylie heard 5 + 20 = 25 sounds and Robert heard 20 sounds. On the second day (teisipäev), Kylie heard twice as many sounds as she did on the first day, so she heard 2 \* 25 = 50 sounds. Therefore, Kylie heard 50 sounds on the second day.
Response:  If Dax can lift 50 times his own weight (which is 50 \* 75 = 3750 kg), and he wants to lift more than half of the total weight of the train (which is 12000 kg), then we need to find out how much less than half of the total weight he needs to lift. So, we subtract half of the total weight from the total weight: 12000 - 6000 = 6000 kg. Therefore, Dax needs to lift at least 6000 kg.
Response:  There are three seals (36) and each of them can jump high (kolmandik). Three seals can cover one kilometer in an hour (uju), so they can cover 3 kilometers in three hours (veel üks). If there were more than three seals, they could also swim faster (koopasse õhtusöögi sööma). Therefore, if there were four seals, they could cover 4 kilometers in four hours (kui palju pingvine on viel päikestamas).
Response:  If Steve increases his production of tomatoes and grows more than he consumes, then he will have extra tomatoes. He can sell three times as many tomatoes as he produces in one day. So if he produces 3 tomatoes per day, he can sell 9 tomatoes (3 x 3 = 9).
Response:  We know that there are 20 apples in total and John wants to divide them equally among 4 friends so each friend gets 5 apples. Now we need to find out how many apples John has left after giving them away. Since he only has 8 apples left, John must have had 16 apples initially (20 - 8 = 16).
Response:  If Rami buys 25 plates and uses them all up, he will have to buy another plate when his stock is empty (since he wants to use as many plates as possible). So if he has X plates left after using 25, then he will have to buy one more plate for each additional X plates he has left. Therefore, the number of plates Rami will buy in total is X + 1.
Response:  The initial amount of money was $20, and an additional $10 was added to it later. So, after three years, the total amount would be $30 + $10 = $40. Therefore, in four years, the amount would be $40 x 2 = $80.
Response:  If Mary is two years younger than Joan and Joan is 35 years old, then Mary is 33 years old (Joan - 2 = Mary). And if Jessica is 20 years old, then Mary is three times as old as Jessica (Mary = 3 x Jessica). So the answer is 91 (Jessica + 20)
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 1000 students in the school and they are divided into three classes - A, B, and C. Each class has 30% of the total number of students. So, the number of students in each class is as follows: Class A - 300 students (30% of 1000), Class B - 240 students (30% of 1000), and Class C - 180 students (30% of 1000). Now, let's calculate the percentage of students who moved from Class A to Class B: Number of students who moved from Class A to Class B = 300 (Class A) x 3/5 (Number of students who moved from Class A to Class B) = 60 students (approximately) Therefore, the approximate percentage of students who moved from Class A to Class B is 60/300 x 100 = 20%. Similarly, we can calculate the percentage of students who moved from Class A to Class C and get approximately 40% (60/300 x 100). Finally, we have approximately 20% of students who moved from Class B to Class C.
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Robert has 30 commi more than John. So if John has 54 commi, then Robert has 84 commi (54 + 30 = 84). Therefore, John has more commi than Robert.
Response:  If Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, then together they have three books (2 + 1 = 3). So if Dolly gives away one of her books to Pandora, she will have two books left (2 - 1 = 1), and Pandora will have two books as well (including the one she already had). Therefore, the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora have after this exchange is still 3 (1 + 2 = 3).
Response:  If there are 5 books written by Mike and he reads one book every day, then after 10 days, he will have read all 5 books. So, the number of days it takes him to read one book is 10/5 = 2 days per book. Therefore, he can read one book in 6 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Thus, Mike can read one book in 6 minutes.
"Response:  If Jasonil spends 1000 minutes talking to his friends over the phone every day for 15 minutes each time and he has talked to 300 people so far, then we can calculate how many minutes he has spent talking to all of them as follows:

Jasonil has talked to 300 people, so he has spent 1000 / 30 = 33 minutes per person on average.
Therefore, if Jasonil talks to more than 33 people in one day, he will have spent more than 1000 minutes talking to all of them."
Response:  We know that Griffin had 24 fries initially. Then, Kyle took 6 more than Griffin. So, Kyle had 24 + 6 = 30 fries. Now, Billy took 2 more than Kyle, so Billy had 30 + 2 = 32 fries. Next, Ginger took some from Griffin, but we don't know how many. So, let's assume Ginger took half of Griffin's remaining fries, which is 13 (since Griffin had 27 - 13 = 14 fries left). Finally, Colby took 3 fewer than Kyle, so Colby had 30 - 3 = 27 fries. Therefore, the total number of fries taken by all players is: 30 + 2 + 13 + 27 = 82 fries.
Response:  The first aquarium has 4 fish and the second one has 8 fish. If we compare their total value, the difference is twice as much as the value of the second aquarium compared to the first one. So if the value of the first aquarium is x, then the value of the second aquarium is 2x. Therefore, there are more fish in the second aquarium than in the first one.
Response:  The jeansi meik artist earns $250 per day and works for 6 hours a day, which means they make $400 per day. If they work for 4 days a week, their total income is $1600 per week. After completing the film project in 6 weeks, the artist will receive $960 from the producer (10% of $9600). So, the total amount that Jean makes from the film project is $2760 ($1600 x 4 weeks + $960).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Isabelle spent on each category of expenses:

* Food: $12 + $43 = $55
* Decorations: $15
* Cake: $4
* Gifts for parents: $22

Total amount spent = $55 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96 on her party."
Response:  We know that there are 50 bags of rice and each bag weighs 2 kg (kilograms). So, in total, there are 100 kg (kilograms) of rice. If one kilogram of rice costs $1.50, then the total cost of all 100 kg of rice is $150. Therefore, if you buy 50 bags of rice, the cost per bag would be $150 / 50 = $3 per bag.
Response:  On the first day (esmaspäev), Sue had 4 küpsists and consumed 800 calories. On the second day (teisipäev), she had 6 küpsists and consumed 1200 calories. Therefore, on the third day (järeltööd), Sue had 10 küpsists (4 + 6) and consumed 2000 calories (800 + 1200). So, Sue consumed more than twice as many calories on the third day as she did on the first day.
