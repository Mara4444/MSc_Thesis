"Response: 
Jane sells 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes four cakes for her friends every day. So she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market each day.
She sells these remaining eggs at $2 per egg, so she makes $2 x 13 = $26 in revenue from selling eggs each day."
Response:  We need two blue threads for every five white threads to make a hat. So, if we need half of that quantity (5/2 = 2.5), then we will need 2.5 blue threads.
Response:  The initial cost of the house is $80,000 and after renovations it becomes worth $130,000 (150% increase). So, Josh made a profit of $50,000 ($130,000 - $80,000)
Response:  James runs 3 times per week and each time he covers 60 meters. So, in one week, he covers... (60 x 3) = 180 meters. Therefore, James runs 180 meters per week.
"Response: 
Wendy gives three meals to each of her chickens per day, containing seeds, grains, and vegetables. She also feeds her chickens 15 bowls of food in the morning and 25 bowls in the evening. To calculate how many bowls Wendy should give to her chickens for their last meal of the day, we need to divide the total number of bowls she feeds them by the number of chickens she has. In this case, Wendy has 20 chickens. So, if she feeds them 3 meals per day, that means she will feed them a total of 9 meals (3 x 3 = 9). Since she feeds them 15 bowls in the morning and 25 bowls in the evening, that means she will give them a total of 40 bowls of food per day (15 + 25 = 40). Therefore, to determine how many bowls Wendy should give to her chickens for their last meal of the day, we can divide the total number of bowls she feeds them per day by the number of chickens she has: 40 / 20 = 2 bowls per chicken. So, Wendy should give 2 bowls of food to each of her 20 chickens for their last meal of the day."
Response:  If one cup costs $5, then half of it will cost $\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$. Therefore, each cup will cost $\$2.5$. Since Kaylor wants to buy 16 cups, he will have to pay $\$2.5 \times 16 = \$40$.
Response:  We know that Tuula has twice as many sheep as Charleston and four times as many as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Tuula has 2 x 2 = 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, or 80 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Tuula, Charleston, and Seattle is 40 + 80 + 20 = 120 sheep.
"Response: 
1. Karla can download 2 GB per minute.
2. She has been downloading for 40% of the total time (or 40 minutes). So far, she has downloaded 80 MB (2 GB x 40%).
3. Windows requires a 20-minute restart to install updates.
Now we need to calculate how much time will be left after the restart:
Time remaining = Total time - Time spent on restart = 200 GB / 2 GB/min - 20 min = 960 minutes
So, Carla will have 960 minutes (or 16 hours) left to finish downloading the file after the restart."
Response:  John started his journey at 3 hours with a speed of 60 miles per hour and then turned back after realizing he had forgotten something important at home. He tried to return after 4 hours but spent the first 2 hours in traffic jam. Then he drove for the next half an hour with a speed of 30 miles per hour, which means he covered 15 miles (half an hour \* 30 miles/hour). Therefore, he still has 2 hours and 45 minutes left to cover the remaining distance from his starting point to home. So, the distance from his starting point to home is: Distance = Speed x Time + Total Distance Traveled = 80 miles/hour x 2 hours + 15 miles = 175 miles away from home.
"Response: 
Елиза works for 40 hours in the first week and earns $10 per hour. So she makes $400 for those 40 hours.
Then, she works overtime for another 5 hours at $12 per hour. So she makes an additional $60 for those 5 hours.
Total amount earned by Елиза for that week is therefore: $400 + $60 = $460."
"Response: 

First month (January): 60 downloads
Second month (February): 3 x 60 = 180 downloads
Third month (March): 70% of 180 = 126 downloads

So, the program was downloaded 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 times in those three months."
Response:  Tulia bought 3 bundles of poppy seed rolls (each bundle contains 12 pieces) for $68 each = $792. She also bought 2 bundles of mini cakes (each bundle contains 12 pieces) for $80 each = $1600. Finally, she bought 6 bundles of mini cheese cakes (each bundle contains 12 pieces) for $55 each = $660. Therefore, in total, Tulia spent $792 + $1600 + $660 = $3052.
"Response: 
Year 1: Carlos plants the lemon tree and spends $90 on it. He also needs to spend $3 for maintenance, so his total cost in year 1 is $93 ($90 + $3). Since he sells each lemon for $1.5, he will make $7 x 7 = $49 from selling lemons in year 1 (assuming he has 7 lemons). So, his profit in year 1 is $49 - $93 = -$54.
Year 2: In year 2, Carlos will have 7 more lemons than in year 1, since each lemon takes 1 year to mature. So, he will have 7 x 8 = 56 lemons in total. His cost of maintaining the tree remains at $3 per year. If he sells each lemon for $1.5, he will make $56 x $1.5 = $84 from selling lemons in year 2. However, he already spent $93 in year 1, so his net profit in year 2 is $84 - $93 = -$9.
Year 3: In year 3, Carlos will have another 7 lemons, bringing him to a total of 56 x 9 = 504 lemons. His cost of maintaining the tree stays at $3 per year. If he sells each lemon for $1.5, he will make $504 x $1.5 = $756 from selling lemons in year 3. However, he still hasn't broken even yet, as his total costs are higher than his profits.
And so on... Based on this pattern, it will take Carlos approximately 10 years (i.e., 10 times 7 = 70 years) before he starts making a profit from his lemon tree. Therefore, the answer is 10 years."
Response:  Melani started with x prahsmukački (x is a number). She sold one-third of them in the green house, which means she got 1/3x prahsmukački from there. Then she sold another 2/3 of what was left in the red house, which means she got 2(1/3)x = 4x prahsmukački from there. Finally, she sold half of what remained in the orange house, which means she got 1/2(4x) = 8x prahsmukački from there. So, in total, Melani has 9x prahsmukački left. Since she started with x prahsmukački, we can conclude that x = 9.
Response:  We know that out of 20 students in the dance class, 4 are signed up for modern dance (20%). Of the remaining 16 students, 4 are signed up for jazz dance (25%). This means that 4 + 4 = 8 students are signed up for either modern or jazz dance. Therefore, the number of students who are not signed up for modern or jazz dance is 16 - 8 = 8. So, the percentage of students who are signed up for hip-hop dance is 8/20 x 100 = 40%.
"Response: 
Let X be the value of the market increase for biuzets and Y be the value of the market increase for electronics.
We know that the financial advisor predicts an increase in both markets, but the percentage increase is different for each one. So we can write:
X + Y = 2,5% (for biuzets)
Y + X = 1,2% (for electronics)
Now, let's assume that the trader chooses to buy the biuzets, which means he will spend $5000 on them. So his total cost will be:
$5000 + X = $5000 + 2,5% = $5175
If he had chosen to buy the electronics instead, his total cost would have been:
$5000 + Y = $5000 + 1,2% = $4980
So, if the trader chose to buy the biuzets, he will make a profit of:
Profit = Total Cost - Market Value = $5175 - $5000 = $175
Therefore, the trader will make a profit of $175 if he chooses to buy the biuzets."
"Response:  On day one, both trains travel west for 80 miles (130 km), and then they turn north and cover 240 km. So, the total distance traveled by each train on day one is: 80 + 240 = 320 miles (515 km). 
On day two, both trains continue to travel north, covering 240 km again. Therefore, the total distance traveled by each train on day two is: 320 + 240 = 560 miles (901 km)."
Response:  Dil has $20 per hour as an instructor and $30 per hour as a beauty salon manager. If she works for 50 weeks of the year (assuming 4 weeks vacation), then her total hours worked are: Instructor hours = 35 weeks x 30 hours/week + 20 weeks x 20 hours/week = 760 hours Manager hours = 35 weeks x 15 hours/week + 20 weeks x 30 hours/week = 840 hours Total hours = 760 + 840 = 1600 hours Annual pay = Hours worked x Hourly wage = 1600 hours x $20/hour = $32,000 So Dil's annual pay is $32,000.
Response:  If Клеър makes an omelette with 3 eggs every morning for breakfast, then she will have made a total of 21 omelettes in one week (7 days). Therefore, if she continues to make omelettes for 4 weeks, she will have made a total of 84 omelettes (21 x 4 = 84).
"Response:  Marisa has already walked for 4 miles in 1 hour, so she is walking at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the remaining distance is 8 miles (12 - 4 = 8), and the time available is 3 hours (since it took her 1 hour to cover the first 4 miles). So, we can plug these values into the formula like this:

Speed = 8 miles / 3 hours = 2.67 miles/hour

Therefore, Marisa needs to walk at an average speed of 2.67 miles per hour to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles in 3 hours."
"Response:  We have 10 liters of port wine and we want to mix it with 15 liters of pineapple juice, which is 3/4 water. So, we need to calculate how much water is in the remaining 24 liters.

First, let's calculate how much water is in the original 10 liters of port wine:

10 liters x 2/3 = 6.7 liters (water)

Now, let's subtract the amount of water in the port wine from the total volume of the mixture:

15 liters - 6.7 liters = 8.3 liters (remaining water)

Therefore, there are 8.3 liters of water left in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:
Raymond and Samantha are cousins.
Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.
Samantha is currently 31 years old.
So, we can calculate the age of Raymond at the time his son was born as follows:
Raymond's son was born 6 years ago + 6 = 29 years old (since Raymonnd was born 6 years before Samantha).
Therefore, Raysmond's son was born 29 years ago.
So, if Saamntha is currently 31 years old, then her cousin Raymond's son must have been born 4 years ago."
"Response: 
Step 1: First three customers buy one each = 3 DVDs
Step 2: Next two customers buy 2 each = 4 DVDs
Step 3: Last three customers don't buy any = 0 DVDs
Total number of DVDs sold = 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs
Therefore, Bill sold 7 DVDs in Wednesday."
Response:  The candle melts at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So if it burns for 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00), it will have melted 8 cm (2 x 4). Therefore, after burning from 13:00 to 17:00, the candle will be 8 cm shorter than its original height.
"Response:  We know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book and there is a 25% discount from the initial price. So we can write an equation as follows:

$19.50 = x \* (1 - 0.25)

Where x is the initial price of the book. Solving for x, we get:

x = $74.80

So the initial price of the book was $74.80."
"Response:  We know that Marry paid $50 for all of these items. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

$12 + $3 + $1,50 + $8,50 = $50

Now let's solve for the number of cups of pizza that Mary ordered:

$12 + $3 + $1,50 = $50

Subtracting $3 from both sides gives us:

$1,50 = $47

Dividing both sides by $47 gives us:

3 = x

Therefore, Mary ordered 3 cups of pizza, which cost her $8,50 in total."
"Response: 
Misha bought 3 shirts for $16.50 each, so he spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on shirts.
He also bought 3 pairs of pants for $22.50 each, so he spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on pants.
Finally, he bought 3 pairs of shoes for $42 each, so he spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes.
In total, Misha spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233 on all his clothes."
"Response:  Synthia eats one portion of ice cream every night, and she buys boxes of ice cream with 15 portions per box at a price of $4 per box. After 60 days, how much will she have spent on ice cream?

Step 1: Calculate the number of portions of ice cream Synthia consumes in one day.
Portions = Number of days / 60 (days in a month)
Portions = 60 / 60 = 1

So, Synthia consumes one portion of ice cream every day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of portions of ice cream Synthia will consume in 60 days.
Total Portions = Number of days \* Number of portions/day
Total Portions = 60 \* 1 = 60

Therefore, Synthia will consume 60 portions of ice cream in 60 days.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of ice cream consumed by Synthia in 60 days.
Cost = Total Portions \* Price per portion
Cost = 60 \* $4 = $240

Therefore, after 60 days, Synthia will have spent $240 on ice cream."
Response:  We know that Henrik made two stops during his 60-mile journey with a bike. He stopped after 20 miles and again before finishing the journey. So, we can calculate the distance between the two stops as follows: Distance = Total distance - Stopped distance = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles Therefore, Henrik traveled 40 miles between his first and second stops.
Response:  Gloria has to choose between two pairs of shoes that cost $5 less than the botushes and one pair of shoes with high heels that costs twice as much as the other shoe. The total cost of both shoes is $10. So, if one shoe costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, then the second shoe costs $66. Therefore, the total cost of the botushes is $72 ($33 + $66).
Response:  We know that Darel and Alan are currently 7 years old, so in 10 years they will be 17 + 7 = 24 years old. Therefore, after 10 years, Alan's age will be 162 - 24 = 138 years old.
Response:  The first friend said there are 80 marbles in the burka. If the second friend says that there are 20 more than half of the first friend's number, then the second friend means that there are 40 (half of 80) + 20 = 60 marbles in the burka. Now, if the third friend says that there are 25% more than the first friend's number, then the third friend means that there are 130 (25% more than 80) = 170 marbles in the burka. Therefore, the average number of marbles among the three friends is (80 + 60 + 170) / 3 = 130.
Response:  John spends half an hour with each dog per day, so he has to spend time with all dogs in total. There are 10 dogs, so he needs to spend 5 hours (half an hour x 10 dogs) with them every day. Therefore, John spends 35 hours (5 hours/day x 7 days/week) taking care of his dogs every week.
Response:  We know that Grechyan has 110 coins in total and 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if he has x silver coins, then he has 110 - 30 = 80 gold coins. Therefore, the number of zlatn moieties Grechyan has is 80.
Response:  We know that Aaron has 5 more biyuts than half of Reymond's biyuts. So if Reymond has 40 biyuts, then Aaron has 40 + 5 = 45 biyuts. Now we need to find out how many biyuts Shiban has. According to the question, Shiban has two camaks less than Aaron. So if Aaron has 45 biyuts, then Shiban has 45 - 2 = 43 biyuts. Therefore, Shiban has 43 biyuts.
Response:  Mike played for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, he scored an additional 25% of 4 points = 1 point in the next 20 minutes. So, Mike scored a total of 5 points (4 + 1) in the last 20 minutes.
Response:  If Teri eats 2 cups of yogurt per day and there are 4 cups in a jar, then she consumes 1/2 jar (or 2 cups) per day. Since each cup costs $5.00, Teri spends $10.00 per day on yogurt. To find out how much she spends over 30 days, we can multiply the daily cost by 30: $10.00 x 30 = $300.00. Therefore, Teri spends $300.00 on yogurt over 30 days.
Response:  John has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, so he spends a total of $160. Therefore, there are still 5 Lego sets left ($160 - $15 x 13 = $5).
"Response:  John runs for 100 km per week, which means he covers that distance in 7 days (assuming no rest days). Since he trains 3 days a week, we can assume he doesn't run the full 100 km on each of those 3 days either. So let's break it down like this:

* Day 1: 3 hours x 3 days/week = 9 hours/week
* Days 2 and 3: Total time = 100 km / 2 days = 50 km/day

Now, to calculate his speed, we need to divide the total distance covered by the time taken to cover it:

Speed = Distance / Time = 50 km / 9 hours = 5.6 km/hour

So, John's current running speed is approximately 5.6 km/hour."
"Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than she walks and can jump with a speed that is half as fast as her running speed, then we know that:

* Running speed = x (since she runs four times faster than she walks)
* Jumping speed = 0.5x (since it's half as fast as her running speed)

Now, let's find out how many miles Dana can cover in one hour:

Running speed = x miles/hour
Jumping speed = 0.5x miles/hour

Since Dana can cover 3 miles in one hour while jogging, we know that her running speed must be at least 3/4 of her jumping speed:

x > 0.75(0.5x) = 0.375x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12 miles/hour

So, Dana can cover 12 miles in one hour while jogging. Now, to find out how many miles she can cover in 6 hours, we multiply her running speed by 6:

Total distance covered = 12 miles/hour x 6 hours = 72 miles

Finally, since Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking, we need to adjust the total distance accordingly:

Adjusted distance = Total distance covered / (running time + walking time)
= 72 miles / (3/6 + 2/6)
= 72 miles / 5
= 14.4 miles per hour

Therefore, Dana can cover 14.4 miles per hour while jogging."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:

* The age of Ben's iPhone is twice that of Suzi's iPhone (i.e., Ben's iPhone is older than Suzi's).
* Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone (i.e., Brandon's iPhone is older than Ben's).

So, if Suzi's iPhone is one year old, then Brandon's iPhone must be at least four years older than Suzi's iPhone. Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is at least five years old (4 x 1 = 5)."
"Response: 
Let d be the distance from Polly to Dragon (in feet).
Since dragon is 1000 ft away from Polly at first, we have d = 1000.
When Polly throws the golden copy, it goes 400 ft away from her, so the new distance between them is d = 600 ft.
Now, when Polly holds sapphire, she can throw the golden copy three times farther than before, so the new distance between them is d = 3 × 600 = 1800 ft.
Finally, since the dragon is 1000 ft away from Polly initially and she hits it with the golden copy after throwing it 1800 ft away, we have d = 1000 + 1800 = 2800 ft."
Response:  Baaba Joans baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's afternoon snack. She cut each pie into eight pieces and placed five of them on the serving platter for guests to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after guests had taken and eaten their share of the pieces, there were 14 remaining pieces. So, guests took 90 pieces (14 remaining pieces x 6 pieces per pie).
Response:  If one serving of chips has 250 calories and there are 5 servings in total (300 grams), then each serving contains 250/5 = 50 calories. Since you have already consumed 1800 calories today, which is more than your daily goal of 2000 calories, you can eat up to 50 - 1800 = 1750 calories worth of chips.
Response:  If Charlie sells each candle for $2, he will make $2 x 20 = $40 from selling 20 candles. However, he spent $10 per kilogram of beeswax, so he also needs to subtract that amount from his total earnings. Therefore, his net profit is $40 - ($10/kg) x 20 kg = $40 - $200 = -$160. So, his net loss is $160.
"Response: 
Meredith wrote 7 articles in total last week (5 on Monday and 2 on Wednesday).
She spent an average of 4 hours per article, so she spent a total of 28 hours writing articles last week (4 x 7 = 28)."
"Response:  We know that Kandi had 80 notes in her bag before she went to work at the cafe. Then, she stopped at a store and bought a pack of Post-it notes. Since each pack contains a fixed number of notes (not mentioned in the problem), let's assume that the pack contained x Post-it notes.
Now, we know that Kandi placed one note from the pack on top of each of the 220 coffee cups at work. So, if there were x notes in the pack, then the total number of notes used by Kandis is:
x + 80 = 220
Solving for x, we get:
x = 140
Therefore, there were 140 notes in the pack that Kandi bought."
Response:  John buys twice as many red socks as blue ones. So he buys 2x = 2 \* 10 = 20 red socks and x = 10 blue socks. The price of each red sock is 50% more than that of blue socks, so the cost of each red sock is (1.5 \* 40) = 60 dollars. Therefore, the total cost of all socks is: 20 + 10 \* 60 = 1200 dollars.
"Response:  Tracy has a piece of land that is 4 feet long. If she cuts it into pieces with a length of 15 cm (which is equal to 0.6 feet), then we can calculate how many pieces she will get as follows:

Length of each piece = Length of the land / Length of each piece
= 4 ft / 0.6 ft
= 6.67 pieces

So, Tracy will have approximately 6.67 pieces of land with a size of 15 cm x 4 ft = 60 cm x 4 ft = 240 cm^2 each."
Response:  The total number of floors in the building is 15, and each floor has 8 apartments, so the total number of apartments in the building is 15 x 8 = 120. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of free apartments can be calculated as follows: Free apartments = Total number of apartments - (3/4) x Total number of floors = 120 - (3/4) x 15 = 96. Therefore, there are 96 free apartments in the building.
"Response:  If Loyd has a farm with chickens that lay eggs and he sells them for $2 per dozen, then we can calculate how much money Lloyd makes from eggs in one week as follows:

Number of eggs produced by chickens per day = 252
Number of days in a week = 7
Total number of eggs produced by chickens in a week = Number of eggs produced per day x Number of days in a week = 252 x 7 = 1764 eggs

Now, let's find out how much money Lloyd makes from selling these eggs:
Selling price of an egg = $2
Total amount of money made from selling eggs in a week = Total number of eggs sold x Selling price of an egg = 1764 eggs x $2 = $3528

So, Lloyd makes $3528 from selling eggs in one week."
Response:  The ship can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours (from 1 to 4 hours). Then it will slow down and travel at a speed of 6 miles per hour until it returns. To find out how long it takes for the ship to return, we need to divide the distance traveled during this time by the speed at which it is moving: Distance = Speed x Time = 6 miles/hour x (time taken to return) = 6 miles/hour x (distance traveled after slowing down) = 6 miles/hour x (distance from 4 to 7 hours) = 6 miles/hour x (2 hours) = 12 hours Therefore, it will take the ship 12 hours to return.
Response:  Chantata has to lose 5 kg from his weight. Each comic book weighs 1 kg and each toy weighs 1 kg as well. If he takes away 30 comics, how many toys does he have to take away in order to reach the target of losing 5 kg? So, he needs to take away 30 / 2 = 15 toys.
"Response: 
On Monday (четвъртък), the mechanic repaired 6 guams for trucks and 4 guams for cars, so he earned $60 + $40 = $100 in total.
On Friday (петък), the mechanic repaired 12 cars but did not repair any tires, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480 in total.
Therefore, the mechanic earned a total of $580 in one day."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:

* Сестрите Дъфтфайър (the sister cats) have 7 kittens between them.
* Осиновените котенца (adopted kittens) are from a local animal shelter.
* Мая (Maya) is the mother of the kittens and informs the sisters that their home cat, Patchi, has just given birth to three times as many kittens as Trixi, who has 12 kittens.

So, if we calculate the total number of kittens among the Duffy family (September, Maya, and their offspring), including both adopted and biological kittens, we get:

7 + 3 x 3 = 21

Therefore, the Duffy family has 21 kittens in total."
Response:  Dijen has 30 ice cream cones and eats two of them. Now he has 30 - 2 = 28 ice cream cones left. He wants to package 2 ice cream cones in each bag. So, how many bags can Dijen fill with his remaining ice cream cones? We need to divide 28 by 2 = 14. Therefore, Dijen can fill 14 bags with his ice cream cones.
Response:  Peter always pays $7 for a ticket and $7 for snacks. If he has $42 for the week, that means he can go to the movies $6 \div 7 = 8 times. So, Peter can go to the movies 8 times if he has $42 for the week.
"Response:  The maximum weight that the bridge can bear is 5000 pounds (or 2268 kg). If we divide this value by the weight of each box (which is 5 kg), we get the maximum number of boxes that can be carried by the camion without overloading the bridge:

Maximum number of boxes = Maximum weight of bridge / Weight of each box
= 2268 kg / 5 kg
= 453 boxes
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 453 boxes."
Response:  The total cost of the food was $40.00 + (25% of $40.00) = $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00. Then, STEVEN added $4.00 as a tip, so the final price would be $50.00 + $4.00 = $54.00.
Response:  We have 1 cluster of 20 fruits and 6 clusters with 20 fruits each, for a total of 120 fruits. Additionally, there are 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the bush. So, in total, we have 120 + 67 = 187 malini.
"Response:  We know that there are 25 portocales in total and we want to find out how many of them are good. From the information given, we can conclude that:

* 1 is bad (loosh)
* 20% are not ripe yet (not specified if they are good or bad)
* 2 are sour (кисели)
* The remaining 23 are good (добри)

So, let's calculate the number of good portocales:

Good portocales = Total portocales - Bad portocales - Sour portocales
= 25 - 1 - 2
= 22

Therefore, there are 22 good portocales in the basket."
"Response: 
Jane buys fabric for her daughter's dress at $500. Then she pays an additional $800 for embellishments (jewels, lace, etc.). Finally, she spends $80 ($10% of $800) on insurance. Therefore, Jane pays a total of $1380."
Response:  If Mars works for the same company for 40 years and receives an annual pension of $50,000 after 20 years, then his annual pension is $100,000 ($50,000 x 2). After another 10 years, he will receive 5% of the current year's pension as a bonus, which is $5,000 ($100,000 x 5%). Therefore, Mars' total annual pension after 30 years of work is $105,000 ($100,000 + $5,000).
"Response:  Alina pays $140 per month for the stream service. If the company initially charged her the full amount for the first half of the year and then reduced it by 10% for the second half, we can calculate the total amount she paid as follows:

First half (January to June): $140 x 6 = $840
Second half (July to December): $840 x 0.9 = $752
Total amount paid by Alina: $840 + $752 = $1,592
Therefore, Alina paid a total of $1,592 for the stream service throughout the year."
"Response:  So far, Sofia has traveled 160 km with her car and needs to fill up with 4 gallons of gasoline to continue driving. According to the manual, her car's fuel tank can hold 12 gallons of gasoline. Therefore, Sofia can travel an additional distance of:

Distance = Fuel capacity - Used fuel capacity
= 12 gal - 4 gal
= 8 gal

So, Sofia can travel approximately 8 miles (or 13 kilometers) more with one reservoir of gasoline."
Response:  Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to read for half of the remaining time. So, if he watches TV for x hours in one week, he will spend (x/2) + 2 = 3x/2 hours reading that week. Since he does this 3 times a week, he will spend 3(3x/2) = 9x/4 hours reading over 4 weeks. Therefore, Jim spends 9x/4 = 2.25 hours watching TV and 7.75 hours reading per week.
"Response: 
1. There are four schools participating in the tournament.
2. Each school has an girls' and boys' team, with each team consisting of 5 players.
3. Therefore, there are a total of 4 x 2 = 8 teams participating in the tournament (4 schools x 2 teams per school).
4. Since each school also has a coach for each team, there are a total of 8 x 2 = 16 coaches participating in the tournament (8 teams x 2 coaches per team).
So, in total, there are 8 teams and 16 coaches participating in the tournament."
Response:  We know that there were 175 diamonds and 35 rubies less than the diamonds in total. So, if we have x diamonds, then we have (x - 35) rubies. Since there are twice as many emeralds as rubies, we can say that for every ruby, there are two emeralds. Therefore, the number of emeralds is 2(x - 35). Now, we need to find out how many stones are in total. The sum of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds must be equal to the total number of stones found. So, we can write an equation: 175 + (x - 35) + 2(x - 35) = 175 + 175 + 2(x - 35) = 600. Solving for x, we get x = 480. So, there were 480 stones in total.
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in school. So if there are x girls, then there are 2x boys. Since each teacher has 5 students, we can write an equation: x + (2x) = 180. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 180. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we find that x = 60. Therefore, there are 60 girls and 120 boys in the school.
Response:  Baily started with $x dollars and received an additional $5 every week for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, she had $100. So, we can write an equation: x + (5 \* 8) = 100. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = $60. Therefore, Baily started with $60.
Response:  Judy teaches for 5 hours per day from Monday to Friday and for 8 hours on Saturday. Therefore, she teaches for a total of 30 hours (5 x 6 = 30) during the week and 40 hours (8 x 5 = 40) on Saturdays. If each class has 15 students, then the total number of students Judy teaches in one week is 30 x 15 = 450, and on Saturdays it is 40 x 15 = 600. Since Judy charges $15 per student, her income for one week would be $450 + $600 = $1050.
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one (i.e., 40 instructions). Therefore, Kelly needs to read 40 instructions in total to prepare both dishes.
Response:  Tom sells biscuits for $3 per piece and cheesecakes for $4 per piece. If he sells 43 brownies and 23 pieces of cheesecake, we can calculate his total earnings as follows: Total earnings = Number of brownies x Price of brownies + Number of cheesecakes x Price of cheesecakes In this case, the number of brownies is 43, so the total earnings from brownies are: Total earnings (brownies) = 43 x $3 = $130 And the number of cheesecakes is 23, so the total earnings from cheesecakes are: Total earnings (cheesecakes) = 23 x $4 = $92 Therefore, Tom will have earned a total of $130 + $92 = $222 in donations.
"Response:  We know that Shyla will buy 5 mobile phones for $150 each, and she will pay for them every month for 3 months. So, her total cost for buying these phones is:

$150 x 5 = $750

Now, we have to calculate the interest amount that Shyla will pay for each phone. The interest rate is 2%, so we can calculate it as follows:

Interest amount = Principal amount x Interest rate x Time period
= $750 x 2% x 3/12
= $45

So, the total amount that Shyla will pay for each phone in 3 months is:

Total amount = Principal amount + Interest amount
= $750 + $45
= $895

Therefore, Shyla will pay $895 for each of the 5 mobile phones she bought."
Response:  If Arty sells 12 gernets of marigolds at $2.74 each, he will make $32.08 ($2.74 x 12). If he sells 9 gernets of petunias at $1.87 each, he will make $16.53 ($1.87 x 9). And if he sells 17 gernets of begonias at $2.12 each, he will make $35.34 ($2.12 x 17). So in total, Arty will make $83.95.
Response:  If Luke builds a sandcastle with $n$ levels, each level has half of the area of the previous level ($A_i = \frac{1}{2} A_{i-1}$). Therefore, the total area of all levels is $\sum_{i=1}^n A_i = n\cdot \frac{1}{2}^{n-1}$. Now we know that the highest level has an area of $16$ square meters, so we can find the middle level's area as follows: $A_m = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n A_i = \frac{1}{2}(n\cdot \frac{1}{2}^{n-1}) = \frac{n}{4}$.
"Response:  According to the veterinarian, Cecilia needs to feed her puppy with 1 cup of food for dogs every day during the first 180 days. After that, she needs to feed it with 2 cups of food for dogs every day until the end of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags will Cecilia use during the first year?  Solution: We can start by finding out how many cups of food Cecilia needs to buy during the first year. Since the puppy needs 1 cup of food per day during the first 180 days, and then 2 cups of food per day until the end of its life, we need to multiply these two amounts: 180 days x 1 cup/day = 180 cups; + (365 - 180) days x 2 cups/day = 790 cups Total number of cups of food needed = 180 + 790 = 970 cups Now, let's find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia needs to buy based on the information provided in the question: One bag of dog food contains 110 cups, so we can divide the total number of cups needed by the amount of food contained in each bag: Number of bags = Total cups / Cups per bag = 970 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8-9 bags Therefore, Cecilia will need between 8 and 9 bags of dog food during the first year."
"Response:  If Reymond earns half of Sarah's laundry and Sarah does 4 times more laundry than David, then we can write:
Reymond's laundry = (1/2) × Sarah's laundry
Sarah's laundry = 4 × David's laundry
Now we have two equations:
Reymond's laundry = 200 pounds (since he earns half)
Sarah's laundry = 320 pounds (since she does 4 times more than David)
Solving for the difference between Reyamnd and David's laundry, we get:
Difference = Sarah's laundry - (Reymond's laundry + David's laundry)
= 320 - (200 + x)
Where x is the amount of laundry that David does. Substituting the values given in the question, we get:
x = 160 pounds
So the difference between Reyamnd and David's laundry is 160 pounds."
Response:  If Vincent buys 3 bunches of flowers for $2.50 each, he will spend a total of $7.50. Now, if he buys 2 bunches instead, he will save $2.50 ($7.50 - $5). So, if he buys 18 bunches in total, he will save $42 ($2.50 x 18).
"Response:  The cost of grooming for John is $100 (since he said ""John osinovava куче""). The grimier offers him a discount of 30%, which means that the new price will be:
$100 x (1 - 0.30) = $70
So, grirming costs John $70."
Response:  If two girls took 1/6 of 24 liters of water each, then they took in total 24 / 2 = 12 liters of water. Since one boy received 6 liters of water, this means that 6 + 12 = 18 liters of water remained after they drank it. Therefore, 18 liters of water remain.
"Response:  Charlie had 10 stickers initially. He bought 21 more from the store and received 23 additional stickers as a birthday gift. Then he gave 9 of them to his sister and used 28 for decorating a greeting card. So, how many stickers are left with Charlie?

Let's count the number of stickers Charlie has at each stage:

Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.
He bought 21 more from the store, so now he has 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.
He received 23 more as a birthday gift, so now he has 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.
He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.
He used 28 stickers for decorating a greeting card, so now he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left with him.
Therefore, there are 17 stickers left with Charlie."
"Response:  We know that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, if we convert Grace's weight to kilograms, we get:
Grace weighs 125 lb = 56 kg (since 1 lb = 0.453592 kg)
Now, we can see that Alex weighs less than 4 times what Grace weighs in kilograms:
Alex weighs x kg < 56 kg × 4 = 224 kg
So, Alex weighs approximately 224 kg or 494 lbs."
Response:  We have three rose bushes with 25 roses each. So, in total, we have 3 x 25 = 75 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns, so altogether we have 75 x 8 = 600 thorns. Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total.
Response:  The team has played 22 matches and won 8 more than they lost. So, if they have lost x times, they have won 22 - x times. We know that their total wins are equal to 8 more than their losses, so we can write an equation: 22 - x = 8 + x. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, the team has won 14 matches and lost 8 matches.
"Response: 
1. The number of years since he started going on vacation is 11 (from 23 to 34).
2. Each year, he has taken 4 vacations (according to the statement). Therefore, the total number of vacations he has taken is 4 x 11 = 44 vacations.
3. Since each vacation requires a new set of pajamas, and there are 44 vacations in total, then the number of sets of pajamas he owns is also 44.
So, the answer is 44."
"Response: 
1st time: 4 times
2nd time: longer than 1st time = 3 x (number of times it rang in the first time) + 1 = 3 x 4 + 1 = 12
3rd time: shorter than 2nd time = 3 x (number of times it rang in the second time) / 2 = 3 x 12 / 2 = 6
So, the alarms rang a total of 18 times."
"Response:  If Silvi works for 5 years in the company as of December last year and the company increases salaries by 10% every year, then her current salary can be calculated as follows:
Year 1 (first 5 years): $600 x 1.1 = $660
Year 2: $660 x 1.1 = $728
Year 3: $728 x 1.1 = $804
Year 4: $804 x 1.1 = $900
Year 5: $900 x 1.1 = $1,000
Therefore, after working for 8 years in the company (including the current year), Silvi's annual salary would be $1,000."

Q: Първият албум на Мерилин се продава 10 пъти повече от този на Харалд. Ако са продали 88000 copies, how many copies has Harald sold?
A: Let's think step by step. According to the problem, Melina's first album is selling 10 times more than Harald's album. So if Melina has sold 88000 copies, Harald has sold:

88000 x 1/10 = 8800 copies"
"Response:  Since there are 16 guests invited to the party and each guest will receive 75 gift bags, the total number of gift bags needed is:

16 guests x 75 gift bags per guest = 1200 gift bags

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost of all the gift bags needed for the party is:

1200 gift bags x $2 per gift bag = $2400

Therefore, Kristina will spend $2400 on gift bags for her birthday party."
Response:  We know that one adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of coleslaw and half of it is 5 pounds (since there are twice as many children as adults). So, if there are 20 adults, they will eat 20 x 10 = 200 pounds of coleslaw. Since there are 5 children, they will eat 5 x 5 = 25 pounds of coleslaw. In total, we need to bring 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of coleslaw to the picnic.
"Response: 
Marsha has three times as many pets as Jan, so Marsha has 3 x 3 = 9 pets.
Marcia has two more pets than Marcia, so Marcia has 9 + 2 = 11 pets.
Sindy has four more pets than Marcia, so Sindy has 11 + 4 = 15 pets.
Therefore, the total number of pets among the three is 9 + 11 + 15 = 45 pets."
"Response:  We know that Emily has four children: Emi (age 5), Jackson (age 3), Corey (age 7), and James (age 10). From the information provided, we can deduce the following:

* Emily is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is age 3.
* Corey is 2 years younger than Jackson, so Corey is age 7.
* James is 1 year younger than Corey, so James is age 9.

Therefore, Djaxson is age 3."
"Response:  If Li can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds, then his speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time = 400 m / 38 s = 10.5 m/s

Now, if Jeff changes his diet and improves his running speed by 10%, his new speed will be:

New Speed = Old Speed x (1 + Percentage Change) = 10.5 m/s x (1 + 10%) = 11.65 m/s

So, Jeff can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 34.9 seconds."
Response:  We know that there are fewer rabbits than dogs and cats in the quarter. If there are 60 dogs, then there must be less than 60 x 2 = 120 cats. Since there are more cats than rabbits, we can conclude that there are at most 120 - 12 = 108 rabbits in the quarter. Therefore, there are 108 + 60 = 168 domestic pets (dogs, cats, and rabbits) in the quarter.
"Response:  From the given information we know that out of 200 students in the fifth grade:
* 2/5 = 40 are boys (momchezi)
* 2/3 = 67 are girls (moimchi)
So, there are 40 boys and 67 girls in the scouts. Therefore, there are 67 - 40 = 27 girls who are not in the scouts."
Response:  We know that Ha...
"Response:  We know that when Fred cooked canned tomatoes in his soup, they lost half their volume. Each box of tomatoes he used contained three tomatoes. The last portion of home-made soup Fred made had 32 fluid ounces. So, how many tomatoes did Fred use? 

Now we have enough information to calculate the number of tomatoes Fred used:

Number of tomatoes = Volume of soup / Volume of one tomato
= 32 uints / 1/2 cup (volume of one tomato)
= 64 tomatoes

Therefore, Fred used 64 tomatoes."
"Response:  The total number of cars initially on the highway is 30. In the first 15 minutes, some cars pass through the bottleneck and 20 more cars pass through in the remaining 15 minutes. Since 5 cars exit the highway without passing through the bottleneck, the total number of cars that passed through the bottleneck is:
Total cars = Initial cars + Cars that passed through bottleneck
= 30 + (20 x 0.75)
= 30 + 15
= 45
Therefore, 45 cars passed through the bottleneck during the first 15 minutes."
"Response: 
Meri has already 2 rae plants in each of the 40 windows of her big house in the province. So she has 80 plants in total.
Yesterday, she received 18 new plants from her favorite plant garden.
She decides to give one plant to each friend and family member today.
So, she will give away 18 plants (she already had 80 + 18 = 98).
Now, let's count how many plants Mei has left after giving them away: 98 - 18 = 80.
Therefore, Meri has 80 plants remaining in her saxia."
Response:  The first friend pressed the button 20 times before Jerome opened it, so the total number of presses was 20. Then, the second friend pressed the button 20 + (1/4) \* 20 = 35 times more than the first friend. So, the third friend pressed the button 35 + 10 = 45 times more than the second friend. Finally, if the fourth friend pressed the button 60 times, then the total number of presses would be 45 + 60 = 105. Therefore, there will be 105 clicks on the button.
Response:  Solomon has to read 4 pages from his science book, 20 pages from his social sciences book, 7 pages from his history book, and 8 pages from his geography book in total. If he reads 15 pages on Monday, then he will have to read an average of 3.75 pages per day (15 / 4 = 3.75).
Response:  John drinks water every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. He also drinks an additional glass of water before bedtime. So, in total, he drinks 3 x 7 = 21 glasses of water per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, John drinks 21 / 7 = 3 glasses of water per day. Therefore, John drinks 3 glasses of water per day.
Response:  We know that from the ocean to the city is 3 miles (x) and it takes 10 minutes for mugla to cover this distance. The coastline of the country is 42 miles away from the city. So we can write an equation as follows: x / 6 = 42 / 10 where x represents the number of minutes it will take for the fog to reach the coast from the city. Solving for x, we get x = 7 minutes. Therefore, it will take 7 minutes for the fog to reach the coast from the city.
"Response: 

Part 1 (Popa): Popa places one quarter of the puzzle pieces on the board, which means she has placed 250 pieces (since there are 1000 pieces in total).

Part 2 (Mother): Mother then places one third of the remaining pieces on the board, which means she has placed 333 pieces (since there were 667 pieces left after Part 1). In total, both Popa and Mother have placed 583 pieces on the board (250 + 333 = 583).

So, there are 417 pieces left to be placed on the board (1000 - 583 = 417)."
Response:  Amir eats three times more biscuits than Aiden. So if Aiden eats 5 biscuits, then Amir eats 3 x 5 = 15 biscuits. Therefore, together they eat 15 + 5 = 20 biscuits.
"Response:  The volume of each box is given as follows:

Volume of first box = Length x Width x Height = 5 in x 6 in x 4 in = 120 cubic inches
Volume of second box = Length x Width x Height = 5 in x 6 in x 4 in = 120 cubic inches
Volume of third box = Length x Width x Height = 5 in x 6 in x 4 in = 120 cubic inches
Total volume of all three boxes = Volume of first box + Volume of second box + Volume of third box = 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches = 360 cubic inches
Therefore, the total internal volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches."
"Response: 
Frank watched TV after finishing his homework every evening. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched one hour of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched several episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched an hour-long episode and 30 minutes of another show. On Friday, he was supposed to stay up late, so he watched two hour-long episodes. If Frank watched 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?
Solution: Let X be the number of 30-minute episodes Frank watched on Wednesday. We know that Frank watched a total of 7 hours of TV, so the sum of the time he spent watching each type of show is equal to 7 hours:
1 hour (Monday and Tuesday) + 30 minutes (Wednesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) = 7 hours
We also know that Frank watched 30 minutes of another show on Thursday, so we can write:
X + 30 minutes = 2 hours
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Solving them simultaneously, we get:
X = 4
So Frank watched 4 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
Response:  Last year, Henry made x biquettes for the local race. He wanted to make twice as many this year, so he made 2x biquettes. However, when he finished baking, he realized that he had actually made 3x biquettes instead of 2x. So, last year he made x/2 = 55 biquettes. Now, he has 110 biquettes in total, which means he made 110 - 55 = 55 more biquettes this year than last year. Therefore, the number of biquettes Henry made last year is 55.
"Response:  If the local gas station sells gas for $3 per gallon and the company offers a $20 cashback for each gallon purchased at that station, then the total amount of money received after buying 10 gallons of gas is:

$3 x 10 = $30 (for the gas itself) + $20 x 10 = $200 (cashback) = $230
Therefore, with the cashback, the person will have $230 after buying 10 gallons of gas."
Response:  If both Marcel and Beatriz eat equally, they will have eaten $\frac{3}{5}$ of the total number of packages (since $3$ is the length of Marcel's package and $5$ is the total number of packages). Therefore, if we assume that they eat at the same rate, they will have eaten $\frac{3}{5} \times 24 = 12$ packages in total. So, their average consumption per person would be $\frac{12}{2} = 6$.
Response:  We know that Julia took 16 seconds to reach the shore after leaving the lake. Since she was moving at a rate of two liters per ten feet, we can calculate her distance traveled as follows: Distance = Rate x Time = 2 L/10 F x 16 S = 320 F (since there are 10 feet in 1 fathom) So, Julia traveled 320 feet while crossing the lake. Now, let's find out how much water was in her boat when she reached the shore: Water in boat = Total distance / Speed = 320 F / 2 L/10 F = 160 L (since there are 2 liters in 1 gallon, and 1000 liters in 1 cubic meter) Therefore, Julia had 160 liters of water in her boat when she reached the shore.
Response:  Since there are 4 teachers who share the whiteboard and each teacher has 2 lessons per day, the number of times the board is used in one day is: 4 x 2 = 8. If the board is cleaned 3 times an hour, then it will be cleaned: 8 / 3 = 2.67 times per day. So, the board is cleaned approximately 2.67 times per day.
"Response:  Ryan plants two flowers per day in his garden for 15 days. If he doesn't plant any flowers for 5 days (days 6-10), then how many flowers will he have after 15 days?
Let X be the number of flowers that Ryan has after 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers per day initially, the total number of flowers he has after 5 days is 2 x 5 = 10. So, the total number of flowers he has after 15 days is X + 10 = 15.
Therefore, the answer is 15."
"Response: 
We know that the phone of Jamal can store 6 times more images than the one of Britney. So, if the phone of Britney can hold 50 times more images than the number of birds in the picture with Jamal and his friends at the zoo, then we can say that the phone of Britney can hold 50 x 6 = 300 images.
Now, let's find out how many birds are visible in the picture taken by Jamal. If he took 1800 pictures, it means that each picture contains 1800 / 6 = 300 birds. Therefore, there are 300 birds visible in the picture taken by Jamal."
"Response: 
Sasha has ten dunnage pieces that cost her $ 10 each, so she will get $ 10 x 10 = $ 100 from selling them. She also has five pieces of lumber that cost her $ 16 each, so she will get $ 16 x 5 = $ 80 from selling those as well. In total, Sasha will make $ 100 + $ 80 = $ 180 in profit from selling all of her wood products."
"Response:  We know that Katy used 7 times more tea than water in her tea mixture, so if she used x cups of tea, she used 7x cups of water. Since there are 120 total cups of liquid (tea and water), we can set up the equation:

x + 7x = 120

Simplifying the equation:

8x = 120

Dividing both sides by 8:

x = 15

So Katy used 15 cups of tea in her mixture."
Response:  John bought two pairs of shoes for each of his three children. So he paid $2 \times 3 = 60$ dollars in total.
Response:  On day one, the customs officer counted 2 containers with a total of 10 vehicles (5 per container). So, there were 2 containers on day one. On day two, more containers arrived and the total number of vehicles in the port reached 30. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can conclude that there were additional 6 containers on day two (30 - 10 = 20). Therefore, the number of containers brought on day two is 6.
Response:  We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Laila's four years ago and now it has increased by 40%. So, Adrien's current salary is 140% (30% + 40%) of his previous salary. Similarly, we can calculate Laila's current salary as 120% (30% - 40%) of her previous salary. Now, let's find out how much each of them earned in the last four years. For Adrien: Current salary = 140% x Previous salary = $68,000 (since he made $40,000 four years ago) For Laila: Current salary = 120% x Previous salary = $57,600 (since she made $40,000 four years ago) Finally, to find their combined total earnings over the past four years, simply add up their individual earnings: Total earnings = Adrien's earnings + Laila's earnings = $68,000 + $57,600 = $125,600
Response:  Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for drawing. Therefore, he uses 8 sheets of paper per month (2 x 4 weeks). Since there are 30 days in a month, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper per year (8 x 30).
Response:  Morizet brought 5 apples and 8 portokales, so together they have 13 fruit (5 + 8 = 13). Since Kael brought twice as many apples as Morizet, he brought 2 \* 5 = 10 apples. Therefore, the total number of fruits is 13 + 10 = 23.
Response:  On Monday, she slept for 8 hours. Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept for 2 hours less than on Monday, so she slept for 6 hours each day (6 + 6 = 12). Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, she slept for 1 hour more than on Monday, so she slept for 9 hours each day (9 + 9 + 9 = 27). Therefore, throughout the week, she slept for a total of 27 + 6 + 6 + 9 = 48 hours.
Response:  If Rosie can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, she will have covered a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Then, if her speed decreases to 8 km/h, she will cover a distance of 7 x 8 = 56 kilometers in 7 hours. So, in total, Rosie can cover a distance of 30 + 56 = 86 miles or 139 kilometers.
Response:  When Jenny started helping her mother in the office, there were 60 letters that needed to be stamped and another set of letters that had already been stamped (let's call it X). Since Jenny placed stamps on one-third of the letters that needed to be stamped, the number of letters she stamped is 2/3 \* 60 = 40 letters. So, the total number of letters in the original set was X + 40 = 100 letters.
Response:  Julia bought a new package of plastic spoons because she noticed that the old ones were broken and unusable. Later, her husband also bought a pack of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. So, in total, Julia had 3 + 5 = 8 spoons.
Response:  We know that Dylan needs both chicken and fish sticks to make sandwiches for the party. He bought 38 chicken sticks and 6 more than he bought of chicken sticks than fish sticks. So, if he bought x chicken sticks, then he also bought 6 + x fish sticks. Therefore, the total number of sticks Dylan bought is 38 + (6 + x) = 44.
Response:  After moving to a new school, Amy had 20 more friends than Lily. So, Lily has 50 - 20 = 30 friends. Therefore, Amy and Lily have 30 + 20 = 50 friends in common.
"Response: 
Danya costs $3 times more than pepper, so one danya costs $3 \* 3 = $9.
Portocale costs $5 times less than danya, so one portocale costs $5 \* (1/5) = $1.
So, Dylan will spend $9 for 4 danyas and $1 for 20 peppers, totaling $10."
"Response:  The hospital receives 500 patients per day and each patient is observed for an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent observing patients per day is:

Time = Number of patients x Observation time per patient
= 500 x 24
= 12,000 minutes

Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these visits:

Revenue = Number of patients x Price charged to patients + Price charged to doctors
= 500 x $150 + 500 x $200
= $37,500 + $10,000
= $47,500

Therefore, the profit made by the hospital from these visits is $47,500."
"Response: 
We know that 60 seasonal workers were hired to play elves in Niisa's universal store in Santa's village.
After one-third of the elves (20) refused to continue playing after being ridiculed by children, there are now 40 elves left.
Then, another 10 elves refuse to continue playing after their children are beaten up by the same group of kids.
So, there are now 30 elves left who are willing to continue playing as elves in Niisa's store."
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $440 ($500 - $60). So, his total expenses for these two months were $940 ($500 + $440).
"Response: 
Pam took the ferry twice, so she paid for 2 x 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred took the ferry four times, so he paid for 4 x 6 = 24 tickets.
In total, they paid for 12 + 24 = 36 tickets."
Response:  We know that in Monday Waldo ran 6 km. In Tuesday he ran 6 times more miles than in Monday, so he ran 6 x 6 = 36 km. Therefore, the total distance he covered from Monday to Wednesday is 41 + 36 = 77 km. So, he ran 77 km in Wednesday.
Response:  Tom has 4 cars per month, so he pays $15 x 4 = $60 for each month. Therefore, in one year (12 months), Tom will pay $60 x 12 = $720 for all his cars.
Response:  According to the problem statement, Brian has 5 fewer video games than Brain and Brain has 3 times more video games than Brian. So, if Brian has 20 video games, then Brain has 20 x 3 = 60 video games. Since Brain had 5 more than Brian before making the comparison, Brain now has 60 - 5 = 55 video games. Therefore, the number of video games that Brain has is 55.
Response:  We know that there are 27 remaining one-horned creatures in the world and that one-third of them are located in Scottish mountain regions. This means that there are 9 one-horned creatures in Scotland (3/4 x 27 = 9). Since two-thirds of the Scottish one-horned creatures are female, we can conclude that there are 6 female one-horned creatures in Scotland (2/3 x 9 = 6). Therefore, there are 6 female one-horned horses in Scotland.
Response:  The cost of two pillows is $2 x $7.50 = $15. So far, we have spent $15 + $1.50 (for each torte) = $16.50. Next, let's calculate the cost of the biscuits and chips. Two biscuits are $2 x $1.00 = $2.00, and two bags of chips are $2 x $1.50 = $3.00. Therefore, the total cost so far is $16.50 + $2.00 + $3.00 = $21.50. Finally, there is a $5.00 delivery fee, bringing the total to $21.50 + $5.00 = $26.50.
Response:  If Mark took 75 questions yesterday and finished with 5 per hour, he took 75/5 = 15 hours to finish the test. Now, if he took another test of 100 questions today and finished with 5 per hour, he took 100/5 = 20 hours to finish the second test. Since he had 8 hours to finish the first test and 6 hours to finish the second test, he left 8 - 6 = 2 hours of unfinished questions. So, there are 20 - 2 = 18 questions left unfinished by Mark.
Response:  If there are 4 times more red beans than blue beans, and there are 12 blue beans, then there must be 48 red beans (since 4 x 12 = 48). So, there are 48 red beans in the machine for bonnbons.
Response:  We know that from 20 cars, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, we have 6 cars left as semi-automatic (half of the remaining). Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 6/20 x 100 = 30%.
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees as queen bees. So, if there are x worker bees, then there are 2x queen bees. Therefore, we can write an equation: 700 = x + (2x) = 1400. Solving for x, we get x = 700 / 3 = 233 worker bees.
"Response:  Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day and earns $10 per hour at work. To calculate how much money he would make in a week if he spent all his time playing video games instead of working, we need to multiply the number of hours he spends gaming by the amount he earns per hour, like this:

Number of hours gaming = 2 hours/day x 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
Amount earned per hour = $10/hour
Total amount earned in a week = Number of hours gaming x Amount earned per hour = $10/hour x 14 hours/week = $140/week
Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 per week if he spent all his time playing video games instead of working."
"Response:  John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, bread rolls for $4, and cups for $3 each. So he spends a total of:
$2 + $3 + $4 + ($3 x 3) = $2 + $9 + $12 + $9 = $33
Therefore, everything costs $33 in total."
"Response: 
Lucas has already 3 clients and is in talks with 5 more potential ones. He estimates that each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and one package of cleaning supplies (which contains 5 cloths). The total cost of these items for each client is $10 ($2 x 2 = $4 for bleach + $5 x 5 = $25 for cleaning supplies). Since he wants to be conservative, let's assume that all his clients will actually place orders every week. Therefore, his total revenue per week will be:
$4 x 3 clients = $12
+ $25 x 5 potential clients = $125
Total revenue per week = $137
Now, we need to subtract Lucas's costs from his revenue:
Costs = Total revenue x Percentage of costs as percentage of revenue
= $137 x 0.6 (since he expects to cover 60% of his costs through his revenues)
= $80.20
So, Lucas's profit per week is:
Profit = Total revenue - Costs
= $137 - $80.20
= $56.80
Therefore, Luka's profit per week will be $56.80."
Response:  John has 10 hectares of land with 100 ananas per hectare. He can harvest his ananas every 3 months. So in one year, he will have 4 times as many harvests (since there are 4 seasons in a year). Therefore, John can collect 4 x 100 = 400 ananas in one year.
"Response: 
Joni has collected 500 pieces of Lego from the floor in his room. He has thrown away another set of 500 pieces that had three times as many pieces as the one he collected. And he has also thrown away a set with 1/4 of the total number of pieces. So, let's calculate how much Lego Joni has left to collect:

Total number of pieces = 500 + (3 x 500) + (1/4 x Total number of pieces)
= 500 + 1500 + 250
= 2250

So, Joni still needs to collect 2250 pieces of Lego to have all the pieces he wants."
"Response: 

At first, Debra sees 30 bees leaving the hive during the first 6 hours. This means that there are 30 bees that have left the hive and haven't returned yet.

Then, she sees half of these bees (15 bees) return to the hive within the next 6 hours. So, now there are 15 bees that have returned to the hive.

After that, she sees twice as many bees leave the hive as she initially saw enter it (i.e., 2 x 30 = 60 bees). However, since some of these bees may have already returned, let's assume that only 40 bees have left the hive but haven't returned yet.

Finally, each of the bees that has left the hive and hasn't returned yet comes back in the following 6 hours. Therefore, the total number of bees that come back to the hive is equal to the initial number of bees that entered the hive minus the number of bees that have returned earlier (i.e., 30 - 15 = 15 bees).

So, the final answer is 15 bees that have returned to the hive during the last 6 hours."
Response:  The cost of admission for adults is $12 and for children is $10. Since Britney and her mother went to the museum together, they paid $22 (12 + 10) as their total admission fee. Now, let's see how much money Maya gave to the cashier in exchange for the two tickets. According to the problem statement, Maya gave the cashier $8. So, we can deduce that Maya paid $8 - $2 = $6 for one adult ticket and $8 - $2 = $6 for one child ticket. Therefore, the amount of money Maya gave to the cashier is $6.
Response:  According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, then Charlie has 3x friends. James also has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy does, so he has 4x friends. We are given that Charlies has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can set up the equation: 3x = 12. Solving for x, we get x = 4. Therefore, James has 4x = 16 friends on Facebook.
Response:  STEVE lives 3 miles away from school and can drive a car with an acceleration of 440 feet per minute. TIM lives 2 miles away from school and can skateboard at an acceleration of 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for Steve to reach home after the race, we need to calculate the time it takes him to cover the remaining distance. We know that Steve has covered 3 miles in 1 mile = 5,280 feet, so he has covered a total distance of 3 x 5,280 = 15,840 feet. Now, let's assume that Steve reaches his top speed immediately after the race ends (i.e., there is no delay between the end of the race and when he starts accelerating). In this case, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Acceleration. Plugging in the values we get: Time = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 35,790 seconds or approximately 59 minutes and 40 seconds. So, Tim will have to wait for about 59 minutes and 40 seconds before Steve arrives at home.
"Response: 
1. In the first day, 5 people came to inflate their tires and each tire cost $0.25 for inflation. So, total amount spent in the first day = 5 x $0.25 = $1.25.
2. Next, 3 people came to inflate their tricycle tires, which also cost $0.25 per tire. Total amount spent in the second day = 3 x $0.25 = $0.75.
3. Finally, one person came with a unicycle and did not need to pay anything as they only had one tire to inflate. Therefore, total amount earned that day = $1.25 + $0.75 - $0.25 = $2.75."
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of biscuits, each package contains six biscuits, and each biscuit costs $0.10. Therefore, the total cost of one package is $6 (6 x $0.10). Since Carl pays $10 for all ten packages, he will receive $4 in change ($10 - $6 x 10 = $4).
"Response: 
1. Dave bought a large package of potatoes and ate 15 before a hungry seagull stole the package from his hand.
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining potatoes, which were then eaten by three crows.
3. Each crow ate three potatoes, leaving five potatoes in total.
Therefore, when Dave bought the package of potatoes, there were 5 potatoes left in the package."
"Response: 
Monday to Friday, KiMo has 3 hours of classes per day. So, in one week (7 days), he has:
3 hours/day x 7 days = 21 hours/week
In one semester (16 weeks), he has:
21 hours/week x 16 weeks = 320 hours/semester
Therefore, KiMo spends 320 hours in class attendance per semester."
"Response: 

Firstly, we need to find out how many rolls, kroasans and baguettes Bill has in total. We know that he has 300 rolls, each of which is 4 inches long, so there are 300 x 4 = 1200 inches in total. Similarly, for kroasans, we have 120 x 6 = 720 inches, and for baguettes, we have 60 x 2 = 120 inches. Therefore, the total length of all the food items is:

1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches

Now, let's calculate the time it would take for Bill to eat all these food items if he eats one roll every day, one kroasa every two days, and one baguette every three days. The number of days it takes him to finish all the food can be calculated as follows:

Days required to eat 300 rolls = 300 / 4 = 75 days
Days required to eat 120 kroasans = 120 / 6 = 20 days
Days required to eat 60 baguettes = 60 / 2 = 30 days

Therefore, Bill will take approximately 75 + 20 + 30 = 125 days to finish all the food items."
"Response:  The zookeeper feeds all monkeys in the zoo bananas every two months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas per month, gorillas need 400 bananas per month, and penguins need 100 bananas per month, how many bananas should the zookeeper order to last for two months?

To find out, we can use the following formula: Total number of bananas needed = (Number of monkeys x Number of bananas per month) + (Number of gorillas x Number of bananas per month) + (Number of penguins x Number of bananas per month)

Plugging in the numbers given in the problem, we get:
Total number of bananas needed = (200 x 2) + (400 x 2) + (100 x 2) = 800 + 800 + 200 = 1,200 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper should order 1,200 bananas to last for two months."
"Response: 
Blake moves forward and backward 15 times along the football field, which is 100 yards long. Therefore, his total distance traveled is:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 100 yd / 15 min
= 6.67 mi (or 10.7 km)

Kelly moves once from one end of the field to the other, which is 40 yards away. Then she turns around and runs back to the starting point, for a total distance of:

Distance = Distance moved + Distance turned around
= 40 yd + (-40 yd)
= 0 mi (or 0 km)

Since Blake has covered more distance than Kelly, he is the winner. The difference in their distances is:

Distance between them = Blake's distance - Kelly's distance
= 6.67 mi - 0 mi
= 6.67 mi (or 10.7 km)

Therefore, the winner, Blake, has run a distance of approximately 6.67 miles or 10.7 kilometers more than Kelly."
Response:  Rafael bought 4 chemistry sets that cost $1.5 each, so he spent $6 for those. He also bought 2 notebooks that cost $4 each, so he spent $8 for those. Finally, he bought one sheet of paper for an obligation bond that cost $20. Therefore, Rafael spent a total of $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  We know that FIN sees 11 ducks swimming in the lake. Then he sees six of them leave their hiding place under a lily pad and disappear from sight. After that, he sees two more ducks hide under a rock. So, we can conclude that FIN saw a total of eight ducks (6 + 2 = 8) in the lake.
Response:  On Monday (d = 5 m)...
Response:  Anakin has caught 10 sea stars, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Loxin has caught 5 fewer sea stars than Ana kin, 3 fewer sea horses than Ana kin, and 2 more clown fish than Ana kin. So, L oxin has caught 7 sea stars, 4 sea horses, and 1 clown fish. Therefore, the total number of sea creatures that both Ana kin and Lox in have caught is 10 + 7 = 17.
Response:  The initial price of the torba with tops is $20. After two months, the price will be $24 (120% of $20). Then after another two months, the price will be $28.80 ($24 x 120%). So, after three years and six months, the price of the torba with tops will be $35.92 ($28.80 x 120%). Therefore, after 36 months, the torba with tops will cost $35.92.
Response:  We know that one dollar is equal to 100 cents. So, if one red car costs $4, then it costs 400 cents ($4 / $1). Similarly, we can calculate the cost of each figure as follows: One figure costs $5, so it costs 500 cents ($5 / $1). Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items in the room: • Red cars: 5 x 400 = $2000 • Figures: 3 x 500 = $1500 Total cost = $2000 + $1500 = $3500 Therefore, all the toys together cost $3500.
Response:  If Jackie works as a freelancer for 4 hours per day and her hourly rate is $60, then she earns $240 per day ($60 x 4 hours). If she pays taxes at a rate of 35%, then she will lose $84 in taxes per day ($240 x 35%). So, if she works three days per week (Monday to Wednesday), she will lose $252 in taxes over those three days ($84 x 3 days). Now, let's calculate how much money Jackie can save by hiring an accountant. Suppose the accountant charges $90 per hour. If Jackie works three hours less per week due to hiring an accountant, she will save $178 in taxes ($90 x 3 hours). Therefore, by hiring an accountant, Jackie can save $178 - $252 = $74 per week in taxes.
Response:  Elvira has a budget of €1500 given to her by her family for buying a new computer and accessories. She spent €1090 on the computer itself (€1090 / €1500 = 0.76), leaving €410 remaining. Then she bought an external hard drive for €89 (€410 - €89 = €321). So, Elvira will have €321 left over for clothes after buying all the items mentioned in the question.
"Response:  If Sandra gets 9 eggs every time she looks at her daughter and needs 3 eggs to make an Spanish omelette, then...

Step 1: How many times does Sandra look at her daughter in total?
Total number of times = Number of eggs received / Number of eggs needed per glance = 9 eggs / 3 eggs = 3 times

So, Sandra looks at her daughter 3 times in total.

Step 2: How many times does Sandra need to make an Spanish omelette for the school gathering?
Total number of Spanish omelettes needed = Total number of glances x Number of eggs needed per omelette = 3 times x 3 eggs/omelette = 9 omelettes

Therefore, Sandra needs to make 9 Spanish omelettes for the school gathering."
Response:  According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke and after two years their combined age will be 28. So, if Seth is twice as old as Brooke, then he must be 4 times older than her. Therefore, Seth is 4 x 2 = 8 years older than Brooke. So, Seth is 8 years old.
Response:  We know that Dijim has $2 more than Ether. So, if Ether has $8, then Dijim must have $10 (i.e., $8 + $2).
"Response:  Pancho walks for 30 km per day, except on weekends when he goes for 10 miles (which is approximately 16 km). So, in one week, he walks a total distance of:

30 km/day x 7 days = 210 km

Therefore, Pancho walks a total distance of 210 km in one week."
"Response:  The cost of each item is given as follows:
* Shapka (hat) - $25
* Jacket - three times the cost of the hat = $75
* Pants - average cost of shapka and jacket = $50
Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is: $25 + $75 + $50 = $140
So, each uniform costs $140."
"Response: 
Jake sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so he sees 640 legs (8 x 8 = 64).
He also sees 90 insects with 6 legs each, so he sees 540 legs (9 x 6 = 54).
Finally, he sees 3 rare mutiliated creatures without any legs, so he doesn't see any legs for them.
Therefore, Jake sees a total of 640 + 540 + 0 = 1180 legs."
Response:  We know that Sal 1 is 3 years older than Babka Red, and Babka Red is twice as old as Sal 1. So, if Sal 1 is 3 years older than Babka Red, then Babka Red is half as old as Sal 1. Therefore, Sal 1 is 6 years old (half of 12). Now we need to find out how old are Sal 2, Sal 30, and Sal 30 + 8 = Sal 38. According to the problem, Sal 2 is 3 years younger than Sal 1, so Sal 2 is 3 - 3 = 0 years old. Sal 30 is also 3 years younger than Sal 1, so Sal 30 is 3 - 3 = 0 years old too. And Sal 38 is 8 years old plus 3 years = 11 years old. So, the total age of all four pigeons is 6 + 0 + 0 + 11 = 17 years old.
Response:  The minimum monthly expenses for Jessica are $300 + $200 = $500 per month. If she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, her monthly payment will be $500 x 1.5 = $750 per month. So, over a year, she will pay $750 x 12 = $90,000.
"Response: 

1. Time taken to peel and chop one carrot = 1 minute and 30 seconds (as per the question)
2. Number of carrots = 60 (as per the question)
3. Total time taken to peel and chop all the carrots = x (where x is the total time taken for peeling and chopping one carrot multiplied by the number of carrots)
4. Total time taken to prepare the salad = time taken to peel and chop all the carrots + time taken to prepare other ingredients in the salad (assuming there are no other ingredients that take significantly longer than peeling and chopping carrots)

Now, let's calculate the value of x:
x = 1 minute and 30 seconds/carrot × 60 carrots = 9 minutes and 20 seconds

Therefore, it will take Biri approximately 9 minutes and 20 seconds to prepare the carrot salad."
"Response:  Juan and Carlos sell a total of 25 dollars in profit. Since they charge $0.50 for each cup and receive 20 cups per gallon, their total revenue is:

Revenue = Number of cups x Price per cup
= 20 x $0.50
= $10

Since they spend $3 for every gallon on lemons and $2 for every gallon on sugar, their cost is:

Cost = Number of gallons x Cost per gallon
= Total revenue / (Number of cups per gallon x Price per cup)
= $10 / (20 x $0.50)
= $6

Therefore, Juan and Carlos have spent $6 on lemons."
"Response:  We know that there are 240 participants in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Asian participants is 240 - 80 = 160. Now, we know that 60 of these participants are male (since they are called ""момчетата"" which means ""boys""). Therefore, the number of female participants is 160 - 60 = 100. Since all remaining participants are Chinese, the number of Chinese participants is also 100."
"Response: 
Firstly, we know that Заид gives $ 1/4 of his salary for rent, which is $ 1500 / 4 = $ 375 per month.
Secondly, he spends $ 1/3 of his salary on gasoline for his car, which is $ 6000 / 3 = $ 2000 per month.
Thirdly, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity organization, which is $ 6000 - ($ 375 + $ 2000) = $ 4825 per month.
Fourthly, he gives $ 200 to his daughter and $ 700 to his wife for expenses such as food, clothing, etc., so their total monthly expenditure is $ 900 ($ 200 + $ 700).
Therefore, after all these expenses, Заид will have $ 6000 - ($ 375 + $ 2000 + $ 900) = $ 4025 left over each month."
"Response:  We know that:
Rani has 10 more rais than Monica, which means Rani has x = 10 + 4 = 14 rais.
Monica has 4 fewer rais than Bo, which means Monica has x = 4 - 40 = -36 rais.
So, together they have:
x + x + x = 14 + (-36) = 50 rais."
"Response:  Lloyd earns $10 per hour and teaches for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. So, his total earnings are:
First week: 5 hours x $10/hour = $50
Second week: 8 hours x $10/hour = $80
Therefore, Lloyd has earned a total of $130 ($50 + $80) for the first two weeks."
Response:  The total number of voters in the class is 80. If one candidate received 3/4 of the votes, then the number of votes they received is 80 x 3/4 = 60. So, the number of votes received by the losing candidate is 80 - 60 = 20.
Response:  We know that Sander has ordered four times more red roses than white lilies and that she has also ordered 200 rose-colored lilies which are five times more than the number of white lilies. To satisfy Sandra, Frod must deliver 4 x 20 = 80 red roses and 200 / 5 = 40 rose-colored lilies before 5 pm. Therefore, Frod needs to deliver 80 + 40 = 120 flowers in total before 5 pm.
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:

* Jean is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is x years old, then Jean is x + 2 years old.
* Three years ago, Mark was 5 years older than Jane. So, if Jane is y years old now, then she was y - 5 years old three years ago.
* Before two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than Jane. So, if Jane is z years old now, then she was z - 5 years old before two years ago.

Now we have three equations:

x + 2 = y (Mark's age)
y - 5 = z - 5 (Jane's age before two years ago)
z - 5 = x - 5 (Jane's age three years ago)

Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:

x = 30 (Jean's age)
y = 27 (Mark's age)
z = 23 (Jane's age)

Therefore, the answer is:

Jean is 30 years old, Mark is 27 years old, and Jane is 23 years old."
"Response:  The first team has four members who can run 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds each. Therefore, their total time for one round is:

Time = (Number of members) x (Time per member) = 4 x 55 = 220 seconds

Now, let's consider the second team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds to complete the 400 meters, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, we can calculate their total time as follows:

Time = (Number of members) x (Time per member) = 4 x (60 + 3(3)) = 4 x 63 = 252 seconds

Therefore, the faster team will finish the race in 220 seconds, while the slower team will take 252 seconds to complete it."
Response:  The probability of throwing an even number is $\frac{1}{2}$. So, the probability of throwing a number greater than $3$ is also $\frac{1}{2}$ since there are two possible outcomes for this event: either the next number thrown is odd or it is even and greater than $3$. Therefore, the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers that are both odd is $\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability of throwing any other sequence of numbers is $\frac{1}{2}$.
Response:  Jenna and her mother together collected half of their apple harvest, which means they collected 1/2 x total number of apples = 15 apples (since they have 30 apples in total). So, if Jenna's mother received 20 apples, then Jenna must have received 15 - 20 = 5 apples.
Response:  We know that Russell works in a pet store and gives treats to small rodents (mice) and hamsters. There are 3 cages for mice and each cage has 6 pieces of cheese per mouse. There are also 10 cages for hamsters, and each cage has 5 pieces of cheese per hamster. Additionally, there is a section for rabbits where 20 pieces of cheese are distributed among the rabbits. Since nowhere else in the store does slamka get used, we can conclude that all these animals are receiving their treats equally. Therefore, if 160 pieces of cheese are distributed between the small rodents, then the number of mice in each cage is equal to the number of hamsters in each cage divided by 6, plus the number of rabbits multiplied by 20/10 = 4. So, there are 4 mice in each cage, and 4 hamsters in each cage as well.
"Response:  If Mandy owes Benedic $100 and they agree to have a monthly interest of 2%, then after 3 months, the amount that Mandy needs to pay to Benedic will be:

$100 x (1 + 0.02) ^ 3 = $104

So, Mandy needs to give Benedic $104 after 3 months."
"Response:  The trader buys several bushels of wheat from the farmer for $20 per bushel. If transporting each bushel from the farm to the warehouse costs $2, then...

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of transportation for all bushels bought from the farmer.
Total cost of transportation = Number of bushels x Transportation cost per bushel
= 5 bushels x $2 per bushel
= $10

Step 2: Calculate the profit made by the trader after selling all the bushels at $30 per bushel.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= 5 bushels x $30 per bushel
= $150

So, the trader has sold 5 bushels of wheat."
Response:  The total cost of the tickets is $66 ($20.25 x 3). Since they spent less than $4.50 on food, let's say they spent exactly $4.50 on food. So, the remaining amount they spent together is $61.75 ($66 - $4.50). Now, since there were 2 different trips, each trip cost $33. Therefore, each person will pay $33 / 3 = $11 per trip.
Response:  If John can collect 2 prickly bushes in one minute, then he will be able to collect 60 prickly bushes (2 x 30) in 3 hours. Therefore, John will have collected 180 prickly bushes (60 x 3).
"Response:  If Patata needs to eat one kilogram of insects every seven days to survive, and there are ten patties in the stado, then we need to calculate how much each patty needs to eat per day.

So, if Patata needs 1 kg / 7 days = 0.143 kg of insects per day, and there are ten patties in the stado, then each patty needs to eat 0.143 kg / 10 patties = 0.0143 kg of insects per day."
Response:  Tom planted 10 trees per year and cut down 2 trees per year. So after 10 years, he has 10 x 10 = 100 trees. Now, 30% of the trees die every year, so in 10 years, 30/100 = 30 trees will have died. Therefore, Tom still has 100 - 30 = 70 trees left.
Response:  On Friday morning, Sues neighbors set up 18 plastic flamingos in her yard. Then, on Saturday morning, they took one-third of Sues flock (which we can assume is 6 flamingos) and painted them white. They then placed these newly painted flamingos back in Sues yard. Finally, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 plastic flamingos to the mix. So, at noon on Sunday, there would be 30 rosy plastic flamingos outside Sues house (6 original + 18 new ones), plus however many white plastic flamingos were originally in Sues yard. Therefore, the answer is 30.
"Response:  Violina wants to buy new pencils and she has $20 for that purpose. Each pencil costs $2. So, if she buys 5 different colored pencils, she will spend:

$2 x 5 = $10

So, the change will be:

$20 - $10 = $10"
"Response:  One pencil costs $1.20 and one eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, eight pencils will cost:
8 x $1.20 = $9.60
So, eight pencils will cost $9.60."
"Response:  We have to distribute 200 pounds of cabbage among 40 restaurants in a certain city. Each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of cabbage. To find out how many kilograms of cabbage are needed, we can divide the total weight (200 pounds) by the number of restaurants (40):

200 pounds / 40 restaurants = 5 kilograms (or 11 pounds) of cabbage per restaurant
Therefore, in total, 40 x 5 kg = 200 kilograms (or 440 pounds) of cabbage will be used."

"Response: 
At first, Ilyne had 20 cards with Pokémon. Then she gathered three times more cards in the second month, so she had 60 cards in total (20 x 3 = 60). In the third month, she gathered twice as many cards as in the previous two months combined, which means she gathered 40 additional cards (60 + 20 = 80). Therefore, Ilyne currently has 140 cards with Pokémon (60 + 40 = 100)."
"Response: 
Marc edits an equal number of sentences every week for two different publishers who pay him different prices per sentence. Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. Marc edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. If Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence, then Publisher B pays $0.10 per sentence. How much does Marc earn per week in cents?"
"Response:  Balder takes water from the well every day and gets 5 cups of water in the morning and 6 cups of water in the evening. Since each cup contains 5 liters of water, we can calculate how much water Balder receives daily as follows:
Morning: 5 cups x 5 liters/cup = 25 liters
Evening: 6 cups x 5 liters/cup = 30 liters
Therefore, Balder receives a total of 55 liters of water per day (25 + 30)."
"Response:  If John wins $5000 as an award and gets a 5% raise, his new salary will be $1000 more than before. So, if he earns $2000 per week, his annual income will be:

$2000 x 52 = $104,000 (before the award)
+ $5000 = $109,000 (after the award)

So, during the year, John has earned a total of $109,000."
Response:  If Josy grows grapes on his farm and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then the total number of tons of grapes produced by all acres is 5 x Number of acres = X. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, we can calculate the total number of barrels of wine produced as follows: X \* 2/ton = Y. Therefore, the famer produces Y barrels of wine per year.
"Response: 
Carl eats sandwiches every day for lunch and uses 2 pieces of cheese for each sandwich. He also eats eggs for breakfast 3 days a week, using more than one piece of cheese for an omelette than for a sandwich. Carl made a large dish with macaroni and cheese that can feed him for several meals during the week and used 8 pieces of cheese in it. Therefore, he uses a total of 10 pieces of cheese (2 x 3 + 8) per week."
"Response:  We know that Janet had initially 22 green and 10 yellow chemistry sets. Then she bought 6 blue and 2 red chemistry sets. Since each set contains 9 green and 6 red chemistry sets, we can conclude that Janet now has:

Green: (22 x 9) + (6 x 9) = 184 green chemistry sets
Red: (10 x 6) + (2 x 6) = 72 red chemistry sets
Total number of chemistry sets: 184 + 72 = 256 chemistry sets
Therefore, Janet currently has 256 chemistry sets."
Response:  If Brinly has results of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 from the first five tests, then his average score is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 845 / 5 = 169. So, if he scores 93 on the sixth test, his new average score will be (169 + 93) / 6 = 262 / 6 = 43.33. Therefore, Brinly needs to score at least 43 on the sixth test to have an overall average score of 93.
"Response: 
Michael loves to ride a bike. He rode for 5 times a week and covered 25 kilometers each time for 4 weeks. Then he reduced his rides to twice a week but increased the distance to 60 kilometers each time for 3 weeks. So, in total, Michael cycled:
Week 1-4: 5 x 25 km = 125 km
Week 5-8: 2 x 60 km = 120 km
Total distance cycled by Michael = 125 + 120 = 245 km"
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate sticks and 80 confiscated apples in total. Each chocolate stick weighs twice as much as an apple, so...
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 tarts. On Tuesday, she bought 3 times more tarts than on Monday, so she bought 12 tarts (3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she bought 5 times more tarts than on Tuesday, so she bought 60 tarts (5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, in total, Rose bought 72 tarts (4 + 12 + 60 = 72).
"Response:  We know that two dozen cups cost less than $1200 and that each cup costs half of the price of a full dozen (i.e., $\frac{1}{2}$ of $6000$). Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

$2 \times x = 1200$...(1)

where $x$ is the cost of one cup. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get:

$\frac{1}{2} \times x = 3000$...(2)

Now, we need to solve for $x$. To do so, we can add equations (1) and (2):

$2x + \frac{1}{2}x = 4200$...(3)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$3x = 4200$...(4)

Dividing both sides of the equation by $3$, we obtain the final solution:

$x = 1400$

Therefore, the total cost of buying $24$ cups is $2 \times 1400 = 2800$."
"Response: 
Firstly, Sarah earns $5 x 4 = $20 from watching her neighbors' children four times.
Secondly, she spends $30 for the new jacket and $20 for each pair of shoes, totaling $80 spent.
Lastly, if Sarah has saved $10 before starting to watch the children, then she will have $10 - $80 =-$70 left after buying the items. Therefore, Sarah needs to cut the grass (coś treva) $70 / $4 = 17.5 times to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
Response:  If there are x red birds and y white birds, then each day they produce 3x + 5y eggs. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation: 3x + 5y = 42. Now, if there are two more white birds than red birds, that means there are (2) extra white birds, so the number of white birds is now y+2. Substituting this into our equation gives us: 3x + (y+2) = 42. Simplifying and solving for x, we get: x = 16. So, there are 16 red birds.
"Response:  We know that Gary likes to walk along the edge of the local park, which is a right triangle with sides of length 1.5 miles and 6 miles. If he walks at a speed of 5 km/h (which is approximately 3.1 mph), we can calculate how long it takes him to cover the distance around the park.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to kilometers:

Side length = 1.5 miles x 1.60934 km/mi = 2.4187 km
Side length = 6 miles x 1.60934 km/mi = 9.6576 km

Now, we can use the formula for time taken to travel a distance at a constant speed:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:

Time = 2.4187 km / 5 km/h = 0.4835 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 0.4835 hours or 28 minutes walking around the local park."
Response:  On day 1, Sloane counted 100 customers entering the store. On day 2, she counted 50 more customers than on the first day, so she counted 150 customers (100 + 50). Therefore, on day 3, she will count 300 customers (150 + 150).
Response:  At first, both basins had 8 gallons per minute (gpm). After 4 minutes, the big basin gained twice as much water as the small basin, so the big basin now has 16 gpm and the small basin has 4 gpm. Since then, the big basin has quadrupled its original amount of water, so it now has 64 gpm. Therefore, there are currently 60 gpm in the small basin (since it started with 4 gpm).
"Response: 
Firstly, we need to calculate how much Loris needs to work in order to save enough money for the shoes and the jacket. We know that she earns $8 per hour and wants to buy the shoes for $320 and the jacket for $32. So, her total cost is $352. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we can divide her total cost by her hourly wage:
$352 / $8 = 44 hours
So, Loris needs to work for 44 hours before she can afford to buy the shoes and the jacket."
"Response: 
Jane took $2000 and promised to return with an additional 10% of the amount. Therefore, Jane will have to pay back $2200 (2000 + 10% of 2000). If she pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance at that point would be:
$2200 - ($165 x 12) = $2200 - $2048 = $152
So, the remaining balance of Jane after 12 months is $152."
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more daisies than roses. So, if there are x daisies, then there are 4 + x flowers in total. Since there are 7 more daisies than roses, we can write: x = 4 + (7 - 4) = 11. Therefore, there are 11 flowers in the vase.
"Response:  Adrian is three times older than Harry, and Harry is half as old as Zack. After three years, their ages will be: Adrian - 3 x 3 = 9 years older than Harry; Harry - 1/2 x 3 = 1.5 years older than Zack. So, the average age of the three after three years is: (9 + 1.5) / 3 = 6.5 years."
Response:  We know that four students have together scored 251 points in one game. Naomi has scored 68 points. Yuri has scored 10 more than Naomi, so Yuri has scored 78 points. Brian has scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brian has scored 95 points. Therefore, Joe Joe has scored 246 - 68 = 178 points.
"Response:  Carmen has spent 10 minutes solving crosswords and 5 minutes solving Sudoku during the weekend. She solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles. Therefore, she spent a total of:

Time spent on crosswords = 10 minutes / 3 crosswords = 3.33 minutes per crossword
Time spent on Sudoku = 5 minutes / 8 Sudoku = 0.625 minutes per Sudoku
Total time spent playing games = 3.33 + 0.625 = 4 minutes
Therefore, Carmen spent approximately 4 minutes playing crosswords and Sudoku during the weekend."
"Response:  We know that Selina used 90 liters of water from the tank to irrigate her small garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:

Remaining water = Total water - Used water
= 120 liters - 90 liters
= 30 liters

Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank."
Response:  Andy has planted 90 geraniums and 40 petunias. If we assume that each geranium requires approximately 1 square meter of space (as they are relatively large plants), then Andy has planted 90 x 1 = 90 square meters of geraniums. Similarly, if each petunia requires approximately 0.25 square meters of space (as they are smaller than geraniums), then Andy has planted 40 x 0.25 = 10 square meters of petunias. Therefore, Andy has planted a total area of 90 + 10 = 100 square meters of flowers.
Response:  The company spent $15,000 for advertising in year 1 and then spent one-third of that amount ($5,000) in year 2. So, the total amount spent on advertising over these two years is: $15,000 + ($5,000 / 3) = $20,000.
"Response: 
Carlos pays $30 per hour for the canoe, and Benji pays $18 per hour for the kayak.
If Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours, he will pay $30 x 3 = $90.
If Benji uses the kayak for 5 hours, he will pay $18 x 5 = $90 as well.
So, both of them will pay the same amount, which is $90."
"Response: 
From New Jersey to Rochester, it takes 6 days to travel by bus and half of that time (3 days) to travel by car. So, if he goes from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and returns from Rochester by car, he will take 9 days in total (6 + 3)."
Response:  We have 40 water cards out of total 100 cards. If we lose 8 water cards, then we are left with 40 - 8 = 32 water cards. Now, if we buy 14 more water cards, then we have 32 + 14 = 46 water cards. So, the probability that the randomly chosen card will be from the water type is 46/100 or approximately 0.46.
Response:  Firstly, Chad orders the basic burrito for $6.50. Then he adds additional meat (2 dollars), cheese (1 dollar), avocado (1 dollar), and salsa (0.25 dollars) to his order, making the total cost of his meal so far $9.75. Since Chad wants to improve his food quality, he spends an extra $3 on chips and drinks, bringing the new total cost to $12.75. Finally, with the gift card discount of $5, Chad pays a total of $7.75 for his meal.
"Response: 

1. Calinda can add 4 pieces in one minute, so she will need (360/4) = 90 minutes to complete half of the puzzle alone.
2. Since her mother can place half of the remaining pieces in one minute as well, it will take her another (90/2) = 45 minutes to finish the rest of the puzzle.

Therefore, it will take them a total of 90 + 45 = 135 minutes to complete the puzzle."
"Response: 
After two months, 30% of the strawberries are ready to be picked, so Ashley took 120 / (1 - 0.3) = 80 strawberries home.
When she returns two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining strawberries are ready to be picked, so she picks 75 / 4 = 18 strawberries.
Therefore, there were 18 + 80 = 98 strawberries not yet ready for harvest after two weeks."
"Response:  The total number of cars Mark buys is 12. Each car costs $20,000, so the total cost of all the cars is:

$20,000 x 12 = $240,000

Mark pays 10% tax on each car, which means he pays:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000 in taxes

In addition to the taxes, Mark also pays $1,000 for registration fees for each car, which comes out to be:

$240,000 x 12 = $28,000 in registration fees

So, the total amount that Mark pays is:

$24,000 + $28,000 = $52,000"
Response:  On Monday (inne), Kaili collected 5 more shells than Robert, who collected 20. So, Kaili collected 25 shells (5 + 20). In Tuesday (tue), Kaili collected twice as many shells as she did in Monday. So, Kaili collected 49 shells (2 x 25 = 50). Therefore, Kaili collected 49 shells in Tuesday.
Response:  Dax will collect apples in the orchard and find half of the number of bugs in the garden. If there are 50 ants, the total number of insects in the garden is...
"Response: 
There are 36 penguins in total.

* Another one-third of them (12 penguins) enter the cave to eat dinner.
So, there are 12 penguins left outside to bask in the sun."
"Response:  Steve decides to eat more tomatoes and starts growing his own tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his friend. He eats 6 tomatoes per day. If one loaf of tomatoes can produce 3 tomatoes per week, how many loaves does he need?

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Steve eats twice as much as his friend, so he eats 2 x 6 = 12 tomatoes per day.
2. Since he wants to eat 6 tomatoes per day, he needs 12 / 6 = 2 loaves of tomatoes per day.
3. To find out how many loaves he needs in a week, we multiply the number of loaves per day by 7 (the number of days in a week): 2 loaves/day × 7 days/week = 14 loaves/week.

Therefore, Steve needs 14 loaves of tomatoes per week to satisfy his daily demand."
"Response:  John wants to share the pizza with his 20 friends, and each friend will get 4 slices of pizza. Since there are only 8 portions of pizza available, we need to divide 20 by 8 to find out how many portions John needs to order:

20 / 8 = 2.5
So John needs to order at least 3 portions of pizza (since you can't order a fraction of a portion). Therefore, John needs to order at least 3 x 8 = 24 pieces of pizza."
Response:  If Ram uses 5 empty chemical bottles to make one full chemical bottle, then he will have 5/1 = 5 full chemical bottles after mixing the waste material from 5 empty bottles. Now, if he buys 25 full chemical bottles and uses them all up, he will have 25 - 5 = 20 new chemical bottles left over when his waste material runs out. Therefore, there will be 20 new chemical bottles left over.
Response:  Johnny took $20 and added another $10, so he had $30 in total. Then, he invested that amount which tripled to $90 after one year. Therefore, John has $90 after one year.
"Response:  According to the problem statement:
Meri is two years younger than Joan, who is five years older than Jessica. So, we can write an equation based on this information as follows:
Age of Meri = Age of Joan - 2
Age of Joan = Age of Jessica + 5
Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:
Age of Meri = 18 (since she is two years younger than Joan)
Age of Joan = 23 (since she is five years older than Jessica)
So, we have two equations and three variables. Solving them simultaneously gives us the following solution:
Age of Jessica = 20
Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 61 (20 + 23 + 18)."
Response:  We know that there are 1000 students in the hall and they have left through one of three exits A, B or C. If 30% of them left through exit A, then the number of students who left through exit A is 300 (1000 x 0.3). Now, we need to find out how many students left through each of the other two exits. Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, the number of students who left through exit B is 600 (1000 x 3/5). Finally, the number of students who left through exit C is 400 (1000 - 300 - 600). Therefore, the total number of students who left through exit C is 400.
Response:  We know that James has more than Robert because he has 6 bonnies more than Robert. So, if John has twice as many bonbons as Robert, then John must have at least 12 more bonnies than Robert. Therefore, John has 54 + 12 = 66 bonnies more than James.
Response:  If DoLi has two books and PandoRa has one book, then together they will have 3 books to read (2 + 1 = 3). Since they are reading each other's books as well, the total number of books they will read is equal to the sum of their individual collections plus the number of times they exchange books. Therefore, the final answer is: 3 + 3 = 6 books.
Response:  Mike sends an email to two people every week, and each email is 5 pages long. Since he can write one page in 6 minutes, he spends 6 minutes writing each email. Therefore, he spends 12 minutes per week writing emails (2 emails/week x 6 minutes/email). So, Mike spends approximately 72 minutes per month writing emails (12 minutes/week x 4 weeks/month).
"Response: 
Jason has a monthly plan of 1000 minutes.
He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss every day, so in one month he talks for 15 x 30 = 450 minutes with his boss.
Additionally, he spent 300 minutes talking to other people this month, so the total time he talked is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.
Since there are 30 days in the month, Jason used up all 1000 minutes of his plan in 750 / 30 = 25 days.
So, Jason has 750 - 25 = 725 minutes left at the end of the month."
"Response: 
Gryffindor had 24 potatoes and Kyle took 5 of them. This means that Kyle took twice as many potatoes as Gryffindor had initially.
Then, Dagger gave Gryffindor half of her remaining potatoes (which were 16), so Gryffindor got 8 more potatoes from Dagger.
Finally, Colby took 3 fewer potatoes than the number taken by Kyle, which was 5. So, Colby took 2 potatoes.
Therefore, in the end, Gryffindor had 27 potatoes.
So, Dagger gave Gryffindor 8 + 2 = 10 potatoes."
Response:  In one aquarium there are 4 octopuses and in another aquarium there are 32 fish. The difference between the number of octopuses in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. If both aquariums have an equal number of fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium?  Solution: Let X be the number of fish in the first aquarium and Y be the number of fish in the second aquarium. Since the difference between the number of octopuses in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium, we can write: 4 = 2(X + Y). Subtracting X from both sides gives us: 2Y = 8. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: Y = 4. Therefore, there are 4 fish in the second aquarium. Now, we know that the number of fish in the first aquarium is X, so we can find it by subtracting Y from X: X = X - Y = 4 - 4 = 0. Thus, there are no fish in the first aquarium.
"Response: 
Gripmorcat takes $250 per hour and works for 6 hours every day for 5 weeks to make the film. Therefore, she earns:
$250 x 6 h/d x 5 w = $90,000
Now, let's calculate how much Dijen pays her after deducting 10% as commission:
$90,000 x (1 - 0.10) = $81,000
So, Dijen pays Gripmorcat $81,000."
Response:  Isabel spent $12 for ingredients of the cake, $43 for gifts for her little sister's birthday, $15 for decorations, $4 for invitations, and $22 for party favors for guests. Since she shared the expenses with her parents, each of them paid $\frac{Total cost}{3} = \frac{12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22}{3} = 26$ dollars. Therefore, Isabel's mother paid $26$, and her father paid $26$.
Response:  The total weight of four barrels of cabbage is 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Since each kilogram of cabbage costs $1.50, the total cost of all four barrels would be 4 x $1.50 = $6. So, the grocery store owner spent $6 to buy 4 barrels of cabbage.
Response:  On Monday, Sues eats 4 times more biscuits than her sister, so she eats 4 x 8 = 32 biscuits. In Tuesday, she eats twice as many biscuits as her sister, so she eats 2 x 8 = 16 biscuits. Her sister eats 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 on Wednesday. So, in total, Sues consumes 32 + 16 = 48 biscuits. Therefore, Sues has consumed 48 - 13 = 35 more calories than her sister.
