"Response: 156

Solution:
Let T be the number of sheep in Toulouse, C be the number of sheep in Charleston, and S be the number of sheep in Seattle. We know that:
T = 2C
S = 20
Now we can use these two equations to find the total number of sheep in all three cities:
T + C + S =?
Using the first equation, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:
T + C + S = 2(T + C)
Substituting the value of T from the second equation, we get:
T + C + S = 2(2C)
Simplifying, we get:
T + C + S = 4C
Now we can substitute the values of T and C from the given information:
Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, so T = 2C. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 4(2C)
= 8C
Seattle has 20 sheep, so S = 20. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle = 8C + 20
= 156
Therefore, the three cities together have 156 sheep."

Solution:
Carla starts downloading the file at a rate of 2 GB/minute, which means she will have downloaded 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

Then, when Windows forces a restart to install updates, it takes 20 minutes for the restart and download process. Therefore, the total time taken to download the file after the restart is:

100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes

So, the load required to download the file after the restart is:

Load = Total Time / Download Rate
= 120 minutes / 2 GB/minute
= 60 MB/minute

Therefore, the load required to download the file is 60 MB/minute."

"Response: 23 liters.

Solution:
Let's start by identifying the amount of orange drink we have initially:

Initially, we have 10 liters of orange drink (which is two-thirds water).

Now, let's find out how much water is in the orange drink:

Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the water content is:

2/3 x 10 = 6.67 liters (water)

So, the total volume of the orange drink is:

10 + 6.67 = 16.67 liters

Next, let's find out how much water is added from the pineapple drink:

The pineapple drink is three- fifths water, so the water content is:

3/5 x 15 = 9 liters (water)

So, the total volume of the combined drinks is:

16.67 + 9 = 25.67 liters

Finally, let's subtract the liter that was spilled:

25.67 - 1 = 24.67 liters

Therefore, there are 24.67 liters of water in the remaining drink."

"Response: 12 min/mile

Solution:
Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* John runs 60 miles per week.
* He runs 3 days a week.
* On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
* On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as on the first day.

So, if he runs for x hours on the second day, he will have covered 60 / 2 = 30 miles.
And if he runs for y hours on the third day, he will have covered 60 / 3 = 20 miles.

Now, we need to find out how fast John runs. Let's use the formula:
Speed = Distance / Time

For the first day, Speed = 30 miles / 3 hours = 10 min/mile
For the second day, Speed = 20 miles / 2 hours = 10 min/mile
For the third day, Speed = 20 miles / 1 hour = 20 min/mile

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 12 min/mile."

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote 2/5 x 5 = 7 articles. She spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours researching and writing those articles.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote 2 x 7 = 14 articles. She spent 14 x 4 = 56 hours researching and writing those articles.
Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days was 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours."

1 - (3/4) x 120 = 20 units
Therefore, there are 20 unoccupied units in the building."

Explanation:
The total number of minutes seen by the patients in one day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes.
Since each doctor charges $150/hour, the total amount charged by the doctors to the hospital is 12,000 minutes / 60 (minutes/hour) = $200,000 per day.
Since the hospital charges the patients $200/hour, the total amount collected from the patients is 12,000 minutes / 60 (minutes/hour) = $200,000 per day.
Therefore, the profit made by the hospital per day is $200,000 - $200,000 = $0.

"Response: 42

Reasoning:

1. The seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14/2 = 7 fries.
2. Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 fries. Therefore, the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is 3 x 3 = 9 fries.
3. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is equal to 5/3 = 16 fries (since there are 5 fries left).
4. Finally, ants carried off one fry, leaving 5 - 1 = 4 fries.

Therefore, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it is 42 (4 x 10 = 40 + 2)."

Number of blue pens in each bag = 9 pens/bag x 6 bags = 54 blue pens

Now, let's add the number of blue pens Janet already had to the number of blue pens she just bought:
Total number of blue pens = 22 green pens + 54 blue pens = 76 blue pens

Similarly, we can find out how many red pens Janet has by adding the number of red pens she already had to the number of red pens she just bought:
Total number of red pens = 10 yellow pens + 2 bags of red pens (each with 6 pens) = 18 red pens

So, Janet has a total of 76 blue pens and 18 red pens, which means she has 94 pens in total."

Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom can complete 12 pieces in 1 hour (24 / 2 = 12).
To find out how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate of completion:

* The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
* After two months, Ashlyn went to the farm and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which is 36 (30% of 120).
* Two weeks later, when Ashlyn returned, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which is 90 (3/4 of 36).
* Therefore, there were 36 - 90 = 54 watermelons left on the farm that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

So, the answer is 54."
"Response:  $34,800.

Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them. How much does he pay for everything?

Let's break down the costs:

* Cost of cars = 12 x $20,000 = $240,000
* Tax on cars = $240,000 x 10% = $24,000
* Registration fee on cars = $240,000 x $1000 = $24,000

Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $24,000 = $348,000

Solution:
Let X be the total number of students who went out through all three exits (A, B, and C).
From the problem statement, we know that 30% of the students went out through exit A, so the number of students who went out through exit A is 30%.
The remaining students are 70%, which is equal to 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.
Now, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, so the number of students who went out through exit B is 0.7 x 3/5 = 0.42.
The remaining students go out through exit C, so the number of students who went out through exit C is 0.7 x 0.6 = 0.42.
Therefore, the total number of students who went out through all three exits is X = 0.3 + 0.42 + 0.42 = 267."

Response:  Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Since there are 4 snails in the first aquarium, the total number of living organisms (fish + snails) is 4x. In the second aquarium, there are 32 snails, so the total number of living organisms is 32(=16) + x = 58. To find out how many fish are in each aquarium, we can set up the equation: 4x = 58. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, there are 14 fish in the first aquarium and 16 fish in the second aquarium.

Jeans pays $3875 for the makeup services provided by the artist over the course of 5 weeks. This calculation is based on the following steps:

* Hourly rate = $250/hour x 4 days/week = $1000/week
* Total cost for 5 weeks = $1000/week x 5 weeks = $5000
* Discount given after completion of movie = $5000 x 10% = $500
* Final cost paid by Jean = $5000 - $500 = $4500

Therefore, Jean pays $4500 for the makeup services provided by the artist over the course of 5 weeks."
