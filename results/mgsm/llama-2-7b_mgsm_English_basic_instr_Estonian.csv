"Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula:
Average speed = Total distance / Time taken
We know that Marissa has walked a total distance of 12 miles and it took her 2 hours to cover the first 4 miles. So, the time taken for the remaining distance is:
Time taken = Distance / Speed = 8 miles / 4 miles/hour = 2 hours
Now, we can use the formula again:
Average speed = Total distance / Time taken
= 12 miles / 2 hours = 6 miles/hour
Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at an average speed of 6 miles per hour to complete the remaining distance of 8 miles in 2 hours."

Response:  To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to subtract the cost of all other items from the total amount she paid. The cost of chicken meal is $12, so it costs $12 - $12 = $0. The cost of milk is $3 x 5 = $15. The cost of apples is $1.50 x 4 = $6. Total cost of all other items is $15 + $6 = $21. Now, let's subtract the total cost of all other items from the total amount Marie paid: $50 - $21 = $29. So, Marie ordered 29 boxes of pizza.

Response:  John runs at an average speed of 12 minutes per mile.
Response:  Dana can run for 2/3 of the time, so she runs for 4/5 of the total time. Walking takes 1/5 of the time, or 20% of the total time. So, she walks for 20% of 6 hours = 1.2 hours (or 72 minutes). Now, we need to calculate how far she can go while running and walking separately. Let's assume she can run at 4x the speed of her walking pace. Running speed = 4 x walking speed = 4 x 3 mph = 12 mph. Distance traveled while running = speed x time = 12 mph x 4/5 of 6 hours = 80 miles. Distance traveled while walking = speed x time = 3 mph x 1/5 of 6 hours = 20 miles. Total distance traveled = running + walking = 80 + 20 = 100 miles.
Response:  Brandon's iPhone is eight years old.
"Response:  To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to use the information given in the problem.
First, let's calculate the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the gold javelin without the gemstone. Since the dragon is 1000 feet away, and Polly can throw the javelin for 400 feet, this means that the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone is 600 feet (400 - 100 = 600).
Now, let's see how much further Polly can throw the javelin if she holds the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, the javelin can be thrown three times farther when Polly holds the gemstone. So, if Polly throws the javelin from a distance of 600 feet without the gemstone, then throwing it from a distance of 900 feet (3 x 600) would put it inside the dragon's flame area. Therefore, the answer is 900 feet."

"Response:  To determine the number of grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a bag, we need to calculate the remaining calories available for the day.

First, let's subtract the total number of calories in the bag (250 x 5 = 1250) from your daily calorie target (2000):

Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Total calories in bag
= 2000 - 1250
= 750

Now, divide the remaining calories by the number of grams of chips in one serving (based on the nutrition label):

Grams of chips = Remaining calories / Number of calories in one serving
= 750 / 250
= 3

So, you can eat up to 3 bags of chips (or 3 x 300g = 900g) based on your daily calorie target and the information provided about the bag of chips. However, keep in mind that this calculation assumes that all the calories in the chips are absorbed by your body, which may not be the case. Additionally, it's important to consider other factors such as macronutrient ratios and overall dietary balance when making food choices."
Response:  Charlie has a total of 5 pounds of beeswax. He uses 1 pound of beeswax to make 10 tapered candles, so he will need 4 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 / 10 = 4). The cost of the wicks is $10.00, regardless of how many candles he makes. Therefore, Charlie's total cost for making 20 candles is $10.00 + $10.00 = $20.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, his net profit from selling 20 candles would be $20.00 - $20.00 = $0.00.
"Response:  Meredith spent a total of 16 hours writing articles in the three days.
Rahvas: That's correct! If you multiply the number of articles written on each day by the time it took to write each article (on average), you get the total number of hours spent writing articles for that day. Then, if you add up the total hours from all three days, you get the overall total number of hours spent writing articles. In this case, Meredith spent 4 hours x 5 = 20 hours writing articles on Monday, 2/5 x 4 = 8 hours writing articles on Tuesday, and 2 x 8 = 16 hours writing articles on Wednesday, for a grand total of 20 + 8 + 16 = 44 hours."

Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and each toy weighs 1/2 pound. We know that Uriah has 30 comic books, so they weigh 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. Since Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds from his backpack, he will need to remove 7.5 - 15 = -7.5 pounds of toys. So, he needs to remove 7.5 pounds of toys from his backpack.

Years Worked = 30
Annual Pension at 20 Years = $50,000 / 20 = $2,500/year
Additional Annual Pension Per Year = $50,000 x 5% = $2,500
Total Annual Pension = $2,500 + $2,500 = $5,000/year
Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work will be $5,000."

"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it. We can do this by using the following formula:

distance = (gas left / miles driven) x 12

In this case, the distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas is:

distance = (4 / 100) x 12 = 500 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 500 miles on a single tank of gas."

Boys' teams: School A - 5 players, School B - 5 players, School C - 5 players, School D - 5 players = 20 players
Coaches: School A - 1 coach, School B - 1 coach, School C - 1 coach, School D - 1 coach = 4 coaches
So, in total, there are 20 + 20 + 4 = 64 people who have been sent by all the schools."

Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs during that time. We know that she needs 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days (or 6 months), so she needs a total of 6 x 30 = 180 cups of dog food during those 6 months. After that, she needs 2 cups of dog food per day, which means she needs a total of 12 x 365 = 4370 cups of dog food over the course of the next year. Since each bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will use 4370 / 110 = 40 bags of dog food in the first year.

Response:  Let's start by finding out how many dogs and cats there are in the neighborhood. We know that the number of dogs is 60, and since there are two cats for every dog, we can find out how many cats there are by multiplying the number of dogs by 2: 60 x 2 = 120 cats. Now, let's subtract the number of cats from the total number of pets to find out how many rabbits there are: 120 - 12 = 108 rabbits. So, there are 108 rabbits, 120 cats, and 60 dogs in the neighborhood.

Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total revenue and then subtract the total cost of the materials. The total revenue is the sum of the price per board multiplied by the number of boards sold. For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, the price per board is $10, so the total revenue from these boards is $10 x 10 = $100. For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, the price per board is $16, so the total revenue from these boards is $16 x 5 = $80. Therefore, the total revenue from both sets of boards is $100 + $80 = $180. Next, we subtract the total cost of the materials from the total revenue to find the profit. In this case, the total cost of the materials is $10 x 10 = $100 (for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards) plus $16 x 5 = $80 (for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards), which equals a total cost of $180. So, Sasha makes a profit of $180 - $180 = $0.

On the second day, 3 additional containers arrived, each containing 5 vehicles, for a total of 15 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 35 (20 + 15 = 35).
Since each container can hold up to 5 vehicles, the total number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
35 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 7 containers
So, 7 containers were imported on the second day."

Response:  In the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive and 15 bees return (since half as many bees returned). In the second 6 hours, Debra saw twice as many bees leave the hive as she saw in the first 6 hours, so she saw 60 bees leave (30 x 2 = 60). Since Debra saw twice as many bees leave as she saw return in the first 6 hours, she saw 90 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours (60 + 30 = 90). Therefore, Debra saw 90 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to subtract the distance between the two houses from the time it takes for each of them to travel that distance. For Steve, it takes him 3 miles / 440 feet/minute = 7 minutes to reach his house. For Tim, it takes him 2 miles / 264 feet/minute = 8 minutes to reach his house. So, if Steve starts the race first, he will arrive at his house in 7 - 1 = 6 minutes after starting the race. If Tim starts the race second, he will arrive at his house in 8 - 1 = 7 minutes after starting the race.

Response:  To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over that period. We can do this by multiplying the number of bananas each group of apes needs per month by the number of months they will be receiving bananas. For example, if the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, then they will need 800 (400 x 2) bananas over the course of 2 months. Similarly, the baboons will need 50 bananas per month, so they will need 100 (50 x 2) bananas over 2 months. Finally, we add up the total number of bananas needed by all the groups of apes to find out how many the zookeeper needs to order. In this case, the answer is 950 bananas (800 + 100).

Response:  To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's start by finding the cost of the hat. Since the hat costs $25, we know that the cost of the jacket is three times as much as the cost of the hat. So, the cost of the jacket is $25 x 3 = $75. Now, we need to find the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To do this, we add the cost of the hat and the cost of the jacket together and divide by 2: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $100. Therefore, the cost of each uniform is $100.

"Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to multiply the total amount by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year). So, if Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum for each debt, she will pay:
$300 x 1.5 = $450 per month for her student loans
$200 x 1.5 = $300 per month for her credit card
$500 x 1.5 = $750 per month for her mortgage
So, in a year, Jessica will pay:
$450 x 12 = $5,400 for her student loans
$300 x 12 = $3,600 for her credit card
$750 x 12 = $9,000 for her mortgage
In total, Jessica will pay $18,000 towards her debts in a year."

Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to divide the total amount of money they made by the cost of one gallon of lemonade. So, if they made $25 in profit, that means they sold $25 / $0.50 = 50 glasses of lemonade. Since each glass costs $3 for lemons + $2 for sugar, the total cost of making one gallon is $3 x 20 = $60. Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $60 / 50 = $1.20 on lemons for every gallon they made.

Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out how long it takes for each member of the slower team to complete their 400 meter leg. Since each runner on the slower team runs 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, we can use this pattern to determine how long it takes each runner to finish their leg.  For example, if the first runner on the slower team takes 60 seconds to finish their leg, the second runner will take 57 seconds (since they are 3 seconds faster).  We can continue this pattern until we have determined how long it takes each runner on the slower team to finish their leg. Once we know how long it takes each runner to finish their leg, we can compare it to the time taken by each runner on the faster team to determine who wins the race.

Response:  Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, we can write an equation: 3x = 42 (days). Now let's find out how many white chickens Jerry has by using the information that every day Jerry collects 42 eggs and there are two more white chickens than red chickens. So if Jerry has x red chickens, then he has 2x white chickens. We can write another equation: 2x = 42 - 3x (eggs collected). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 6 and 2x = 84. Therefore, Jerry has 6 red chickens and 84 white chickens.

So Ginger gave Griffin 1/6 x 58 = 9 fries.  Finally, Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took 26 fries (-3). Therefore, in the end Griffin had 27 fries.
Response:  Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x. Then, the number of fish in the second aquarium is twice that amount, so it is 2x. Since the total number of fish in both aquariums is equal to the sum of the number of snails in both aquariums, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 4 + 32. Simplifying this equation gives us: 5x = 36. Dividing both sides by 5 gives us: x = 7. So, there are 7 fish in the first aquarium and 14 fish in the second aquarium.
"Response:  To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services over the duration of the movie shoot.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours of makeup application per week:

4 days/week x 6 hours/day = 24 hours/week

Next, let's multiply the total hours by the hourly rate:

24 hours/week x $250/hour = $6,000/week

Since the movie shoot lasted for 5 weeks, the total cost of makeup services comes to:

$6,000/week x 5 weeks = $30,000

Now, since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we subtract that amount from the total cost:

$30,000 - ($30,000 x 10%) = $27,000

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000 for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid $70 / 3 = $23.33.
Response:  The chef spent a total of $600 ($1.50 x 4 bags = $6).
"Response:  On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, if her sister ate x cookies, then Sue ate 4x cookies. 
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, if her sister ate x cookies, then Sue ate 2x cookies. 
The problem states that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. So, if we let x be the number of cookies her sister ate on Monday, then the number of cookies her sister ate on Tuesday is 13 - 5 = 8. 
Now, we need to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. We know that each cookie has 200 calories, so if Sue ate x cookies on Monday, she consumed 200x calories. Since her sister ate 8 cookies on Tuesday, she consumed 8 x 200 = 1600 calories. Therefore, Sue consumed 200x - 1600 = 1400 more calories than her sister."
