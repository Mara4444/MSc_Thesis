"Response:  First, we know that Janet sells all of her eggs except for three that she consumes in the morning. So, if she has 16 eggs per day and sells them all, then she must sell 13 eggs (16 - 3 = 13).  Next, we know that each egg costs $2, so the total amount of money she earns from selling eggs is:  
13 x $2 = $26  
Therefore, Janet earns $26 per day at the farmer's market."
Response:  We know that we need half of the fiber white to make one mantle. So if we have x fiber white, we will have (x/2) fiber for the mantle. Now, we also know that we need two fiber blue to make one mantle. So in total, we will need (x/2 + 2) parafusos. Therefore, the number of parafusos needed is (x/2 + 2).
Response:  First, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. So, he invested a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000 in the house.  Next, we are told that after the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%. This means that the new value of the house is 150% of $130,000, which is:  150% x $130,000 = $195,000  Therefore, Josh made a profit of $195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000 on his investment.
Response:  If James runs 3 sprints three times a week, that means he runs a total of 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week.  Since each sprint is 60 meters long, James runs a total distance of 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week.
Response:  First, we know that each chicken needs three meals per day with a total of 3 x 3 = 9 cups (xícaras) of food per day.  Since there are 20 chickens in Wendi's flock, she will need to provide a total of 9 x 20 = 180 cups of food per day.  So, for the last meal of the day, Wendi will need to give her chickens 180 - 15 = 165 cups of food.
"Response:  If the first cup costs $5 and each additional cup is 60% of that price, then the second cup would cost $5 x 0.6 = $3. So, if Kylar buys 16 cups, he will pay:  
$5 + (15 x $3) = $5 + $45 = $50."
"Response:  First we know that Toulouse has more sheep than Charleston because it is stated ""Toulouse tem o dobro de ovelhas que Charleston"". This means that if Charleston has x ovelhas, then Toulouse has 2x ovelhas. We also know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4x ovelhas. Finally, we are told that Seattle has 20 ovelhas. So let's set up an equation based on this information:  

Let x be the number of ovelhas in Charleston. Then Toulouse has 2x ovelhas and Seattle has 20 ovelhas.  Now we can write down our equation:  

2x + 4x = 20 + 2x  Simplifying the equation:  

6x = 40  Dividing both sides by 6:  

x = 7  Therefore, Charleston has 7 ovelhas, Toulouse has 14 ovelhas (2 times 7), and Seattle has 20 ovelhas."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much time it would take to download 2 GB of data at 2 GB/minute. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:   Time = Distance / Speed Time = 2 GB / (2 GB/min) Time = 1 minute So, it would take 1 minute to download 2 GB of data. Now let's calculate how long it would take to download the entire file of 200 GB. We can use the same formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 200 GB / (2 GB/min) Time = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes Therefore, it would take approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to download the entire 200 GB file if there were no interruptions. However, as mentioned in the problem statement, after downloading 40% of the file, the Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. This means that the total time required to download the file will be: Total Time = Download Time + Restart Time Total Time = 1 hour and 40 minutes + 20 minutes Total Time = 1 hour and 60 minutes or 100 minutes Therefore, it would take approximately 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download the entire 200 GB file including the interruption for installing updates.
Response:  First, we know that John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 100 km/h, so he covers a distance of:  Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 100 km/h x 3 hours Distance = 300 km Now, we know that John spends the first two hours in traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time. Therefore, the total distance traveled by John is: Total Distance = 300 km + (2 hours x 30 mph) + (2 hours x 80 mph) Total Distance = 300 km + (2 x 60 km) + (2 x 160 km) Total Distance = 300 km + 120 km + 320 km Total Distance = 540 km So, after four hours, John is 540 kilometers away from home.
Response:  First, we know that Eliza's regular hourly wage is $10 per hour.  For her first 40 hours of work, she earned $10 x 40 = $400.  Next, we know that for any hours worked beyond 40, she received 1.2 times her regular hourly wage. So for the additional 5 hours (45 - 40), she earned 1.2 x $10 = $12 per hour. Therefore, her total earnings for the week are $400 + ($12 x 5) = $400 + $60 = $460.
"Response:  We know that in the first month, there were 60 downloads. In the second month, there were three times as many downloads as in the first month, so we can write:  
In the second month, there were 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.  Now, we are told that in the third month, there was a 30% decrease from the previous month. So if there were x downloads in the third month, we can find out how many downloads there were in the second month by multiplying by 0.7 (since 0.7 is the fraction of the original number that remains after a 30% decrease):  
x = 180 x 0.7 = 126 downloads.  Since we already knew that there were 180 downloads in the second month, we can add up all three months to get our final answer:  
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 426 downloads."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much each type of dessert costs per unit (donuts, mini cupcakes and mini cheesecakes). Then we will multiply that cost by the number of units she bought for each type of dessert. Finally, we add up all these amounts to get the total cost.  Donuts: Cost per unit = $68 / 3 dozen = $22.67 per dozen Mini Cupcakes: Cost per unit = $80 / 2 dozen = $40 per dozen Mini Cheesecakes: Cost per unit = $55 / 6 dozen = $9.17 per dozen Now let's calculate the total cost for each type of dessert: Donuts: Total cost = 3 x $22.67 = $68.01 Mini Cupcakes: Total cost = 2 x $40 = $80 Mini Cheesecakes: Total cost = 6 x $9.17 = $55.02 Now let's add up all these amounts to get the total cost: Total cost = $68.01 + $80 + $55.02 = $203.03
Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend each year on watering and feeding the tree.  $ 3 per year. Now let's calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to break even (i.e., start making a profit). To do this, we need to subtract the annual expenses from the revenue generated by the tree. Revenue = Number of Limons x Price per Limon = 7 x $ 1.5 = $ 10.5 per year Subtracting the annual expenses: $ 10.5 - $ 3 = $ 7.5 per year It takes 7.5 years for Carlos to break even. After that, he will start making a profit!
Response:  We know that Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house and two more at the red house. So she has sold a total of 3 + 2 = 5 vacuum cleaners. Since she still has half of what remains at the orange house, let's find out how many she had there to start with. Half of what remains is equal to half of 5 (since we know she sold 5). Therefore, Melanie started with 5 / 2 = 2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. In total, Melanie had 2 + 5 = 7 vacuum cleaners at the beginning.
Response:  We know that 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance and 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. So we can start by finding out how many students did not enroll in either contemporary or jazz dance.  To do this, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students (20% of 20 = 4). This leaves us with 16 students who did not enroll in contemporary or jazz dance.  Now, we find out how many of these students enrolled in hip-hop dance. Since 75% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, there are 75% of 16 = 12 students who did not enroll in jazz dance. Therefore, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  Finally, to find the percentage of all students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students: 12/20 x 100% = 60%.  So, 60% of all students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the profit for each option. For the jewelry option, we have: Profit = Price x Growth Rate = $5,000 x 2.5% = $125 So, the profit from selling jewelry would be $125. Now let's calculate the profit for the electronics option: Profit = Price x Growth Rate = $8,000 x 1.2% = $96 So, the profit from selling electronics would be $96. Since the profit from selling jewelry is higher than the profit from selling electronics ($125 vs. $96), it makes more sense for the merchant to choose the jewelry option in order to maximize their profits at the end of this month.
"Response:  On the first day, both trains travel west for 80 miles. Since they start from the same place (San Rafael), they cover the same distance. So, their daily distance is:  
Day 1: 80 miles each train.  Now, let's consider Day 2. Both trains travel north for 240 kilometers. Again, since they start and end at the same point, their total distance traveled on Day 2 will be the same. Therefore, their combined daily distance on Day 2 is:  
Day 2: 240 km x 2 = 480 km.  Total distance covered in two days:  
Total distance = Day 1 + Day 2 = 80 mi + 480 km = 560 km."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours she works as a teacher per year:  
35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year (as a teacher) Next, let's calculate her income from teaching:  
$20/hour x 1750 hours/year = $35,000/year (as a teacher) Now, let's calculate her income from training:  
$30/hour x 15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = $9,000/year (as a trainer) Total income = $35,000 + $9,000 = $44,000/year"
Response:  If Claire makes an omelette with three eggs every morning for breakfast, and there are 7 days in a week, then she consumes 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Since we want to know how many dozen eggs she will consume in 4 weeks, we can multiply 21 eggs/week x 4 weeks = 84 eggs. So, Claire will eat 84 eggs in 4 weeks.
"Response:  First, we know that Marissa walked for 4 kilometers in the first hour at some velocity v_1. Then she walked for another 2 kilometers in the second hour at some velocity v_2. We can let v_1 be her speed for the first hour and v_2 be her speed for the second hour. Since she covered 4 + 2 = 6 kilometers in total, we have:  
v_1(4 km) + v_2(2 km) = 6 km  Now we need to convert all distances to miles. There are 1.60934 kilometers in a mile, so:  
4 km x 1.60934 = 6.4373 mi  
2 km x 1.60934 = 3.2187 mi  Therefore, Marissa walked 6.4373 miles in the first hour and 3.2187 miles in the second hour. To find her average speed over the entire distance of 12 miles, we add up these two speeds and divide by the total distance:  
(6.4373 + 3.2187) / 12 = (9.6560) / 12 = 0.80467 or approximately 8.05 miles/hour."
Response:  We have 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water and we want to add it to 15 liters of pineapple juice that is three-fifths water. First, let's calculate how much water there is in the orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 6.67 liters (since 2/3 = 0.66...). Now, we can calculate how much water there is in the pineapple juice. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 9 liters (since 3/5 = 0.6). So, if we add the water from the orange drink to the pineapple juice, we get: 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water. Therefore, there are 15.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of beverage.
Response:  First, we know that Raymond is six years older than Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond must be 31 + 6 = 37 years old.  Next, we are told that Raymond had a child at age 23, so his child was born when Raymond was 23 + 6 = 29 years old.  Therefore, the child of Raymond was born 37 - 29 = 8 years ago.
Response:  First three customers buy one DVD each, so we sell 3 DVDs to them. Next three customers buy two DVDs each, so we sell 6 DVDs to them. Total number of DVDs sold = 3 + 6 = 9 DVDs.
Response:  We know that the candle burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour.  If we want to find out how much shorter the candle will be after burning for 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00), we need to multiply the rate by the number of hours it will burn.  So, we can calculate the total distance the flame will travel as follows: Total distance = Rate x Time Total distance = 2 cm/hr x 4 hrs Total distance = 8 cm Therefore, the candle will be 8 cm shorter after burning for 4 hours from 13:00 to 17:00.
Response:  First, we know that the discount was 25%.  That means if we multiply the cost of the book by 0.75 (which is what happens when you subtract 25%), we will get the amount saved.  So, if Kyle paid $19.50 for the book and he saved $4.88 (25% of $19.50), then the original price of the book must have been: Original Price = Cost - Amount Saved Original Price = $19.50 - $4.88 Original Price = $14.62 Therefore, the original price of the book was $14.62.
Response:  First, we know that Marie paid $50 in total.  We also know that she spent $12 on chicken, $3 x 5 = $15 on milk, and $1.50 x 4 = $6 on apples.  That adds up to $23.50.  So, if Marie paid $50, then she must have spent an additional amount of $26.50 ($50 - $23.50) on pizza.  Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie bought  26.50 / 8.50 = 3 boxes of pizza.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much each item costs and then add up all of the items that Mishka bought.  Here are the calculations for each item:  
Shorts: 3 pairs x $16.50 = $49.50 Calças: 3 pairs x $22.50 = $67.50 Sapatos: 3 pairs x $42 = $126 Total cost: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Cynthia spends per day on gelato.  To do this, we divide the cost of one box of ice cream (R$ 4.00) by the number of portions in each box (15):  R$ 4.00 / 15 = R$ 0.27 per portion.  Now that we know how much Cynthia spends per portion, we can calculate how much she will spend in total over 60 days:  Total amount spent = Number of days x Cost per day  Total amount spent = 60 x R$ 0.27 = R$ 16.20.
Response:  We know that O Henry rode his bike for 20 miles before making the first stop and then rode an additional 15 miles before making the second stop. To find out how many kilometers he traveled between the two stops, we need to add the distances he rode before each stop. So, the total distance = 20 + 15 = 35 miles or 56.32 kilometers.
Response:  First, we know that the two pairs of shoes together cost $5 less than the boots. So if the boots cost x dollars, the total cost of both pairs of shoes will be x + (x * 2) = 2x + 5. Since the two pairs of shoes together cost $5 less than the boots, we can set up the equation:  2x + 5 - x = x. Simplifying this equation, we get:  3x = 6. Dividing both sides by 3, we get:  x = 2. Therefore, the boots cost $2.
Response:  First, we know that the sum of their ages is 162.  We also know that Darrel is 7 years old and Allen is 11 - 7 = 4 years old.  So, if we add their ages together, we get:  7 + 4 = 11  Now, let's look at what we want to find out.  We want to find out how old Allen will be in 10 years.  To do this, we need to add 10 to his current age of 4.  So, we add 4 + 10 = 14 years old.  Therefore, Allen will be 14 years old in 10 years.
Response:  First, we know that the first friend said there were 80 geleias in the frasco. Second, the second friend said there were 20 more than half of the first amount, which is 20 + (80/2) = 80 + 40 = 120. Third, the third friend said there were 25% more than the first amount, which is 120 x 1.25 = 150. So, the estimated median number of geleias in the frasco is 150.
"Response:  First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours per day to take care of its affairs.  Second, we are told that John cares for 10 dogs.  Therefore, the total time John spends taking care of all 10 dogs is:  
Time = Number of dogs x Time per dog  Time = 10 x 0.5  Time = 5 hours  So, John spends 5 hours per week taking care of his 10 dogs."
Response:  We know that there are 30 more coins of gold than silver. So if we subtract the number of silver coins from the total number of coins, we will get the number of gold coins.  Total coins = 110  Number of silver coins = 80 (since there are 80 silver coins)  Subtracting the number of silver coins from the total coins gives us the number of gold coins:  Gold coins = Total coins - Number of silver coins = 110 - 80 = 30 Therefore, Gretchen has 30 gold coins.
Response:  First, we know that Aaron has five more than half of Raymond's jewels, so let's find out how many jewels Raymond has first.  We are given that Raymond has 40 jewels.  Half of 40 is 20, so Aaron has five more than 20, which is 25 jewels.  Now, we can see that Siobhan has two fewer than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.  In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than in the first 20 minutes. So, if he scored x points in the first 20 minutes, he scored (1 + 0.25x) points in the second 20 minutes. Since there are 40 minutes in total, we can add up both parts to find out how many points Mike scored overall: x + (1 + 0.25x) = 4 + (1 + 0.25x). Simplifying this equation, we get: 3x + 0.25x = 4 + 1 + 0.25x. Combine like terms: 4x + 0.5x = 5x + 1. Subtracting 0.5x from both sides gives us: 3.5x = 5x + 1. Solving for x, we get: x = 5/3. Therefore, Mike scored 5/3 points in 40 minutes of playing ping-pong.
Response:  First, we know that Terry buys two yogurts per day, so he consumes 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in 30 days.  Next, we know that each yogurt costs $5, so Terry spends 60 x $5 = $300 on yogurt during those 30 days.
Response:  First, we know that John has 13 sets of Legos and he sells each set for $15. So, if he sells all his Legos, he will have $15 x 13 = $195.  Next, we know that he spends $20 x 8 = $160 on video games, so he has $195 - $160 = $35 left over. Finally, we know that he has $5 left over, so he must still have some Legos left.  To find out how many Legos he still has, let's subtract the amount he spent on video games from the total amount he had: $35 - $160 = $125.  Since he sold each Lego set for $15, he must have sold at least $125 / $15 = 8 sets of Legos. Therefore, John still has 8 sets of Legos.
Response:  First, we know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day and half of the remaining two days, so he runs for half of 2 days x 3 hours = 3 hours.  Total running time per week = 3 + 6 = 9 hours.  Since John runs 100 km per week, his speed can be calculated as follows: Speed = Distance / Time = 100 km / 9 h = 11.11 km/h.
"Response:  First, we know that Dana can run at a speed of four times her walking speed, so if she can walk at 5 km/h, she can run at 20 km/h (4 x 5).  Now, we are given that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.  So, if she runs for x hours, she walks for 2x hours.  Since she needs to cover a total distance of 6 miles in six hours, we can set up the following equation:  

(20 km/h)x + (5 km/h)(2x) = 6 mi  
Simplifying this equation, we get:  

3x + 10 = 6  
Solving for x, we get:  

x = 2  
So, Dana runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours."
Response:  First, we know that the iPhone of Brandon is four times older than the iPhone of Ben. So if the iPhone of Ben is two years old, then the iPhone of Brandon is four times two, which is eight years old.  Now, we also know that the iPhone of Suzy is one year old. Therefore, the iPhone of Brandon is eight years older than the iPhone of Suzy.  So, the iPhone of Brandon has been around for nine years (eight plus one).
Response:  First, we know that without the stone of preciousness (pedra de safira), Polly can throw the golden spear (javelino de ouro) up to 120 meters.  Second, when she holds the stone, she can throw it three times farther than before. Third, the great dragon (grande dragão) is sitting on top of Mount Farbo and breathing fire up to 300 meters away from him. So if Polly throws the javelin with the stone, even though it will be beyond the range of the dragon's flames, she can still hit the dragon because the stone allows her to throw it much farther than usual. Therefore, the distance at which Polly can reach the dragon while holding the stone is 3 x 120 = 360 meters.
Response:  First, Avó Jones cut each of her five apple tarts into 8 pieces, so she had 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of tart in total.  Next, we know that after everyone had taken and eaten their share of the tarts, there were 14 leftover pieces. So, if we subtract the number of leftovers (14) from the total number of pieces (40), we can find out how many pieces were taken by the convidados:  40 - 14 = 26  Therefore, 26 pieces of apple tart were taken by the guests.
"Response:  First, we know that one portion of potatoes (300g) contains 250 calories. Therefore, if we consume five portions, we will have consumed 5 x 250 = 1250 calories.  Now, we are given that our daily calorie intake is 2000 calories and we have already consumed 1800 calories. So, to calculate how many grams of potatoes we can eat, we need to subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie intake. In other words, we can eat:  

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories worth of potatoes. Since each portion contains 250 calories, we can eat:  

200 / 250 = 0.8 portions or 240g of potatoes."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Charlie will make if he sells all 20 velas.  If each vela costs $2 and Charlie makes 10 velas per kilogram of wax, then he needs 20/10 = 2 kilograms of wax to make 20 velas.  Since one kilogram of wax costs $10 in supplies, Charlie needs $10 x 2 = $20 worth of wax to make all 20 velas.  Now let's calculate his profit. He spends $20 on wax and sells all 20 velas for $40 (2 x $20).  His profit is therefore: Profit = Sales - Cost = $40 - $20 = $20.  So Charlie makes a profit of $20 from selling 20 velas.
Response:  First, we know that she wrote 5 articles on Monday and twice as many on Tuesday (2 x 5 = 10). On Wednesday, she wrote double the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday (2 x 10 = 20). So, in total, she wrote 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 articles. Now, let's calculate the time it took her to write these articles. We know that each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total time she spent writing all 35 articles is 35 x 4 = 140 hours.
"Response:  First, we know that Candice had 80 notes in her bag before she went to work at the cafe. Second, we know that she used 23 of those notes to label the cups of coffee. Third, we know that there were 220 different cups of coffee in total. So, if we subtract the number of cups that Candice labeled (23) from the total number of cups (220), we can find out how many cups Candice did not label:  
220 - 23 = 197. Therefore, Candice did not label 197 cups of coffee. Now, let's think about the Post-its that Candice bought. We know that she had 23 notes left over after labeling all the cups. If she had 23 notes left over and she used one note per cup, then she must have bought a pack of Post-its with at least 23 notes in it. So, the answer is:  
The pack of Post-its that Candice bought contained at least 23 notes."
Response:  First, we know that John bought twice as many red t-shirts as blue ones. So if he bought x blue t-shirts, he bought 2x blue t-shirts.  Second, we know that the price of each red t-shirt is 50% more than the price of each blue t-shirt. So the price of one red t-shirt is $40 + (50% of $40), which is $40 + $20 = $60.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  2x + x = 2(200)  Simplifying the equation:  3x = 400  Dividing both sides by 3:  x = 133.33  Therefore, John spent $133.33 on blue t-shirts and $266.67 on red t-shirts for a total of $400.
Response:  We know that Tracy used a string of length 1.2 meters to support the tomatoes in her garden. She cut it into pieces of 15 centimeters each. So we can start with what she had before cutting it: 1.2 m (the whole string) Now let's see how many pieces she got after cutting it: 1.2 m / 0.15 m (piece size) = 8 pieces So Tracy obtained 8 pieces of strings of length 0.15 meters each.
Response:  First, we know that there are 15 floors in the building.  Each floor has 8 units, so there are 15 x 8 = 120 units in total.  Next, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that only 3/4 of the units are occupied.  So, if we multiply 120 by 3/4, we get 90 units occupied.  Therefore, the number of units that are vacant or unoccupied is 120 - 90 = 30.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many dozen eggs Lloyd sells per day:  
252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day  
Now, let's calculate how much money Lloyd makes per day:  
21 dozen x $2/dozen = $42 per day  
Finally, let's calculate how much money Lloyd makes per week (assuming a 7-day week):  
$42 per day x 7 days = $294 per week"
Response:  First we need to calculate how far Tom's ship will travel during the four hours it is sailing at 10 miles per hour.  We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:  Time x Speed = Distance 4 hours x 10 miles/hour = Total distance traveled 4 x 10 = 40 miles  Now let's find out how long it takes Tom's ship to return at a speed of 6 miles per hour.  We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:  Time = Distance / Speed 40 miles / 6 miles/hour = Time 40 / 6 = 6.67 hours or approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that the total weight of the books is 15 kg and each comic book weighs 1 kg. So, if he removes 30 comic books, he will have removed a total of 30 x 1 = 30 kg. Now, let's find out how many toys he needs to remove to reach his goal. We can set up an equation based on this information: Total weight of books - Weight of comics = Weight of toys To solve for the number of toys, we can substitute the values we know into the equation: 15 kg - 30 kg =? kg To find the number of toys, we need to subtract the weight of the comics from the total weight of the books: 15 kg - 30 kg = -15 kg Since we cannot have a negative number of toys, we know that he does not need to remove any toys! Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
Response:  First, we know that the mechanic charges $60 per truck tire and $40 per car tire. So if he repairs six truck tires, that would be 6 x $60 = $360. If he repairs four car tires, that would be 4 x $40 = $160. In total, the mechanic earned $360 + $160 = $520 on Thursday.  On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 cars, but did not repair any truck tires. Since each car tire costs $40 to repair, the mechanic earned 12 x $40 = $480 on Friday. Therefore, the mechanic had a higher receipt of $520 on Thursday than $480 on Friday.
Response:  First, we know that each of the two cats had kittens.  So, if Patchy had three times as many kittens as Trixie, and Trixie had 12 kittens, then Patchy must have had 3 x 12 = 36 kittens.  In total, the family now has 7 + 36 = 43 kittens.
Response:  First, we know that Jean has 30 pirulitos and gives two to her friend. That means she has 30 - 2 = 28 pirulitos left. Now, she wants to pack two pirulitos in each bag, so she can make bags until she runs out of pirulitos.  We can start by making one bag with two pirulitos, leaving us with 28 - 2 = 26 pirulitos. We can then make another bag with two pirulitos again, leaving us with 26 - 2 = 24 pirulitos. And so on... Since there are no more pirulitos after the last bag, we have made 24 bags in total. So, the answer is 24.
Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 to spend for the week.  He spends $7 on a movie ticket and $7 on popcorn, so he has $42 - $14 = $28 left over.  Since he can only afford to go to the movies twice with the money he has left ($28), he can go twice.  So, the answer is 2.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total weight of the camion and its cargo.  The weight of the empty camion is 1.400 kg (1,4 tons). If each box weighs 5 kg, then the number of boxes that can be loaded in the camion is: Total weight = Weight of camion + Number of boxes x Weight per box Total weight = 1.400 kg + (number of boxes) x 5 kg Total weight = 1.400 kg + 5 kg x (number of boxes) Since the maximum weight allowed for the bridge is 5.000 kg, we set up an equation: Total weight <= 5.000 kg To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we solve this equation: 1.400 kg + 5 kg x (number of boxes) <= 5.000 kg Subtracting 1.400 kg from both sides gives us: 5 kg x (number of boxes) <= 3.600 kg Dividing both sides by 5 kg gives us: Number of boxes <= 720 boxes Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded in the camion without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge is 720 boxes.
Response:  First, we know that Stephen paid $40 for his groceries.  Next, we know that there was an additional 25% charge added to the total, which would be $40 x 25% = $10. So, the new total with the extra charge would be $40 + $10 = $50.  Finally, Stephen also added a tip of $4, so the final price he paid would be $50 + $4 = $54.
Response:  We know that there are 6 groups of 20 fruits each, so we can start by multiplying 6 x 20 = 120 fruits in all the groups.  Now, we also have 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the bush, so let's add that to our total.   Total number of strawberries = 120 + 67 = 187 strawberries.
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 laranjas in total.  Of those, 1 is bad (so 1 out of 25), and 20% are not mature (so 20/100 x 25 = 5).  That leaves us with 25 - 1 - 5 = 19 good laranjas.
"Response:  First, we know that Janet paid $500 for the material to make the brooch. Then she paid $800 to the jeweler to construct it. Finally, she paid an additional $100 (10% of $800) for insurance. So in total, Janet paid:  
$500 + $800 + $100 = $1400."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Mary will receive as her pension if she works for 40 years and then retires.  We know that she receives $50,000 per year in her pension, so if she works for 40 years, she will receive a total of:  40 x $50,000 = $2,000,000  Now, let's consider how much of this amount is attributable to each of the first 20 years of service.  Since she has a 5% increase in her pension after 20 years, we can assume that the first 20 years of service are worth 95% of the total amount she received during those years.  This means that the value of the first 20 years of service is:  95% x $2,000,000 = $1,900,000  Finally, we need to subtract out the portion of the pension that is attributable to the last 10 years of service (since she worked for 30 years but only received 5% increases for the first 20).  The value of the last 10 years of service is:  5% x ($2,000,000 - $1,900,000) = $50,000 x 10 = $500,000  So, Mary's annual pension after working for 30 years would be:  Her annual pension = $1,900,000 + $500,000 = $2,400,000 /year
Response:  First, we know that the monthly subscription fee is $140.  If the company charged her for the first semester (6 months) at the full price of $140 per month, then she paid $840 for the first semester ($140 x 6 months).  Now, if the company charged her 10% less in the second semester, that means they charged her $126 per month ($140 x 90%). So, for the second semester, she paid $792 ($126 x 6 months).  Therefore, the total amount she paid for the year is $840 + $792 = $1,632.
"Response:  First, we know that Sophia traveled 160 kilometers since the last time she filled up her tank and needed to add 4 gallons of gasoline to fill it again. This means that the amount of gasoline left in the tank after her previous trip was:  

12 liters - 4 gallons = 8 liters (since 1 gallon is equal to 3.785 liters)

Now, let's calculate how far Sophia can go with one tank of gasoline based on the remaining amount of fuel:  

Distance = (Amount of fuel left x Fuel efficiency) / (Fuel consumption per kilometer)

In this case, the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car is not given, so we will assume an average fuel efficiency of 20 km/l for sedans (based on data from fueleconomy.gov). Therefore, the distance Sophia can travel with one tank of gasoline would be:  

Distance = (8 liters x 20 km/l) / (3.785 liters/gallon x 100 km/liter)
= 160 km

So, Sophia can travel approximately 160 kilometers with one tank of gasoline, assuming an average fuel efficiency of 20 km/l."
Response:  First, we know that Jim spends two hours watching television three times per week, so he watches for a total of six hours per week (2 x 3 = 6).  Next, we know that he spends half of his time reading after watching television, so he reads for half of six hours per week (6/2 = 3).  Therefore, in four weeks, Jim will spend a total of 3 x 4 = 12 hours watching television and reading.
Response:  We know that each school sent one team of girls and one team of boys to compete in the basketball tournament. So, for each school, we have:  Girls Team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people Rapid Boys Team: 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people Therefore, the total number of people sent by each school is: 6 (Girls Team) + 6 (Boys Team) = 12 people Since there are four schools participating in the tournament, the total number of people sent by all schools is: 4 x 12 = 48 people
Response:  First, we know that there were 175 diamonds.  Next, we know that there were 35 rubies less than the number of diamonds. So, if we subtract 35 from 175, we get 140 rubies. Finally, we know that there were twice as many emeralds as rubies. Therefore, if we double 140, we get 280 emeralds.  In total, there were 175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 695 stones in the chest.
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls in total and each class has 5 students for every teacher. So if we divide 60 by 5, we get: 60 / 5 = 12 classes with 5 students per class. Therefore, there must be 12 teachers to accommodate all of the female students.
"Response:  First, we know that Bailey has $x dollars at first. Then she receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so she gets:  
$5 x 8 = $40  
In total, Bailey has:  
$x + $40 = $100  
Now solve for $x$.  We get:  
$x = $60"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Judy earns per day.  To do this, we can multiply the number of classes she teaches per day (5) by the number of students in each class (15):  Daily income = 5 x 15 = 75  Next, we need to calculate how much money Judy earns per week. We can do this by multiplying her daily income by the number of days in a week (7):  Weekly income = 75 x 7 = 525  Finally, we can calculate how much money Judy earns in one week by multiplying her weekly income by the number of weeks in a month (4):  Monthly income = 525 x 4 = 2,100  So, Judy earns $2,100 per month teaching dance classes.
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, then the second recipe will have 2 x 20 = 40 instructions.  Therefore, in total, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions to prepare both dishes.
Response:  First, we know that Tommy sells brownies for $3 per piece and cheesecakes for $4 per piece.  Second, we know that Tommy sells a total of 43 brownies and 23 pieces of cheesecake.  Finally, we need to find out how much money Tommy makes in total.  To do this, we multiply the number of items he sells by their price.  For the brownies, we multiply 43 x $3 = $130.  For the cheesecakes, we multiply 23 x $4 = $92.  Therefore, Tommy makes a total of $130 + $92 = $222.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount paid for each cell phone: Total Amount = $150 x 5 units = $750 Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment for each unit: Monthly Payment = Total Amount / Number of months (3) Monthly Payment = $750 / 3 = $250 So, Sheila will pay $250 per month for 3 months.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Artie will make from each type of flower.  Calendula: $2.74 x 12 = $33.08 Petunia: $1.87 x 9 = $16.83 Begonia: $2.12 x 17 = $35.64 Total amount earned: $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.64 = $85.55
Response:  We know that each level of the sandcastle has half the area of the level below it, so if we start with an area of 16 square meters at the top level and work our way down, we can calculate the areas of all the levels as follows:  Level 4 (top): Area = 16 m^2 Level 3: Area = 8 m^2 (half of 16) Level 2: Area = 4 m^2 (half of 8) Level 1: Area = 2 m^2 (half of 4) Therefore, the average area of one level is: Average area = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2)/4 = 20/4 = 5 m^2
Response:  First, we know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy for 180 days (6 months) at a rate of 1 cup per day. So she will use up all 110 cups in those first 180 days. After that, she has to feed her dog 2 spoons per day for the rest of its life. Since there are 365 days in a year, and Cecilia has to feed her dog every day, she will need an additional 365/2 = 182.5 cups per year. Therefore, Cecilia will use a total of 110 + 182.5 = 292.5 cups of food per year.
Response:  First, we know that Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, so if David does x kilograms of laundry, Sarah does 4x kilograms.  Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so if Sarah does 4x kilograms, Raymond does 2x kilograms.  Finally, we are told that Sarah does 400 kilograms of laundry, so we can substitute this value in to find out how much laundry Raymond and David do.  So, for David:  400 kg / 4 = 100 kg (David does 100 kg of laundry) For Raymond:  400 kg / 2 = 200 kg (Raymond does 200 kg of laundry)
"Response:  First, we need to find out how much it would cost Vincent to buy 18 flowers at each price option.  If he buys 3 flowers per package and there are 6 packages of 3 flowers each, then he needs 6 x 3 = 18 flowers.  At R$ 2.50 per package of 3 flowers, it would cost him:  
R$ 2.50 x 6 packages = R$ 15.00 for 18 flowers.  Now let's compare this to the other price option:  
If he buys 2 flowers per package and there are 9 packages of 2 flowers each, then he also needs 9 x 2 = 18 flowers.  At R$ 1.00 per package of 2 flowers, it would cost him:  
R$ 1.00 x 9 packages = R$ 9.00 for 18 flowers.  So, Vincent saves R$ 6.00 (R$ 15.00 - R$ 9.00) when he buys the 18 flowers in packs of 3 instead of packs of 2."
Response:  First, we know that the cost without any discount is $100. Next, we know that there is a 30% discount, which means we can calculate the amount saved as follows: Amount Saved = Original Price x Discount Percentage Amount Saved = $100 x 30% Amount Saved = $30 Now, we need to subtract the amount saved from the original price to find out the final price with the discount: Final Price = Original Price - Amount Saved Final Price = $100 - $30 Final Price = $70 So, the total cost of the grooming service after the 30% discount is $70.
Response:  We know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 24 / 6 = 4 liters each. So, in total, they received 4 + 4 = 8 liters of water. Now we are told that a boy received 6 liters of water. Therefore, the amount of water left over can be found by subtracting what the boys received from the total amount available: 24 - 6 = 18 liters. The correct answer is 18 liters.
"Response:  First, we know that Charlie had 10 autocolantes to start with. Then he bought 21 adhesives from the store and received 23 adhesives for his birthday. So, in total, Charlie has:  
10 + 21 = 31 autocolantes Now, we are told that Charlie gave 9 of the adhesives to his sister. So, how many autocolates does Charlie have left?  
31 - 9 = 22 autocolantes Therefore, Charlie still has 22 autocolantes."
Response:  First, we know that Alex weighs one kilogram less than Grace. So if Grace weighs 45 kilograms, then Alex weighs 45 - 1 = 44 kilograms.  Therefore, the total weight of both is:  45 + 44 = 89 kilograms.
Response:  First, we know that each bush has 25 roses and each rose has 8 thorns. So, to find out how many thorns there are in total, we need to multiply the number of bushes by the number of roses per bush and then by the number of thorns per rose.  Here's the calculation:  3 bushes x 25 roses/bush x 8 thorns/rose = 3 x 25 x 8 = 400 thorns  Therefore, there are 400 thorns in total.
Response:  First, we know that the team won 8 times more than they lost. So if they lost x games, they won x + 8 games. Since the total number of games played is 22, we can set up an equation: x + (x + 8) = 22. Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22. Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14. Divide both sides by 2: x = 7. Therefore, the team lost 7 games and won 7 + 8 = 15 games.
Response:  First, we know that each year of vacation is represented by one block in the blanket.  Since he has been going on four vacations per year since he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old, he has gone on a total of 34 x 4 = 136 vacations.  Each vacation is represented by one block in the blanket, so he has a total of 136 blocks.
Response:  First time: 4 times Second time: 3 times more than first time = 4 x 3 = 12 times Third time: Half of second time = 12 / 2 = 6 times Total number of times: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times
Response:  First, we need to calculate Sylvie's current annual salary based on her five years of service.  If she was paid $600 per month and there are 12 months in a year, then her current annual salary is:  $600 x 12 = $7,200 per year. Now, let's apply the 10% increase for each year of service. Since Sylvie has served for five years, her salary will be increased by 5 x 10% = 50%. So, her new annual salary after three more years of service would be: $7,200 + (50% of $7,200) = $7,200 + $3,600 = $10,800 per year.
"Response:  We know that the first album of Marilyn sold 10 times more copies than the one of Harald. So if the first album sold x copies, the second album sold 10x copies.  Now we are given that the total number of copies sold is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  
Marilyn's album: 10x = 88,000  
Harald's album: x = 88,000 / 10 = 8,800  So the Harald's album sold 8,800 copies."
Response:  First, we know that one-quarter of the participants will not appear, so we need to calculate how many bags of presents we need for the remaining guests. We have 16 friends attending the party, and since one-quarter of them won't show up, we can subtract 4 from 16: 16 - 4 = 12. So, we need 12 x 75 = 900 bags of presents in total. Now, let's calculate the cost. Each bag costs $2, so the total cost would be: 900 x $2 = $1800.
Response:  First, we know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 kilograms of potato salad.  Since there are 20 adults, they will eat a total of 20 x 10 = 200 kilograms of potato salad.  Now, we know that each child will eat half as much as an adult, so five children will eat 5 x 5 = 25 kilograms of potato salad.  In total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 kilograms of potato salad to the picnic.
"Response:  We know that Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so if Marcia has x pets, Jan has 3x pets.  Since Cindy has four pets and Marcia has two more than Cindy, we can write an equation based on this information:  
Marcia = Cindy + 2  
Now we have two equations:  
1) 3x = 4 + 2(x - 4)  
2) x = 4 + 2(x - 4)  
Solving these equations simultaneously gives us:  
x = 6  
So Marcia has six pets.  Therefore, Jan has three times six or eighteen pets."
"Response:  We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So, if we subtract 5 from Amy's age, we get Jackson's age. Then, we can find out Corey's age by adding 2 to Jackson's age. Finally, since James is one year younger than Corey, we can find his age by subtracting one from Corey's age. Here are the calculations:  
Amy's age = 4 + 5 = 9  
Jackson's age = 9 - 5 = 4  
Corey's age = 4 + 2 = 6  
James's age = 6 - 1 = 5  
Therefore, Jackson has 4 years old."
Response:  First, we know that Lee can run the 400 meters with barriers in 38 seconds. Second, we are told that Gerald improved his diet by 10%, which means he became 10% faster. Third, we need to find out how fast Gerald can run the 400 meters with barriers if he is 10% faster than before. To do this, we can use the following formula: New Time = Old Time x (1 + Percentage Increase). So, if Gerald was running the 400 meters with barriers in 45 seconds before improving his diet, and he becomes 10% faster, then: New Time = 45 x (1 + 0.10) = 45 x 1.10 = 49.5 seconds. Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400 meters with barriers in 49.5 seconds, which is 11.5 seconds slower than Lee.
"Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer rabbits than the combined number of dogs and cats in the neighborhood.  If there are two cats for every dog, then the number of cats is twice the number of dogs.  So if there are x dogs, there are 2x cats.  Since there are 60 dogs, there are 60 \* 2 = 120 cats.  Now we can find out how many rabbits there are.  There are 12 fewer rabbits than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is:  
120 (cats) + 60 (dogs) - 12 =?  To solve this equation, add 60 and 120:  
60 + 120 = 180  Therefore, there are 180 animals in the neighborhood, including 60 dogs, 120 cats, and 12 rabbits."
Response:  We know that there are 200 students in the fifth grade and 2/5 of them are boys. This means that there are 2 x 200 = 40 boys. Now we need to find out how many girls are not in the scouts. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the scouts, so we can start with the remaining girls who are not in the scouts. Girls not in the scouts = Total number of girls - (2/3) x Total number of girls. In this case, the total number of girls is 200 - 40 = 160. So, the number of girls not in the scouts is: Girls not in the scouts = 160 - (2/3) x 160 = 160 - 100 = 60. Therefore, there are 60 girls who are not in the scouts.
Response:  First, we know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night.  Second, we know that James slept for 2/3 of what Harry slept. So if Harry slept for x hours, then James slept for 2x/3 hours. Now we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James did. To do this, we can subtract the number of hours that James slept from the number of hours that Harry slept: 9 - (2x/3) = 9 - 2x/3. Simplifying and solving for x gives us: 9 - 2x/3 = 9 + x/3. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us: 2x/3 = 10/3. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us: 2x = 30. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 15. Therefore, Harry slept for 15 hours more than James did.
Response:  First, we know that each can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, so if Freda used 32 ounces (oz) of tomato sauce, she must have used 32 / 3 = 10 cans of tomatoes.  Since each can contains three tomatoes, Freda used 10 x 3 = 30 tomatoes in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were originally 30 cars on the highway.  Secondly, we know that some cars passed in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam (we don't know exactly how many). Thirdly, we know that another 20 cars passed during the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. Fourthly, we know that five cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam. Finally, we want to find out how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. So let's start with what we know:  There were originally 30 cars on the highway. Some cars passed in the first 15 minutes (we don't know exactly how many). We can assume that these cars passed in equal parts over the 15 minutes, so if x cars passed in the first 15 minutes, then 30/x cars remained on the highway for the remaining 15 minutes. Now we have two equations:  Equation 1: x + 30/x = 30... (1)  Equation 2: 20 + 30/x = 30... (2) Solving equation (1) for x, we get:  x = 10... (3) Substituting this value into equation (2), we get:  20 + 10/x = 30... (4) Simplifying and solving for x, we get:  x = 12... (5) Therefore, 12 cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.
"Response:  First, we know that Mary has 2 plants in each of her 40 windows, so she already has 2 x 40 = 80 plants in total.  Next, we know that she received 18 new plants yesterday, so now she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants in total. Finally, we are told that she will give one plant in a pot to each of her friends and family tomorrow, so she will be left with 98 - (number of plants given away) plants. Since she is giving away one plant per friend/family member, she will be left with 98 - (1 x number of recipients) plants. Therefore, the final number of plants Mary will have after giving some away is:  
98 - (1 x number of recipients)."
Response:  First, we know that the first friend tolled the bell 20 times before Jerome opened the door.  Secondly, we know that the second friend tolled the bell 1/4 more than the first friend, so if the first friend tolled the bell 20 times, then the second friend tolled it for 5 times (since 20 x 4 = 80).  Thirdly, we know that the third friend tolled the bell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so if the fourth friend tolled the bell 60 times, then the third friend tolled it for 70 times (since 60 + 10 = 70).  Therefore, in total, the four friends tolled the bell for 20 + 5 + 70 = 95 times.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many pages Solo has left to read in each subject.  Second, we will add up all these numbers and divide them by the number of days he has left to finish reading.  To find out how many pages Solo needs to read per day, we can use the following calculations:  Number of pages left to read in each subject:  Sciences: 4 pages (since he already read 20 pages) Social Studies: 20 - 4 = 16 pages History: 7 - 4 = 3 pages Geography: 8 - 4 = 4 pages Total number of pages left to read: 4 + 16 + 3 + 4 = 27 pages Days left to finish reading: 4 (since he finished 15 pages on Monday) Now, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of days left to finish reading: 27 pages / 4 days = 6.75 pages per day Therefore, Solo needs to read approximately 6.75 pages per day to finish all his subjects within the given time frame.
Response:  We know that John drinks one cup of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) every day, so he drinks 3 cups of water per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, John drinks a total of 3 x 7 = 21 cups of water per week. However, during the weekends, John prefers to relax and drinks a refrigerated beverage instead of water, so we need to subtract this from his daily water intake. Let's assume that he drinks half a liter of a refrigerated beverage each day over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). This means John drinks 0.5 liters x 2 days = 1 liter less water per weekend. Therefore, John's total water consumption for the week is: 21 - 1 = 20 cups of water per week.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many minutes it would take for the fog bank to cover one mile of the city. We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles, so it will take 3 x 10 = 30 minutes to cover one mile. Now, let's calculate how many minutes it would take to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles long. We can multiply the number of minutes it takes to cover one mile by the total distance of the city: 30 minutes/mile x 42 miles = 1260 minutes (or approximately 21 hours). So, it would take approximately 21 hours for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
"Response:  First, we know that Poppy has placed one quarter of the pieces on the board, so she has placed 25% of the pieces (since there are 100 pieces in total).  Now, her mother has added one third of the remaining pieces, which is:  
3/4 x 75 = 3 x 75 = 225 pieces  So, in total, Poppy and her mother have placed:  
25 + 225 = 250 pieces  That means there are still:  
250 - 25 = 225 pieces to be placed."
Response:  If Cody comes three times more cookies than Amir, that means for every one cookie Amir eats, Cody will eat three. So if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody will eat 5 x 3 = 15 cookies. Therefore, together they will eat 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.
Response:  First we need to find out how much space is inside each box.  Since each box has dimensions of 15cm x 15cm x 15cm (length x width x height), and since all sides have an thickness of 1 inch (or 2.54 cm), we can calculate the internal volume of each box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: V = length x width x height.  For each box, this would be:  Box 1: V = 15 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm = 3750 cubic centimeters (or 3.75 liters) Box 2: V = 15 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm = 3750 cubic centimeters (or 3.75 liters) Box 3: V = 15 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm = 3750 cubic centimeters (or 3.75 liters) Now that we know the internal volume of each box, we just need to add them up to get the total internal volume of all three boxes: Total Volume = Box 1 + Box 2 + Box 3 = 3750 + 3750 + 3750 = 11,250 cubic centimeters (or 11.25 liters) So the total internal volume of all three boxes is approximately 11.25 liters.
Response:  First, we know that Frankie watched one hour of his favorite program every night from Monday to Wednesday (3 episodes). On Thursday, he watched some episodes of a 30-minute program (let's call it x episodes), and on Friday, he watched two hours of TV (one episode of his favorite show and another 30-minute program). So, in total, Frankie watched: 3 (Monday-Wednesday) + x (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 7 hours of TV. Now, let's find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Thursday. We know that he watched some episodes of a 30-minute program, so we can write an equation based on that: x + 30 minutes = 7 hours. Solving for x, we get: x = 45 minutes. Therefore, Frankie watched 45 minutes of a 30-minute program on Thursday.
Response:  First, we know that Henry made 15 more biscuits than he intended to make. So if he had intended to make x biscuits, he actually made x + 15.  Next, we know that Henry left 5 biscuits on the tray while they were cooling down. So the total number of biscuits Henry made is x + 15 - 5 = x + 10.  Finally, we are told that Henry wants to double his production from last year. So if he made y biscuits last year, he will make 2y this year.  We can set up an equation based on these facts:  x + 10 = 2y  Solving for x, we get:  x = 2y - 10  Now we need to find out how many biscuits Henry made last year.  The problem states that Henry wants to double his production from last year, so if he made y biscuits last year, he will make 2y biscuits this year. Therefore, we can substitute y for x in the previous equation and solve for y:  y = (2x - 10) / 2  Substituting x = 2y - 10, we get:  y = ((2y - 10) / 2) / 2  Simplifying, we get:  y = (y - 5) / 2  Since Henry made 110 biscuits this year, we can substitute y with 110:  y = (110 - 5) / 2  Simplifying, we get:  y = 55  Therefore, Henry made 55 biscuits last year.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much the person will pay for 10 gallons of gasoline at the local gas station. We know that the price per gallon is $3.00, so:  10 gallons x $3.00/gallon = $30.00  Now, let's calculate the amount of the cashback reward that the person will receive from the application company. We know that the cashback rate is $20.00 per gallon, so:  10 gallons x $20.00/gallon = $200.00  Finally, let's add the cost of the gasoline and the cashback reward to find out how much the person will actually pay after using the application:  $30.00 (cost of gasoline) + $200.00 (cashback reward) = $230.00  So, after using the application, the person will pay $230.00 for 10 gallons of gasoline.
Response:  First, we know that Beatrice had 24 rolls of length and Marcel had 14 rolls of length.  So, if they both ate all their rolls, then Beatrice ate 24 x 2 = 48 rolls in total, and Marcel ate 14 x 2 = 28 rolls in total.  Now, let's find out how many rolls each person ate on average. To do this, we divide the total number of rolls each person ate by the number of rolls they started with. For Beatrice, this is (48 / 2) = 24 rolls per day, and for Marcel, it's (28 / 2) = 14 rolls per day.  Therefore, Beatrice ate an average of 24 rolls per day, and Marcel ate an average of 14 rolls per day.
Response:  First, we know that the boat was taking in two liters of water for every ten feet it traveled. So if it traveled six meters (which is equal to sixty feet), it would have taken in:  2 liters/10 ft x 60 ft = 120 liters  Next, we know that the boat took sixteen seconds to travel from the point where the leak started to the shore. Therefore, the time it took to travel six meters can be calculated as follows:  16 sec / 6 m = 2.67 sec/m  Now we need to find out how much water the boat had taken in when it reached the shore. We know that the coast was 64 seconds away from the point where the leak started. So, the distance the boat traveled before reaching the shore can be calculated as follows:  64 sec - 16 sec = 48 sec  Since we know that the boat traveled at a rate of 2.67 seconds per meter, we can calculate the distance it traveled as follows:  48 sec x 2.67 sec/m = 131.52 meters  Finally, we add this distance to the amount of water the boat took in to find out how much water it had taken in when it reached the shore:  120 liters + 131.52 meters x 2 liters/10 ft = 120 liters + 263.04 liters = 383.04 liters  Therefore, the barco da Julia had taken in 383.04 liters of water when it reached the shore.
Response:  There are 4 professors who use the blackboard and each professor has 2 classes per day. So there will be 8 classes in total. Since the board is cleaned 3 times during each class, the board will be cleaned a total of 8 x 3 = 24 times per day.
Response:  If O Ryan plants two flowers per day, then after one day he will have 2 + 2 = 4 flowers in his garden. After another day, he will have 4 + 2 = 6 flowers. And so on... So, after 15 days, O Ryan will have 2 x 15 = 30 flowers in his garden. However, if 5 of them did not grow, then he will have 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.
"Response:  We know that the number of photographs in Jamal's phone is six times more than the number of photographs in Brittany's phone. So if Brittany has x photographs, Jamal will have 6x photographs.  We also know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's zoo picture. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
50(number of birds in Jamal's zoo picture) = 6x (since Jamal has 6 times as many photos as Brittany)  Now we need to find out how many birds are in Jamal's zoo picture. The problem states that there are ""several"" birds in the picture, but it doesn't give us a specific number. However, since we're looking for a numerical answer, let's assume that there are exactly 20 birds in the picture (this is just a random number I picked).  So now we can substitute 20 for the number of birds in Jamal's zoo picture and solve for x:  
50(20) = 6x 1000 = 6x  Since we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up another equation:  
1800 = 6x + 20 (since there are 20 birds in the picture)  Substituting x from the previous equation into this one gives us:  
1800 = 6(300) + 20  Simplifying and solving for x gives us:  
1800 = 1800 + 20  This equation is true by definition, so we can conclude that x = 300.  Finally, we can use this value of x to find out how many birds are in Jamal's zoo picture:  
There are 300 birds in Jamal's zoo picture."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Sasha spent on each item. For the 2x4s, she spent $10 per board, so she spent $10 x 10 = $100 in total. For the 4x4s, she spent $16 per frame, so she spent $16 x 5 = $80 in total. In total, Sasha spent $100 + $80 = $180. Now let's calculate her profit if she sells all of her items at the current price (which is 50% higher than what she paid). For the 2x4s, she will sell them for $10 x 1.5 = $15 each, so she will make $15 x 10 = $150 in profit. For the 4x4s, she will sell them for $16 x 1.5 = $24 each, so she will make $24 x 5 = $120 in profit. In total, Sasha will make $150 + $120 = $270 in profit.
Response:  We know that Katy used 120 colheres de chá de açúcar and copos de água in all.  Since she used a ratio of 7:13, we can set up a proportion to represent this information:  7x = 13y  where x is the number of colheres de chá de açúcar used and y is the number of copos de água used.  Now we need to find out how many colheres de chá de açúcar were used.  To do this, we can substitute the values we know into the proportion:  7x = 13(120)  Simplifying, we get:  7x = 960  Solving for x, we get:  x = 138  So Katy used 138 colheres de chá de açúcar.
Response:  First, we know that John bought two pairs of shoes for each of his three children. So he bought a total of 3 x 2 = 6 pairs of shoes.  Next, we know that each pair of shoes costs $60. So the total amount John paid is 6 x $60 = $360.
Response:  We know that there were 2 containers of imported vehicles on the first day, and each container had 5 vehicles inside. So, in total, there were 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles on the first day. On the second day, we are told that there were more containers brought in, and the total number of vehicles at the port reached 30. Therefore, if we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day (10) from the total number of vehicles on the second day (30), we can find out how many containers were brought in on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20. So, there were 20 containers brought in on the second day.
Response:  First, we know that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, so his current salary is $40,000 + (40% of $40,000) = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.  Since Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, her current salary is $30,000 + (30% of $30,000) = $30,000 + $9,000 = $39,000.  Therefore, Adrien's current salary is $56,000 and Lylah's current salary is $39,000.
Response:  If Miguel uses two blocks of paper per week and each block has 30 sheets, then he uses 60 sheets of paper per week (2 x 30). Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Miguel uses a total of 60 x 4 = 240 sheets of paper per month.
Response:  First, we know that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges for a total of 13 fruits. Next, we are told that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so Kael brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. Additionally, Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette, so Kael brought 1/2 x 8 = 4 oranges. Therefore, in total, there are 13 + 10 + 4 = 27 fruits.
Response:  First, we know that Sadie slept for eight hours on Monday.  Next, she slept for two fewer hours each of the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), so she slept for eight minus two hours on Tuesday and eight minus four hours on Wednesday.  That gives us:  8 - 2 = 6 (on Tuesday)  8 - 4 = 4 (on Wednesday)  Now, let's consider the rest of the week. We know that Sadie slept one hour more than those two days each day, so she slept six plus one hours on Thursday, four plus one hours on Friday, and seven plus one hours on Saturday and Sunday.  That gives us:  6 + 1 = 7 (on Thursday)  4 + 1 = 5 (on Friday)  7 + 1 = 8 (on Saturday)  8 + 1 = 9 (on Sunday)  So, in total, Sadie slept for:  7 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 30 hours
"Response:  First, we know that Rosie can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers a distance of:  

10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles  
Now, we are told that after running for 3 hours, Rosie slows down to 8 kilometers per hour. So, if she runs for an additional 4 hours (since she ran for 3 hours already), her total distance traveled would be:  

8 kilometers/hour x 4 hours = 32 kilometers  
Therefore, in 7 hours, Rosie can cover a total distance of:  

30 miles + 32 kilometers = 62 kilometers"
"Response:  First, Jennie places stamps on one-third of the cards that need them. So if there are x cards in total, then x/3 will have stamps. Now we know that there are 30 cards in the pile of already stamped cards. So we can set up an equation:  
x/3 = 30  Since there are 60 cards in total (the number of cards that need stamps), we can solve for x:  
2x = 3(60) + 30  
2x = 180 + 30  
2x = 210  
x = 105  
So there were 105 cards in the pile when Jennie began."
Response:  We know that Julia used three of the new colheres to taste her ensopado, so there are 3 less in the package she bought.  If her husband gave her 5 new colheres and she used 3, then there are 5 - 3 = 2 more colheres left in the package he gave her.  Therefore, the number of colheres in the package that Julia bought is 12 - (3 + 2) = 12 - 5 = 7.
Response:  We know that Dylan bought more chicken sausages than fish sausages. So if he bought x chicken sausages and y fish sausages, we can write an equation based on this information.  Since there are 38 chicken sausages in total (chicken + fish), we can set up another equation using the number of fish sausages.  Now let's substitute the values we know into one of these equations to solve for x or y.  After some simple calculations, we get our final answer!
Response:  First, we know that Lily made 50 friends at her new school.  Second, we know that Amy made more than 20 friends at her new school after moving from her old school.  So together, they have made a total of 50 + (more than 20) = 50 + x friends.  Since x is greater than 20, let's say x = 30.  Therefore, Lily and Amy together have 50 + 30 = 80 friends.
Response:  First, we know that one melon costs three times as much as one pepper, so if one melon costs x dollars, then one pepper costs x/3 dollars.  We also know that one orange costs five dollars less than one melon, so one orange costs x - 5 dollars.  Now let's look at how many of each fruit Dillon needs to buy:  He needs four melons, which means he needs 4x dollars worth of melons.  He needs 20 peppers, which means he needs 20(x/3) dollars worth of peppers.  And he needs 10 oranges, which means he needs 10(x - 5) dollars worth of oranges.  To find out the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to add up these amounts:  4x + 20(x/3) + 10(x - 5) =?  Can you solve for x and find out how much Dillon will spend in total?
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time each doctor spends with each patient. Since there are 500 patients per day and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total number of minutes doctors spend with patients is:  
Time spent with patients = Number of patients x Average time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes/day  Next, we need to calculate how much revenue the hospital generates from these visits. We know that each doctor charges $150 per hour and they see patients for an average of 24 minutes, so the total amount earned by each doctor per patient is:  
Revenue generated per patient = Doctor's fee / Time spent with patient = $150 / 24 = $6.25/patient  Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated by all 500 patients: Total revenue generated = Number of patients x Revenue generated per patient = 500 x $6.25 = $3,125/day  Finally, we need to subtract the cost of providing services (doctor's fees) from the total revenue to find out the profit. Profit = Total revenue - Cost of providing services = $3,125 - $150 x 24 = $3,125 - $3,600 = $-475/day or $(-475/500) x 100% = -95%  So, the hospital loses $475 per day or 95% of the total revenue generated from these visits."
Response:  First, we know that 60 workers were hired to make elves.  Then, one-third of them (20) quit after children threw up on them. Next, 10 more quit after being kicked in the legs by children. So, how many elves are left? To find out, subtract the number who quit from the original total: 60 - 20 - 10 = 30. Therefore, there are 30 elves left working at the department store.
Response:  First, we know that in May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than in May. So, if we subtract $60 from $500, we get: Total expenses in May = $500 Total expenses in June = $500 - $60 = $440 Therefore, Joseph's total expenses for both months were: Total expenses for May and June = $500 + $440 = $940
Response:  First, Pam went on the roller coaster twice, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets.  Next, Fred went on the roller coaster four times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets.  Then, both of them went on the luge twice, so they used 2 x 2 = 4 more tickets each.  Therefore, in total, Pam used 12 + 4 = 16 tickets, and Fred used 24 + 4 = 28 tickets.
"Response:  First, we know that Walt walked 6 km on Monday (second day).  Next, we know that he walked six times more kilometers on Tuesday than he did on Monday. So if he walked x km on Monday, he walked 6x km on Tuesday.  Now, let's add up all of the distances traveled from Monday to Wednesday:  
Monday: 6 km + Tuesday: 6x km + Wednesday:? km = Total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday.  We are given that the total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles or 64 km. Since there are 1.60934 kilometers per mile, we can convert the distance as follows:  
Total distance = 64 km + 6x km = 64 km + 6(64 km/1.60934 km/mile) = 64 km + 6(102.57812 km) = 64 km + 602.57812 km = 662.57812 km  Therefore, Walt walked 662.57812 km on Wednesday."
Response:  If Tom receives 4 car washes per month and each car wash costs $15, how much does he pay in total per month?  To find out, we can multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each one:  4 car washes x $15/car wash = $60 per month  Now let's calculate how much Tom pays per year:  $60 per month x 12 months = $720 per year
Response:  First, we know that Brian has 20 games minus 5 = 15 games left after losing 5 games.  Now, if Brian had 15 games and Bobby has 3 times as many games as Brian, then Bobby would have 3 x 15 = 45 games.  But wait! We also know that Bobby has 5 fewer games than Brian, so Bobby actually has 45 - 5 = 40 games.  Therefore, Bobby has 40 games in total.
"Response:  We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world and two-thirds of them are female. So, if we divide 27 by three (since one-third is in Scotland), we get: 

27 / 3 = 9

Now, since two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can multiply 9 by two to find out how many females there are: 

9 x 2 = 18

So, there are 18 female unicorns in Scotland."
Response:  First we need to calculate the total cost of each item:  Sandwiches: 2 x $7.50 = $15.00 Batata Fries: 2 x $1.50 = $3.00 Biscuits: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00 Total Cost: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00 Now let's add the delivery fee (20%) which is calculated as follows: Delivery Fee: $20.00 x 20% = $4.00 So the final total cost will be: Final Total Cost: $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00 And finally, she wants to add an extra $5.00 for a grand total of: Grand Total: $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00
Response:  First, we know that Mark completed the first test of 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. So he spent 75/5 = 15 hours to complete the first test.  Since he had 8 hours to complete the first test, he must have left 8 - 15 = 3 hours worth of questions unanswered.  Now let's look at the second test of 100 questions. If he completes it at the same rate as the first test (5 questions per hour), then he will spend 100/5 = 20 hours to complete the second test.  However, since he only has 6 hours to complete the second test, he must leave 20 - 6 = 14 hours worth of questions unanswered.  Therefore, Mark left 3 + 14 = 17 hours worth of questions unanswered in total.
Response:  We know that there are four times as many pink balls as blue balls. So if we have 12 blue balls (given), we can find out how many pink balls there are by multiplying 12 by 4.  12 x 4 = 48  Therefore, there are 48 pink balls.
Response:  We know that there are 20 cars available for rental and we have information about their transmission types.  Firstly, let's calculate how many cars are automatic: 12 x 2 = 24 (since each automatic car has two gears). Now, let's calculate how many cars are manual: 4 x 2 = 8 (since each manual car also has two gears). Finally, let's calculate how many cars are semi-automatic: 20 - (24 + 8) = 20 - 32 = 8. So, there are 8 semi-automatic cars among the 20 available. To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars: 8 / 20 x 100% = 40%. Therefore, 40% of the cars are semi-automatic.
Response:  We know that there are 700 abelhas in total.  Of those, we know that half (or 350) are bebes de abelhas.  Since each bebe de abelha is surrounded by two operarias (according to the problem), we can say that there are twice as many operaias as bebes de abelhas.  Therefore, the number of operaias is 2 x 350 = 700.  So, there are 700 operaias in the colmeia.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games per week.  If he plays for 2 hours every day, that's 14 hours per week (2 x 7 = 14).  Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job.  If he earns $10 per hour and works for 5 hours per week (5 x $10 = $50), then his total weekly earnings from his job are $50.  Now, let's subtract the amount of time Jordan spends playing video games from his total weekly hours worked.  14 - 5 = 9  So, Jordan has 9 hours left after working and playing video games.  We can multiply this number by his hourly wage from his job ($10) to find out how much extra money he could make if he spent those 9 hours working instead of gaming.  9 x $10 = $90  Therefore, if Jordan spent his 9 hours of free time each week working instead of playing video games, he would earn an additional $90 per week.
Response:  First we need to calculate how much each item costs without tax and then add up all of those amounts to find out how much everything costs in total before tax.  Next, we can multiply that amount by 1.1 (the tax rate) to find out how much everything costs with tax.  Here are the calculations for each item: Leite: $2 x 1 = $2 Copos: $3 x 1 = $3 Lâmpadas: $3 x 1 = $3 Armadilhas: $4 x 1 = $4 Total cost without tax: $2 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $12 Now let's calculate the total cost with tax: $12 x 1.1 = $13.20 So the total cost of all items is $13.20.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total revenue for each week. Total revenue = number of clients x price per client. Since there are 3 clients already confirmed and 5 potential clients, the total revenue can be calculated as follows: Total revenue = 3 clients x $2 (price per client) + 5 clients x $2 (price per client) Total revenue = $6 + $10 Total revenue = $16 Now, let's calculate the total cost for each week. The only expense is the cost of the cleaning supplies, which is $2 per bottle of Lixivia and $5 per pack of rags. Total cost = 3 clients x $2 (cost per client) + 5 clients x $2 (cost per client) Total cost = $6 + $10 Total cost = $16 Likewise, the profit for each week can be calculated as follows: Profit = total revenue - total cost Profit = $16 - $16 Profit = $0 Therefore, Lucas will not make any profit in the first week. However, he has the potential to make a profit if he can secure more clients or increase the prices of his services.
"Response:  We know that there are 10 hectares of land and each hectare has 100 abacaxis, so we have in total: 

10 x 100 = 1000 abacaxis per hectare.  Since John can harvest his abacaxis every 3 months, he will be able to collect: 

1000 x 4 (harvests per year) = 4000 abacaxis per year."
Response:  First, we know that the first set of Lego has 500 pieces, so if Johnny picks up all the pieces from this set, he will have 500 blocks.  Next, we are told that the second set of Lego has three times as many pieces as the first set, so it has 500 x 3 = 1500 pieces.  If Johnny picks up all the pieces from this set, he will have 1500 blocks.  Finally, we are told that the third set of Lego has one-fourth the number of pieces as the second set, so it has 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces.  If Johnny picks up all the pieces from this set, he will have 375 blocks in total.  So, the final answer is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 blocks.
Response:  First, we know that 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours. Since half of them returned in the next 6 hours, there were 30/2 = 15 bees who did not return. Now, if all 15 bees return to the hive within the last 6 hours of the day, then the total number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is 15 + (2 x 30) = 15 + 60 = 75. Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
Response:  First, we know that the cost of admission for an adult is $12 and for a child is $10.  Second, we know that the mother gave the cashier $8 in total.  Finally, we want to find out how much money the mother received back from the cashier.  To do this, we need to subtract the amount she paid ($8) from the total cost of the two tickets (adult + child).  So, let's calculate: Adult ticket = $12 Child ticket = $10 Total cost = $12 + $10 = $22 Subtracting $8 from $22 gives us: $22 - $8 = $14 Therefore, the mother received $14 in change from the cashier.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends.  We also know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so if Dorothy has x friends, James has 4x friends.  Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up an equation based on this information:  3x = 12  Now solve for x to find out how many friends Dorothy has:  x = 12 / 3 x = 4 So Dorothy has 4 friends.  Now we can use this value of x to find out how many friends James has:  4x = 12 \* 4 x = 48 Therefore, James has 48 friends.
"Response:  First we need to find out how long it takes Steve to get to school on his bike. We know that he can go at 440 feet per minute, so if he has to travel 5 kilometers (which is equal to 5000 meters), it will take him:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = 5000 / 440  
Time = 11 minutes and 30 seconds  
Now we need to find out how long it takes Tim to get to school on his skateboard. We know that he can go at 264 feet per minute, so if he has to travel 3 kilometers (which is equal to 3000 meters), it will take him:  
Time = Distance / Speed  
Time = 3000 / 264  
Time = 11 minutes and 9 seconds  
Since Steve takes longer to get to school than Tim, the winner will have to wait for Steve at home before Tim finishes the race. Therefore, the answer is:  
Waiting time = Time of slower person + Time difference between them  
Waiting time = 11 minutes and 30 seconds + (11 minutes and 9 seconds - 11 minutes and 30 seconds)  
Waiting time = 11 minutes and 30 seconds + 2 minutes and 3 seconds  
Waiting time = 13 minutes and 3 seconds"
"Response:  First, we know that each person who came to inflate their tires paid $0.25 for each tire. So if 5 people came with bicycles and 3 people came with tricycles (since they have more than one tire), then the total amount of money earned is:  
$0.25 x 5 = $1.25 from bicycle riders $0.25 x 3 = $0.75 from tricycle riders Total earnings = $1.25 + $0.75 = $2.00 per day."
Response:  First, we know that Carl bought ten packages of cookies, and each package contains six cookies. So, in total, Carl bought 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.  Next, we know that each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of all the cookies is 60 x $0.10 = $6.00.  Finally, since Carl paid with a $10 bill, he received $10 - $6.00 = $4.00 in change.
Response:  First, Dave ate 14 batatas fritas before the seagull stole the package. Then, the seagull ate half of what was left (since there were still 14 - 14 = 0 batatas fritas). So, after the seagull ate, there were 14 - 7 = 7 batatas fritas remaining. Next, three pigeons came and each ate three batatas fritas, leaving 7 - 3 x 3 = 7 - 9 = 8 batatas fritas. Finally, a raccoon took two-thirds of what remained (2/3 of 8), which is 2/3 x 8 = 5/3 = 16/3 = 5 batatas fritas. Therefore, when Dave bought the bag of potatoes, there were 5 batatas fritas in it.
Response:  First, we know that there are 16 weeks in a semester. Next, we need to determine how many hours of class time Kimo has each week. We can start with the days he has classes: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (he doesn't have classes on Wednesdays). Now, let's count how many hours he spends in class each day:  * Mondays: 3 hours (1 hour x 3 periods)  * Tuesdays: 3 hours (1 hour x 3 periods)  * Thursdays: 4 hours (2 hours x 2 periods)  * Fridays: 3 hours (1 hour x 3 periods) Total weekly class time: 13 hours (3 + 3 + 4 + 3) Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, multiply the total weekly class time by 16 to get the total number of class hours for the semester: 13 hours/week x 16 weeks = 208 hours So, Kimo attends 208 hours of classes per semester.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many meters of each product Bill has in total.  Then we can calculate how long it would take him to arrange them all end to end.  Here are the calculations:  
Rolos (10 cm x 300): Total length = 3000 cm or 3 km  
Croissants (20 cm x 120): Total length = 2400 cm or 2.4 km  
Baguettes (60 cm x 60): Total length = 36000 cm or 36 km  
Now let's add up the total length of all products:  
Total length = 3000 + 2400 + 36000 = 42400 cm or 42.4 km  
Finally, we divide the total length by the length of one item to find out how many times Bill could place them end to end:  
42400 / 10 = 4240 rolls  
4240 / 20 = 212 croissants  
36000 / 60 = 600 baguettes  
So, if Bill places all his products end to end, he will have:  
4240 rolls, 212 croissants, and 600 baguettes."
Response:  First, we know that the total number of bananas needed per month is 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas. Since they need to last for two months, we multiply this amount by 2 to get 1400 bananas. Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas every two months.
Response:  First, we know that the length of the field is 100 meters. We also know that Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he covers a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters.  Now, let's look at Kelly's runs. She runs to the end line (40 yards) and back once, which means she covers a distance of 40 + 40 = 80 yards. Since there are 91.44 meters in an American football field (40 yards), this means she covers a distance of 80 / 91.44 = 0.876 meters.  Since Kelly only runs once, she covers a distance of 0.876 meters.  Now, let's compare the distances covered by Blake and Kelly. Blake covers 1500 meters, while Kelly covers 0.876 meters. So, the difference between their distances is:  1500 - 0.876 = 1499.124 meters.  Therefore, the winner (Blake) covers 1499.124 more meters than the loser (Kelly).
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much Raphael spent on canetas and cadernos. We know that he bought 4 canetas at $1.5 each, so:  
4 x $1.5 = $6 Now we add this amount to the cost of the cadernos:  
2 x $4 = $8 So far, Raphael has spent: $6 + $8 = $14 Next, let's calculate the cost of the border of paper. We know that it costs $20. Therefore, we add this amount to what Raphael has already spent: $14 + $20 = $34 In conclusion, Raphael spent $34 in total."
Response:  First, we know that there were originally 11 girinos in the lake. Then, six of them left their hiding place under the blanket, so now there are 11 - 6 = 5 girinos left in the lake. Next, two more girinos were found hidden under a stone, so now there are 5 + 2 = 7 girinos remaining in the lake. Therefore, the final answer is 7.
Response:  First, we know that on Tuesday (the third day), the tank had 2 meters more water than it did on Monday (the second day). So, if the tank had 5 meters of water on Monday, then it had 5 + 2 = 7 meters of water on Tuesday.  Next, we know that on Wednesday (the fourth day), the tank had two-thirds of the amount of water it had on Tuesday. So, if the tank had 7 meters of water on Tuesday, then it had 7 x 2/3 = 4.67 meters of water on Wednesday.  Therefore, the depth of water in the tank on Wednesday is approximately 4.67 meters.
Response:  First, we know that Anakin caught 3 fish-palhaços.  Second, we know that Locsin caught fewer stars than Anakin, so she caught 5 - 10 = 5 stars. Third, we know that Locsin caught fewer sea horses than Anakin, so she caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Fourth, we know that Locsin caught more fish-palhaços than Anakin, so she caught 3 + 2 = 5 fish-palhaços. Finally, we add up all the catches: Anakin caught 3 fish-palhaços, Locsin caught 5 stars, 3 sea horses, and 5 fish-palhaços for a total of 3 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 16. Therefore, they caught a total of 16 fish.
"Response:  If the price increases by 20% every two months, then after one month, the price will increase by 10%. So, if the initial price is $20, the price after one month will be:  
$20 x 1.10 = $22  
After two months, the price will increase again by another 20%, so the price will be:  
$22 x 1.20 = $26.40  
And after three years (36 months), the price will be:  
$26.40 x 1.20^36 = $875.92  
Therefore, a bag of balls would cost $875.92 after 36 months."
Response:  First, we know that one figure of action costs $5 and one car costs $4. So if we want to buy all the cars and figures, it would cost us:  5 x $5 = $25 + 5 x $4 = $20 = $45.  Now, we are told that the boneca costs 3 figures of action, so we can calculate how much the boneca costs:  3 x $5 = $15.  Therefore, the total value of all the brinquedos is: $45 + $15 = $60.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much time Jackie will spend doing her taxes if she does them herself.  We know that she can earn $35 per hour working as a freelancer and that it takes her 3 hours to do her taxes. So, the opportunity cost of doing her taxes herself is:  
Opportunity Cost = $35 x 3 hours = $105  
Now let's calculate how much Jackie would pay for a contabilista. The contabilista charges $90.  
So, the total cost of hiring a contabilista is:  
Total Cost = $90  
Now we need to compare the two options: doing her taxes herself versus hiring a contabilista. To do this, we need to subtract the opportunity cost from the total cost:  
Doing Taxes Herself = Total Cost - Opportunity Cost  
Hiring Contabilista = Total Cost  
Let's evaluate both options: Doing Taxes Herself:  
Doing Taxes Herself = $90 - $105 = -$15 (loss)  
Hiring Contabilista:  
Hiring Contabilista = $90  
Since option B (hiring a contabilista) results in a positive outcome ($90), while option A (doing taxes herself) results in a negative outcome (-$15), Jackie should hire a contabilista."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Elvira spent on all the computer accessories she bought: 
Scanner - 157 euros 
Gravador de CD - 74 euros 
Impressora - 102 euros  Total = 333 euros Now let's subtract the total amount spent from her budget of 1500 euros:  
1500 euros - 333 euros = 1167 euros So, after buying all the computer accessories, Elvira will have 1167 euros left for buying clothes."
Response:  First, we know that each Spanish omelette requires 3 eggs.  Since there are 9 eggs in the basket given to Sandra each time she takes care of her daughter, and since she needs 3 eggs for one omelette, she can make 3 omelettes with one basket of eggs. Therefore, if she wants to make 15 Spanish omelettes (flans), she will need 15 baskets of eggs.  So, the number of times Sandra has to go to the neighbor's house to get eggs is 15.
Response:  We know that Brooke is 2 years older than Seth. So if Brooke is 28 now, Seth must be 28 - 2 = 26 years old.
Response:  If Ethel has $8, then she has half of what Jimmy has because he has twice as much money as her. So, if Ethel has $8, then Jimmy has $16 (twice $8).  Therefore, Jimmy has $16.
Response:  First, we know that Pancho walks 30 kilometers per day, except for weekends. So, if it is not a weekend, he walks 30 km. If it is a weekend, he walks 16 km. Now, let's calculate the total distance walked by Pancho in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so: Total distance = 7 x 30 km + 2 x 16 km We can simplify this expression as follows: Total distance = 7 x 30 km + 2 x 16 km = 7 x 30 km + 32 km Total distance = 490 km + 32 km Total distance = 522 km Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 522 kilometers in one week.
Response:  First, we know that each hat costs $25. Next, we know that the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so if the hat costs $25, then the jacket will cost $25 x 3 = $75. Finally, since the pants cost the average of the prices of the hat and the jacket, they will cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $45. Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $45 (pants) = $145.
Response:  First, we know that each spider has 8 legs (patas), so if there are 80 spiders, then there are 80 x 8 = 640 legs from the spiders alone. Next, we know that each insect has 6 legs, and there are 90 insects, so there are 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. Finally, we know that each of the three invertebrate mutants has 10 legs, so there are 3 x 10 = 30 legs from these creatures as well. Therefore, the total number of legs that Jake sees is:  640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.
Response:  First, we know that Sally Three is three years older than Sally Two. So if Sally Two is x years old, then Sally Three is x + 3 years old.  Next, we know that the grandmother (Avó Vermelha) is twice as old as Sally Three. So the grandmother is 2(x + 3) years old.  Now, we are given that Sally Four has the same age as Sally Twenty-Two. So Sally Four is also x years old.  Finally, we know that Sally Twenty-Two is eight years old.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on these statements:  Sally Two = x  Sally Three = x + 3  Grandmother = 2x + 6  Sally Four = x  Sally Twenty-Two = 8  We can solve this system of equations to find the ages of each bird.  To start, let's substitute the value of Sally Four into the equation for the grandmother:  Grandmother = 2x + 6  Substituting Sally Four = x, we get:  Grandmother = 2x + 6 = 2x + 6  Now, let's substitute the value of Sally Twenty-Two into the equation for Sally Two:  Sally Two = x  Substituting Sally Twenty-Two = 8, we get:  Sally Two = x = 8 - 3  Since Sally Two is three years younger than Sally Three, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the previous equation:  Sally Three = x + 3 = 8 - 3 + 3 = 11  Now we have found the ages of all four birds:  Sally Two = 8 - 3 = 5  Sally Three = 11  Sally Four = x = 5  Grandmother = 2x + 6 = 2(5) + 6 = 11
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month for her debts.  For the student loans, she needs to pay at least $300 per month.  For the credit card, she needs to pay at least $200 per month.  And for the mortgage, she needs to pay at least $500 per month.  Total minimum payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000 per month.  Now, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she will pay 1.5 times the minimum amount.  So, her total monthly payment would be:  1.5 x $1,000 = $1,500 per month.  To find out how much Jessica pays in one year, we can multiply her monthly payment by 12 months:  12 x $1,500 = $18,000 per year.
"Response:  First, Billy needs to spend one and a half minutes (1.5 minutes) to peel each of the 60 potatoes. Therefore, he will spend a total of:  

1.5 minutes x 60 potatoes = 90 minutes (or 1 hour and 30 minutes) just peeling the potatoes.  Next, he only takes 5 seconds to cut each potato, so he will spend:  

5 seconds x 60 potatoes = 300 seconds (or 5 minutes) cutting all the potatoes.  In total, Billy will spend:  

90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes (or 1 hour and 35 minutes) preparing all the potatoes for his big family gathering."
Response:  First, we know that they sold 20 cups of lemonade per gallon and each cup costs $0.50. So, the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade is: Revenue = Number of cups x Price per cup = 20 x $0.50 = $10 per gallon. Since they made a profit of $25, we can set up an equation to represent this information: Profit = Total revenue - Cost of goods sold (COGS) We know the cost of lemons and sugar separately, so let's calculate COGS first: COGS = Number of lemons x Cost per lemon + Number of cups x Cost per cup (sugar) Using the given information, we get: COGS = 20 x $3/lemon + 20 x $2/cup (sugar) = $60 + $40 = $100 Now, we can substitute the value of COGS into our previous equation for profit: Profit = $100 - $100 = $0 Since they made a profit of $25, their actual cost of goods sold must have been less than what they calculated using the prices of lemons and sugar. To find out how much less, let's subtract the COGS from the profit: Actual COGS = Profit - $25 = $0 - $25 = -$25 So, Juan and Carlos actually spent $25 less on lemons and sugar than what they had calculated. Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is: Amount spent on lemons = Actual COGS / Cost per lemon = (-$25) / $3/lemon = -8 lemons
Response:  We know that there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese. That means there are 160 non-Japanese Asians (240 - 80 = 160). Since the rest of the Asians are Chinese, we can say that there are 160 Chinese Asians (160 - 80 = 80). Now, we know that 60 of these Chinese Asians are boys. So, if we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese Asians, we get the number of girls: 80 - 60 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Zaid spends on rent, gasoline, and charity donations.  Rent is $1/4 of his salary, so that's $600 (1/4 x $6000). Gasoline is $1/3 of his salary, so that's $2000 (1/3 x $6000). Charity donation is half of what's left, which is $3000 (half of $6000 - $600 + $2000 = $3000).  Now let's add up all these expenses: $600 + $2000 + $3000 = $5800. So Zaid has spent $5800 out of his $6000 monthly salary.  Next, we need to subtract the amount he gave to his daughter ($200) and wife ($700), since those are not expenses but rather transfers to family members.  That leaves us with $5800 - $900 = $4900. Therefore, after all expenses and donations, Zaid still has $4900 remaining from his monthly salary of $6000.
Response:  First, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monica, so if Monica has x crabs, Rani has x + 10 crabs.  Next, we know that Monica has four fewer crabs than Bo, so if Bo has y crabs, Monica has y - 4 crabs. Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  Rani has x + 10 crabs and Monica has y - 4 crabs, so together they have x + 10 + (y - 4) =?  We also know that Bo has 40 crabs, so we can add that to our equation:  x + 10 + (y - 4) + 40 =?  Simplifying the equation, we get:  x + y = 54  So the three of them together have 54 crabs.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Lloyd earned in each week:  Week 1: 5 hours x $10/hour = $50 Week 2: 8 hours x $10/hour = $80 Total amount earned in two weeks: $50 + $80 = $130
Response:  We know that there are two candidates running for class representative in Sarai School and one of them got 3/4 of the votes. The total number of students who voted was 80. To find out how many votes the loser received, we can subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes cast. So, the calculation would be: Number of votes the loser received = Total number of votes cast - Number of votes the winner received. Substituting the given values, we get: Number of votes the loser received = 80 - (3/4) x 80. Simplifying, we get: Number of votes the loser received = 80 - 60. Therefore, the loser received 20 votes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white carnations. So if she ordered x white carnations, she ordered 4x red roses. We also know that she ordered 200 lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, she ordered 5(200) = 1000 lilies. Now, let's calculate how many red roses Sandra needs to receive until 17h. Since she wants four times more red roses than white carnations, and she received x white carnations, she will need 4x = 4(x) = 4x white carnations. To deliver these flowers before 17h, Fred must deliver all 4x white carnations plus the 1000 lilies. Therefore, Fred has to deliver 4x + 1000 = 4x + 1000 flowers until 17h. Solving for x, we get: 4x + 1000 = 4(1000) = 4000 - 1000 = 3000. Thus, Fred has to deliver 3000 flowers until 17h to keep Sandra's business.
Response:  First, we know that Jean is two years older than Jan. So if Jan is x years old, then Jean is x + 2 years old.  Next, we know that two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jan's age. So if Jan was x years old two years ago, then Mark was (x / 2) + 5 years old.  Now we need to find out how old Jan is now. We are given that she is 30 years old. So we can set up an equation based on this information:  x + 2 = 30  Solving for x, we get:  x = 28  Therefore, Jan is currently 28 years old. And since Jean is two years older than Jan, Jean is also 28 + 2 = 30 years old.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how long it will take for each member of the second team to run their respective laps. We know that the first runner will take 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 57 seconds (since they are 3 seconds faster), the third runner will take 54 seconds (since they are 6 seconds faster), and the fourth runner will take 51 seconds (since they are 9 seconds faster). Now let's add up all these times to get the total time for the second team:  
Total time for second team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 268 seconds  Since each member of the first team runs in exactly 55 seconds, we can calculate the total time for the first team as follows: Total time for first team = 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds  Therefore, the difference between the total time for the two teams is: Difference = 268 - 220 = 48 seconds  So, the more well-rounded team will win by approximately 48 seconds."
Response:  To launch a number greater than 3, we need to throw a number from 4 to 6. There are four numbers in this range.  To throw two even numbers in a row, we must throw an even number and then another even number. There are three even numbers in total (2, 4, 6). So, the probability of throwing a number greater than 3 is:   Probability = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = (4) / (6) = 0.67 or 67%.  Similarly, the probability of throwing two even numbers in a row is:   Probability = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes) = (3) / (6) = 0.5 or 50%.  Therefore, the probability of Jerry throwing a number greater than 3 is higher than the probability of him throwing two even numbers in a row.
Response:  If Jenna received half of what her mother received, then she received 20/2 = 10 maçãs.  Therefore, they together received 20 + 10 = 30 maçãs.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 gaiolas of hamsters and each hamster receives 5 pieces of hay. Therefore, the total number of pieces of hay given to the hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.  Next, we know that there are 3 gaiolas of rats and each rat receives 6 pieces of hay. Therefore, the total number of pieces of hay given to the rats is 3 x 6 = 18.  Finally, we know that there are 20 pieces of hay distributed among the rabbits in the canil. So, the total number of pieces of hay distributed throughout the loja is 50 + 18 + 20 = 88.  Now, let's find out how many rats are in each gaiola. We know that there are 3 gaiolas of rats and each gaiola has an equal number of rats. Therefore, if there are x rats in each gaiola, then there will be 3x rats in total.  Since there are 88 pieces of hay distributed throughout the loja, and each rat gets 6 pieces of hay, then we can set up the equation:  3x = 88 / 6  Solving for x, we get:  x = 14  Therefore, there are 14 rats in each gaiola.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest will be accrued over three months at a rate of 2% per month.  To do this, we can use the formula for simple interest: Principal x Rate x Time = Interest.  In this case, the principal is $100 (the amount borrowed), the rate is 2%/month (the monthly interest rate), and the time is 3 months.  So, the interest accrued would be:  
$100 x 2%/month x 3 months = $6.00  Now that we have calculated the interest, we need to add it to the original principal to find out how much Mandy needs to pay Benedict after three months.  So, the total amount due would be:  
$100 + $6.00 = $106.00  Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.00 after three months if they agreed on a 2% monthly interest rate."
Response:  First, we know that the merchant made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a price of $30 each. So, if he sold x bags, his total revenue would be 30x dollars.  Since he paid $20 per bag to the farmer, his cost would be 20x dollars.  To make a profit of $400, his revenue must be greater than his cost by $400.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:  30x - 20x = 400  Simplifying the equation:  10x = 400  Dividing both sides by 10:  x = 40  So, the merchant sold 40 bags of wheat.
"Response:  First, we know that they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food than what was printed on the tickets. So, let's subtract $4.50 from $20.25 to find out how much they spent on food:  
$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75 (food) Now, we know that they also went on two different rides that cost $33 each. So, let's add up all their expenses:  
$15.75 + $33 + $33 = $81.75 (total expenses) Since they agreed to divide all costs equally among themselves, each person paid:  
$81.75 / 3 = $27.25 (each person paid)"
Response:  First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. That means he collects peaches for 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Next, we know that John can catch 2 peaches per minute. So, in total, John catches 180 x 2 = 360 peaches.
Response:  First, we know that each pato needs to eat 1.5 kilograms of insects per week. Since there are ten patos, we can multiply this amount by ten to find out how much they need to eat in total. So, the daily amount would be:  10 x 1.5 = 15 kilograms of insects per day.
Response:  First, we know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees per year. So after 10 years, he will have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees and cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, he will have a total of 100 - 20 = 80 trees. Now, since 30% of the trees die, he will be left with 80 x 0.7 = 56 trees.
Response:  First, there were 18 flamingos of plastic pink in the front yard of Sue's house (on Friday morning). Then, one-third of these flamingos (6) were taken back and painted white (on Saturday morning), so there were 12 flamingos of plastic pink left. Next, 18 more flamingos of plastic pink were added to the collection (on Sunday morning), bringing the total number of flamingos to 30. Therefore, at midday on Sunday, there were 30 - 12 = 18 flamingos of plastic pink in the front yard of Sue's house, which is more than the 12 flamingos of plastic white.
"Response:  First, we know that Violetta needs 5 different colored pens and each pen costs $2. So, if she has $20 to spend, how many pens can she buy?  We can start by dividing $20 by $2 (the cost of one pen):  
$20 ÷ $2 = 10  
That means Violetta can buy 10 pens! But wait, she wants 5 different colors, so she will need to choose 5 of those pens in different colors. How many pens of each color can she buy?  If she buys 10 pens in total, and she chooses 5 different colors, then she can buy:  
10 pens / 5 colors = 2 pens per color  
So, Violetta can buy 2 pens of each of the 5 colors she chose. Now let's calculate the amount of money she will receive as change:  
2 pens x $2/pen = $4/color  
Since she needs 5 colors, her total change will be:  
$4/color x 5 colors = $20  
Therefore, Violetta will receive $20 in change!"
Response:  We know that one pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser together. So if we want to find out how much eight pens cost, we need to find out first how much one pen costs.  One pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser together, so we can write:  Pen = Pencil + Eraser  Now we know that one pencil costs R$ 1,20 and one eraser costs R$ 0,30, so we can substitute these values into our equation:  Pen = Pencil + Eraser  Pen = R$ 1,20 + R$ 0,30  Pen = R$ 1,50  Therefore, one pen costs R$ 1,50.  To find out how much eight pens cost, we can simply multiply the cost of one pen by 8:  Eight pens = 8 x R$ 1,50  Eight pens = R$ 12,00
Response:  First, we know that there are 200 kilograms of carrots in total. Second, each restaurant will receive 1 kilogram of carrots. So, if we divide 200 by 40, we get: 200 / 40 = 5 Each restaurant will receive 5 kilograms of carrots. Now, let's calculate how many kilograms of carrots won't be used: 200 - (40 x 5) = 200 - 200 = 0 There won't be any leftover carrots! All 200 kilograms will be distributed among the 40 restaurants.
"Response:  First, we know that there are 23786 inhabitants in Soda.  Second, we know that the number of men is 8417 and the number of women is 9092. Third, we can assume that all children are included in the ""rest of the population"" category. Therefore, to find out how many children there are in Soda, we need to subtract the total number of men and women from the total population.  So, let's do it!  Total population = 8417 + 9092 + x (where x is the number of children)  We know that the sum of the numbers of men and women is equal to the total population:  8417 + 9092 = 23786  Simplifying the equation:  17519 = 23786  Now, we can solve for x (the number of children):  x = 23786 - 17519  x = 6267  Therefore, there are 6267 children in Soda."
"Response:  First month, Elaine collected 3 times 20 = 60 cards. Second month, she collected less than 60 cards because ""she collected 20 fewer cards"" means that she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Third month, she collected double the number of cards she collected in the first two months, which is 2 x (40 + 60) = 2 x 100 = 200 cards. Therefore, Elaine has a total of 60 + 40 + 200 = 300 cards."
Response:  First, we know that Mark edits 1000 frases per week for both editors A and B. We also know that editor A pays Mark $0.05 per phrase, so he pays $50 (5 x 1000) per week to Mark. Editor B pays twice as much as editor A, so he pays $2 x 1000 = $2000 per week to Mark. Therefore, Mark earns in one week: $50 + $2000 = $2050.
Response:  First, we know that Baldur receives 5 baldes of water in the morning and 6 baldes of water in the evening.  Since each balde contains 5 liters of water, we can calculate how much water he receives in total for both times of day.  In the morning, he receives 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water.  In the evening, he receives 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water.  Therefore, Baldur receives a total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water every day.
Response:  First, we know that John received a prize of $ 5000 and an increase of 5% in his salary. So, if he earned $ 2000 per week before receiving the prize, after receiving the prize, his new salary would be:  Old Salary = $ 2000 x 100 + 5% of $ 2000 = $ 2000 x 100 + $ 100 = $ 2100  Now, let's calculate how much money John made in one year with this new salary:  New Salary x Number of Weeks in One Year = $ 2100 x 52 = $ 109,200  Since John received the prize at the beginning of the year, all 52 weeks of the year will have the increased salary of $ 2100. Therefore, John's total earnings for the year are:  Total Earnings = $ 109,200 + $ 5000 = $ 114,200
Response:  First, we know that each hectare produces 5 toneladas of grapes per year. Since there are 10 hectares in total, the total number of toneladas produced is 10 x 5 = 50 toneladas. Next, we know that each tonelada of grapes produces 2 barris of wine. Therefore, the total number of barris produced is 50 x 2 = 100 barris. So, the answer is 100 barris of wine per year.
Response:  First, we know that he used 2 fatias of cheese per sandwich for lunch every day this week, so that's 7 x 2 = 14 fatias of cheese just for lunch.  Next, we know that he made omelets with cheese and eggs three times a week, using one more slice of cheese per omelet than per sandwich, so that's 3 x (1 + 1) = 9 fatias of cheese for the omelets.  Finally, we know that he used 8 slices of cheese in his big pasta dish for several dinner meals, so that's another 8 fatias of cheese.  In total, then, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 fatias de queijo.
Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so she had a total of 32 pens.  Next, we know that she bought 6 bags of blue pens and each bag contained 9 pens, so she bought 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens.  She also bought 2 bags of red pens and each bag contained 6 pens, so she bought 2 x 6 = 12 red pens.  In total, Janet now has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total score of Brinley in the first five tests:  Total = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458 Next, we need to subtract the lowest score (71) from the total to get the adjusted total: Adjusted Total = 458 - 71 = 387 Now, we divide the adjusted total by six (the number of tests): Average = 387 / 6 = 64.5 So, Brinley needs to obtain at least 64 points in the sixth test to have an average of 93.
Response:  First, we know that Michael rode his bike five times a week for four weeks, so he rode 5 x 4 = 20 times in total.  Each time, he rode 25 kilometers, so he traveled a total of 20 x 25 = 500 kilometers.  Next, we know that he reduced his rides to two times a week for three weeks, so he rode 2 x 3 = 6 times in total.  Each time, he rode 60 kilometers, so he traveled a total of 6 x 60 = 360 kilometers.  Therefore, Michael traveled a total distance of 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.
Response:  We know that each bar of chocolate weighs twice as much as each confited apple. So if each bar of chocolate weighs 40 grams, then each confited apple weighs 40/2 = 20 grams. Since there are 80 confited apples in total, the weight of all the confited apples is 80 x 20 = 1600 grams or 1.6 kilograms. Now, let's calculate the weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars in total, and each one weighs 40 grams, so the total weight of all the chocolate bars is 25 x 40 = 1000 grams or 1 kilogram. Therefore, the total weight of Joe's candy bag is 1.6 + 1 = 2.6 kilograms (or approximately 2 pounds and 3 ounces).
Response:  On Monday (second day), she bought 4 buns.  On Wednesday (third day), she bought three times more buns than on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 buns.  On Friday (fourth day), she bought five times more buns than on Wednesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 buns.  In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 buns after all three days.
Response:  First, we know that half a dozen plates cost $6,000 each, so one plate costs $6,000 / 2 = $3,000.  Now, we are told that twenty-five cups of coffee cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.  So, the cost of twenty-five cups of coffee is $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800.  Therefore, the cost of each cup of coffee is $1,800 / 25 = $72.
Response:  First, we know that Sara has $10 already saved up.  She wants to buy a coat for $30 and two pairs of shoes at $20 each, so she needs a total of $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.  Since she gets paid $5 per time she takes care of the kids, she will need to take care of them four times to earn enough money to buy everything.  So, she needs to take care of the kids 4 x 5 = 20 times.
Response:  We know that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day and has more white hens than red ones. So let's say he has x white hens and y red hens, where x > y (since he has more white hens). Now we can set up an equation based on what we know:  1) White hens lay 5 eggs/day each = 5x eggs/day  2) Red hens lay 3 eggs/day each = 3y eggs/day  3) Total number of eggs collected daily = 42 eggs/day  4) Total number of eggs from white hens + total number of eggs from red hens = 42 eggs/day  5) 5x + 3y = 42  6) Solve for x and y.  7) Since Jerry has more white hens, we know that x > y. So substitute x = 20 (twice the number of white hens) and y = 10 (the number of red hens):  8) 5(20) + 3(10) = 42  9) Simplify: 40 + 30 = 42  10) Solution: Jerry has 20 white hens and 10 red hens.
Response:  First, we need to convert miles to meters. There are 1609.34 meters in a mile, so the park is approximately 905780 meters long (1.5 x 6000). Next, we can calculate how many hours it takes for Gary to walk around the park at 5 km/h. We know that there are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we can set up the equation: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, Time = 905780 meters / 5 km/h. To solve for time, we can divide: Time = 905780 / 5. This simplifies to: Time = 181156. So, Gary spends approximately 181156 seconds or 3022 hours walking around the park!
"Response:  On the first day, Sloane counted 100 clients entering the store.  On the second day, she counted 50 more than the previous day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 200 clients.  Now, let's find out how many clients she counted on the third day.  If there were in all 500 clients, and she counted 50 more than the previous day, then she counted:  
500 - 200 = 300 clients.  So, Sloane counted 300 clients on the third day."
Response:  First, we know that the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool at present. So if the small pool has x gallons of water now, the large pool will have 4x gallons of water.  Now, we are given that the large pool is being drained at a rate of 4 gallons per minute and it takes 4 minutes to drain all the water from the large pool. Therefore, the amount of water in the large pool after 4 minutes can be calculated as follows:  Large Pool Water = 4x - (4x/4) = 4x - x = 3x gallons  Since the small pool has only half the amount of water as the large pool before it was drained, the initial amount of water in the small pool is half of what the large pool had: Small Pool Water = x/2 gallons  Now, we want to find out how much water is left in the small pool after 4 minutes. We can calculate this by subtracting the amount of water drained from the small pool during those 4 minutes: Small Pool Water After 4 Minutes = x/2 - (x/2)/4 = x/8 gallons  So, the answer is x/8 gallons.
"Response:  First we need to calculate how much money Lori needs to make before she can buy the shoes and belt.  To do this, let's add up the cost of both items: Shoes = $320 Belt = $32 Total Cost = $352 Now, we know that Lori earns $8 per hour working part time. So, if she wants to buy the shoes and belt, she will have to work for a certain number of hours to earn enough money. We can set up an equation using ""x"" to represent the number of hours Lori has to work: x (8) = 352 where ""x"" is the unknown number of hours Lori has to work. Solving for ""x"", we get: x = 44 hours Therefore, Lori would have to work for 44 hours at her part-time job to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much interest she will pay over the 12 months.  To do this, we can multiply the principal amount (the $2000) by the annual interest rate (which is 10%). This gives us an interest payment of $200 per year or $16.67 per month ($200 / 12).  Now let's subtract the total interest paid from the original principal amount to find out how much Janeth still owes after making all 12 payments:  Original Principal = $2000 Interest Paid = $200 x 12 = $2400 Total Amount Due = $2000 - $2400 = $0 So, after making 12 payments of $165 each, Janeth will have paid back the entire principal amount of $2000 plus the agreed-upon interest of $2400, leaving no remaining balance.
Response:  We know that there are four roses in the vase and seven more than roses. So we can start by finding out how many more flowers there are besides the roses.  Seven plus four is equal to eleven. Therefore, there are eleven more flowers besides the roses.  Now let's add the number of roses to the number of extra flowers. Eleven + four equals fifteen.  There are fifteen flowers in all in the vase.
Response:  First, we know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so if Harriet is x years old now, Adrian would be 3x years old.  Secondly, we know that Zack is half of Harriet's age, so Zack is also x/2 years old.  Finally, we are asked to find the average age of all three in three years. To do this, we need to add their ages together and divide by three. So let's start with Adrian's age: 3x + Harriet's age + Zack's age = (3x + x + x/2) = 4x + x/2 Now we can substitute for x since we know it is equal to Harriet's current age of 21: 4x + x/2 = 4(21) + x/2 = 84 + x/2 Since we want the average age in three years, we will add three to each number: 84 + x/2 + 3 = 87 + x/2 + 3 Now we simplify: 87 + x/2 + 3 = 90 + x/2 We can see that x/2 is the same as Harriet's current age, so we can replace it with 21: 87 + 21 + 3 = 90 + 21 + 3 Simplifying further gives us our final answer: The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is 90 + 21 + 3 = 114 years old.
Response:  First, we know that Yuri scored 10 points more than Naomi, so if Naomi scored x points, then Yuri scored x + 10 points.  Next, we know that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so if Naomi scored x points, then Brianna scored x + 17 points.  Now, let's add up all of these scores to find out how many points were scored in total:  x + (x + 10) + (x + 17) = 3x + 27  Since there are four players and each player scored at least one point, we can be sure that the total number of points is an even number. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get:  3x/4 + 27/4 = 251/4  Simplifying this equation gives us:  3x = 1008  Solving for x gives us:  x = 336  So, Naomi scored 336 points, Yuri scored 336 + 10 = 346 points, and Brianna scored 336 + 17 = 353 points.  Finally, we can use the information given in the problem to determine how many points Jojo scored:  Since Jojo scored 251 points, he must have scored fewer points than any of the other three players. In fact, since his score is less than or equal to the lowest score among the other three players (which is 336), we can conclude that Jojo scored exactly 336 - 251 = 85 points.
"Response:  We know that Carmen spent 10 minutes to solve one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to solve one Sudoku. To find out how much time she spent playing these games in total, we need to multiply the number of crosswords and Sudokus she solved by their respective times.  So, if she solved 3 crosswords and 8 Sudokus, we can calculate her total playtime as follows:  
Time spent solving crosswords = 3 x 10 = 30 minutes  
Time spent solving Sudokus = 8 x 5 = 40 minutes  
Total playtime = 30 + 40 = 70 minutes"
"Response:  First, Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So how much is left in the tank? We can set up an equation based on this information:  
Tank capacity - Amount used = Remaining amount  In this case, the tank capacity is 120 liters, and Celine used 90 liters, so we can substitute these values into our equation:  
120 - 90 =?  Now solve for the remaining amount:  
120 - 90 = 30  Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters to water her garden."
Response:  First, we know that Andy plants 90 geraniums. Next, we know that he plants fewer petunias than geraniums, so let's say he plants x petunias (where x is a number less than 90). Now, we can write an equation based on the information given in the problem:  Geraniums = 90  Petunias = x  Total flowers =?  To find the total number of flowers, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias together. So, our equation becomes:  90 + x =?  Solving for the unknown variable x, we get:  90 + x = 130  Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 130.
Response:  First, we know that the company spent $15,000 in year one and $5,000 (one-third of $15,000) in year two. So, to find the total amount spent on advertising over both years, we need to add these amounts together.  Total = $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each person will pay for their respective watercraft.  For Carlos, he pays $30 per hour, so for 3 hours, he pays:  $30 x 3 = $90  For Benji, she pays $18 per hour, so for 5 hours, she pays: $18 x 5 = $90  Now that we have found out how much each person paid for their watercraft, let's add up the amounts to find the total cost:  $90 + $90 = $180  Therefore, the total amount they will pay is $180.
Response:  If it takes Andrew 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, and half that time (i.e., 3 days) to travel back by car, then he will spend a total of 6 + 3 = 9 days on his trip.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many cards of each type James has after he loses 8 water-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards.  We know that he had 40 water-type cards originally, so if he loses 8, he will have:  
40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards left.  Now, let's add the new grass-type cards he bought:  
32 + 14 = 46 cards in total.  So, out of the 46 cards in total, what is the probability that a randomly chosen card will be an aquatic-type card?  To find this, we can divide the number of aquatic-type cards he has left (32) by the total number of cards he has (46):  
Probability = 32/46 ≈ 0.70 (rounded to the nearest integer, which is 70%)"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much he needs to pay for the upgrades.  Carne extra costs $2, Cheese extra costs $1, Avocado costs $1, and each Molho costs $0.25, so total upgrades cost $2 + $1 + $1 + ($0.25 x 2) = $2 + $1 + $1 + $0.50 = $4.50.  Next, we add this amount to the basic price of the burrito: $6.50 + $4.50 = $11. Now, let's see what happens with the coupon. He has a $5 coupon that he uses at checkout, so he pays $11 - $5 = $6. So, his final payment is $6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute and her mother can add half of what she adds. So, if Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, then her mother can add 2 pieces per minute. Now, let's calculate how many minutes it will take for them to complete the puzzle. We are given that there are 360 pieces in total. Therefore, the number of minutes required to complete the puzzle is: 360 / (4 + 2) = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes. Hence, it will take 60 minutes or 1 hour for Kalinda and her mother to complete the puzzle together.
"Response:  First, we know that 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested after two months, so the number of watermelons ready for harvest is 30% of 120 = 36.  Next, we know that three weeks later (two weeks + one week), three-fourths of the remaining watermelons are ready for harvest, which means the number of watermelons not yet ready for harvest is equal to the total number of watermelons minus the number of watermelons ready for harvest. In this case, the number of watermelons not yet ready for harvest would be:  
Total number of watermelons - Number of watermelons ready for harvest = 120 - 36 = 84.  Therefore, there were 84 watermelons not yet ready for harvest after three weeks."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much Mark pays for each car:  $20,000 x 10% = $2,000 So he pays $2,000 in taxes per car. Next, let's calculate how much he pays for all 12 cars: $2,000 x 12 = $24,000 Now, add the registration fee of $1000 per car: $24,000 + (12 x $1000) = $24,000 + $12,000 = $36,000 Therefore, Mark pays a total of $36,000 for his fleet of 12 cars.
Response:  On Monday, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so if Robert collected 20, then Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells.  On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so she collected 2 x 25 = 50 shells. Therefore, on Tuesday, Kylie collected 50 shells.
Response:  If there were 50 formigas and each one carried half of an apple (i.e., 50%), then the number of apples they carried would be equal to the number of formigas times half of an apple.  So, if there were 50 formigas, they would have carried 50 x 0.5 = 25 apples.  Now, since Dax found half of the insects that the formigas had collected, he found 25/2 = 12.5 insects.  Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 12.5.
"Response:  If there are 36 penguins taking sunbaths and one-third of them jump into the ocean to swim, then we can subtract one-third of 36 from 36 to find out how many penguins are still basking in the sun.  
One third of 36 is 12. So, if 12 penguins jump into the ocean, how many are left?  
36 - 12 = 24. Therefore, 24 penguins are still taking sunbaths."
Response:  First, we know that Steve consumes 6 tomatoes per day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, he consumes 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes per week. Now, we need to find out how many tomato plants Steve needs to produce 42 tomatoes per week. We know that each tomato plant produces 3 tomatoes per week, so we can calculate as follows: Number of tomato plants = 42 / 3 = 14 plants. Therefore, Steve needs 14 tomato plants to produce enough tomatoes for his consumption.
"Response:  First, we know that each pizza has 8 slices and John wants to give 4 slices to each of his 20 friends. So, if we divide 20 (friends) by 4 (slices per friend), we get:  
20 / 4 = 5  
This means that John needs to order 5 pizzas in total!"
"Response:  If Ram uses five empty pens to make one full pen, and he has 25 empty pens, how many full pens will he have in total?  We know that 5 empty pens + 1 full pen = 6 pens (since we need 5 empty pens to fill up one full pen). Therefore, if Ram has 25 empty pens, he will have:  
25 x 6 = 150 full pens in total."
Response:  First, Johnny had $20, so he had $20 + $10 = $30. Then, he invested that money and it tripled in one year. So, after one year, he had $30 x 3 = $90.
Response:  First, we know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is x - 2 years old.  Next, we know that Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is x + 5 years old. Finally, we are given that Jessa is 20 years old, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  Mary = x - 2...
Response:  First, we know that 30% of the students left through entrance A, so the number of students who left through entrance A is 30% of 1000, or 300.  Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining students left through entrance B, so the number of students who left through entrance B is 3/5 of (1000 - 300), which is 3/5 of 700, or 420.  Finally, we know that all of the remaining students left through entrance C, so the number of students who left through entrance C is 1000 - 300 - 420, which is 380.  Therefore, the number of students who left through entrance C is 380.
Response:  First, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So if Robert has x candies, James has x + 6 candies.  Next, we know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. So John has 2x candies.  Finally, we are told that Joao has 54 candies.  To find out how many more candies Joao has than Tiago, we can set up an equation based on the information given:  x + 6 = 2(x) + 54  Simplifying this equation, we get:  x + 6 = 2x + 108  Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:  x + 6 - 2x = 108 - 2x  This simplifies to:  6 = 108 - 2x  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  3 = 54 - x  Since Joao has 54 candies and Tiago has fewer candies, Joao has more candies than Tiago by 54 - x. Therefore, the difference between the number of candies Joao has and the number of candies Tiago has is 54 - x.
Response:  First, Dolly will read her two books. That's 2 books. Then, Pandora will read her one book. That's 3 books in total. Now, both Dolly and Pandora will read each other's books. So, Dolly will read Pandora's book, and Pandora will read Dolly's books (since she has two). Therefore, the total number of books read collectively until the end is: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 books.
Response:  First, we know that Michael has five friends he corresponds with, and two of them have stopped corresponding with him. So, he currently writes to three friends.  Each friend sends two letters per week, for a total of six letters per week (2 x 3 = 6).  Since each letter is five pages long, Michael receives 60 pages of letters per week (6 x 10 = 60).  We are also given that Michael can write one page in six minutes. Therefore, he spends 60 / 6 = 10 minutes writing responses to his friends per week.  To find out how many hours he spends writing per week, we need to divide the number of minutes he spends writing by 60. 10 minutes / 60 = 0.17 hours or approximately 1 hour and 9 minutes per week.
Response:  First, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month.  Second, he makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day, so that's 450 minutes (15 x 30) of calls to his boss this month.  Third, he had an additional 300 minutes of other calls, so in total, he used 750 minutes (450 + 300).  Finally, since there are 30 days in the month, we can calculate how many minutes he has left by subtracting the number of minutes he used from the total number of minutes available: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes.  So, Jason has 250 minutes left this month.
Response:  First, we know that Kyle took five batatas fritas, so there are 24 - 5 = 19 left.  Next, we know that Billy took twice as much as Kyle, so he took 2 x 5 = 10 batatas fritas.  Now there are 19 - 10 = 9 left.  Finally, we know that Colby gave Griffin three less than what Kyle had taken, so Colby gave him 3 fewer than 10, which is 7 batatas fritas.  Therefore, the total number of batatas fritas that Griffin has at the end is 9 + 7 = 16.  So, Ginger gave Griffin 16 - 14 = 2 batatas fritas.
"Response:  We know that the difference between the number of snails in both aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So if we let X be the number of fish in one aquarium, then the number of fish in the other aquarium would be 2X.  Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can set up the equation:  
X + 2X = 32 + 4  Simplifying the equation:  
3X = 36  Dividing both sides by 3:  
X = 12  Therefore, there are 12 fish in each aquarium."
Response:  First we need to calculate how much time she spends getting ready each day: 6 hours x 4 days/week = 24 hours/week. Now let's calculate how much she earns per week: $250/hour x 24 hours/week = $6,000/week. Since the filming lasts for 5 weeks (or 5 x 7 days = 35 days), her total earnings would be: $6,000/week x 35 days = $210,000. However, since the makeup artist gives her a 10% discount, her final payment would be: $210,000 x 90% = $189,000.
Response:  First, we need to find out how much each parent paid. To do this, we can divide the total cost of the party by three (the number of parents). So, if we divide $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $98 by 3, we get: Each parent paid $32.67.  Now that we know how much each parent paid, we can calculate how much Isabelle paid. Since she is paying for her own portion of the costs, she paid $32.67 x 1 = $32.67.
Response:  First, we know that each sack of onions weighs 50 kilograms and there are four sacks in total. So, the total weight of all the onions is 4 x 50 kg = 200 kg. Next, we need to find out how much each kilogram of onions costs. We are given that one kilogram of onions costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of all the onions can be calculated as follows: Total Cost = Number of kilograms x Price per kilogram Total Cost = 200 kg x $1.50/kg = $300.
Response:  First, we know that Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister on Monday (second day). So if her sister ate x cookies, Sue ate 4x cookies.  On Tuesday (third day), Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2(x) cookies.  In total, Sue ate 4x + 2(x) = 6x cookies.  Now, we are given that each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue consumed 6x \* 200 = 1200x calories more than her sister.
