To find out how much profit Josh made from selling the house, we need to calculate the profit percentage first. The formula for calculating profit percentage is:
Profit Percentage = (Sales Price - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price

In this case, the sales price of the house was $80,000 and the purchase price was $50,000. So, the calculation would be:

Profit Percentage = ($80,000 - $50,000) / $50,000
= (30,000) / $50,000
= 60%

Now that we have the profit percentage, we can multiply it by the original purchase price to find out the total profit:

Total Profit = Profit Percentage x Purchase Price
= 60% x $50,000
= $30,000

So, Josh made a profit of $30,000 from selling the house."

To calculate the total cost of 16 bottles of shampoo, we need to know the price of each bottle and the discount percentage offered on the second glass. Let's assume that the price of each bottle is $5, and the discount percentage on the second glass is 60%.

The cost of 2 bottles (first glass) = 2 x $5 = $10
The cost of 2 bottles (second glass) = 2 x ($5 x 60%) = $10 x 60% = $6
Total cost = $10 + $6 = $16

Therefore, the total cost of 16 bottles of shampoo would be $16 x 16 = $256."

To calculate the total value of the two investment options, we need to consider both the fixed income and the growth potential of each option.

Option 1: Investing $5,000 in a high-yield savings account with an interest rate of 2.5% per year for 3 years.
Total value after 3 years = $5,000 x (1 + 0.025)^3 = $6,479.62

Option 2: Investing $8,000 in an index fund with an expected return of 7% per year for 3 years.
Total value after 3 years = $8,000 x (1 + 0.07)^3 = $10,355.28

Therefore, if the business owner wants to maximize their returns, they should choose Option 2 - investing $8,000 in an index fund. The total value of this investment after 3 years would be $10,355.28, which is higher than the total value of Option 1 ($6,479.62)."

To calculate the total cost of the dealer's profit and the discount offered to each customer, we need to first calculate the cost price of each phone. Let's assume that the cost price of one phone is $150.

For the first customer, who buys three phones at a time, the total cost would be:

$150 x 3 = $450

Since the dealer offers a 2% discount, the actual amount paid by the customer will be:

$450 - (2% of $450) = $450 - ($9) = $441

So, the dealer makes a profit of:

$450 - $441 = $9

For the second customer, who also buys three phones at a time, the total cost would be:

$150 x 3 = $450

Since the dealer already made a profit of $9 from the first customer, the new profit for this customer will be:

$450 - $9 = $441

So, the dealer makes a total profit of:

$9 + $441 = $450

Therefore, the dealer earns a total profit of $450 over the course of three months, or an average monthly profit of $150."

The total cost of purchasing 4 thermoses, 20 marbles, and 10 camel leather goods from Delilah's store is calculated as follows:

4 thermoses x $30 each = $120
20 marbles x $15 each = $300
10 camel leather goods x $50 each = $500
Total cost = $920

So, the maximum amount of profit that can be made by selling these items at a 50% markup is:

Maximum profit = Total cost x 1.5 (50% markup)
= $920 x 1.5
= $1,380"

"Response: 
To calculate the total revenue of Kim's business, we need to multiply the number of bottles sold per month (24) by the price of each bottle ($2). Therefore, the total revenue for one month is:

24 x $2 = $48

Since Kim wants to make a profit of $92 per month, she needs to increase her prices. To do this, she can raise the price of each bottle by $10, which would give her a profit margin of:

$48 + $10 = $58

Therefore, the new price of each bottle would be:

$58 / $2 = $29

So, Kim will sell each bottle for $29, and her total revenue for the month will be:

24 x $29 = $676

Now, let's calculate the total laundry service revenue for the month. Since Kim has 5 regular customers who pay $5 per package, and she delivers 2 packages per day, the total laundry service revenue for the month is:

5 x $5 x 2 = $50

Adding both the bottled water and laundry service revenues, we get:

$676 + $50 = $726

Therefore, Kim's estimated monthly revenue is $726."

If Tim can walk at a speed of 264 feet per minute (457 meters per minute) for 2 miles (3.2 kilometers), then he will take 2 x 264 = 528 minutes to walk from his house to Stevie's house. Therefore, the time difference between their arrival times will be 110 - 528 = 418 minutes or approximately 7 hours and 28 minutes."

To calculate the total amount of rice required for 2 months for 350 people, we need to first determine the daily requirement of rice per person. Let's assume that each person consumes 2 kg of rice per day.

Total number of days = 60 (for 2 months)
Daily rice requirement per person = 2 kg/day x 350 people = 700 kg/day

Therefore, the total amount of rice required for 2 months is:

Total amount of rice = Daily rice requirement x Total number of days
= 700 kg/day x 60 days
= 42,000 kg

So, to feed 350 people for 2 months, you would need approximately 42,000 kg of rice."

Let's analyze the given information -

* Juyan and Carlos sell lemonade for $3 per glass.
* They charge $2 for each cup of ice.
* They buy sugar at $0.50 per pound.
* They use 20 pounds of sugar to make 1 gallon of lemonade.
* If they sell $25 worth of lemonade, how much change will they have?

To find out how much change they will have, we need to subtract the amount they sold ($25) from the total amount they received (($3 x 20) + $2 x 1).

So, the calculation is as follows:

((3 x 20) + 2 x 1) = (60 + 2) = 62

Therefore, if Juyan and Carlos sell $25 worth of lemonade, they will have $62 in change."

So, the total amount both friends spent is:
$37.50 + $37.50 = $75

Therefore, if they had split the cost equally between them, each friend would have paid:
$75 / 2 = $37.50"

Total marks for all subjects = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 458

Since Brinley got 93 marks in the final exam, her score can be calculated as follows:

Brinley's score = Total marks / 100 x 93

To calculate the total cost of the goods and services purchased by Lorri, we need to add up the prices of each item. The price of one jar of juice is $32.00, and the part-time job pays $8.00 per hour. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Price of Jar of Juice + Hourly Wage for Part-Time Job
= $32.00 + ($8.00 x Number of Hours Worked)

Since Lorri wants to buy one jar of juice and work for 4 hours, we can substitute these values into the equation above:

Total Cost = $32.00 + ($8.00 x 4)
= $32.00 + $32.00
= $64.00

Therefore, the total cost of the goods and services purchased by Lorri will be $64.00."

Number of students absent from class A = 30% of 1000 = 300

Number of students absent from class B = 2/5 of (1000 - 300) = 2/5 x 700 = 440

Total number of absentees = 300 + 440 = 740
