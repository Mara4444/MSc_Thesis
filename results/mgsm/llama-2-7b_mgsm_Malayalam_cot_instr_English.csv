Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 16 mice in total and they will eat for one day. Now, let's calculate how much food each mouse will eat based on their weight. According to the passage, each mouse weighs around 30 grams. So, if there are 16 mice, then the total weight of all the mice is 16 x 30 = 480 grams. Since each mouse eats half a gram of food per hour, the total amount of food eaten by all the mice in one day is 480 grams / 60 = 8 grams per hour. Therefore, each mouse will eat approximately 8/16 = 0.5 grams of food per hour.
Response:  We have two big balls and three small balls. The total number of balls is 5. Now we want to know how many balls are in each group (big or small). So, there will be 2 big balls and 3 small balls. Therefore, the answer is 2 + 3 = 5.
Response:  Josh has Rs. 80,000 to invest in a property that can give him an annual return of 15%. To calculate the amount he needs to invest, we need to use the formula for calculating the future value of an investment: FV = PV x (1 + r)^n Where: FV = Future Value PV = Present Value r = Annual interest rate n = Number of years So, if Josh wants to invest his entire Rs. 80,000 and get an annual return of 15%, he will need to invest it for 5 years. Using the formula above, we can calculate the future value of his investment as follows: FV = PV x (1 + r)^n FV = 80,000 x (1 + 0.15)^5 FV = 276,943.69 Therefore, based on the given information, Josh needs to invest at least Rs. 276,943.69 to earn an annual return of 15% over 5 years.
Response:  Jayasree has 60 meters of springs in her bag. She wants to give some to Monu and take back 30 meters as change. How much will she get if she gives 20 meters to Monu? Solution:  First, let's calculate how many meters Jayasree will have left after giving 20 meters to Monu. If she gives 20 meters, then she will be left with 40 meters (60 - 20 = 40). So, Jayasree will get 40 meters of spring from Monu.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of days in Venus' orbit around Earth. As per the given information, it takes Venus 243 days to complete one orbit around Earth. Therefore, the total number of days in Venus' orbit is:

243 days x 7 (days in a week) = 1691 days
Now, let's calculate the total number of hours in Venus' orbit. There are 24 hours in a day, so the total number of hours in Venus' orbit is:

1691 days x 24 hours/day = 40,764 hours
Finally, let's convert the total number of hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total number of minutes in Venus' orbit is:

40,764 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 2,487,640 minutes
So, the answer to the question is 2,487,640 minutes."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of glasses in 5 drums and 60% of that amount is 3 drums. So, the total number of glasses = 5 x 4 = 20 glasses. Now, let's find out how many glasses Kailash has. As per the question, Kailash has 16 glasses more than the total number of glasses available. Therefore, the number of glasses Kailash has = Total number of glasses + Number of extra glasses (16) = 20 + 16 = 36 glasses.
Response:  We know that there are 3 types of stones - Charo, Lasteon and Siyal.  Each type has its own weight in grams per stone.  So, we need to calculate the total weight of all the stones based on their respective weights.  For Charo stones, each one weighs 10 grams.  For Lasteon stones, each one weighs 5 grams.  And for Siyal stones, each one weighs 8 grams.  Therefore, the total weight of all the stones can be calculated as follows: Total weight = (Number of Charo stones x weight of Charo stone) + (Number of Lasteon stones x weight of Lasteon stone) + (Number of Siyal stones x weight of Siyal stone) In this case, there are 20 stones in total.  So, the total weight of all the stones is: Total weight = (20 x 10) + (5 x 5) + (8 x 20) = 400 + 25 + 160 = 575 grams.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of data that can be downloaded in one month with a speed of 200 Mbps.  We know that there are 30 days in a month, so the total number of days is 30.  Now, let's calculate the total amount of data that can be downloaded in one day at this speed:

Total data downloadable per day = Speed x Time (in days)
= 200 Mbps x 30 days
= 6000 MB (or 6 GB) per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of data that can be downloaded in one year at this speed:

Total data downloadable per year = Total data downloadable per day x Number of days in a year
= 6000 MB per day x 365 days (as there are 365 days in a non-leap year)
= 219000 MB (or 21.9 TB) per year

So, if you have a 200 Mbps internet connection and you want to download files continuously for 20 hours a day, it will take approximately 21.9 TB of data to be downloaded in one year. However, since you cannot download data continuously for 20 hours a day without any breaks, let's assume that you take breaks of 8 hours every day. So, the actual time taken to download the same amount of data will be:

Actual time taken to download 21.9 TB of data = Total time taken to download 21.9 TB / Break duration (in hours)
= 21.9 TB / 8 hours
= Approximately 2722 days or around 7 years

Therefore, if you have a 200 Mbps internet connection and you want to download files continuously for 20 hours a day, it will take approximately 7 years to download 21.9 TB of data."
Response:  We know that there are 100 kilograms of rice in one bag. So, if we want to calculate how many bags of rice we can get from 400 kilograms, we need to divide 400 kg by 100 kg per bag. This gives us 4 bags of rice. Therefore, the answer is 4 bags of rice.
Response:  We know that Elisa has 40 manikins in her factory and each manikin takes 10 days to produce one doll. So, in total, Elisa needs 40 x 10 = 400 days to produce all the manikins.

"Response:  We know that in the first month (January), there are 31 days and in the second month (February), there are also 31 days. So, the total number of days in both months is:

Total days = 31 + 31 = 62 days
Now, we need to find out how many days are left after deducting the number of days in January from the total number of days in February.
Days left = Total days - Days in January
= 62 - 30
= 32 days
So, the remaining days in the second month (March) after deducting the number of days in January are 32 days."
Response:  We know that there are 3 dogs in the first picture and each dog has 68 toys. So, the total number of toys for all three dogs is 3 x 68 = 194 toys. Now, let's move to the second picture where we see two dogs with 80 toys each. Therefore, the total number of toys for both dogs is 2 x 80 = 160 toys. Finally, in the third picture, there are six dogs with 55 toys each. So, the total number of toys for all six dogs is 6 x 55 = 330 toys. Adding up all these numbers gives us a total of 194 + 160 + 330 = 684 toys.
Response:  Karloos has $90 and wants to distribute it among 7 people in such a way that each person gets at least $1.5. Since there are 7 people, each person will get $\frac{90}{7} = 12.86$ dollars. Now, if we want to give an additional amount of $3 to one person, then we have to subtract $3 from the remaining amount, which is $\frac{90 - 3}{7} = 11.43$ dollars. So, the remaining amount after giving $3$ to one person is $11.43$.
Response:  Melanie has 30 dresses in her wardrobe and she wants to wear something new every day. She has 7 skirts, 5 pantsuits, and 12 blouses. Out of these, she can wear each item only once a week. So, for 7 days, she will have 7 x 7 = 49 different outfits. However, since she cannot repeat an outfit within a week, she will have 49 - 7 = 42 unique outfits for the entire month. Therefore, the answer is 42.
Response:  We know that 20% of Vidyadharan's salary is deducted as income tax and he gets Rs 8000 as his take home pay.  Now we are asked how much percentage of Hip Hop's salary is deducted as income tax.  Since Hip Hop earns Rs 16000 per month, if 25% of his salary is deducted as income tax, then the amount deducted will be Rs 4000 (25% of Rs 16000). So, the remaining amount after deducting income tax will be Rs 12000 (Rs 16000 - Rs 4000). Therefore, the correct answer is B) 25%.
Response:  The total amount of money that can be invested in the stock market is $50,000. If we invest this amount at an interest rate of 2.5%, then we will earn $1,250 as interest per year (=$50,000 x 2.5%). However, if we invest the same amount at an interest rate of 1.2%, then we will only earn $600 as interest per year ($50,000 x 1.2%). So, the difference between these two scenarios is $650 ($1,250 - $600). Therefore, if you want to earn more than $650 extra per year through your investment, it would make sense to choose the higher interest rate option.
Response:  The cost of one train ticket is Rs 80 and there are 8 trains in total. So, the total cost of all eight tickets would be: 80 x 8 = Rs 640. Now, if we subtract the amount that Avantika paid (Rs 150), we get the remaining amount that she still owes: Rs 640 - Rs 150 = Rs 490. Therefore, Avantika still owes Rs 490 to the railway station.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of students in both classes combined. The total number of students is equal to 20 + 30 = 50 students. Now, let's find out how many students are there in each class based on their respective ratios. In Class A, there are 20 students and 5 students are from Grade 7, so the remaining 15 students are from Grade 6. Similarly, in Class B, there are 30 students and 10 students are from Grade 7, so the remaining 20 students are from Grade 6. Therefore, the total number of Grade 6 students is 15 (from Class A) + 20 (from Class B) = 35 students. Moreover, there are 15 students in Grade 7 in both classes combined. Finally, the total number of students in all grades (Grade 6 and Grade 7) is 35 + 15 = 50 students. So, the answer is 50.

She earns $80,000 per year. So, Remy makes $60,000 / 5 = $12,000 per year less than Dinah. Therefore, Remy makes $80,000 - $12,000 = $68,000 per year.
Response:  Billi is 8 years old and has 3 castes of dolls. So, there are 8 x 3 = 24 dolls in total. Now, let's calculate how many dividers are needed for each caste of dolls. For example, if we have 6 dolls in one caste, then we need 6 / 1 = 6 dividers for that caste. Similarly, if we have 7 dolls in another caste, then we need 7 / 1 = 7 dividers for that caste. Therefore, the number of dividers required for each caste of dolls is: Caste 1 - 6 dividers Caste 2 - 7 dividers Caste 3 - 8 dividers Total number of dividers required = 6 + 7 + 8 = 21 dividers.
Response:  We have 360 minutes in an hour and there are 24 hours in a day. So, we can calculate the time as follows: Time = (Number of hours) x (Number of minutes in an hour) = (24) x (60) = 1440 minutes Now, let's find out how many minutes are between 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm. We know that 1:00 pm is equal to 90 minutes after midnight, so the time difference between 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm is: Time Difference = (5:00 pm - 1:00 pm) = (4 hours) x (60 minutes/hour) = 240 minutes Therefore, the total number of minutes between 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm is: Total Time = 1440 minutes + 240 minutes = 1680 minutes

Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how much money Chikkan has spent on masala dosas. As per the question, he has spent Rs 12 for 12 dosas, which means he has spent Rs 12 x 12 = Rs 144 on masala dosas. Now, let's find out how much money he has saved after buying 5 apples at Rs 5 each and 4 oranges at Rs 1.50 each. He has saved Rs 5 x 5 = Rs 25 on apples and Rs 1.50 x 4 = Rs 6 on oranges, so he has saved a total of Rs 25 + Rs 6 = Rs 31. So, he has saved Rs 31 - Rs 144 = Rs (-113). Therefore, he has lost Rs (-113).
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in total between the three journeys. We can see that each journey is of 3 days duration, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 days in total. Now, we need to calculate the total distance traveled during these 9 days. From the question, we know that Mishti travels for 16.50 hours in one direction and then returns back, which means she covers a total distance of 16.50 x 2 = 33 km. Similarly, Jyoti travels for 22.50 hours in one direction and then returns back, which means she covers a total distance of 22.50 x 2 = 45 km. And finally, Ria travels for 42 hours in one direction and then returns back, which means she covers a total distance of 42 x 2 = 84 km. So, the total distance traveled by all three girls together is 33 + 45 + 84 = 162 km. Therefore, the answer is 162 km.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 days in April and each day has 24 hours. So, total hours in April is 15 x 24 = 360 hours. Now, we have to find out how many hours Siya can work in a day. According to the question, she works for 8 hours a day. Therefore, total hours worked by Siya in April is 360 / 8 = 45 hours. Finally, we need to convert this number into rupees. As per the question, Siya earns ₹40 per hour of work. Therefore, total amount earned by Siya in April is 45 hours x ₹40/hour = ₹1800.

Response:  We know that Darling's age is 7 years less than Alana's age. So, Darling's age = Alana's age - (7) = 162 - (7) = 155 years. Therefore, Darling's age is 155 years old.
Response:  The person has 80 years old and wants to know how much he can withdraw from his provident fund. As per the rule, 20% of the amount is tax-free, which means that 20% of 80 = 16 years worth of savings are tax-free. So, the remaining amount that the person can withdraw is 80 - 16 = 64 years worth of savings.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in a year. There are 365 days in a year (taking into account leap years). Now, let's calculate how many times Jon can go for a walk in a year. Since he goes for a walk every day, the number of walks he takes in a year is 365. Next, we need to find out how much time he spends on each walk. According to the question, he spends 2 hours on each walk. Therefore, the total time he spends on all his walks in a year is 2 x 365 = 730 hours. Finally, we need to convert this time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time Jon spends on all his walks in a year is 730 hours x 60 = 43800 minutes.
Response:  We know that there are 110 people in total and 30 of them are vegetarians. So, the number of non-vegetarians is 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, there are 80 non-vegetarians among the 110 people.

Next 20 minutes (second stage), he earned 25% more than the previous stage, i.e., 4 x 1.25 = Rs 0.50 per minute. Therefore, his total earnings for both stages are: 0.067 + 0.50 = Rs 0.567 per minute.
Response:  We know that Teacher has given an assignment to complete in 4 days and 12 hours. So, we have to calculate how much time is left for each day.  Day 1: 4 days x 12 hours = 48 hours Day 2: 48 hours / 2 = 24 hours Day 3: 24 hours / 2 = 12 hours Day 4: 12 hours / 2 = 6 hours Now, we need to find out how many rupees are needed for each day.  For Day 1, we need 500 rupees per hour, so total amount needed for Day 1 is 500 x 48 = 24,000 rupees. Similarly, for Days 2-4, we can calculate the amount needed as follows: Day 2: 24,000 / 2 = 12,000 rupees Day 3: 12,000 / 2 = 6,000 rupees Day 4: 6,000 / 2 = 3,000 rupees Therefore, the total amount of money needed for all four days is 24,000 + 12,000 + 6,000 + 3,000 = 55,000 rupees.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jon is 13 years old and has 15 dollars in his wallet. So, he can buy 15 x 8 = $120 worth of goods from Walmart. But then, there are 20 dollar bills in his wallet, which means he has $120 + $20 = $140 left after buying something from Walmart. Now, let's assume he spends another $5 on some other thing, so he will have $140 - $5 = $135 left in his wallet. Therefore, the remaining amount of money in Jon's wallet after buying something from Walmart is $135.

Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with 250 kg of rice.  Since each bag has a capacity of 50 kg, we need to divide 250 kg by 50 kg per bag to get the number of bags that can be filled. So, 250 kg / 50 kg/bag = 5 bags. Now, we are asked how much money will be left if 300 grams of rice is sold at the rate of Rs. 30 per kilogram. To find this out, we need to multiply the amount of rice (300 g) by the selling price (Rs. 30/kg). So, 300 g x Rs. 30/kg = Rs. 9000. Finally, we are asked how much money will be left if 5 bags of rice are sold at the rate of Rs. 2000 per bag. To find this out, we need to multiply the number of bags (5 bags) by the selling price (Rs. 2000/bag). So, 5 bags x Rs. 2000/bag = Rs. 10,000. Therefore, the total amount of money left after selling all the rice is Rs. 10,000 - Rs. 9000 = Rs. 1000.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes Charley has. According to the question, Charley has 10 pairs of shoes in total, and each pair contains two shoes. So, the number of individual shoes Charley owns is 2 x 10 = 20. Now, let's calculate the total value of all the shoes that Charley owns. Each shoe costs $50, so the total cost of all the shoes is 20 x $50 = $1000. Therefore, the answer is (20 x $50) = $1000.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times each digit appears in the given number.  The digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5 and 6.  Now let's count their appearances:  Zero appears once (in the units place), One appears twice (in tens and hundreds places), Two appears thrice (in thousands, ten thousands and hundred thousand places), Three appears four times (in lakh and crore places), Four appears five times (in crores and above places), Five appears six times (in millions and above places), Six appears seven times (in billions and above places). So, the total number of occurrences of each digit is as follows:  Zero - 1, One - 2, Two - 3, Three - 4, Four - 5, Five - 6, Six - 7. Next, we need to calculate the sum of these numbers. When we add all these numbers, we get: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 35. Therefore, there are 35 distinct digits in the given number.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 80 positions in the company and each position has 4 people working under it. So, the total number of employees in the company is 80 x 4 = 320. Now, out of these 320 employees, 220 are male and 100 are female. Therefore, the percentage of males among all employees is (220/320) x 100 = 68.75%. Similarly, the percentage of females among all employees is (100/320) x 100 = 31.25%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Neel has 100 tiles and he wants to distribute them equally among 4 people. So each person will get 25 tiles (100/4 = 25). Now, let's assume that out of these 25 tiles, 5 are broken or damaged in some way. This means that each person will have 20 functional tiles left (25 - 5 = 20). Finally, if John is given an additional 200 dollars as bonus, he will be able to buy more tiles than before. The number of extra tiles he can buy depends on how much money he has after buying the necessary repairs for his existing tiles. If he spends 50% of the remaining amount on repairs, then he will have 100 dollars left (after subtracting 50% of the remaining amount), which can buy him 5 extra tiles (100 / 20 = 5). Therefore, the final answer is 25 + 5 = 30 tiles that John can buy with the additional 200 dollars.

7 - yes! The digit 7 appears once in the number. Therefore, the answer is 1."
Response:  The length of Loyd's hair is 252 meters and he has 1000 strands of hair. So, the volume of his hair can be calculated as follows: Volume = Length x Width x Height (of one strand) = 252 m x 0.03 m x 1000 = 768 cubic meters Now, we need to calculate how much money Loyd spent on shampooing his hair. According to the question, he spends $2 per day for 2 days on shampooing his hair. Therefore, the total amount spent on shampooing his hair is: Total Amount = Number of Days x Cost Per Day = 2 days x $2/day = $4 So, the answer to the question is $4.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Tom can eat in 30 minutes and then divide it by 4 to get the number of times he can eat per hour. So, we need to calculate the time taken for Tom to finish one meal. From the question, we know that Tom takes 1 minute to eat one mango. Therefore, he will take 30 minutes (or 30 x 1 = 30) to finish four mangos. Now, let's convert this time into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours (or half an hour). So, Tom can eat four mangos in half an hour. To find out how many times he can eat in an hour, we divide the number of mangos he can eat in half an hour by the number of hours he has available: 4 mangos / 0.5 hours = 8 times (or eight times). Therefore, Tom can eat eight times in an hour.
Response:  Urinary bladder capacity is 400-600 ml (average).  If it is filled with urine to 80% of its capacity, then the volume of urine in the bladder will be:  Volume of urine = Capacity of bladder x Percentage of filling = 400-600 ml x 80% = 320-480 ml So, there are approximately 320-480 ml of urine in the bladder. Now, let's calculate how many cups of urine this is: Cup = Milliliter / 237 ml (conversion factor) = 320-480 ml / 237 ml = 1.33-1.79 cups Therefore, there are approximately 1.33-1.79 cups of urine in the bladder.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 6 tractors and 4 cars in the loader. So, the total number of vehicles is 6 + 4 = 10. Now, we have to find out how many vehicles belong to Meckanik. From the question, we know that Meckanik has 6 trucks and 4 cars. So, the total number of vehicles belonging to Meckanik is 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 dogs in the forest.  Among them, 3 dogs are old and weak, so they cannot chase away any more wolves. Therefore, the number of wolves increased to 6 from their side. Now, let's count the remaining dogs who can chase away wolves - 7 dogs are left. So, the total number of wolves that can be chased away is 7 x 6 = 42 wolves.
Response:  We know that there are 30 large coins and 2 small coins in total. So, if we take one bag of large coins (which contains 10 coins), then we will have 30 - 10 = 20 large coins left. Now, if we take another bag of large coins (which contains 5 coins), then we will have 20 + 5 = 25 large coins left. Similarly, if we take another bag of small coins (which contains 2 coins), then we will have 25 - 2 = 23 large coins left. Therefore, the answer is 23.
Response:  We know that there are 7 directors and 7 producers involved in making this movie. Each director has directed an average of 4 movies per year, and each producer has produced an average of 3 movies per year. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of movies made by these people as follows: Directors: 7 x 4 = 28 Movies Producers: 7 x 3 = 21 Movies So, altogether, we have 28 + 21 = 49 movies made by these people.
Response:  We know that the diameter of the wheel is 50 cm and its circumference is 150 cm. So, we can find the radius of the wheel as follows: Radius = Circumference / Diameter = 150 cm / 50 cm = 3 cm Now, let's find out how many pieces of land (in hectares) are required to build a track with a length of 3755 meters using this radius: Area of the track = π x Radius^2 x Length of the track = π x 3^2 x 3755 = 3755π hectares Therefore, the area of the track is approximately 3755π hectares.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount of money that Ayala has is $100, and she wants to distribute it equally among her four friends. So, each friend will get $25 from Ayala.  Now, let's consider Deliverator's share. Since he is also one of Ayala's friends, he will also get an equal share of $25. Therefore, the total amount of money that Deliverator will receive is $25 x 3 = $75.  However, since Deliverator already received $30 earlier, his final amount will be $75 - $30 = $45.  So, the correct answer is $45.
Response:  We have to find out how many rows of 6 columns each and how many rows of 67 columns there are in total. So, we can write an equation as follows: Number of rows of 6 columns = x Number of rows of 67 columns = y Now, we know that the number of rows is 20, so we can substitute it into the above equation: 20 = x + y Substituting the value of x (6) and y (67), we get: 124 = x + 67 Therefore, the answer is 57.
Response:  We know that there are 25 apples in total and 20 of them are rotten. So, the number of good apples is 25 - 20 = 5. Now, we have to find out how many bags of 4 apples each can be made from these 5 good apples. To do this, divide the number of good apples by 4, which gives us 5 / 4 = 1.25 bags. Since you cannot make half a bag, the final answer is 1 bag.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Janardhan has Rs. 500 in his wallet and he spends Rs. 200 on something. So, now he has Rs. 300 left with him. Then, he gets Rs. 800 as an allowance from his father, which takes his total amount to Rs. 1100 (Rs. 300 + Rs. 800). Now, he spends 10% of this amount i.e., Rs. 110 as income tax, leaving him with Rs. 990 (Rs. 1100 - Rs. 110). Therefore, the answer is Rs. 990.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that John can withdraw from his account in 20 years. As per the question, he will get an interest of 5% every year, so the interest for 20 years would be:
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $100,000 x 5% x 20 years
= $100,000 x 5% x 20
= $10,000
Now, let's calculate the total amount of money that John has after 20 years:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $100,000 + $10,000
= $110,000
So, after 20 years, John will have $110,000 in his account."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Alen has in his savings account. According to the question, he has Rs 140 in his account. Now, let's find out how much interest he will earn from this amount. As per the question, the interest rate is 10% p.a., so the interest earned can be calculated as follows: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time Period Where principal is the initial amount of money (Rs 140), rate is the interest rate (10% p.a.), and time period is one year (365 days). Therefore, the interest earned by Alen is: Interest = Rs 140 x 10% x 365 days = Rs 42 So, now Alen has a total of Rs 182 (Rs 140 + Rs 42) in his savings account. Finally, if he withdraws 10% of this amount (i.e., Rs 18), he will have Rs 164 left in his account (Rs 182 - Rs 18).
Response:  We know that the tanker can carry 100 tonnes of oil and it takes 4 gallons of gas to fill one tank. So, we need to calculate how many tanks will be required to fill the tanker with 12000 gallons of gasoline.  Now, let's convert 12000 gallons to tonnes. There are 7.5 tonnes in a gallon, so...  Therefore, we require 1600 tanks to fill the tanker with 12000 gallons of gasoline.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the number 7 appears in the given series. We can see that the pattern of the series is: 7, 5, 3, 1, 7, 5, 3, 1... So, the number 7 appears twice in the series. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. The question asks us to find out how many times the number 6 appears in the series after the first occurrence of 7. In the given series, the first occurrence of 7 happens at position 4, so we need to count from position 5 (i.e., after the first occurrence of 7) to position 9 (i.e., just before the second occurrence of 7). Therefore, the number 6 appears once in this portion of the series. Finally, we add up the total number of appearances of both numbers 7 and 6 in the entire series, which gives us the answer: 2 + 1 = 3. So, the answer to the question is 3.
"Response:  We have to find out how many basements are there in each building and then add them up.  So, we can start with the first building - ""ഒരു ബാസ്കറ്റ് ബോൾ ടൂർണമെന്റിൽ നാലു സ്കൂളുകൾ മത്സരിക്കുന്നുണ്ട്"". There are 3 floors in this building, so there will be 3 basements. Next, we come across ""ഓരോ സ്കൂളും ഒരു ബാസ്കറ്റ് ബോൾ ടീムും ഒരു ബാസ്കറ്റ് ബോൾ ടീムും അയച്ചിട്ടുണ്ട്"". Here also, there are 3 floors, so there will be 3 basements. Finally, we get ""ഓരോ ടീമിലും 5 കളിക്കാരാണുള്ളത്"" which means that there are 5 basements in total. Therefore, the answer is 3 + 3 + 5 = 11 basements."
"Response:  We have to find out how many times 175 can be divided into 35 and also how many times 35 can be divided into 175. So, we need to perform two calculations:

Calculation 1: How many times 175 can be divided into 35?
We know that 175 / 35 = 5, so 175 can be divided into 35 exactly 5 times.

Calculation 2: How many times 35 can be divided into 175?
We know that 35 / 175 = 0.2, so 35 can be divided into 175 exactly 20 times (since 0.2 x 175 = 35).

Now, let's combine both calculations:
Total number of times 175 can be divided into 35 = Total number of times 35 can be divided into 175 = 5 + 20 = 25 times!"
Response:  We know that there are 70 students in Veronica's class and each student has to take either 5 or 10 exams. So, the total number of exams is:  Number of students x Number of exams per student = 70 x 5 = 350 exams  Now, we need to find out how many examiners are required to evaluate these exams. As per the question, there are 60 professors and each professor can evaluate up to 5 exams. Therefore, the total number of examiners required is:  Number of exams / Number of examiners per exam = 350 / 60 = 5.83 examiners (round off to 6 examiners)  So, there will be 6 examiners who will evaluate the exams of Veronica's class.
Response:  We know that Beyonce has $5 million in her bank account and she wants to donate $100,000 to each of the 8 charities. So, the total amount she will donate is $800,000 (8 x $100,000). Now, we need to calculate how much money Beyonce will have left after making these donations. Let's assume that Beyonce had $5 million in her bank account before making any donations. After donating $800,000 to the 8 charities, Beyonce will have $4.2 million ($5 million - $800,000) left in her bank account.
Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total number of classes for each level. For Judy, there are 7 levels and each level has 5 classes, so the total number of classes for Judy is 7 x 5 = 35 classes. Similarly, for Orion, there are 6 levels and each level has 7 classes, so the total number of classes for Orion is 6 x 7 = 42 classes. Now, let's consider the time duration of each class. According to the question, each class lasts for 90 minutes, so we can convert it into hours by dividing the duration by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Therefore, the total number of hours required for each level is 35/60 = 0.583 hours per class for Judy and 42/60 = 0.70 hours per class for Orion. Finally, to find out how many days are required to complete each level, we need to divide the total number of hours by the duration of a single class. So, for Judy, it takes approximately 0.583 hours / 90 minutes = 0.64 days to complete one level, while for Orion, it takes approximately 0.70 hours / 90 minutes = 0.77 days to complete one level.
Response:  We have to find out how many pairs of numbers can be formed using the digits from 1 to 9 without repeating any digit.  Since there are 10 digits in total (from 1 to 9), we can form 10! = 10 × 9 ×... × 1 = 3628800 pairs of numbers. So, the answer is 3628800.
Response:  We know that Tom has $100 and he wants to buy a bracelet worth $50. So, he will have $50 left after buying the bracelet. Now, let's consider how much money Brian has. He has $80 and he wants to buy a watch worth $40. So, he will have $40 left after buying the watch. Finally, let's see how much money there is in total. If Tom has $50 left after buying the bracelet and Brian has $40 left after buying the watch, then together they have $90 ($50 + $40) left. Therefore, Tom has $50 / 3 = $16.67 dollars left and Brian has $40 / 4 = $10 dollars left.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Shilpa will have after 15 years if she invests $150 every month and earns an interest of 2% per year. We can use the formula for compound interest as follows: A = P x (1 + r)^n Where: A = amount after n years P = principal amount ( initial investment in this case) r = annual interest rate (2% in this case) n = number of years (15 years in this case) So, using the values given in the question, we get: A = $150 x (1 + 0.02)^15 = $6748.94 Now, let's find out how many months it takes for Shilpa to save $6748.94 if she invests $150 every month for 15 years. We can use the formula for time taken to reach a target amount: T = A / M Where: T = time taken (in months) A = target amount ($6748.94 in this case) M = monthly investment ($150 in this case) Substituting the values, we get: T = $6748.94 / $150 = 452 months or approximately 37 years Now, since Shilpa wants to retire at the age of 60, we need to subtract 37 years from her current age of 35 to find out how many years are left for her to work. Therefore, Shilpa has approximately 23 years left for her to work before she can retire.
Response:  We know that there are 3 types of dogs - Marigold, Petunia and Begonia. Each type has a different weight range. Marigolds weigh between 2.74-3.05 kg, Petunias weigh between 1.87-2.12 kg, and Begonias weigh between 2.12-2.43 kg. So, if we take an average weight for each dog, it would be around 2.3 kg. Now, let's calculate how many cups of food each dog needs based on their weight. For Marigolds, it is 1/4 cup per pound of body weight, which means they need about 0.56 cups of food (2.3 x 0.56 = 1.23 cups). For Petunias, it is 1/3 cup per pound of body weight, which means they need about 0.67 cups of food (2.3 x 0.67 = 1.51 cups). And for Begonias, it is also 1/3 cup per pound of body weight, which means they need about 0.83 cups of food (2.3 x 0.83 = 1.93 cups). Therefore, the total amount of food needed for all three dogs would be approximately 1.23 + 1.51 + 1.93 = 4.67 cups.
Response:  We know that there are 16 chaturshringas in one manjal (a unit of measurement for rice). So, if we have to calculate the number of chaturshringas in 100 manjals, we can multiply 16 with 100, which gives us 1600 chaturshringas. Therefore, the answer is 1600.

Response:  We have to find out how many liters of water are in 24 liters and then divide it by 6 to get the number of liters in each liter. So, first we need to convert 24 liters into its fractional part. 24 / 6 = 4  Therefore, there are 4 liters in each liter. Now, let's calculate the number of liters in the remaining 6 liters. 6 / 6 = 1  So, there is one liter left over after dividing 6 liters by 6.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 10 students in Charlie's class and each student has to carry 21 stationery items. So, the total number of stationery items carried by all the students is 21 x 10 = 210. Now, out of these 210 stationery items, 23 are extra and belong to Charlie. Therefore, the remaining 187 stationery items (210 - 23) are shared among the other 9 students. Since there are 9 students, each student will get 187 / 9 = 20 stationery items. Hence, Charlie carries 23 more than the rest of the students combined.
Response:  We know that Greeshma is 125 years old and Alkusin is 70 years old. So, the difference between their ages is 55 years (125 - 70 = 55). Therefore, Alkusin's age is 55 + 70 = 125 years old.
Response:  We know that there are 25 roses in total and 8 of them are red. So, the number of non-red roses is 25 - 8 = 17. Therefore, there are 17 white or yellow roses.

Response:  Firstly, we know that the age of the person is 23 years old and will be 34 years old in 10 years. So, the difference between their current age and future age is 11 years (34 - 23 = 11). Therefore, there are 11 years left for the person to reach the next level of seniority.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Gregor Samsa is transformed into an insect. So, he has eight legs instead of two arms and two legs like a human being. Therefore, his body shape changes to an octagon (8-sided) rather than a square or rectangle as in humans. Now, let's calculate the number of sides of each limb based on the given information:  Limbs: 2 pairs of wings + 6 legs = 8 total limbs. Each wing has 3 segments (base, middle, tip), so there are 3 x 2 = 6 segments per pair of wings. Similarly, each leg has 5 segments (ankle, foot, shin, thigh, hip), so there are 5 x 6 = 30 segments for all six legs. Total number of segments: 6 x 30 = 180 segments. Since each segment has a length of approximately 1 cm, the total length of all segments would be: 180 x 1 cm = 180 cm. Now, let's convert this measurement to meters: 1 meter = 100 cm, so: 180 cm x 100 cm/m = 18,000 mm. Finally, since Gregor Samsa is now an insect, his height is measured in millimeters rather than centimeters or meters. Therefore, his height is approximately 18,000 mm.
Response:  The company provides an annual salary of Rs. 60000 to its employees and deducts 10% as service tax. If there are 30 employees in the company, then the total amount of service tax deducted would be Rs. 600 x 30 = Rs. 18000. So, the net salary paid to each employee is Rs. 60000 - Rs. 18000 = Rs. 42000. Now, let's calculate the average salary for the last 5 years. For that, we need to find out the total salary paid to all employees during those 5 years. Let's assume that the number of employees remained constant at 30 throughout those 5 years. Then, the total salary paid to all employees over those 5 years would be Rs. 60000 x 30 x 5 = Rs. 720000. Therefore, the average salary for the last 5 years is Rs. 720000 / 5 = Rs. 144000 per year.
Response:  We know that there are 88,000 cockroaches in total and we want to find out how many will be left after 75% of them have been killed. So, let's calculate 75% of 88,000 which is equal to 64,800. Now, we need to subtract the number of cockroaches that were already dead (23,200) from the remaining ones (64,800). Therefore, the final number of cockroaches left after 75% of them have been killed is 41,600.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Christie has 75 puzzles in total and wants to give them away as gifts. Out of these, she has already given 16 puzzles away. So, there are 59 remaining puzzles left with her. Now, out of these 59 puzzles, she wants to give 20 away as gifts to her friends. Therefore, the number of puzzles left with Christie after giving away 20 puzzles is 39 (59 - 20).
Response:  We know that there are 10 dinosaurs in total and each of them has 5 eggs. So, we have 10 x 5 = 50 eggs in total. Now, let's assume that out of these 50 eggs, 20 are fertile (i.e., can hatch into baby dinosaurs). Therefore, the number of baby dinosaurs that will be born is 20. Since each baby dinosaur takes 5 years to grow up, the total number of dinosaurs after 5 years will be 20 x 5 = 100. So, the answer is 100.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times Jan Mariyam has appeared in Sinthikkal movies. From the given information, we know that she has acted in 5 movies with him. So, her appearance count is 5. Now, let's move on to finding out how many times Chacko Rajan has directed movies with Jan Mariyam. According to the question, he has directed 3 movies with her. Therefore, his direction count towards Jan Mariyam is also 3. Finally, we need to add these two counts together to get the total number of movies that Jan Mariyam and Chacko Rajan have worked together in. Hence, their combined movie count is 8 (5 + 3).
Response:  We know that Emily has 4 pets - dog, cat, parrot, and snake. She also knows how to play jazz music and can speak English fluently. Now let's calculate the number of hours she spends with each pet per day.  Dog - 3 hours/day Cat - 2 hours/day Parrot - 1 hour/day Snake - 1 hour/day Total time spent with pets = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 hours/day Now we need to subtract the time spent playing jazz from the total time spent with pets. Let's assume she plays jazz for 2 hours every day. Time spent playing jazz = 2 hours/day Total time spent with pets after playing jazz = 7 - 2 = 5 hours/day So, Emily spends 5 hours per day with her pets after playing jazz.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 400 meters in one kilometer. So, if we convert 400 meters to kilometers, we get:

400 m = 0.4 km

Now, we have been given that the speed of the jeep is 40 km/h. To find out how many hours it will take for the jeep to cover 400 meters, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Time = 400 m / 40 km/h = 10 minutes

Therefore, the jeep will take 10 minutes to cover 400 meters."
Response:  We know that there are 12 months in a year and each month has either 30 or 31 days. So, if we multiply 12 x 30 = 360 days in a non-leap year and 12 x 31 = 378 days in a leap year, then the total number of days in an Indian non-leap year is 360 + 58 = 418 days. Similarly, for an Indian leap year, it is 378 + 58 = 436 days. Therefore, the difference between the two years is 436 - 418 = 18 days.
Response:  We have to find out how many 2/5 th part and 2/3 parts are in 200 grams of rice. So, we need to divide 200 grams into equal parts.  Since there are 16 parts in 1 cup, we can divide 200 grams into 16 equal parts. Therefore, each part is 12.5 grams (200 g / 16 = 12.5 g). Now, let's find out how many 2/5 th parts and 2/3 parts are in 12.5 grams of rice. To do this, we need to divide 12.5 grams into equal parts using the ratios given in the question. For 2/5 th part, we have to divide 12.5 grams into 8 equal parts (since there are 4 parts in 1/5), so each part is 1.5 grams (12.5 g / 8 = 1.5 g). Similarly, for 2/3 part, we have to divide 12.5 grams into 6 equal parts (since there are 2 parts in 2/3), so each part is 2.17 grams (12.5 g / 6 = 2.17 g). Therefore, there are 13 2/5 th parts and 11 2/3 parts in 200 grams of rice.
Response:  Harish had 9 manjis (coins) in his pocket. He gave one manji to Jayasheelan, who is his friend. So, now Harish has 8 manjis left. Then, he met another person named Suresh and gave him 2 manjis. Now, Harish has 6 manjis left. Finally, he met yet another person named Ramesh and gave him 1 manji. Therefore, the total number of manjis that Harish gave away is 8 + 2 = 10.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times Fred can eat one pizza in a day. As per the question, Fred eats 8 slices of pizza every time he takes a bite. So, if he eats pizza for 16 hours continuously without taking any break, then he will have eaten 16 x 8 = 128 slices of pizza in total. Now, let's calculate how much time it would take him to finish one whole pizza. Since each slice takes 30 minutes to digest, it means that Fred needs 30 minutes to finish one entire pizza. Therefore, if he is eating pizza non-stop for 16 hours, it would take him 16 x 30 = 480 minutes or 8 hours and 20 minutes to finish one whole pizza. So, Fred does not eat more than one pizza in a day as he cannot eat more than what his stomach can hold.
Response:  We know that there are 30 cars in total and we have to find out how many of them will be left after 15 minutes. So, let's calculate the number of cars that will be left after 15 minutes.  Out of 30 cars, 15 cars will be gone in 15 minutes (as per the question). So, the remaining cars after 15 minutes = Total cars - Number of cars gone in 15 minutes = 30 - 15 = 15 cars. Therefore, 15 cars will be left after 15 minutes.
Response:  Meri is 18 years old and has been in the hostel for 3 months. She has 15 friends in her hostel, including herself. Among them, 4 are boys, and the remaining 11 are girls. Out of these 11 girls, 3 have blue eyes, 2 have brown eyes, and 6 have black eyes. So, there are altogether 7 different eye colors among the 15 friends of Meri. Now, let's count how many times each color appears in the group of 15 friends: Blue eyes - 3 Brown eyes - 2 Black eyes - 6 Total number of different eye colors - 7 Therefore, the answer to the question is 7.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 4 suhurthus in one day and each suhurthu has 20 tavans (units). So, the total number of tavans in one day is 4 x 20 = 80 tavans. Now, we are given that Joemon took 1/4 part of the total tavans in one day as his share. Therefore, he got 80 / 4 = 20 tavans. Next, we are told that Munna took 10 tavans from Joemon's share. So, Joemon had 20 - 10 = 10 tavans left after giving it to Munna. Finally, we are asked how many more tavans Joemon would have if he gave 60 tavans to another person. Therefore, the answer is 60 - 10 = 50 additional tavans that Joemon would have if he gave all his remaining tavans to another person.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many students are there in each of the four categories mentioned in the question.  From the question, we know that there are 4 students in the first category, 6 students in the second category, 8 students in the third category and 10 students in the fourth category.  Therefore, the total number of students in these categories is: 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 38 students.  Next, we need to find out how many students will be present in the exam hall after 4 days.  From the question, we know that 20 students from the social science stream will be absent for 4 days, which means they will not be present in the exam hall during those days.  So, the total number of students who will be present in the exam hall after 4 days is: 38 - 20 = 18 students.  Finally, we need to find out how many students will be present in the exam hall after 7 days.  From the question, we know that 7 students from the art stream will be absent for 7 days, which means they will not be present in the exam hall during those days.  So, the total number of students who will be present in the exam hall after 7 days is: 18 - 7 = 11 students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jon is tall and has long hair. So, his height can be estimated to be around 6 feet or more (based on the average height of an adult male). Now, let's consider the length of his hair. If it's shoulder-length or longer, then it would take up some space on his head, reducing the volume of his hair overall. Assuming his hair is around shoulder-length, we can estimate its volume as follows: Volume of hair = Length x Width x Thickness Where length is the distance from the scalp to the end of the hair, width is the diameter of each strand of hair, and thickness is the cross-sectional area of each strand. Since we don't have access to these exact measurements, we'll use rough estimates based on common values for human hair. Let's assume the length of Jon's hair is around 12 inches (30 cm), the width is around 0.07 mm (which is a typical value for human hair), and the thickness is around 0.5 mm (also a typical value). Using these values, we can calculate the volume of Jon's hair as follows: Volume of hair = 12 in x 0.07 in x 0.5 mm = 3.9 cubic centimeters (cm³) Now, let's convert this volume to milliliters (mL): Volume of hair = 3.9 cm³ x (1 mL / 100 cm³) = 39 mL Finally, since Jon has a lot of hair, we can estimate that he has around 100 times more volume than what we calculated earlier - around 3900 mL (or approximately 4 liters). Therefore, if Jon were to cut all his hair off, he would lose around 4 liters of volume from his head!
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 miles in an Indian mile and 10 minutes in an hour. So, if it takes 3 hours to reach the destination, then the distance is 3 x 60 = 180 miles. Now, we need to find out how many miles Nagarathi will walk per minute. We know that he walks at a speed of 42 miles per hour, so his walking speed is 42 / 60 = 0.7 miles/minute. Therefore, Nagarathi will walk 0.7 miles in 10 minutes, which means he will cover a total distance of 0.7 x 60 = 42 miles during those 10 minutes.
Response:  We know that there are 1000 coins in total and we have to find out how many coins will be left after 500 coins are taken away from the box. So, the number of coins left after taking 500 coins is 500 - 1000 = -500 coins. Therefore, there will be -500 coins left in the box if 500 coins are taken away.
Response:  We know that there are 10 coders and each coder can write at most 5 bugs per minute. So, in one minute, a total of 50 bugs (10 coders x 5 bugs/minute) will be written. Now, we need to calculate how many bugs will be fixed in one minute. As there are 4 bug fixers for every 10 coders, so in one minute, 40 bugs (4 bug fixers / 10 coders) will be fixed. Therefore, the difference between the number of bugs written and the number of bugs fixed is 10 - 40 = -30 bugs.
"Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if Jonin is born on Monday at 10 AM, then he will be 7 days old on Sunday at 10 AM. Now, let's calculate his age in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Jonin's age in minutes from Monday to Saturday is:
Monday - 7 x 60 = 420 minutes
Tuesday - 7 x 60 = 420 minutes
Wednesday - 7 x 60 = 420 minutes
Thursday - 7 x 60 = 420 minutes
Friday - 7 x 60 = 420 minutes
Saturday - 7 x 60 = 420 minutes
Now, let's find out how many minutes Jonin is old on Sunday. Since Sunday is the seventh day, Jonin will be zero years old on Sunday at 10 AM. Therefore, his age in minutes on Sunday is:
Sunday - 0 x 60 = 0 minutes
So, Jonin is 420 minutes old on all six days of the week except for Sunday, when he is zero minutes old."
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 30 minutes. There are 60 seconds in one minute, so there are 60 x 30 = 1800 seconds in 30 minutes. Now, we need to convert this time into hours. There are 60 minutes in one hour, so we can divide the total number of seconds by 60 to get the number of hours. Therefore, 1800 seconds / 60 = 30 hours. So, the answer is 30 hours.
Response:  Henrik is currently at level 110 and has 15 eggs in his inventory. To reach level 120, he needs to collect 10 more eggs. So, he will need 3 more eggs to reach level 120. Since each egg gives him 1 experience point, he will gain 3 x 1 = 3 experience points when he reaches level 120. Therefore, the answer is 3.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much money the company spends on gas for each vehicle in its fleet of 50 vehicles. Since the cost of gas is $3 per gallon and the company uses an average of 20 gallons of gas per day, the daily gas expense for one vehicle would be:

$3/gallon x 20 gallons/day = $60/day

Now, let's calculate the total monthly gas expense for all 50 vehicles:

$60/day x 30 days/month = $1800/month

Next, we need to find out how many hours each driver works per week. Assuming that each driver works 40 hours per week (which is a reasonable estimate), we can calculate the total number of working hours per month as follows:

40 hours/week x 4 weeks/month = 160 hours/month

Finally, we can calculate the total fuel cost for the entire company by multiplying the monthly gas expense by the number of working hours per month:

$1800/month x 160 hours/month = $276,000/month

So, the total fuel cost for the entire company is approximately $276,000 per month."

Response:  Rajan has 15 days to spend his vacation and he wants to divide it equally among 5 friends. So each friend will get 3 days of vacation with Rajan. Therefore, there are 5 options for the number of days that Rajan can spend with each friend: 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15. Since we are asked to choose one option from these five, the correct answer is (D) 12 days.
Response:  Jamaline's phone has 1800 photos. Each photo can be edited with 50 filters. So, in total, there are 1800 x 50 = 90,000 edits possible. Now, we need to find out how many photos Brandon can edit using these filters. Since he is an expert, he can edit 5 times more than Jamaline, which means he can edit 90,000 / 5 = 18,000 photos. Therefore, Brandon can edit 18,000 photos using Jamaline's filters.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many cubes of size 3x3x3 are there in total. Since each cube has a volume of 3^3 = 27 cubic centimeters, so altogether there are 27 x 10 = 270 cubes. Now, let's find out how many cubes of size 4x4x4 are there. Each such cube has a volume of 4^4 = 256 cubic centimeters, so altogether there are 256 / 10 = 25.6 cubes. Finally, let's find out how many cubes of size 5x5x5 are there. Each such cube has a volume of 5^5 = 125 cubic centimeters, so altogether there are 125 / 10 = 12.5 cubes. So, the total number of cubes is 270 + 25.6 + 12.5 = 318 cubes.
Response:  We have to find out how many trips of 120 tires and one cap can be made with 7:13 hours of work per day.  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of minutes available for work in a day.  There are 1440 minutes in a day (24 x 60).  Now, let's divide the total number of minutes available for work in a day by the time taken for each trip.  The time taken for each trip is given as 7:13 hours, which means it takes 7 hours and 13 minutes to complete one trip.  Therefore, the number of trips that can be completed in a day = Total minutes available for work / Time taken for each trip = 1440 minutes / 7 hours 13 minutes = 195 trips. So, there can be 195 trips of 120 tires and one cap made with 7:13 hours of work per day.
Response:  Jon is 35 years old and has been working for 12 years. He earns $80,000 per year and saves $20,000 of that amount. Therefore, he has saved a total of $240,000 ($80,000 x 12 years). Now, let's calculate how much money he can withdraw from his retirement fund each year. According to the formula provided in the question, he can withdraw up to 4% of his account balance each year. So, if we divide $240,000 by 4%, we get $9,600 (round off to nearest integer). Therefore, Jon can withdraw $9,600 per year from his retirement fund.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many seats are available in each classroom. According to the question, there are 6 classrooms and each classroom has 40 students, so the total number of seats available is 6 x 40 = 240.

From the question, we know that 18 students have passed in Class A, 22 students have passed in Class B, 15 students have passed in Class C, 27 students have passed in Class D, 19 students have passed in Class E, and 23 students have passed in Class F. So, the total number of students who have passed is 18 + 22 + 15 + 27 + 19 + 23 = 155. Finally, we need to find out how many students have failed in each class. From the question, we know that 85 students have failed in Class A, 78 students have failed in Class B, 63 students have failed in Class C, 55 students have failed in Class D, 46 students have failed in Class E, and 42 students have failed in Class F. So, the total number of students who have failed is 85 + 78 + 63 + 55 + 46 + 42 = 425. Therefore, the answer is 425.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how much money Adrian has spent so far in buying gifts for Leila. According to the question, Adrian has already bought 30 gifts and each gift cost him Rs 500. Therefore, he has spent a total of Rs 15,000 (30 x Rs 500) on gifts so far. Now, we are asked how much more he needs to spend to buy another 40% of Leila's favorite things. To calculate this, we can use the formula: Total Cost = (Total Value / Percentage) x 40%. In this case, the total value is Rs 20,000 (as per the question), which means that Adrian needs to spend an additional amount equal to 40% of Rs 20,000, i.e., Rs 8,000 (Rs 20,000 x 40%). So, the total amount that Adrian needs to spend on buying gifts for Leila is Rs 15,000 + Rs 8,000 = Rs 23,000.
Response:  We know that there are 30 peppers in one packet of Mi-Gulu. So, if we have to calculate how many packets of Mi-Gulu will be required to fill 100 bags of rice, we can divide the number of bags of rice (100) by the number of peppers in one packet (30). This gives us an estimate of 3.33 packets of Mi-Gulu needed for each bag of rice. Therefore, to fill 100 bags of rice, approximately 333 packets of Mi-Gulu will be required.
Response:  We know that there are 5 apples and 8 oranges in the basket. So, if we take out one apple from the basket, then the number of apples will be 4 (5 - 1). Now, let's consider the oranges.

Response:  Firstly, we know that Sadhik had 8 mani stones in his possession and he gave one to each of the eight people who came for the interview. So, there are 8 people who received a mani stone from Sadhik.  Now, let's consider the situation where all the eight people who received a mani stone from Sadhik come back after 7 days. In this case, there will be a total of 8 x 8 = 64 people present at the interview (including Sadhik). Therefore, the number of mani stones left with Sadhik after 7 days is 8 - 64 = -56.
Response:  Rosie has $10 in her pocket and spends $3 on something. Now she has $7 left. To find out how much more money she has than the previous amount, we need to subtract the amount spent from the original amount. So, the answer is $7 - $3 = $4.
Response:  Jenny has 60 cats in her house and she wants to know how many of them are black. So, if we assume that all 60 cats are present in the room where the offense took place, then there will be 60/2 = 30 black cats in the room. Since each cat can have multiple owners, let's assume that each black cat has one owner. Therefore, the number of owners of black cats is 30. Now, since Jenny is the only person who can see the offense, it means that she is the owner of at least one black cat. So, the answer is 1.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 12 spoonfuls of rice in one bowl. So, if there are 30 bowls, then there will be 360 spoonfuls of rice (30 x 12 = 360). Now, let's consider how many spoonfuls of rice are left after 5 people have eaten from the same bowl. Since each person has taken 4 spoonfuls, and there were initially 360 spoonfuls, then after 5 people have eaten, there will be 360 - 20 = 340 spoonfuls of rice left. Therefore, the answer is 340.
Response:  We know that there are 38 chicken soup recipes and 6 vegetable soup recipes. So, if we want to find out how many more chicken soup recipes than vegetable soup recipes, we need to subtract the number of vegetable soup recipes from the total number of soup recipes.

Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 500 people in one ashram and each person has to walk for 24 minutes. So, the total time taken by all 500 people to complete one round is 500 x 24 = 12,000 seconds. Now, let's consider the number of rounds that can be completed in an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide the total time taken by all 500 people to complete one round (12,000 seconds) by 60 to get the number of rounds that can be completed in an hour - 12,000 seconds / 60 = 200 rounds per hour. Therefore, the answer is 200 rounds per hour.
Response:  We have to find out how many elves can fit in each gram of Santa's sack.  Since there are 60 seeds in one gram, and each seed has 10 elves inside it, we need to divide 60 by 10 to get the number of elves that can fit in one gram. So, the answer is 6 elves per gram. Now, let's calculate how many elves can fit in Santa's sack. If Santa has 320 grams of presents (as given in the question), then he has 320 x 6 = 1920 elves in his sack!
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josephine has 500 dollars in May month and she spends 60 dollars in June month. So, her remaining amount of money after spending is $440 ($500 - $60). Now, let's calculate how much money she will have in July month if she doesn't spend anything. The total amount of money she had in all three months is $440 + $440 + $440 = $1280. Therefore, her balance amount in July month would be $1280 - $60 = $1220.

Response:  We know that there are 5 videos of Brahmanandam in each group. So, if we have 3 groups, then the total number of videos of Brahmanandam will be 5 x 3 = 15 videos.  Now, let's consider the second part of the question. If there are 5 videos of Brahmanandam in each group, and we have 5 groups, then the total number of videos of Brahmanandam will be 5 x 5 = 25 videos. Therefore, the answer is (A) 25 videos.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many triangles are there in each of the 27 shapes given in the question.  For example, among the 27 shapes, there are 3 circles, and each circle has 12 points (i.e., vertices). So, the number of triangles in each circle is 12 x 3 = 36. Similarly, there are 5 squares, and each square has 4 corners or vertices. Therefore, the number of triangles in each square is 4 x 5 = 20. Now, let's count the total number of triangles in all the 27 shapes: 36 + 20 + 18 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 150. Therefore, there are 150 triangles in the 27 shapes given in the question.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to calculate the total cost of the items that Roty has purchased. The cost of each item is as follows:  Rooter 2 sub-soilers = Rs. 7.50 x 2 = Rs. 15.00; 2 bags of cement = Rs. 1.50 x 2 = Rs. 3.00; and 2 kukkis (small containers) = Rs. 1.00 x 2 = Rs. 2.00. Therefore, the total cost of the items that Roty has purchased is Rs. 15.00 + Rs. 3.00 + Rs. 2.00 = Rs. 20.00. Now, we need to find out how much percentage of the total cost Roty has paid using his 20% discount coupon. To do this, we need to divide the amount he paid after applying the discount by the total cost of the items he purchased. So, Rs. 20.00 / Rs. 20.00 x 100 = 100%. Hence, Roty has paid the full amount for all the items he purchased."
"Response:  We have to find out how many chances are there for each of the 75 questions in the examination hall. Since there are 5 options for each question, we can assume that there will be 5 chances for each question. So, the total number of chances for all 75 questions is 5 x 75 = 375. Now, let's consider the first option - ""If you get 8 marks or more in any one question, you will get full marks for that question."" If this happens, then the total number of chances for all 75 questions becomes 375 - 8 = 367. Similarly, if none of the options happen, then the total number of chances remains 375. Therefore, the answer is (A) 367."
Response:  We know that there are 22 gambols in one mardhur yanthra. So, if we have 12 mardhurs, then the total number of gambols will be 12 x 22 = 264 gambols. Therefore, the answer is 264.
Response:  We have to find out how many cars are there in total and then calculate the number of cars that can fit in each row.  So, let's start with the first part of the question - How many cars are there in total?  Based on the question, we know that there are 20 cars in total. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question - Can all these cars fit in one row? No, they cannot because the length of each car is given as 12 meters and the width of each row is given as 4 meters. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of cars by the number of rows available. In this case, we have 4 rows available, so we will divide the total number of cars by 4. Thus, we have 5 cars per row (20 / 4 = 5). So, the answer to the question is 5.

Now, we need to find out how many more tusks belong to Rajanikanta's camp compared to other camps. According to the question, Rajanikanta's camp has 1200 tusks more than other camps. Therefore, the total number of tusks in Rajanikanta's camp is 3500 + 1200 = 4700 tusks.
Response:  Jordon has 7 days in a week and he works for 8 hours a day, so he works for 56 hours (7 days x 8 hours/day) in a week. Now, let's calculate how much money he can save if he doesn't spend anything during those 56 hours. The cost of living in Kerala is around Rs. 10 per hour, so if Jordon doesn't spend any money during those 56 hours, he will have saved Rs. 560 (56 hours x Rs. 10/hour). Therefore, the answer is Rs. 560.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times 2 dollars can buy something. As per the question, 2 dollars can buy 3 items of small things and 3 items of medium things. So, total number of small things that 2 dollars can buy = 3 x 3 = 9. Similarly, total number of medium things that 2 dollars can buy = 3 x 3 = 9. Now, let's calculate the cost of each item in dollars. Cost of one small thing = $1 / 9 = $0.11 (approximately). Cost of one medium thing = $1 / 9 = $0.11 (approximately). Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. We are asked to find out how much money will be left after buying all these things. Total amount spent on buying all the things = Number of small things x Cost of one small thing + Number of medium things x Cost of one medium thing = 9 x $0.11 + 9 x $0.11 = $1.09. Therefore, there will be $0.91 left after buying all these things.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many dogs are there in the world. According to the question, there are 1 billion dogs in the world. Now, let's calculate the number of dog owners. As per the question, each dog has 3-4 owners, so the total number of dog owners would be 3 x 4 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 dog owners for every 1 billion dogs in the world. Next, we need to find out how much time these dog owners spend with their pets. According to the question, an average dog owner spends around 16 minutes with their pet daily. Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of time spent by all dog owners with their pets. Since there are 12 dog owners for every 1 billion dogs, and each dog owner spends around 16 minutes with their pet daily, the total amount of time spent by all dog owners with their pets is 12 x 16 = 192 minutes. So, the answer is 192 minutes.
Response:  We know that Jonin has 100 pains in his head due to the heat of the heater. Now, we are asked how many more pains Jonin will have after 5 years. To find this out, we need to calculate the increase in temperature over those 5 years. Assuming an average annual temperature increase of 0.5 degrees Celsius (which is a reasonable estimate), we can calculate the total temperature increase over 5 years as follows: Temperature increase = 0.5 degrees Celsius x Number of years = 0.5 degrees Celsius x 5 years = 2.5 degrees Celsius So, after 5 years, Jonin's head will be 2.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it is now. Therefore, the answer is 2.5.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many boxes of chocolates are there in total. From the question, we know that there are 500 chocolate pieces and each box contains 20 chocolates. So, the number of boxes is:

 Number of boxes = Total number of chocolate pieces / Number of chocolates per box
= 500 / 20
= 25 boxes

Now, we need to find out how many layers of wrapping paper are needed for each box. According to the question, one layer of wrapping paper is required for every 3 chocolates. Since there are 25 boxes, the number of layers of wrapping paper needed is:

 Number of layers of wrapping paper = Total number of chocolate pieces / Number of chocolates per layer
= 500 / 3
= 167 layers (round off to nearest integer)

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of layers of wrapping paper required for all the boxes. Since there are 25 boxes, the total number of layers of wrapping paper required is:

Total number of layers of wrapping paper = Number of layers of wrapping paper per box x Number of boxes
= 167 x 25
= 4175 layers (round off to nearest integer)

So, the answer to the question is 4175 layers of wrapping paper are required to wrap 500 chocolate pieces."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 30 tenets in the first six mandalis and each mandali has 6 tenets. So, the total number of tenets in the first six mandalis is 30 x 6 = 180. Now, we are asked how many more tenets will be added to these 180 tenets if another 6 mandalis are formed with each mandali having 6 tenets. To find this out, we need to multiply the number of tenets in the previous group (180) by the number of new groups being formed (6). Therefore, the total number of tenets after forming additional 6 mandalis is 180 x 6 = 1080. So, the answer is 1080.
Response:  We know that there are 12 dogs and 10 cats in Brittany's house. Each dog has 5 puppies, and each cat has 3 kittens. So, the total number of offspring (puppies + kittens) is: 12 x 5 = 60 puppies + 10 x 3 = 30 kittens = 90 offspring. Now, we need to find out how many of these offspring belong to Brittany. Since she is the owner of the house, all the offspring belong to her. Therefore, the number of offspring belonging to Brittany is 90 / 8 = 11.25 offspring.
Response:  We know that Jay has 12 Facebook friends who are also fans of his work. So, if we assume that each fan follows him equally, then Jay has 12/1 = 12 fans overall. Now, let's consider the possibility that some of these fans may not be active or engaged with Jay's content. For example, maybe they only follow him out of obligation or because they used to enjoy his work but haven't kept up with it recently. In this case, we can estimate that a certain percentage of his total fans (let's say 20%) may not be actively engaging with his content. This means that instead of having 12 fans overall, Jay actually has 12 x 0.8 = 9.6 fans who are truly engaged and following him closely. Therefore, the answer is 9.6.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many minutes are there in an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, if it takes 440 minutes for the steam to pass through the pipe, then the diameter of the pipe is:

 Pipe Diameter = 440 / 60 = 7.33 meters

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the steam to pass through the pipe. Since the pipe is 7.33 meters long and the steam travels at a speed of 1 meter per minute, the time taken for the steam to pass through the pipe is:

Time Taken = Length of Pipe x Speed of Steam = 7.33 x 1 = 7.33 minutes

So, the steam takes 7.33 minutes to pass through the pipe. Now, let's convert this time into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

Hours = Minutes / 60 = 7.33 / 60 = 0.1225 hours

Therefore, the steam takes approximately 0.1225 hours (or 7.33 minutes) to pass through the pipe."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in 25 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 25 weeks is equal to 25 x 7 = 175 days. Now, let's calculate the number of hours that Aditya has spent with his grandfather in those 175 days. We know that Aditya spends 5 hours per day with his grandfather, so he has spent a total of 5 x 175 = 875 hours with him. Finally, we have to convert these hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 875 hours are equal to 875 x 60 = 51,000 minutes. So, Aditya has spent a total of 51,000 minutes with his grandfather.
Response:  We know that 10 dolphins can eat 0.10 kg of fish in one day. So, if we want to calculate how many kilograms of fish 100 dolphins can eat in one day, we need to multiply the number of dolphins by the amount of fish each dolphin can eat. Therefore, 100 dolphins can eat 10 x 0.10 = 10 kg of fish in one day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dev has to give an answer within 30 seconds. So, let's assume the time taken for each question is 1 second (as it is a rapid fire round).  Now, there are 5 questions in total. Therefore, the total time required for all the questions would be 5 x 30 = 150 seconds or 2 and half minutes.  So, Dev will have 2 and half minutes to answer all the five questions.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many classes are there in each time slot.  For തിങ്കളാഴ്ച (morning), we have 4 classes -  Kerala University Time Table for UG and PG Courses.  For ബുധനാഴ്ച (afternoon), we have 3 classes - Kerala University Time Table for UG and PG Courses.  For വെള്ളിയാഴ്ച (evening), we have 2 classes - Kerala University Time Table for UG and PG Courses. Therefore, the total number of classes that will be conducted during one day is 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 classes. Now, let's calculate the number of semesters based on the number of classes. If there are 9 classes in a day, then there will be 9 x 7 = 63 classes in a week. Since there are 8 weeks in an academic year, the total number of classes in an academic year is 63 x 8 = 504 classes. Finally, if there are 504 classes in an academic year, then there will be 504 / 16 = 31.25 semesters in a year. So, the answer is 31 semesters.
Response:  We have to find out how many times each number can be divided into 300 without leaving any remainder.  For example, 300 / 1 = 300 (no remainder).  Similarly, we can divide all numbers given in the question by 300 and find out the remainders as follows:  * 75 / 300 = 2 with a remainder of 150 * 120 / 300 = 4 with a remainder of 80 * 60 / 300 = 2 with a remainder of 20 * 4 / 300 = 1 with no remainder * 8 / 300 = 0 with a remainder of 290 So, there are 2, 4, 2, 0, and 1 possible ways to divide 300 using the numbers given in the question, respectively. Therefore, the total number of ways to divide 300 using these numbers is 2 + 4 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 10.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many days are there in each of the given periods.  For example, there are 365 days in a year, so for 1 year (200-400), it is 200 + 400 = 600 days. Similarly, for 2 years (200-800), it is 200 + 800 = 1000 days. Now, let's calculate the total number of days for all the given periods:  Total number of days = 600 + 1000 + 200 + 400 = 1800 days. Therefore, if there are 200 weeks in a year, then there will be approximately 9 months (based on 4 weeks per month) or 9 x 30 = 270 days left over after completing all the given periods. So, the answer is 270 days.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times 15 minutes is equal to an hour. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

15 minutes / 60 = 0.25 hours (or 1/4 of an hour)

Now, let's calculate how much time Blay and Kelu spend together in total:

Blay spends 15 minutes with Kelu every day, which means he spends 15 x 7 = 105 minutes with her in a week.

Kelu spends 30 minutes with Blay every day, which means she spends 30 x 7 = 210 minutes with him in a week.

In total, Blay and Kelu spend 105 + 210 = 315 minutes together in a week.

Finally, we need to convert this time into hours:

315 minutes / 60 = 5.25 hours (or approximately 5 hours and 15 minutes)

So, Blay and Kelu spend approximately 5 hours and 15 minutes together every week."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of raffle tickets that can be sold for each prize category. For the first prize, there are 4 penny prizes and 1 large prize, so the total number of tickets is 4 x 1 = 4. Similarly, for the second prize, there are 4 small prizes and 1 medium-sized prize, so the total number of tickets is 4 x 1 = 4. For the third prize, there are 4 small prizes and 1 small prize, so the total number of tickets is 4 x 1 = 4. And finally, for the fourth prize, there is only one prize, so the total number of tickets is 1. Therefore, the total number of raffle tickets that can be sold is 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13.
Response:  We have 11 coins and we need to find out how many of them are facing downwards.  So, let's count the number of coins that are facing downwards.  From the given options, option (D) is correct as there are 5 coins facing downwards. Therefore, the answer is 5.
Response:  We know that Veena has 17 tanks and she filled 7 tanks with water from one tank. So, there are 10 tanks left empty. Now, we need to find out how much water is left in Veena's remaining 10 tanks. Since each tank can hold 4 gallons of water, we have: Number of tanks = 10 Water capacity per tank = 4 gallons Total water left = Number of tanks x Water capacity per tank So, total water left = 10 x 4 = 40 gallons. Therefore, there are 40 gallons of water left in Veena's remaining 10 tanks.
Response:  Anakki has 10 noshathraangal and 6 kudirakals. Each noshathraangal has 5 kuravu and each kudirakal has 3 kuravus. So, in total, Anakki has 5 x 10 = 50 kuravus. Similarly, Luxini has 6 kudirakals and each kudirakal has 3 kuravus. Therefore, Luxini has 6 x 3 = 18 kuravus. Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of kuravus possessed by Anakki and Luxini. The difference is: 50 - 18 = 32 kuravus. Hence, more than 32 kuravus are possessed by Anakki compared to Luxini.
Response:  We know that the age of the baby is 20 months and the weight gain during this period is 20%. So, the total weight of the baby at 36 months will be: Total weight = (Initial weight x Growth rate) / Number of months  Therefore, the total weight of the baby at 36 months can be calculated as follows: Total weight = (20 kg x 20%) / 18 months = 45 kg Now, we need to find out how much percentage of weight gain occurs between 20 and 36 months. To do this, we need to subtract the initial weight from the final weight and divide it by the initial weight: Percentage of weight gain = (Final weight - Initial weight) / Initial weight = (45 kg - 20 kg) / 20 kg = 125% Therefore, the baby gains approximately 125% of its original weight between 20 and 36 months.
Response:  We have 5 cars, each with 4 doors and 1 driver. So, total number of doors = 5 x 4 = 20 doors. Now, we have 3 big houses, each with 5 rooms and 1 family. So, total number of rooms in all three houses = 3 x 5 = 15 rooms. Since there is only one car per house, total number of cars = 3. Therefore, total number of drivers = 3 / 4 = 0.75 drivers. Finally, since there are no other vehicles like bicycles or motorcycles, total number of wheels = 0 wheels.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jack can make in one day by working for 8 hours at $15 per hour. So, the calculation is:
$15 x 8 = $120
Now, let's find out how many days Jack can work to earn $350. Since he needs to pay $35 for each manikkur ( fraction of an acre), we need to divide the total amount he wants to earn ($350) by the cost per manikur ($35):
$350 / $35 = 10 manikurs
Therefore, Jack can work for 10 days to earn $350."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of people who have been affected by the floods in Kerala. According to the question, 1500 yojanas (a unit of distance) of land has been submerged under water, and out of that, 74 yojanas are inhabited areas. So, the total number of people affected can be calculated as follows: Total area affected = 1500 yojanas x 74% (inhabited area) = 113,000 hectares Area affected per person = 113,000 hectares / 1500 yojanas = 76 persons per yojana Now, let's assume that each person requires at least 10 square meters of dry land for survival. Therefore, the total number of people who require shelter can be calculated as follows: Total requirement of shelter = Number of people affected x Required space per person = 113,000 hectares x 10 square meters/hectare = 1,130,000 square meters Now, let's convert this value from hectares to square meters: 1,130,000 square meters / 10,000 square meters/hectare = 113,000 square kilometers Finally, we can round off the value to the nearest integer to get our final answer: Rounded off answer = 113,000 square kilometers.
Response:  Sandeep has 9 mothers and each mother has 4 children. So, in total, Sandeep has 9 x 4 = 36 cousins. Now, out of these 36 cousins, 15 are boys. Therefore, the number of girls among Sandeep's cousins is 36 - 15 = 21.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between two dates. We know that the date of birth of Sethu is March 10th and the date of death is August 28th. So, the difference between these two dates is approximately 3 months or 90 days. Therefore, the age of Sethu at the time of his death would be 3 x 365 = 1095 days.
Response:  Jimmi has 2 dogs and each dog eats 3 bowls of food per day. So, Jimmi needs to feed 6 bowls of food (2 x 3 = 6) to his dogs every day. Now, let's calculate how much food Jimmi needs to buy for 8 days. If he buys enough food for 1 day, then he needs to buy 6 bowls of food per day \* 8 days = 48 bowls of food. Therefore, Jimmi needs to buy 48 bowls of food for 8 days.
Response:  We know that Panchami is 30 days after Vishu. So, Vishu happened 30 days ago. Now, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice are left in the pot. Based on the information given in the passage, there were 10 measures (majjiram) of rice in the pot initially. Since each measure contains 5 kg of rice, the total amount of rice in the pot was 50 kg (10 x 5 kg). Now, since Panchami happened 30 days after Vishu, and it takes 20 days for the rice to get spoiled, there are only 10 kg of rice left in the pot now (50 kg - 20 days = 10 kg). Therefore, the answer is 10 kg.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many years old is Marching Band in human years. As per the given information, Marching Band has been around for 25 dog years, which means it is approximately 175 human years old (25 x 6 = 150). Now, let's calculate the age of Orion's Belt. According to the question, Orion's Belt is 4.3 light-years away from Earth. A light year is equal to 9.46 trillion kilometers, so Orion's Belt is approximately 40.8 trillion kilometers away from Earth (4.3 x 9.46 x 10^12). To convert this distance into human years, we can use the following formula: distance in light-years x speed of light in km/s / 100,000, where the speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. Using this value and the above calculation, we get: Orion's Belt is approximately 1.3 billion years old in human years (40.8 x 299,792,458 / 100,000). Therefore, the difference between the ages of Marching Band and Orion's Belt is approximately 1.3 billion - 175 = 1.275 billion years.

"Response:  We have to find out how many times the word ""സാലി"" appears in the given text and then calculate the average of those appearances.  The word ""സാലി"" appears 5 times in the given text. So, we can say that the frequency of the word ""സാലി"" is 5. Now, let's calculate the average of these appearances. To do this, we need to divide the total number of appearances of the word ""സാലി"" by the number of words in the given text. In this case, there are 100 words in the given text, so we can divide 5 (the number of appearances of the word ""സാലി"") by 100 to get the average. Therefore, the average appearance of the word ""സാലി"" in the given text is 5/100 = 0.05 or 5%."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total value of Jesica's assets. The value of her house is $800,000 and she has an investment portfolio worth $1 million. Therefore, the total value of her assets is $1.8 million. Now, let's calculate the percentage of assets that can be used to pay off debts. As per the question, 50% of the total value of assets can be used to pay off debts. So, the amount that can be used to pay off debts is $900,000 (50% of $1.8 million). Finally, let's calculate the remaining amount after paying off debts. The remaining amount is $900,000 minus the amount owed ($400,000), which is $500,000.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the baby will urinate in an hour. As per the question, the baby will urinate every 40 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the number of times the baby will urinate in an hour is:

$$ \frac{60}{40} = 1.5 $$

Now, let's calculate the total number of urinations in one day:

$$ Total Urinations = Number of hours in a day \times Number of urinations in an hour $$

As per the question, there are 24 hours in a day. So, the total number of urinations in a day is:

$$ Total Urinations = 24 \times 1.5 = 36 $$

Therefore, the baby will urinate 36 times in a day."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Huvan and Avan are brothers who have 3 dogs each, so in total they have 6 dogs. Now, let's calculate the cost of feeding these dogs for one month. According to the question, it costs ₹10 per kilogram of dog food, and Avant has 2 dogs that weigh 25 kg each, so their monthly dog food cost is ₹250 (25 x ₹10). Similarly, Huvan has 3 dogs that weigh 15 kg each, so his monthly dog food cost is ₹450 (3 x 25 x ₹10). Therefore, the total monthly dog food cost for both brothers is ₹700 (₹450 + ₹250). Now, we are also given that Orono has 5 dogs that weigh an average of 20 kg each, and he spends ₹50 per kilogram on dog food. So, his monthly dog food cost is ₹1000 (5 x 20 x ₹50). Finally, we are told that there are 25 dogs in all, including those belonging to Huvan and Avant, so the total monthly dog food cost for all the dogs is ₹1700 (₹700 + ₹1000).
Response:  We have 240 athletes in total and we need to divide them into two teams of 120 each. So, we will have 80 athletes in one team and 160 athletes in the other team. Now, let's assume that 50% of the athletes are javelin throwers, which means 120 athletes (half of 240) are javelin throwers. Therefore, there are 120 non-javelin throwers in the remaining 120 athletes. So, the number of athletes who are not javelin throwers is 120.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how much money Saayid has in his account. According to the question, he has Rs. 6000 in his account. Now, we need to calculate how many rupees are there in each of the four quarters of the year. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, and each quarter is equal to 3 months, we can say that each quarter contains 3 months x 30 days = 90 days. So, if Saayid has Rs. 6000 in his account, then he has Rs. 6000 / 90 days = Rs. 66.67 per day. Therefore, Saayid has Rs. 66.67 per day in his account.
Response:  We know that there are 16 monkeys in total (4 big ones and 12 small ones). So, if we take away 4 of the big monkeys, there will be 4 - 4 = 0 small monkeys left with each big monkey. Therefore, the number of small monkeys left with each big monkey is 12 / 4 = 3.
"Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times the number 10 appears in the given series of numbers. We can see that the number 10 appears twice in the series - once at position 3 and again at position 9. So, the total number of occurrences of the number 10 in the series is 2. Now, let's find out how many times each of the remaining numbers (except 10) appears in the series. We can see that the number 7 appears three times in the series - once at positions 1, 5, and 8. The number 4 appears twice - at positions 2 and 6. And the number 3 appears only once at position 4. Therefore, the total number of occurrences of each of these numbers except 10 in the series is as follows: Number 7 - 3; Number 4 - 2; Number 3 - 1. Finally, we need to add up all these totals to get the overall sum of the series. So, the answer to the question is: Sum = Total number of occurrences of 10 + Total number of occurrences of other numbers = 2 + (3 x 3) + (2 x 2) + (1 x 1) = 2 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 16."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many students are there in Saraswati School. We know that it is a school with 3/4 of the total number of students in Classes 1 to 7 being girls and the remaining boys. So, if there are x boys in these classes, then there are 3x/4 girls. Therefore, the total number of students in Saraswati School = x + (3x/4) = 5x/4. Now, we have to find out what percentage of students in each class are from rural areas. For this, we need to divide the number of rural students by the total number of students in that class. For example, if there are 20 rural students among the 30 students in Class 1, then the percentage of rural students in Class 1 = 20/30 × 100 = 66.67%. Similarly, for other classes, we can calculate the percentage of rural students as follows: Class 2: 25/40 × 100 = 62.5%, Class 3: 30/50 × 100 = 60%, Class 4: 20/40 × 100 = 50%, Class 5: 25/50 × 100 = 50%, Class 6: 30/60 × 100 = 50%, Class 7: 25/60 × 100 = 41.67%. Finally, we add up all these percentages to get the overall percentage of rural students in Saraswati School: Overall percentage of rural students in Saraswati School = 66.67% + 62.5% + 60% + 50% + 50% + 41.67% = 391.67%.
Response:  Sandeep has 200 lilies and he wants to distribute them equally among 5 friends. So, each friend will get 40 lilies (200 / 5 = 40). Now, let's consider Roshan's case. He is also given 40 lilies as per Sandeep's decision. But, Roshan has already received 200 lilies from someone else earlier, so he doesn't need any more lilies now. Therefore, the final distribution of lilies among the remaining four friends is: 40 + 40 = 80 lilies. Hence, the answer is 80.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Janan has earned as an engineer. According to the question, his monthly salary is Rs 50,000, which means he has earned:

Total earnings = Monthly salary x Number of days worked
= Rs 50,000 x 90 days
= Rs 4,50,000

Therefore, the answer to the question is Rs 4,50,000."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of seconds in 400 meters race. There are 100 meters in each lap, so there will be 4 laps in 400 meters race. Therefore, the total distance is 4 x 100 = 400 meters. Now, let's calculate the time taken for one lap. Since the runner can run at a speed of 40 km/h, it takes him/her 25 seconds to cover 100 meters (as per the given information). So, the time taken for one lap is 25 seconds x 4 = 100 seconds. Now, let's calculate the total time taken for all four laps. Therefore, the total time taken for 400 meters race is 4 x 100 = 400 seconds.

Now, if they want to divide these apples further into equal parts of 4 each, then Jenny will have 3 apples and her mother will have 4 apples. Therefore, the final answer is 3 + 4 = 7 apples.
Response:  We have to find out how many cubes are there in total and then calculate the number of cubes that can be formed using each size of cube.  Firstly, we know that there are 10 cubes in total. Now, let's see how many cubes can be formed using each size of cube.  For size 1 cube, we can form 10 cubes. For size 2 cube, we can form 40 cubes ( since 4 x 10 = 40). For size 3 cube, we can form 120 cubes (since 3 x 40 = 120). And for size 4 cube, we can form 60 cubes (since 4 x 15 = 60). So, altogether we can form 280 cubes using all sizes of cubes. Therefore, the answer is 280.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Manthri has Rs 100 in her bank account and she wants to invest it for 3 months with an interest rate of 2%. So, after 3 months, she will have earned an interest of Rs 2 (Rs 100 x 2%). Now, if she withdraws Rs 30 from her account, how much money will be left in her account? Therefore, the correct answer is Rs 70 (Rs 100 - Rs 30).
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice each farmer can produce in one day given that they work for 20 days and there are 10 farmers in total. So, we need to divide the total number of bags of rice produced (20 x 10 = 200) among the 10 farmers. Since each farmer works for 20 days, they will produce 20/20 = 1 bag of rice per day. Now, let's calculate the total number of bags of rice produced by all 40 farmers working for 30 days. We multiply the number of bags produced by each farmer per day (1) by the total number of farmers (40), which gives us 40 x 1 = 40 bags of rice per day. Finally, if we add the total number of bags produced by all 40 farmers working for 30 days (40 x 30 = 1200 bags) to the total number of bags produced by the initial 10 farmers working for 20 days (200 bags), we get a grand total of 1300 bags of rice produced over the course of 50 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Munna has Rs. 20.25 in his wallet and he wants to buy tickets for a movie which costs Rs. 4.50 each. So, he needs Rs. 91 (Rs. 20.25 x 4.50).  Now, let's assume that he also wants to buy some snacks which cost Rs. 33 per pack. Therefore, he needs an additional amount of Rs. 33. So, the total amount he needs is Rs. 124 (Rs. 91 + Rs. 33).
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times the word ""mani"" appears in the given text. We can do this by counting the number of occurrences of the word ""mani"" in the text.  After counting, we will get the result as follows:

Number of occurrences of ""mani"": 4
Now, let's move on to the next part of the question. The question asks us to find out how many times the word ""muni"" appears in the text after the word ""mani"". To do this, we need to count the number of occurrences of the word ""muni"" in the text starting from the position where the word ""mani"" ends.

Let's assume that the last occurrence of the word ""mani"" is at position x. Then, the first occurrence of the word ""muni"" after ""mani"" will be at position x + 1. Therefore, the total number of occurrences of the word ""muni"" in the text after ""mani"" will be:

Total number of occurrences of ""muni"": (x + 2)
So, the final answer to the question is:

Answer: (x + 2)"
Response:  We know that there are 100 days in an year and each day has 24 hours. So, total number of hours in a year is 100 x 24 = 2400 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours are spent by a student studying for one hour everyday during these 100 days. Therefore, total number of hours studied by the student is 2400 / 100 = 24 hours per day. Since the student studies for 1.5 times more than the usual time, he spends (24/1.5) = 16 hours per day studying extra. So, in total, the student spends 24 + 16 = 40 hours studying during these 100 days.
Response:  We have to find out how many marbles are left after 10 turns of drawing without replacement.  Each turn we draw one marble and put it back in the bag. So, after 10 turns, there will be 50 - 10 = 40 marbles left in the bag. Now, we need to calculate the probability that exactly 30 marbles are drawn from the remaining 40 marbles. To do this, we divide the number of marbles drawn (30) by the total number of marbles remaining (40). Therefore, the probability is 30/40 or 3/4.
Response:  Firstly, there are 365 days in a year. Now, let's consider that each day has 24 hours and each hour has 60 minutes. So, we have 365 x 24 = 8760 hours in a year. Next, we need to calculate how many times an elephant can walk 18 miles per hour. Therefore, we divide 8760 hours by 18 miles per hour, which gives us approximately 490,400 walks per year. Finally, we multiply this number by 365 days to get the total number of walks an elephant can take in its lifetime, which is approximately 176,672,000 walks.
Response:  We know that there are 20 students in the class and each student has to pay Rs 10 as examination fee. So, the total amount of money collected from all the students is 20 x 10 = Rs 200. Now, we need to find out how much each student has to pay towards the examination fee. To do this, we divide the total amount collected by the number of students, which is 20. Therefore, each student has to pay Rs 200 / 20 = Rs 10 per head.
Response:  We know that there are 8 pens in total and we want to find out how many pens will be left after using one pen for 1.20 dollars and another pen for 0.30 dollars. So, let's calculate it as follows:  For 1.20 dollars, we can use one pen completely, so we have 7 pens remaining = 8 - 1 = 7 pens. Similarly, for 0.30 dollars, we can use half of another pen, so we have 6 pens remaining = 7 - (0.30 / 1) = 6 pens. Therefore, after using both pens, we have 6 pens left.
Response:  We have to find out how many cars can fit in one row of 40 restrooms. Since each restroom has 2 urinals, we need to subtract 2 from 40 to get the number of car spaces available for parking. So, there are 38 car spaces available for parking (40 - 2). Now, let's assume that each car takes up 2 parking spaces, so we divide 38 by 2 to get the total number of cars that can park in one row of restrooms. Therefore, 19 cars can park in one row of 40 restrooms (38 / 2 = 19).
Response:  We know that there are 23786 actors in the movie industry and out of them, 8417 are male actors and 9092 are female actresses. So, the number of transgender actors is Bakki Janasamkhya Kuṭṭikāl (8417 + 9092) = 17509.
Response:  Firstly, there are 20 cards in total, and each card has a different number from 1 to 20 printed on it. So, there are 20 possible numbers that can be drawn from the deck. Now, let's consider the probability of drawing a particular number. Since there are only 20 cards with unique numbers, the probability of drawing any one of those numbers is 1/20 or approximately 0.05. Therefore, the expected value of the number of times the person will draw a card with the same number as their age is (0.05 x 20) = 1. So, the person can expect to draw a card with the same number as their age once every 20 attempts.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times Marakki can make 1000 rupees in one day. As per the question, he can do it 10 times, so the number of days required to earn 1 lakh rupees is 10 days. Now, let's calculate the total amount earned by Marakki in those 10 days. If he earns 1000 rupees per day, then his total earnings in 10 days will be 10 x 1000 = 10,000 rupees. So, the answer is (D) 10,000 rupees.
Response:  We know that Baldev has 5 liters of water in his container and he wants to share it equally among 10 people. So, each person will get 0.5 liters of water (5/10). Now, we are asked how many liters of water Arav will get if there are 20 people in total and they all want to drink from the same container. Well, if 10 people can get 0.5 liters each, then 20 people will get twice as much, i.e., 1 liter each (2 x 0.5 = 1). Therefore, Arav will get 1 liter of water.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jonin has Rs. 5000 as his initial investment and he gets 5% interest per annum. So, after one year, he will have Rs. 5000 x (1 + 0.05) = Rs. 5300. Now, in the second year, he again gets 5% interest on the new balance of Rs. 5300, which is Rs. 5300 x (1 + 0.05) = Rs. 5615. Similarly, in the third year, he gets 5% interest on the new balance of Rs. 5615, which is Rs. 5615 x (1 + 0.05) = Rs. 5947.50. Therefore, after three years, Jonin's total savings would be Rs. 5000 + Rs. 5300 + Rs. 5615 = Rs. 16815.50.
Response:  Joseph has 10 farmers working for him and each of them works for 5 months in a year. So, the total number of days they work is 5 x 10 = 50 days per year. Now, let's calculate how many bags of rice each farmer can produce in a year. Since there are 30 days in an average month, each farmer can produce 50 / 30 = 1.67 bags of rice per month. Therefore, the total number of bags of rice produced by all the farmers under Joseph's supervision in a year is 1.67 x 10 = 16.7 bags of rice per year.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in total for which the person is taking the course. From the question, we know that the person has taken the course for 3 divas (days). So, the total number of days = 3 days. Now, let's calculate the number of classes per day. According to the question, there are 7 classes in total and each class lasts for an hour. Therefore, the number of classes per day = Total number of classes / Number of days = 7 classes / 3 days = 2.33 classes per day. Since we can't have a fraction of a class, we will round off the value to 2 classes per day. Hence, the person has attended 2 classes per day on average during the course.
Response:  We have 22 large bags and 10 small bags. Each large bag contains 5 kg of rice, so there are 110 kg (22 x 5) of rice in total from the large bags. Similarly, each small bag contains 2 kg of rice, so there are 20 kg (10 x 2) of rice in total from the small bags. Therefore, the total weight of rice is 130 kg (110 + 20).
Response:  We know that Brinley has scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 in his five tests. So, we have to find out which score is closest to 93.  Comparing these scores with 93, we can see that only 100 is closer to 93 than any other score. Therefore, the answer is (D) 100.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 types of birds in the world and each bird has its own unique sound. So, if we want to identify which bird is making the noise, we need to listen carefully to the sound and try to match it with one of the 5 types of birds. If we can successfully match the sound with one of the 5 types, then we have identified the bird that made the noise. Now, let's consider the information provided in the question - ""The noise was heard for 3 seconds."" This means that we only got to hear the bird make the noise for a short period of time, so we don't have much information to go on. However, based on what we do know, we can narrow down our options further. We know that the bird made the noise at night, and this reduces the number of possible bird species even more. Finally, we are told that the bird made the noise once every 3 minutes. This tells us that the bird is likely to be a nocturnal bird that makes a distinctive call, and we can now use this information to make an educated guess about which bird might have made the noise. Based on all these factors, I would estimate that the bird that made the noise is most likely to be either a Nightingale or a Whipbird. Both of these birds are known to make distinctive calls during the nighttime hours, and they both fit the pattern of making a single noise every 3 minutes. Therefore, my answer is either a Nightingale or a Whipbird."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 chocolate bars in Joey's bag and each bar contains 80 grams of chocolate. So, the total weight of all the chocolate bars is:

25 x 80 = 2000 grams

Now, we need to find out how much weight Joey has lost due to the rain. We know that he had 1 kg (1000 grams) of chocolate before going outside and after getting wet, he only had 800 grams left. So, the weight he lost due to the rain is:

1000 - 800 = 200 grams

Therefore, the final weight of chocolate Joey has is:

2000 - 200 = 1800 grams"
Response:  Roshan has 4 balls in his pocket and he throws one ball at each of the four corners of the room. Now, there are 32 balls in total (4 x 8 = 32). Then, Roshan takes one ball from each corner and puts it back into his pocket. So, now there are 16 balls left in the room (4 x 4 = 16). Finally, Roshan takes all the remaining balls from the room and puts them back into his pocket. Therefore, after the fourth throw, there will be 0 balls left in the room.
Response:  We have to find out how many days it takes for 1200 dollars to become 1 lakh rupees at an interest rate of 8% per annum.  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount that can be earned as interest in one year.  The formula for calculating interest is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal is 1200 dollars, and the time period is 1 year (365 days). So, the interest earned will be: Interest = $1200 x 8% x 365 days = $970. Now, let's find out how much money you will have after 1 year. The new value of your investment will be: New Value = Principal + Interest = $1200 + $970 = $2170 After 1 year, your investment of $1200 will grow to $2170, which means you will earn $970 in interest.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students in both classes. The class teacher has 30 students and the art teacher has 20 students. So, the total number of students is 30 + 20 = 50 students. Now, let's find out how many students are there in each class. In the first class, there are 30 students, and in the second class, there are 20 students. Therefore, the number of students in each class is 30/50 x 100 = 60% and 20/50 x 100 = 40%. So, the percentage of students who are good at drawing is 60%, and the percentage of students who are not good at drawing is 40%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 42 divisions in Kerala and each division has 3 mutts. So, the total number of mutt divisions in Kerala is 42 x 3 = 126. Now, let's consider the case where all the 126 mutt divisions have equal number of temples. In this scenario, the number of temples in each mutt division would be 126 / 12 = 10.5 temples per division. However, since we know that some mutt divisions have more than 10 temples, we can conclude that the average number of temples per mutt division is less than 10.5. Therefore, the answer to the question is less than 10.5.
Response:  The length of Garikkal Parakkini's arm is 1.5 meters and his height is 6 meters. So, if he stretches out his arm fully, it will be 1.5 + 6 = 7.5 meters long. Now, we need to find out how much of Manikkunkoor can he touch with that stretched-out arm. According to the question, Manikkunkoor is 3 meters wide and 20 meters long. So, if Garikkal Parakkini stretches out his arm fully, he can touch an area of 3 x 20 = 60 square meters of Manikkunkoor. Therefore, the answer is 7.5 meters.
Response:  We know that in Dolly's store, there are 100 slots available for shopping.  Of these, 50 slots have already been taken up by customers who came earlier. So, the remaining 50 slots are available for the next customer. Now, let's assume that the next customer comes after 5 days (i.e., on the sixth day). Therefore, the total number of customers who will come to shop during the next 5 days is 5 x 50 = 250 customers. Since each customer can take only one slot, the total number of slots taken up by all these customers is also 250. Hence, the number of slots left vacant after they finish their shopping is 100 - 250 = -150 slots. So, Dolly has -150 slots available for the next customer.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, total number of hours in a week is 7 x 24 = 168 hours. Now, we need to find out how many hours are spent on watching TV during an average day. According to the question, an average person spends 4 hours per day watching TV. Therefore, total number of hours spent on watching TV in a week is 4 x 7 = 28 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many times 320 dollars can be divided into 32 dollar bills. To do this, we divide 320 by 32, which gives us 10. So, there are 10 groups of 32 dollars each that can be obtained from 320 dollars. Now, let's calculate how much money is left after giving 8 dollars to each of these 10 groups. We multiply 10 by 8, which gives us 80 dollars. Therefore, there are 80 dollars remaining after distributing 8 dollars to each of the 10 groups.
Response:  We have to find out how many days are there in 2000 dollars worth of gold. So, we need to divide $2000 by the price of one gram of gold per day.  The current price of one gram of gold is around $47. So, if we divide $2000 by $47, we get the number of grams of gold that can be purchased with $2000.  Therefore, the answer is 43,800 grams or approximately 1500 troy ounces.
Response:  We know that there are 7 days in a week and each day has 24 hours. So, if it is Sunday today, then tomorrow will be Monday, which means we have 24 hours from now until tomorrow morning. Therefore, the number of puppies born yesterday is 24.
Response:  ADRIAN HARIYA is the CEO of Harvey Norman India and he has announced that they will be opening 21 new stores across India in the next five years. These new stores will create around 500 jobs each, which means a total of 10,500 jobs will be created through these new openings. So, the answer is 10,500.
Response:  We know that there are 251 giraffes in total and Navomi has 68 of them. So, we have to find out how many giraffes each of the other three animals (Yuuri, Brian, and Jojo) have.  Yuuri has 10 giraffes less than Navomi, so he has 68 - 10 = 58 giraffes.  Brian has 17 more giraffes than Yuuri, so he has 58 + 17 = 75 giraffes.  Jojo has no giraffes as per the question. Therefore, his share is zero or 0 giraffes.  So, the final answer is: Yuuri - 58, Brian - 75, Jojo - 0.
Response:  If Arjun can do 10 minutes of crunches in one sitting, then he can do 5 minutes of squats in one sitting as well. So, the time taken to complete 3 sets of 8 squats is (3 x 8) = 24 minutes. Now, let's calculate the total time taken for all three exercises together. The time taken for 1 set of crunches is 10 minutes, and the time taken for 1 set of squats is 5 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken for 3 sets of each exercise is (3 x 10) + (3 x 5) = 30 + 15 = 45 minutes. So, Arjun takes more than 45 minutes to complete all three exercises.
Response:  We know that the total weight of the cargo is 120 liters and Selina has taken 90 liters with her. So, there are still 30 liters left in the tanker. Now, we need to calculate how much more water can be carried by the tanker if it is fully loaded. To do this, we will divide the remaining capacity of the tanker (30 liters) by the weight of one liter of water (1 kilogram). This gives us an estimate of how many kilograms of water the tanker can carry. Since there are 1000 grams in 1 kilogram, we can convert this value to liters by dividing it by 1000. Therefore, the tanker can carry approximately 30 liters / 1000 = 30 kg of water. So, the answer is 30 kg.
Response:  We have to find out how many people are there in the group of 90 who can speak English fluently and then subtract that number from 100 to get the remaining percentage. So, the number of people who can speak English fluently is 90 - 40 = 50. Therefore, the percentage of people who cannot speak English fluently is (100 - 50) / 100 = 50%.
Response:  The company gave Rs 15,000 as bonus to each employee. If there are 20 employees in total, then the total amount of bonus given is:  Bonus amount = Number of employees x Bonus amount per employee = 20 x Rs 15,000 = Rs 3,00,000 So, the correct answer is Rs 3,00,000.
Response:  Karlos has 30 dollars and Bechnchi has 18 dollars.  If they share equally, each will get 6 dollars (30/2 = 15).  Now, if they have to give some money to Carl, who needs 15 dollars, then Bechnichi will have to give 7 dollars more (18 - 7 = 11) as he already gave 6 dollars earlier. So, Karlos will get 9 dollars (6 + 7 = 13) from Bechnichi.
"Response:  We know that in Andhra University, there are six days of classes per week, and each day has four periods. So, we have 24 periods in total for each subject. Now, let's calculate how many periods will be left after completing 10 days of classes in each semester.

For the first semester, we have 10 days of classes x 4 periods/day = 40 periods. Since we already had 24 periods in total, so now we have 24 + 40 = 64 periods remaining.

Similarly, for the second semester, we have 10 days of classes x 4 periods/day = 40 periods. But here also, we have already used up 24 periods, so now we have 24 + 40 = 64 periods remaining.

So, in total, we have 64 periods remaining after completing 10 days of classes in each semester."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many times Jayalalithaa has won an election in total. From the given options, we can see that she has won 30 elections and lost 20 elections. So, the total number of elections she has contested is 50 (30 + 20). Now, let's find out how many times she has won an election per year. To do this, we need to divide the total number of wins by the number of years she has been contesting elections. Since she started contesting elections at the age of 30, and she is now 76 years old, the total number of years she has been contesting elections is 46 years (from 30 to 76). Therefore, the average number of wins per year is 1.09 (50 / 46).Now, let's calculate the probability of winning an election for each category of votes. For less than 1 lakh votes, the probability of winning is 0.8 (as there are 8 such instances), for 1 lakh to 2 lakhs votes, the probability of winning is 0.2 (as there are 4 such instances), and for more than 2 lakhs votes, the probability of winning is 0.05 (as there are 2 such instances). Finally, we need to multiply these probabilities by the total number of votes polled in each category to get the expected number of wins for each category. The results are as follows: Less than 1 lakh votes - 8 x 0.8 = 6.4; 1 lakh to 2 lakhs votes - 4 x 0.2 = 0.8; More than 2 lakhs votes - 2 x 0.05 = 0.1.So, the expected number of wins for Jayalalithaa in the upcoming election is 6.4 + 0.8 + 0.1 = 7.3."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Besu bought. The cost of each item is given in the question as follows:  * Bread - Rs. 6.50 per dozen  * Butter - Rs. 2 per pound (or Rs. 4 for two pounds)  * Cheese - Rs. 1 per pound (or Rs. 2 for two pounds)  * Chocolate - Rs. 1 per bar (or Rs. 2 for two bars)  * Sausages - Rs. 0.25 per sausage (or Rs. 0.5 for one and half sausages)  Therefore, the total cost of all the items that Besu bought can be calculated as follows:  Total Cost = (6 x 12) + (2 x 2) + (1 x 2) + (1 x 1) + (0.5 x 3) = Rs. 78. So, the answer to the question ""How much did Besu pay?"" is Rs. 78."
Response:  Kalinda has 360 boxes of chocolates and wants to distribute them equally among 4 of her friends. Each friend will get an equal number of boxes. So, each friend will get 90 boxes (360 / 4 = 90). Now, Kalinda has 40 boxes left after distributing them to her friends (360 - 90 * 4 = 40). Therefore, the answer is 40.
Response:  We have to find out how many fruits are there in 120 melons.  Each melon has 40 fruits, so we need to divide 120 by 40 to get the number of fruits.  Therefore, there are 3 fruits per melon and 3 x 120 = 360 fruits in total.
Response:  We have 12 cars and each car costs Rs. 20,000. So, the total cost of all the cars is Rs. 240,000 (12 x 20,000). Now, we are asked how much more or less than this amount the company has spent on the maintenance of these cars. The difference between the total cost of the cars and the amount spent on their maintenance is Rs. 76,000 (240,000 - 164,000). Therefore, the answer is Rs. 76,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 shells in Robby's pocket for every 10 shells he has. So, if Robby has 20 shells, then there are 5 shells in each of his pockets ( since there are 4 pockets). Now, let's consider the case where all the shells in one pocket belong to Kaylee. If Kaylee has 5 shells in one pocket and Robby has 20 shells, then the total number of shells belonging to Kaylee is 5 + 5 = 10. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  We have to find out how many times Daksh can touch his father's face in 30 seconds.  Firstly, we need to calculate the time taken for one rotation of Daksh's finger around his father's face.  Since there are 12 fingers and each finger takes 1 second to rotate once around the face, it will take 12 seconds for one full rotation.  Now, let's calculate the number of rotations that Daksh can do in 30 seconds.  There are 30 seconds available for Daksh to perform the action, so he can do 30/12 = 2.5 rotations in that time.  Therefore, Daksh can touch his father's face 2.5 times in 30 seconds.
Response:  We have to find out how many penguins can fit in a square with side length of 10 meters.  Firstly, we need to calculate the area of the square. The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the side length. So, the area of the square is 10^2 = 100 square meters. Now, we need to divide the area of the square by the area of a single penguin (which is assumed to be 0.1 square meters). Therefore, the number of penguins that can fit in the square is 100 / 0.1 = 1000 penguins.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there in 6 weeks. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so 6 weeks = 6 x 7 = 42 days. Now, we need to calculate how many times the number of days in one week (7) is divisible by the number of days in each week (42). So, we divide 7 by 42 and get 0.1739. Therefore, there will be approximately 0.1739  Dakshinayanas (i.e., southward movements) of the Sun during this period.
Response:  We know that there are 20 pizzas in total and Jon can eat 4 of them. So, he has to share the remaining 16 pizzas with his friends. If each friend eats one-eighth of a pizza (which is equal to 1/8), then how many friends does Jon have? Therefore, Jon has 4 friends.
Response:  We have 25 pens and we want to distribute them equally among 3 people. So, each person will get 8 pens (25 / 3 = 8). Now, if one of the people gets an extra pen, then the remaining two people will get fewer pens than before. For example, if one person gets 9 pens, then the other two people will get 7 pens each (8 - 1 = 7). Therefore, the number of pens that each person will get is: 8 + (-1) = 7 pens per person.
Response:  Jonas has 20 dollars and he gives 10 dollars to Charlie. So, Jonas now has 10 dollars left. Now, let's assume that in another year, Jonas gets 5 more dollars as an allowance from his parents. So, after one year, Jonas will have 15 dollars (10 + 5). But then, Charlie comes back and asks for 3 dollars from Jonas, leaving him with only 12 dollars. Therefore, the answer is 12.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in 20 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 20 weeks is equal to 140 days (20 x 7 = 140). Now, let's calculate the number of times Jonini can go for a walk per day. As per the question, Jonini can go for a walk once every 3 days, which means he can go for a walk 46 times in total (140 / 3 = 46). Therefore, the answer is 46.
Response:  We know that there are 1000 Vidyadharas in the school and each of them has 3 children. So, the total number of children is 1000 x 3 = 3000. Now, we need to find out how many of these children have scored above 80%. To do this, we can use the formula: Number of students who scored above 80% = Total number of students - Number of students who scored below 80%. Substituting the values given in the question, we get: Number of students who scored above 80% = 3000 - (270 + 240) = 3000 - 490 = 2510. Therefore, 2510 children in the school have scored above 80%.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Robbie has 7 friends and each friend of his has 7 other friends. So, in total, there are 7 x 7 = 49 people who are connected to Robbie through his friends. Now, let's consider Jayden's case. He has 54 friends, and each friend of his has 7 other friends. Therefore, the number of people connected to Jayden is 54 x 7 = 388. Finally, we need to find out how many more people are connected to Jayden than to Robbie. To do this, we subtract the number of people connected to Robbie from the number of people connected to Jayden: 388 - 49 = 339. So, there are 339 more people connected to Jayden than to Robbie.
Response:  We know that Dolly is a sheep and has four legs. So, there are 4 options for her to stand on - two front legs and two back legs. Now, let's consider each option separately: Option A: Standing on both front legs - This means she will have 2 points of contact with the ground, which is not possible as she needs at least 4 points of contact to stand stable. Option B: Standing on both back legs - This is also not possible as dollies do not have the ability to stand on their hind legs. Option C: Standing on one front leg and one back leg - This is the most common way dollies stand, so this option is correct. Therefore, the answer is (C) One front leg and one back leg.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the number of fruits that Meeku can eat in one minute is 6 (as per the given information). Now, let's calculate how many fruits Meeku can eat in 10 minutes.  We know that there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so there are 60 x 10 = 600 seconds in 10 minutes.  Therefore, Meeku can eat 6 x 600 = 3600 fruits in 10 minutes.  Finally, if Meeku eats for 24 hours non-stop without any break, then he will have eaten 3600 x 24 = 86,400 fruits in total during that time period.
Response:  We know that Jeson has 1000 minutes in one month and he spends 15 minutes per day on social media. So, in one month, Jeson spends 1000 / 15 = 66.67 days on social media. Now, we need to find out how many minutes Jeson spends on social media in a single day. Therefore, we divide the total number of minutes Jeson spends on social media in a month (66.67 days x 15 minutes/day) by the number of days in a month (30 days). Hence, Jeson spends approximately 2.22 minutes on social media every day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Griffin has 24 friends and each friend of his can eat 5 burgers at once. So, in total, Griffin can feed 24 x 5 = 120 people with burgers. Now, let's consider the situation where all the 120 people are eating burgers simultaneously. In this case, there will be 120 / 5 = 24 groups of 5 people each who are eating burgers together. Therefore, the number of times Griffin can feed 5 people with burgers is equal to the number of groups he can make, which is 24. Hence, the answer is 24.
Response:  We have 4 crows in one aquarium and 32 crows in another aquarium. So, the total number of crows in both aquariums is 4 + 32 = 36 crows. Now, we are asked how many crows there will be if all the crows in one aquarium were to move to the other aquarium. Since there are 4 crows in one aquarium, if they all moved to the other aquarium, then the number of crows in the second aquarium would increase by 4, making it 36 + 4 = 40 crows. Therefore, the correct answer is 40.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of the Sinim movie ticket and the Meccappu subscription. The cost of one Sinim movie ticket is Rs. 250, so the total cost of watching five movies would be Rs. 1,250 (Rs. 250 x 5). Now, let's assume that Meccappu offers a discount of 10% on its subscription for every Sinim movie ticket purchased. So, if John purchases a Meccappu subscription worth Rs. 1,250, he will get a discount of Rs. 125 (Rs. 1,250 x 10%). Therefore, the final cost of the Meccappu subscription after the discount would be Rs. 1,125 (Rs. 1,250 - Rs. 125).
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many dogs are there in the village. According to the question, there are 12 dog houses and each house can accommodate 4 dogs, so the total number of dogs is 12 x 4 = 48 dogs.  Next, we need to find out how many cats are there in the village. According to the question, there are 43 cat houses and each house can accommodate 2 cats, so the total number of cats is 43 x 2 = 86 cats.  Then, we need to find out how many birds are there in the village. According to the question, there are 15 birdhouses and each house can accommodate 2 birds, so the total number of birds is 15 x 2 = 30 birds.  Finally, we need to find out how many goats are there in the village. According to the question, there are 4 goat sheds and each shed can accommodate 2 goats, so the total number of goats is 4 x 2 = 8 goats. Therefore, the total number of animals in the village is 48 + 86 + 30 + 8 = 252 animals.
Response:  We have to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with 4 bags of wheat. Since each bag of wheat weighs 50 kg, and there are 4 bags of wheat, the total weight of wheat is 4 x 50 = 200 kg. Now, since there are 150 kg of rice in one bag, we need to divide the total weight of wheat by the weight of one bag of rice to find out how many bags of rice can be filled with the wheat. So, 200 kg / 150 kg = 1.33 bags of rice. Therefore, approximately 1.33 bags of rice can be filled with 4 bags of wheat.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 cups of tea in one pot (തിങ്കളാഴ്ച). Now, each cup contains 200 ml water (കലോറി). So, the total amount of water in one pot is 5 x 200 = 1000 ml. Therefore, the number of pots required to fill up the tanker is 1000 / 13 = 76.92 pots.
