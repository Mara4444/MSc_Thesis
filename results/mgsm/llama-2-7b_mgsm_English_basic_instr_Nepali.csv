"Response:  To find out how much money Janet makes from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market each day, we need to subtract the number of eggs she eats or uses (3) from the total number of eggs she lays per day (16). So, the number of eggs available for sale is:

16 - 3 = 13

Now, let's assume that she sells all 13 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily income from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market would be:

13 x $2 = $26

So, Janet makes $26 per day by selling duck eggs at the farmers' market."

"Response:  If the value of the house after repairs is $240,000 (150% increase), then the profit made by Josh would be:
Profit = Selling price - Original cost = $240,000 - $80,000 = $160,000
So, Josh made a profit of $160,000 on his investment of $50,000 in repairs."
Response:  Total distance = Number of sprints x Distance per sprint = 3 x 60 = 180 meters/week
Response:  To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Wendi feeds her chickens 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per bird every day, so for a flock of 20 chickens, she will need to give them 60 cups of feed (3 x 20 = 60).
Response:  To find out how many glasses Kylar needs to buy, we can use the formula: Total cost = (Number of glasses x Cost per glass) + (Number of glasses x Discount percentage). In this case, the total cost would be: Total cost = (16 x $5) + (8 x ($5 / 2)) = $90 + $4 = $94. So Kylar needs to pay $94 for 16 glasses.
Response:  Let's first find out how many sheep Charleston has. According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep. Finally, we add the number of sheep in Seattle (20) to get the total number of sheep in all three cities: 160 + 20 = 180 sheep.
"Response:  To find out how long it will take for Carla to download the file after a restart, we need to calculate the time taken in each segment and add them up.

1. Before the restart: Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it will take her 200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download 200 GB before the restart.
2. After the restart: Carla needs to restart the download from the beginning, which means she will spend another 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) downloading the remaining 160 GB (since 40% of the file was already downloaded).

Therefore, the total time it will take Carla to download the file after a restart is 100 + 100 = 200 minutes or 3 hours and 20 minutes."
"Response:  To find out how far John is from home after 4 hours, we need to use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, John's speed varies throughout the journey, so we will calculate his distance traveled at each speed and add them up.

1. For the first 2 hours, John was stuck in standstill traffic, so he did not move. Therefore, his distance traveled during this time is zero.
2. From the start of the second hour until he turned around (which took him 30 minutes), John drove at a speed of 30 mph. Over this period, he traveled a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 1.5 hours = 45 miles.
3. After turning around, John spent the next 2 hours driving towards home at a speed of 80 mph. During this time, he traveled a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 2 hours = 160 miles.

Adding all these distances together gives us the total distance John traveled over the course of the 4 hours: Total distance = 45 miles + 160 miles = 205 miles. So, John is 205 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours."
"Response:  To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular hourly earnings and then add her overtime pay.

Regular hourly earnings = $10/hour x 40 hours = $400
Overtime pay = $400 x 1.2 = $480
Total earnings = Regular hourly earnings + Overtime pay = $400 + $480 = $880

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $880."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the question:

* In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
* In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as in the first month, so the downloads were 3 x 60 = 180.
* In the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30%, which means that if we subtract 30% of the downloads in the second month (which is 180), we get 120 downloads in the third month.

So, the total number of downloads for the three months is: 60 + 180 + 120 = 460."
"Response:  The total cost of the pastries is:
Donuts: 3 x $68 = $204

"Response:  To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree over time. Let's break down the costs as follows:

* Initial cost of planting the tree = $90
* Annual cost of watering and feeding the tree = $3
* Total cost per year = $90 + $3 = $93

Now, let's calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to recoup his initial investment and start earning money from his lemon tree:

Yearly income from lemons = 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon = $10.50 per year
Total amount earned in first year = $93 (initial cost) - $10.50 (yearly income) = $82.50

To find out how many years it will take to reach this amount, we can divide the total amount earned by the annual income:

Number of years to reach break-even point = $82.50 / $10.50 per year = 7.9 years

So, it will take Carlos approximately 7.9 years to start earning money from his lemon tree after planting it."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she had (3/4) x 5 = 3.75 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.
* She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had (3.75 - 2) = 1.75 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the red house.
* She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she had (1.75 / 2) = 0.875 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.
* Finally, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: 0.875 + 3.75 + 2 = 5.
Solving for x, we get: x = 6.
Therefore, Melanie started with 6 vacuum cleaners."
"Response:  To find out what percentage of the total students are enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to add up the number of students who enrolled in each type of dance and divide it by the total number of students. Let's do that:

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 4
Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of (20 - 4) = 10
Total number of students enrolled in all three dances = 4 + 10 = 14
Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = (14/20) x 100 = 70%
So, 70% of the entire group of 20 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"Response:  The profit from purchasing jewelry over electronics can be calculated as follows:

Profit = ($5,000 x 2.5%) + ($8,000 x 1.2%)

Therefore, if the merchant chooses to invest in jewelry, they are expected to gain a profit of $1,085 at the end of the month."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Both trains start from San Rafael and travel westward for 80 miles. So, Train A covers a distance of 80 miles in one day.
* Next day, both trains travel northwards and cover a distance of 150 miles. So, Train B covers a distance of 150 miles in one day.
* Since both trains are traveling together, their total distance covered in two days is equal to the sum of their individual distances covered in those two days. Therefore, the distance covered by Train A in two days = 80 miles + (150 miles / 2) = 130 miles.
* Similarly, the distance covered by Train B in two days = 150 miles + (80 miles / 2) = 160 miles.

So, the distance covered by each train in two days is:
Train A - 130 miles
Train B - 160 miles"
Response:  To find Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply the number of hours she works each week by the rate she is paid for each activity. For teaching, she works 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week. For coaching, she works 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week. So, her total weekly income is $700 + $450 = $1,150/week. Since she works 50 weeks/year, her annual salary is $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year.
Response:  If Claire makes a 3 egg omelette every morning for breakfast and it takes her 1 week to finish one dozen eggs (i.e., 12 eggs), then she will eat 48 eggs in 4 weeks (since there are 4 weeks in a month). Therefore, the answer is 48 eggs.
Response:  To find out how fast Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken. In this case, the total distance left to hike is 8 miles (the remaining distance after walking the first 4 miles and the next 2 miles), and the time taken so far is 3 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles + 1 hour for the next 2 miles). So, Marissa's average speed needed to finish the hike is: Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken = 8 miles / 3 hours = 2.67 miles/hour.
"Response:  The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters can be calculated as follows:

Total volume of orange drink = 10 liters (as given)
Volume of orange drink added to pineapple drink = 10/3 = 3.33 liters (since 1 liter was spilled)
New total volume of mixture = 15 liters + 3.33 liters = 18.33 liters

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
24 - 18.33 = 5.67 liters

So there are approximately 5.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture."

"Response:  To find out how much Cynthia spends on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes during that period and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Total number of servings = Number of days x Number of servings per day
= 60 x 1
= 60 servings

Cost per serving = Cost per carton / Number of servings per carton
= $4.00 / 15
= $0.27 per serving

Total amount spent on ice cream = Total number of servings x Cost per serving
= 60 x $0.27
= $16.80

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.80 on ice cream."
Response:  The distance between Henry's first and second stops is 35 miles (10 + 25).
"Response:  The price of the boots can be calculated using the information provided in the problem statement. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Gloria has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels.
2. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost $5 less than the boots.
3. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much ($66).
4. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of heels = $33 + $66 = $99.
5. So, the price of the boots = $100 - $99 = $1.

Therefore, the answer is $1."
Response:  To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to use the given information that the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. So, if Darrell's age is D, then Allen's age is A = 11D/7. Ten years from now, Allen's age will be A + 10 = (11D/7) + 10. Substituting D = 44 (since Darrell's age is 44), we get A = 55. Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 55.
"Response:  The average of their guesses can be calculated as follows:

First friend's guess = 80
Second friend's guess = 20 + (40/2) = 100
Third friend's guess = 25% of 80 = 20

Average of all three guesses = (80 + 100 + 20)/3 = 120

Therefore, the average guess of Gunter's friends is 120 jelly beans in the jar."
Response:  To find out how many hours per week John spends taking care of the dogs, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to walk and take care of each dog's business per day. So, if there are 10 dogs, and it takes.5 hours per day to walk and take care of each dog's business, then John spends 5 hours per day (10 dogs x.5 hours/dog/day) taking care of the dogs. Since there are 7 days in a week, John spends 35 hours (5 hours/day x 7 days/week) taking care of the dogs per week.
Response:  The number of gold coins that Gretchen has is 40. Explanation: If there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins and Gretchen has 110 coins in total, then the number of silver coins is 80 (110 - 30). Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:

1. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, if Aaron has x jewels, Siobhan has x - 2 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, if Raymond has y jewels, Aaron has y + 5 jewels.
3. Raymond has 40 jewels.

Now, we can use the above information to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

Siobhan has x - 2 jewels, and Aaron has y + 5 jewels. Therefore, Siobhan has (x - 2) + (y + 5) = 40 jewels.

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 26
y = 24

So, Siobhan has 26 jewels."
Response:  The total number of points scored by Mike is 4 + (20/100) x 4 = 4 + 2 = 6.
Response:  To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate the cost of 30 days' worth of yogurt. Since there are 30 days in a month and Terry eats 2 yogurts per day, the total number of yogurts he will eat in a month is 60 (2 x 30). Therefore, the cost of 1 yogurt = $5 / 60 = $0.083 (approximately). So, Terry spends $0.083 x 2 = $0.166 on yogurt per day. Over 30 days, he spends $0.166 x 30 = $4.98 on yogurt.
Response:  John sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each, so he got $195 ($13 x $15). Then he spent $80 on video games (8 x $20), so he has $195 - $80 = $115 left.
Response:  John's average speed during his three-day running routine is 20 miles per hour.
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how far Dana can travel in each mode of transportation. Let's start with walking:

Dana can walk at a rate of speed x = 2/3 \* 4 = 2 miles per hour (since she spends two-thirds of the time walking).

Now, let's find out how far she can travel in six hours while walking:

Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 2 miles/hour x 6 hours = 12 miles

Next, let's find out how far she can travel in each hour while running:

Speed = 4x = 4 miles/hour (since she runs four times faster than she walks)

Now, let's find out how far she can travel in each hour while running:

Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 4 miles/hour x 1 hour = 4 miles

Since Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she will spend:

Time running = 1/3 x 6 hours = 2 hours running
Time walking = 2/3 x 6 hours = 4 hours walking

So, the total distance traveled by Dana in six hours is:

Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking
= 4 miles + 12 miles
= 16 miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 16 miles in six hours."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"Response:  To determine the maximum distance beyond which Polly can stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to use the information provided in the problem.

First, let's find out the maximum distance at which Polly can throw the gold javelin without holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, the distance is 400 feet.

Now, let's find out the additional distance that Polly can cover by holding the sapphire gemstone. As per the problem, the distance increases by 3 times, or 3 x 400 = 1200 feet. So, the total maximum distance beyond which Polly can stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone is:

400 + 1200 = 1600 feet.

Therefore, the answer is 1600 feet."
Response:  The number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is equal to the total number of pieces of pie (5) minus the number of pieces left on the buffet table at the end of the evening (14). Therefore, the answer is 9.
"Response:  To calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a single serving of chips, we need to use some basic math. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in a 300g bag of chips: 5 servings x 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories (total)
2. Determine your daily calorie target: 2000 calories/day
3. Subtract the total number of calories from your daily target: 2000 - 1250 = 750 calories remaining for the day
4. Divide the remaining calories by the number of servings in the bag: 750 / 5 servings = approximately 150 calories per serving
5. Multiply the number of calories per serving by the weight of the bag in grams: 150 calories/serving x 300g = approximately 45,000 calories (in grams)
6. Dividing the total number of calories in the bag by the number of servings gives us the approximate number of grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target: 45,000 calories / 5 servings = approximately 9000 grams (of chips)

So, if you have already consumed 1800 calories and want to stick to your daily target of 2000 calories, you can eat approximately 9000 grams of chips (based on the nutritional information provided). However, please note that this calculation assumes that all the calories in the chips come from fat, which may not be accurate. Additionally, it's important to consider other factors like fiber, protein, and other nutrients when calculating your daily intake."
"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. Since each candle weighs 1/4 pound (or 8 ounces), we can calculate the number of candles as follows:

1 pound = 16 ounces (since 1 pound = 16 ounces)
1/4 pound = 4 ounces (since 1/4 pound = 4 ounces)
Number of candles = 16 ounces / 4 ounces per candle = 4 candles

Now, let's calculate the total cost of making these candles:

Cost of beeswax = $10.00 (since it costs $10.00 for one pound of beeswax)
Cost of wicks = $2.00 (since it costs $2.00 for enough wicks to make 4 candles)
Total cost = $10.00 + $2.00 = $12.00

Finally, let's calculate the net profit if Charlie sells each candle for $2.00:

Selling price = $2.00 (per candle)
Net profit = Selling price - Cost = $2.00 - ($12.00 / 4 candles) = $5.00 per candle

So, if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles, his net profit would be:

Net profit = $5.00 x 20 candles = $100.00"
"Response:  To find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1 (Monday):
Meredith wrote 5 articles, which means she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours researching and writing articles on Monday.

Day 2 (Tuesday):
Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than she did on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 x 5 = 7 articles. And since each article took 4 hours to write, she spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours writing articles on Tuesday.

Day 3 (Wednesday):
Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 x 7 = 14 articles. And since each article took 4 hours to write, she spent 14 x 4 = 56 hours writing articles on Wednesday.

Total time spent writing articles in the three days = 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours."
Response:  The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 16 (80 - 23 = 57).
"Response:  To find out how much John spent on ties, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so if he bought x blue ties, he also bought 2x red ties.
2. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of one red tie is 50% more than the cost of one blue tie. If the cost of one blue tie is $40, then the cost of one red tie is $40 + (50% of $40), or $40 + $20 = $60.
3. John spent a total of $200 on ties, and since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he spent half of his money on red ties ($200 / 2) = $100 on red ties.

So, John spent $100 on red ties and $100 on blue ties, for a total of $200."
Response:  To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire (4 feet) by the length of each piece (6 inches). This gives us 4 / 6 = 2 pieces. So, Tracy obtained 2 pieces of wire.
Response:  Total number of unoccupied units = Total number of units - Number of occupied units. = 15 x 8 - (3/4) x 15 = 60 - 10 = 50 unoccupied units.
"Response:  To find out how much Lloyd makes from his eggs per week, we need to first convert the number of eggs produced per day into a decimal form. There are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years), so we can multiply the daily production by 365 to get the total number of eggs produced per year:

252 eggs/day x 365 days/year = 91,700 eggs/year

Now, we divide the total number of eggs produced per year by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week:

91,700 eggs/year / $2/dozen = $183.40/week

So, Lloyd makes $183.40 per week from his egg farm."
Response:  To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate. In this case, the distance traveled by Tom during the first part of his journey is 4 miles (since he started at 1 mile and sailed for 4 hours). The rate at which he traveled during that time was 10 miles per hour. So, if he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour, it will take him half as much time to return, or 2 hours. Therefore, the answer is 2 hours.
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so 30 comic books would weigh 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. Since Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds from his book bag, he needs to remove 7.5 - 15 = -7.5 pounds of toys. So, he needs to remove 7.5 pounds of toys from his book bag.
Response:  The mechanic earned $240 more on Friday than on Thursday.
"Response:  The Doubtfire family now has a total of 29 kittens! Here's how we arrived at this answer:

* The Doubtfire sisters already had 7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter before their mother called. So, they now have 7 + 7 = 14 kittens in total.
* Their mother informed them that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which is 3 x 7 = 21 additional kittens.
* Similarly, Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 additional kittens, bringing the total number of kittens for both cats to 12 + 12 = 24 kittens.
* Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 14 + 21 + 24 = 59 kittens. However, since the question asks for the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we round up the answer to 60 kittens."
Response:  To find out how many bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops, we need to divide the total number of lollipops by the number of lollipops that will be packaged in each bag. In this case, Jean has 30 lollipops and he wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag, so he can fill 30/2 = 15 bags.
Response:  To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($42) by the cost of one movie ticket and popcorn ($14). So, Peter can go to the movies $\frac{42}{14} = 3$ times.
"Response:  To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the total weight of all the boxes that will be carried by the truck when it crosses the bridge.
The weight of a single box is 15 pounds, so the total weight of 5000 boxes would be 5000 x 15 = 75,000 pounds.
Since the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, this means that there is a remaining capacity of 75,000 - 3755 = 69,245 pounds for loading boxes onto the truck.
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 69,245 / 15 = 4686 boxes."

"Response:  Good oranges = Total number of oranges - (Bad orange + Unripe orange + Sour orange)

Explanation:
The total number of oranges in the basket is given as 25. Among them, 1 is bad, so there are 24 good oranges. Out of these, 20% are unripe, i.e., 4 oranges are unripe. So, the number of good oranges after removing the unripe ones is 24 - 4 = 20. Finally, 2 oranges are sour, so we need to subtract them from the remaining good oranges, leaving us with 20 - 2 = 18 good oranges. Therefore, there are 18 good oranges in the basket."
"Response:  To find out how much Janet paid for the brooch, we need to add up all the costs involved in making and purchasing it.

First, let's calculate the cost of materials:
$500 (material cost) + $800 (jeweler cost) = $1,300

Next, let's calculate the insurance cost:
$1,300 x 10% = $130

So, the total amount Janet paid for the brooch is:
$1,300 + $130 = $1,430

Therefore, Janet paid $1,430 for the brooch."
"Response:  The annual pension for Marcy can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the present value of the pension at the end of Year 20:
Present Value = $50,000 / (1 + 5%)^20 = $786,951
2. Calculate the annual pension amount starting from Year 21:
Annual Pension = Present Value / 5% = $786,951 / 5% = $157,390
3. Calculate the total pension amount over 30 years:
Total Pension = Annual Pension x Number of Years = $157,390 x 30 = $4,711,700

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service will be $4,711,700."
"Response:  The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is calculated as follows:

Initial payment = $140 x (6/12) = $90
Remaining amount = $140 - $90 = $50
Total amount paid = Initial payment + Remaining amount = $90 + $50 = $140
Therefore, by the end of the year, Aleena had paid a total of $140 for the streaming service."
Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, and she needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again. This means that her current tank size is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons. So, Sophia can drive 8 / 4 = 2 miles on a single tank of gas. Therefore, the answer is 2 miles.
Response:  If Jim watches TV for 2 hours per day and reads for half as long, he will spend 1 hour reading per day. Since he does this 3 times a week, he will spend 3 x 7 = 21 hours watching TV and 3 x 7 = 21 hours reading in one week. In 4 weeks, he will have spent a total of 4 x 21 = 84 hours watching TV and 4 x 21 = 84 hours reading.
"Response:  Total number of people = Number of teams + Number of players + Number of coaches
Total number of people = 4 x (10 + 10 + 5) + 4 x 4 = 40 + 20 + 4 = 64

"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems.
* There were 175 diamonds in the chest.
* There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140.
* Twice the number of emeralds than the rubies means that the number of emeralds = 2 x 140 = 280.

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = 695 gems."
"Response:  Let the number of boys be 2x. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of girls is x. 
The total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls = 2x + x = 3x.

Response:  To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to multiply the number of classes she teaches by the number of students in each class and then multiply that result by the amount she charges per student. So, if she teaches 5 classes on weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday, she will have a total of 5 x 15 + 8 x 15 = 90 classes in one week. And if she charges $15.00 per student, she will make $90 x $15.00 = $1350.00 in one week.
Response:  The total number of instructions that Kelian needs to read to prepare both dishes is 40 (2 x 20).
Response:  To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of brownies he sold by the price per slice and then add that amount to the total raised from the cheesecakes. So, if he sold 43 brownies at $3 each, he raised $13 (43 x $3). And if he sold 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 each, he raised $92 (23 x $4). Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $105 ($13 + $92) in funds for his charity.
"Response:  For this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones and then find out how much Sheila has to pay each month for 3 months. Let's break down the calculation as follows:
Total Cost = Number of Cell Phones x Price per Cell Phone x Interest Rate x Time Period (in Months)
= 5 x $150 x 2% x 3
= $750
So, Sheila has to pay $750 for all 5 cell phones. To find out her monthly payment, we can divide the total cost by the number of time periods she is making payments for:
Monthly Payment = Total Cost / Time Period
= $750 / 3
= $250 per month
Therefore, Sheila has to pay $250 per month for 3 months to buy the 5 cell phones."
Response:  To find out how much Artie will make, we need to multiply the number of pots of each type of flower by its rounded price. So, for marigolds: 12 x $2 = $24 For petunias: 9 x $1.87 = $16.53 For begonias: 17 x $2.12 = $36.04 Total: $24 + $16.53 + $36.04 = $76.57
"Response:  To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to add up all the square footages of the levels and divide by the number of levels. Let's do this:

Level 1: Square footage = 16 (as given)
Level 2: Square footage = Half of Level 1 = 8
Level 3: Square footage = Half of Level 2 = 4
Level 4: Square footage = Half of Level 3 = 2

Now, let's add up all these square footages:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

So, the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle is 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet."
"Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs during that time.

Day 1-180: 1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups
Day 181-365: 2 cups/day x 184 days = 376 cups
Total cups needed in first year = 180 + 376 = 556 cups

Now, since each bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we can divide the total number of cups needed by the number of cups per bag to find out how many bags Cecilia will use:
556 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags
Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Sarah does twice as much laundry as Raymond. So, Sarah does 2 × 400 = 800 pounds of laundry.
2. If Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 1/4th of the laundry that Sarah does. So, David does 800 / 4 = 200 pounds of laundry.
3. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 800 - 200 = 600 pounds."
"Response:  To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of 18 flowers at each price.

At $2.50 per package of 3 flowers, the total cost of 18 flowers would be:
$2.50 x 6 = $15.00

At $1.00 per package of 2 flowers, the total cost of 18 flowers would be:
$1.00 x 9 = $9.00

So, by buying 18 flowers at the better price of $1.00 per package of 2 flowers, Vincent saves a total of $6.00 ($15.00 - $9.00)."
Response:  If the groomer offers a 30% discount for being a new customer, then the total cost of the grooming will be $100 x (1 - 0.3) = $70. So, the grooming costs $70.

Total number of quilt blocks = 34 x 4 x 1 x 6 = 768 quilt blocks."
Response:  The alarm rang 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 times in total.
Response:  To find out Sylvie's current annual salary, we need to calculate it based on the information given in the problem. According to the policy, if an employee stays in the company for five years, their salary will increase by 10% of the initial salary. So, if Sylvie has been working at the company for five years (since she clocked 5 years in Dec), then her initial salary was $600. Now, let's calculate her current annual salary: Initial Salary = $600 x 10% = $60 x 5 years = $3000 Current Annual Salary = $600 + ($3000 x 10%) = $600 + $300 = $3600 Therefore, Sylvie's current annual salary is $3600.
Response:  Let x be the number of copies Harald sold. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies. The total number of copies sold by both is given by 88,000 = x + 10x = 110x. Solving for x, we get x = 72,000. So Harald sold 72,000 copies.
Response:  To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to calculate the total number of gift bags she will need based on the number of guests who actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can assume that 4/8 or half of the invited guests will actually attend the party. So, the total number of gift bags needed = (Number of guests x Number of gift bags per guest) / 2 = 16 x 0.75 = 12 gift bags. Therefore, Christina will spend $2 x 12 = $24 on gift bags.
"Response:  To find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. So, if there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, the total amount of potato salad needed is:

20 x 10 = 200 pounds (for adults) + 5 x 5 = 25 pounds (for children) = 225 pounds

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
Response:  Total number of pets = 3x + 2 + 4 = 10
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Amy is 5 + 5 = 10 years older than Jackson.
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Corey is 2 - 2 = 0 years older than Amy.
* James is 1 year younger than Corey. So, James is 0 + 1 = 1 year younger than Corey.

Now, we can find out the age of Jackson by using the information provided:

Jackson is 5 years younger than Amy, so Jackon's age = Amy's age - 5.
Amy's age = 10 (as mentioned in the problem).
So, Jackson's age = 10 - 5 = 5 years old."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that Lee could run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. So, if Lee takes x seconds to complete the race, then Gerald will take x + 2 seconds to complete the same race.
Now, we are told that Gerald's diet improvement has increased his speed by 10%. This means that for every second he takes to complete the race, he will now be able to cover an additional distance of 10% of the total distance. In other words, if he took x seconds to complete the race before, after the diet change, he will take (x + 10%) seconds to complete the same race.
So, if Lee takes 38 seconds to complete the race, then Gerald, with his improved diet, will take (38 + 10) = 48 seconds to complete the same race."
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The number of rabbits pets is 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, if the combined number of pet dogs and cats is x, then the number of rabbits pets is x - 12.
2. There are two cats for every dog, so the number of cats is twice the number of dogs. If the number of dogs is 60, then the number of cats is 60 × 2 = 120.
3. Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is x + 120 = 72 (since we subtracted 12 from the original value).

So, the answer is 72 pets in total in the neighborhood."
"Response:  Total number of grade 5 students = 200
Number of boys = 2/5 x 200 = 40
Number of girls = 3/5 x 200 = 120
Number of girls in Girl Scouts = Number of girls x 2/3 = 120 x 2/3 = 80
So, there are 40 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts."
Response:  If Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for 2/3 of that, then James slept for 6 hours (since 2/3 of 9 = 6). So, Harry slept for 9 - 6 = 3 more hours than James.
"Response:  To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the total volume of the sauce by the volume of each tomato. Since there are three tomatoes in each 16-ounce can, and Freda used 32 ounces of sauce, the number of tomatoes she used is:

32 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 2 cans
Therefore, Freda used 2 cans of tomatoes."
"Response:  Let's assume that the time taken by each car to pass through the traffic jam is uniform and equal to x minutes. Since some cars passed through in the first 15 minutes, we can say that the number of cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes is equal to the total number of cars minus the number of cars that took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes is:

Number of cars passing through = Total number of cars - Number of cars taking exit
= 30 - 5
= 25

So, 25 cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
Response:  After giving away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, Mary will remain with 36 potted plants (2 x 40 - 40 = 36).
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* First friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
* Second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so he pressed it 20 x 1/4 = 5 times more than the first friend.
* Third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so he pressed it 60 - 10 = 50 times.

Now, let's calculate the total number of doorbell rings:

20 + 5 + 50 = 85

So, the doorbell made 85 ringings."
"Response:  To find out the number of pages that Solo needs to read per day, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Solo has 4 days left to complete all his reading after Monday. So, if he reads x pages per day, then he will finish all his reading in 4 days. Therefore, the average number of pages that Solo needs to read per day is:
x / 4 = 15 (since he read 15 pages on Monday)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 36 (pages/day)
Therefore, Solo needs to read approximately 36 pages per day to finish all his reading within the given time frame."
Response:  John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week (Monday to Friday).
"Response:  The time taken by the fog bank to cover the whole city can be calculated as follows:

Distance covered per minute = Speed of fog bank x Time taken to cover 3 miles
= 3 miles/10 minutes x?

Since the city is 42 miles wide, we need to cover that distance in addition to the 3 miles already covered. So, the total distance to be covered is 45 miles (42 miles + 3 miles).

Time taken to cover 45 miles = Distance covered per minute x Number of minutes taken to cover 45 miles
= 3 miles/10 minutes x?

Now, we have two equations: one for covering 3 miles and another for covering 45 miles. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of?.

Equation 1:
distance = speed x time
3 miles = 3 miles/10 minutes x?

Solving for?, we get:
? = 3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles/minute

Equation 2:
time = distance / speed
45 miles = 0.3 miles/minute x?

Solving for? again, we get:
? = 45 miles / 0.3 miles/minute = 150 minutes

Therefore, it will take 150 minutes or 2 hours and 30 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."

"Response:  Let's break down what we know about Frankie's TV watching habits:

* Every night, Frankie finishes his homework before watching TV.
* On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night.
* On Wednesday, Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. (We don't know exactly how many episodes he watched, but we do know it was fewer than 1 hour.)
* On Thursday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
* On Friday, Frankie stayed up late for the weekend and watched two 1-hour episodes.

So, if Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total, that means he must have watched at least 4 hours of 30-minute shows on Wednesday. However, since we don't know exactly how many episodes he watched, we can't give an exact answer. Therefore, the correct answer is ""More than 4 hours"" but less than 7 hours."
Response:  Last year, Henry baked 55 cookies.
Response:  After getting the cashback reward, the person will get to pay $2.80 per gallon ($3.00 - $0.20) for the 10 gallons of gas. So, they will end up paying a total of $28.00 for the gas.
Response:  To find out how much each of them ate on average, we need to divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of roll-ups each person had. For Beatrice, it is 24 / 2 = 12, and for Marcell, it is 14 / 3 = 4. So, on average, Beatrice ate 12 fruit roll-ups and Marcell ate 4.
Response:  To find out how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows back towards shore, and it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, if Julia rowed 64 feet (which is equal to 8 times 8 = 64), then the boat would have taken on 64 x 2 = 128 liters of water. Therefore, the answer is 128 liters.
Response:  The whiteboard will be cleaned 12 times in a day (4 teachers x 2 lessons/day x 3 cleans per lesson = 12).

"Response:  Let x be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Since the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, we have:
x = 1800 / 50 = 36
Therefore, there are 36 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo."
"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling all of her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has left and then subtract that amount from the total revenue she will get from selling it all. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x $10 = $100
Total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x $16 = $160
Total cost of all leftover lumber = $100 + $160 = $260

Now let's find out how much money Sasha will make from selling all of her leftover lumber:
Revenue from selling 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x $20 = $200
Revenue from selling 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x $32 = $320
Total revenue from selling all lumber = $200 + $320 = $520

So, if Sasha sells all of her leftover lumber, she will make a profit of $520 - $260 = $260."
Response:  To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to use the ratio given in the problem. The ratio is 7:13, which means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 teaspoons of water. So, if Katy used 120 teaspoons of sugar, she used 120 x 7 = 840 teaspoonfuls of sugar.
Response:  John paid a total of $180.
"Response:  Let's assume that the first container had a unique identifier (e.g., Container #1). Then, the second container would have a different unique identifier (e.g., Container #2). Therefore, there are 2 containers in total. Now, let's calculate the number of vehicles in each container:

Container #1: 5 vehicles x 2 days = 10 vehicles
Container #2: 5 vehicles x 1 day = 5 vehicles

So, in total, there are 10 + 5 = 15 vehicles imported on the second day."
"Response:  Let's assume that Adrien's initial salary was x. Since Adrien's salary is now 40% more than it was four years ago, his current salary is (x + 40%). Similarly, Lylah's salary is (x - 30%). Therefore, their combined salary four years later is:
(x + 40%) + (x - 30%) = 2x + 70%
So, the total salary they received four years later is 2x + 70%."
"Response:  To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to divide the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week = 2 x 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week
Therefore, Miguel uses 60 sheets of paper/week × 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets of paper/month
So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."

Response:  Total hours = 8 + (2 - 2) + (1 - 2) = 8 + (-2) + (-1) = 7 hours
Response:  To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the total distance she can run in that time. We know that she can run at a rate of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she will have covered a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles during those 3 hours. Then, if she slows down and runs at a rate of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (i.e., 7 - 3 = 4 hours), she will cover a distance of 4 x 5 = 20 miles. Therefore, in total, Rosie can run 30 + 20 = 50 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  Let X be the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she put stamps on 20 letters (since 1/3 × 60 = 20). So, after Jennie finished, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters was X + 20 = 30. Therefore, the answer is X = 10.
Response:  The package that Julia bought contained 8 spoons.
Response:  Dylan bought 44 sausages in all (38 chicken sausages + 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages).
Response:  Let's assume that Lily has x friends. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, Amy has x + 20 friends. So, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is x + 20 = 50. Therefore, Lily has 30 friends (x) and Amy has 30 + 20 = 50 friends.
"Response:  The total amount of money Dillon will spend on buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges can be calculated as follows:

Watermelons: 4 x 3 = 12 x 15 = 180
Peppers: 20 x 15 = 300
Oranges: 10 x 15 - 5 = 150
Total amount spent = 180 + 300 + 150 = 630
Therefore, the answer is 630."
"Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital during each day. We can do this by multiplying the number of patients seen per day (500) by the average time spent with each patient (24 minutes). This gives us a total of 12,000 minutes (or 20 hours) of patient care provided by the hospital per day.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital based on the charging structure given in the problem. Since the doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital, the hospital earns $150 x 20 = $3000 per day from doctor consultations alone. Similarly, since the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, it earns $200 x 12,000 = $24,000 per day from patient care services. Therefore, the total daily revenue of the hospital is $3000 + $24,000 = $27,000."

"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. So, his total distance walked on Monday = 4 miles.
* On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, his total distance walked on Tuesday = 6 x 4 = 24 miles.
* On Wednesday, he walked a total of 41 miles. So, his distance walked on Wednesday = 41 - 4 = 37 miles.

Therefore, Walt walked 37 miles on Wednesday."
Response:  To find out how much Tom pays in a year for the 4 car washes per month, we need to multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash. So, Tom pays $60 ($15 x 4) per month and $720 ($60 x 12) per year.
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. ""Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does."" - This means that if Brian has x video games, then Bobby has x - 5 video games.
2. ""If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made..."" - This means that after losing 5 video games, Brian now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
3. So, we can write an equation based on the above two statements:
Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does, so Bobby has 3x - 5 video games.
After Brian lost 5 video games, he had 15 video games, so the number of video games Brian had before losing any is 15 + 5 = 20.
Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. Using the equation, we get:
Bobby has 3(20) - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 video games.
Therefore, Bobby has 55 video games."
"Response:  Let's break this down step by step!

So, we know that there are 27 unicorns left in the world. And one-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands, which means there are 9 unicorns in Scotland.

Now, two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, which means there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland.

So, to find out how many female Scottish unicorns there are, we can simply add 6 to the total number of unicorns in Scotland, which is 9. Therefore, there are 15 female Scottish unicorns."
Response:  To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to add up all the items she is ordering. The cost of two subs is $7.50 x 2 = $15.00, the cost of two bags of chips is $1.50 x 2 = $3.00, and the cost of two cookies is $1.00 x 2 = $2.00. So, the total cost of the items she is ordering is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00. Then, there is a 20% delivery fee which is calculated as follows: $20.00 x 20% = $4.00. So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order including the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00. Finally, if she adds a $5.00 tip, the total cost of her delivery order would be $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.
"Response:  To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered from the total number of questions in both tests. Let's do this:

Total questions in both tests = 75 + 100 = 175
Number of questions Mark answered = 5 x 75 = 375
Number of questions Mark left incomplete = Total questions - Number of questions Mark answered = 175 - 375 = -200
So, Mark left 200 questions incomplete."
Response:  Let's assume that the total number of gumballs in the machine is x. Since there are 4 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, the number of pink gumballs is 4x. We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so the difference between the total number of gumballs and the number of blue gumballs is: x - 12 = 4x - 12. Solving for x, we get x = 30. Therefore, there are 30 pink gumballs in the machine.
Response:  The percentage of semi-automatic cars among the total number of cars is 3/20 = 15%.
"Response:  Total number of bees = Number of worker bees + Number of baby bees + Number of queen bees.
Total number of bees = 700 + (2 x 100) + 1 = 800.
So, there are 800 worker bees in the hive."
"Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day and works for 5 days a week at $10 per hour, then he will earn:

2 hours/day x 5 days/week = 10 hours/week
$10/hour x 10 hours/week = $100/week

So, Jordan would earn $100 per week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"Response:  The total cost of the items John bought can be calculated as follows:

* Milk: $2 x 1 = $2
* Eggs: $3 x 1 = $3
* Light bulbs: $3 x 1 = $3
* Cups: $3 x 1 = $3
* Roach traps: $4 x 1 = $4
Total cost = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15
Therefore, everything costed $15 including the 10% tax on non-food items."
Response:  To find out how much profit Lucas will make each week, we first need to calculate his total income for the week. Based on the information given, his total income per week is $92. Next, we subtract his total expenses from his total income to find his profit. His total expenses are $2 x 6 = $12 (for the 6 bottles of bleach) + $5 x 5 = $25 (for the 5 packs of cloths). So, his profit each week is $92 - $12 - $25 = $45. Therefore, Lucas will make $45 in profit each week.
"Response:  To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to multiply the number of hectares he has by the number of pineapples per hectare and then divide it by the time interval between harvests (every 3 months). So, the answer is:

Number of pineapples = Number of hectares x Number of pineapples per hectare / Time interval between harvests
= 10 x 100 / 3
= 3333 pineapples
Therefore, John can harvest approximately 3333 pineapples within a year."
"Response:  Total number of Legos = Number of small Lego sets + Number of medium Lego sets + Number of large Lego sets.

So, in this case, Johnny has picked up 500 pieces from the first set, 3 times 500 = 1500 pieces from the second set, and 1/4 of 1500 = 375 pieces from the third set. Therefore, the total number of Legos that Johnny has picked up is 500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375."
"Response:  The number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day can be calculated using the information provided in the problem.

First, we need to find out how many bees were leaving the hive at a rate of 30 bees per hour for the first 6 hours of the day.

30 bees/hour x 6 hours = 180 bees (total bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours)

Next, we need to find out how many bees were returning to the hive at a rate of half the original rate of 30 bees per hour for the next 6 hours.

Half the rate of 30 bees/hour = 15 bees/hour (bees returning to the hive in the second 6 hours)

Now, we need to calculate the total number of bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day by adding the number of bees that left the hive during the first 6 hours with the number of bees that returned during the second 6 hours.

Total number of bees returning to the hive = 180 bees + (15 bees/hour x 6 hours) = 195 bees

Therefore, Debra saw 195 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."
Response:  Brittany's mom gave the cashier $10 (for the child ticket) + $12 (for the adult ticket) = $22. She received $8 in change, so she gave the cashier $22 - $8 = $14.
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:

Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, which means that if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, Charlie has 3x friends.
James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy, which means that if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, James has 4x friends.
We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write an equation based on this information:

3x = 12

Now, let's solve for x:

3x = 12
x = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, he has 4 × 4 = 16 friends on Facebook."
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Steve has traveled when Tim catches up to him. We know that Steve travels at a rate of 440 feet per minute, so in one minute, he covers 440 feet. Since Tim takes longer to reach Steve's house, he will have covered less distance than Steve by the time he catches up. Let's assume it takes Tim x minutes to reach Steve's house. Then, the distance between them is: Distance = Speed x Time = 440 ft/min x x min = 440x ft Now, since Steve has already traveled 3 miles, or 3000 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot), before Tim catches up to him, the total distance between them when Tim catches up is: Total distance = Distance left + Distance traveled = 3000 ft + 440x ft = 3000 + 440x So, if Tim takes x minutes to reach Steve's house, the winner will be waiting for x - 3 minutes at their house before the loser finishes the race.
Response:  To find out how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the cost of inflating each tire and then multiply it by the number of tires inflated. For the bicycles, each tire costs $0.25, so 5 tires x $0.25 = $1.25. For the tricycles, each tire costs $0.25, so 3 tires x $0.25 = $0.75. And for the unicycle, since it only has one tire, the cost is $0.25. So, in total, Shawnda made $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25 that day.
Response:  If Carl pays for the cookies with a $10 bill and each pack of cookies costs $0.10, then the total amount that Carl owes is $10 x 10 = $100. Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, he will receive $90 in change ($100 - $10).
"Response:  The number of French fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 140.

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 French fries before a hungry seagull stole the pack. So, there were 14 - 1 = 13 French fries left in the pack.
2. The seagull ate half of the remaining French fries, which is 13 / 2 = 6.5 French fries. Since we can't have a fraction of a French fry, let's round up to 7 French fries eaten by the seagull.
3. Three pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food, so they ate 3 x 7 = 21 French fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining French fries, which is (2/3) x 7 = 5 French fries.
5. Finally, ants carried off one French fry, leaving 5 + 1 = 6 French fries in the pack.

So, the total number of French fries in the pack when Dave bought it is 140 - 13 - 7 - 21 - 5 = 86 French fries."
"Response:  To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester, we need to calculate the total number of hours he attends classes per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a semester.

Weekly attendance:
Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 3 x 1 hour = 3 hours/week
Tuesday, Thursday: 2 x 2 hours = 4 hours/week
Total weekly attendance: 3 + 4 = 7 hours/week

Semester duration: 16 weeks
Total hours attended in a semester: 7 hours/week x 16 weeks = 112 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 112 hours attending classes in a semester."
"Response:  To find out how long the baked goods are when put end to end, we need to convert their lengths from inches or feet to a common unit like meters. Let's do that!

Rolls: 300 x 4 = 1200 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
Chocolate Croissants: 120 x 6 = 720 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)
Baguettes: 60 x 2 = 120 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot)

Now, let's convert these measurements to meters:

1 meter = 39.37 inches (approximately)

So, the total length of the baked goods in meters is:

Rolls: 1200 / 39.37 = 30.85 meters
Chocolate Croissants: 720 / 39.37 = 18.35 meters
Baguettes: 120 / 39.37 = 3.08 meters

Therefore, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they would be approximately 30.85 + 18.35 + 3.08 = 51.28 meters long!"
"Response:  To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over that period. Let's do this step by step:

* In one month, the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas. So, in one month, the total number of bananas needed is: 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.
* Since there are two months in total, the total number of bananas needed over those two months is: 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
Response:  The distance between the start and finish lines of the football field is 100 yards = 91.4 meters (using the conversion factor of 1 yard = 0.914 meters). Since Blake ran 15 times back and forth across the field, his total distance covered is 15 x 91.4 = 1366 meters. On the other hand, since Kelly ran from the 40-yard line to the opposite end zone and back, her total distance covered is 2 x 40 = 80 meters + 80 meters = 160 meters. Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 1366 - 160 = 1206 meters more than the loser (Kelly).
Response:  To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to add the cost of all the items he bought. The total cost is: $1.5 x 4 = $6 for pens + $4 x 2 = $8 for notebooks + $20 = $34. So, Raphael spent $34 on everything.

"Response:  To find the total value of all the toys, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the doll is worth $3 × 3 = $9.
2. One red car costs $4, so the total value of the 5 red cars is $4 × 5 = $20.
3. There are 3 action figures, each worth $5, so the total value of the action figures is $5 × 3 = $15.

Adding up the values of all the toys, we get: $9 + $20 + $15 = $44.

So, all the toys together are worth $44."
Response:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant ($90) from the lost income due to doing her own taxes ($35 x 3 = $105). So, the answer is $105 - $90 = $15.
Response:  To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of all the accessories from her budget. So, if her budget is €1500 and she spends €1090 on the computer, then she will have €410 left (€1500 - €1090 = €410). Therefore, she will have €410 left for her clothing.

* Pants: ($25 + $75)/2 = $40

So, the total cost of each uniform is: $25 + $75 + $40 = $130."
Response:  To find out how many legs Jake sees, we need to add up the number of legs on all the creatures he saw. The spiders have 8 legs each, so that's 8 x 80 = 640 legs from the spiders alone. The insects have 6 legs each, so that's 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. And there are 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 legs from those. So, in total, Jake sees 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.
Response:  The total age of the four birds is 30 + 24 + 16 + 8 = 78 years.
"Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month and then multiply it by 12. Let's do that step by step:

Total monthly payment = Minimum payment for student loan + Minimum payment for credit card + Minimum payment for mortgage + 50% of minimum payment for each (optional)
= $300 + $200 + $500 + ($300 x 1.5)
= $1500 + $300
= $1800 per month

Now, let's calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year:
Total annual payment = Total monthly payment x 12 months
= $1800 x 12
= $21,600 per year

So, Jessica pays $21,600 in a year towards her debts if she chooses to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt."
Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that it takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato (1 min 15 sec) and about 5 seconds to cut it up. Since there are 60 potatoes to prepare, we can multiply these times by 60 to find the total time it will take Billy to prep all the potatoes. So, the answer is: 1 min 15 sec x 60 = 900 sec or 15 minutes.
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that they sold 20 glasses of lemonade per gallon and that each glass cost $0.50. So, if they sold a total of 10 gallons of lemonade (since they made $25 in profit), then they sold 20 x 10 = $200 worth of lemonade. Since each gallon costs $3 for lemons, they spent $3 x 10 = $30 on lemons. Therefore, they spent $30 on lemons.
Response:  There are no girls on the Chinese team because the question states that all members of the Chinese team are boys.
"Response:  To find out how much money Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to subtract the total amount spent from his income.

Income = $6000

Rent = $1500 (1/4 of $6000)
Car Fuel = $2000 (1/3 of $6000)
Donation = $3000 (half of $6000)
Weekly Expenses for Daughter = $200
Groceries and Other Household Goods for Wife = $700
Total Spent = Rent + Car Fuel + Donation + Weekly Expenses for Daughter + Groceries and Other Household Goods for Wife = $5500

So, the amount of money that Zaid has left is:

$6000 - $5500 = $500

Therefore, Zaid has $500 left after all these expenses and donations."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, which means Rani has x crabs and Monic has x - 10 crabs.
Bo has 4 fewer crabs than Monic, which means Bo has x - (4 × 10) = x - 40 crabs.
Total number of crabs the three have together is equal to the sum of their individual crab counts:
x + (x - 10) + (x - 40) = 40
Simplifying the equation:
3x = 40
Solving for x:
x = 13
So, Rani has 13 crabs, Monic has 13 - 10 = 3 crabs, and Bo has 13 - 40 = -27 crabs."
Response:  For the first two weeks, Lloyd earned a total of $40 ($10/hour x 5 hours + $10/hour x 8 hours).
Response:  Let X be the number of votes received by the loser. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, the number of votes received by the winner is 3X/4. Therefore, we can write an equation: 3X/4 = 72 (since there were 80 students who voted). Solving for X, we get X = 16. So, the loser got 16 votes.
Response:  Let's first calculate the total number of flowers that Sandra needs for her orders: Red roses = 4 x (total number of flowers) White carnations = 200 / 5 = 40 Pink calla lilies = 5 x (total number of flowers) Total flowers needed = Red roses + White carnations + Pink calla lilies = 4 x (total number of flowers) + 40 + 5 x (total number of flowers) = 4x(total number of flowers) + 130 Now we know that Fred only delivered 80% of the total flowers, so he did not deliver all of the red roses or white carnations. We can use this information to find out how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm: Red roses = Total flowers needed - (Fred's delivery percentage x Total flowers needed) = 4x(total number of flowers) - (0.8 x 4x(total number of flowers)) = 4x(total number of flowers) - 3.2x(total number of flowers) = 4x(total number of flowers) - 12.8 = 16.2 red roses By 5 pm, Fred must deliver at least 16.2 red roses to satisfy Sandra's orders and avoid losing her business.
Response:  Jean is 32 years old.
"Response:  To solve this problem we need to find out the total time taken by both teams to complete the race. Let's assume that the slower team takes x seconds to complete their race. Since they start with a disadvantage of 3 seconds per runner, their total time would be:

x + (1/4) \* (60 - x) = 55

Now, let's find the time taken by the faster team. As mentioned earlier, each member of the faster team runs their 400 meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. So, the total time taken by them would be:

4 \* 55 = 220

Now, we can calculate the difference between the times taken by both teams:

220 - x = 55

Solving for x, we get:

x = 75

So, the slower team takes 75 seconds to complete their race, while the faster team takes 220 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 145 seconds (220 - 75)."
"Response:  To determine the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we can use the following formula:

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

In this case, there are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6

Of these outcomes, the number greater than 3 is:

4, 5, and 6

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

(Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) = (3) / (6) = 0.5 or 50%

Now, to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes for this event. An even number in a row refers to the outcome where the first number rolled is even and the second number rolled is also even. The total number of outcomes for this event is:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6

The number of favorable outcomes for this event is:

2, 4, and 6

So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

(Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) = (3) / (6) = 0.5 or 50%

Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row is also 50%."
Response:  Let's assume that Jenna picked x apples. Since her mother picked 20 apples, the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother is 20 + x = 40. So, Jenna picked 20 apples.
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* Total number of pieces of straw distributed = 160
* Number of cages for small rodents (rats) = 3
* Number of pieces of straw given to each rat = 6
* Number of rats in each cage =?

We know that the total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160, and since there are 3 cages, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 3 x 6 = 18. Therefore, there are 18 rats in each cage."
"Response:  To find out the amount that Mandy needs to pay to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount due including principal and interest.

Total Amount Due = Principal + Interest x Time
= $100 + ($100 x 2%) x 3/12
= $100 + $2 x $3/12
= $100 + $6
= $106

Therefore, Mandy needs to pay $106 to Benedict after 3 months."
"Response:  Let's first calculate the total cost of transportation for all the bags:
Transportation cost = Number of bags x Cost per bag x Transportation distance
= 10 bags x $2 x 5 km (distance between farm and warehouse)
= $100
Now, let's find out the total profit earned by the trader:
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= 10 bags x $30 x Profit percentage
= $3000 (since the trader made a profit of $400)
Now, we can use the following equation to find out the number of bags sold:
Number of bags = Total profit / (Transportation cost + Profit percentage)
Substituting the values given in the question:
Number of bags = $3000 / ($100 + 20%)
= 16 bags
Therefore, the trader sold 16 bags of wheat."
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The total cost of the tickets is $20.25.
2. The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets.
3. Each person paid an equal amount for the tickets and food.

Now, let's use these facts to find out how much each person paid:

Total cost of tickets = $20.25
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75
Each person paid an equal amount for tickets and food, so each person paid:
Ticket price = Total cost of tickets / Number of people = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75
Food price = Cost of food / Number of people = $15.75 / 3 = $5.25

So, each person paid $6.75 for the tickets and $5.25 for the food, for a total of $11.95 per person."
Response:  John collects 3 x 2 = 6 peaches in 3 hours.
Response:  To find out how much insects the duck needs per day, we can use the information given in the question that the duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the duck needs to eat 24.5 pounds of insects per week (3.5 x 7). Therefore, if there are ten ducks, they need to eat 245 pounds of insects per day (24.5 x 10).

Response:  According to the information given in the passage, there are 23786 inhabitants in the city of Soda. Among them, 8417 are men and 9092 are women. This means that the total number of adults (men + women) is 17519. Since the remaining population consists of children only, the number of kids in Soda is 23786 - 17519 = 6267.
Response:  Elaine has 80 Pokemon cards in total.
Response:  To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we need to first find out how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, Mark edits 200 sentences (1000 / 5) for Publisher A. Similarly, since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence (2 x 5 = 10). So, Mark edits 100 sentences (1000 / 10) for Publisher B. Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Mark makes in a week: For Publisher A, Mark makes $20 (200 sentences x 5 cents/sentence). For Publisher B, Mark makes $200 (100 sentences x 10 cents/sentence). Therefore, Mark makes a total of $220 in a week ($20 + $200).
"Response:  To find out the total amount of water that Baldur gets every day, we need to calculate the number of liters of water he gets in the morning and then add it to the number of liters of water he gets in the afternoon. Let's do this step by step:

Morning:
Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning, so he gets 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water in the morning.

Afternoon:
Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon, so he gets 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water in the afternoon.

Total daily water supply:
Adding the number of liters of water Baldur gets in the morning and afternoon gives us a total of 25 + 30 = 55 liters of water per day.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"Response:  To find out how much money John made that year, we need to calculate his total earnings from January 1st to December 31st. Since he makes $2000 per week, his total earnings for the year would be:

$2000 x 52 weeks = $104,000

So, John made $104,000 that year."
Response:  To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to multiply the number of acres she has by the amount of grapes produced per acre. Since there are 5 tons of grapes produced per acre, multiplying that by the number of acres gives us 5 x 10 = 50 tons of grapes per year. Then, since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, multiplying 50 tons of grapes by 2 barrels per ton gives us 100 barrels of wine per year. So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response:  To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add up all the amounts of cheese he used throughout the week. Let's do that:

* He ate a sandwich with 2 slices of cheese every day = 14 slices of cheese (2 x 7 days)
* He had cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days = 3 slices of cheese (1 extra slice per omelet)
* He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese = 8 slices of cheese
Total number of slices of cheese Carl used = 14 + 3 + 8 = 25 slices of cheese
Therefore, Carl used 25 slices of cheese throughout the week."

Response:  To get an average of 93, Brinley needs a score of at least 95 on the sixth test.
Response:  Total distance = (5 x 25) + (2 x 60) = 150 + 120 = 270 kilometers
Response:  To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to first calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and then add that to the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can use this information to convert the weights from grams per item to grams overall. Let's start by calculating the weight of the chocolate bars: 25 x 40 = 1000g (since each chocolate bar weighs 40g) Now, let's calculate the weight of the candied apples: 80 / 2 = 40g (since each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar) So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 1000 + 40 = 1040g.
"Response:  Let's break this down step by step:

Day 1 (Monday): Rose went to the store and bought 4 cakes.

Total cakes = 4

Day 2 (Tuesday): Rose went to a different store and bought 3 times as many cakes as she bought on Monday. So, she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

Total cakes = 4 + 12 = 16

Day 3 (Wednesday): Rose went to another store and bought 5 times as many cakes as she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought 5 x 16 = 80 cakes.

Total cakes = 16 + 80 = 96 cakes

Therefore, Rose bought a total of 96 cakes over the course of the three days."
Response:  Let's assume that the number of cups is x. Then, we know that the total cost of half a dozen plates = 6x$6000 = 36x$1000 = 36000x$. Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount, we can write: 36000x - 1200 = 24000x$. Now, dividing both sides by 24 gives us x = 1000. So, the total cost of buying each cup is $1000.
"Response:  To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sara will have after she finishes babysitting and mowing the lawn. Let's do that:

Babysitting: 4 times x $5 per time = $20
Mowing the lawn: 4 times x $4 per time = $16
Total amount of money Sara will have = $20 + $16 = $36
Now, let's compare this amount with the cost of the jacket and shoes:
Jacket cost = $30
Each pair of shoes cost = $20
Total cost = $30 + $20 + $20 = $70
Since Sara has $36 after finishing both tasks, she can afford the jacket and two pairs of shoes. Therefore, she needs to mow the lawn 7 times ( $70 / $10 = 7) to save enough money to buy what she wants."
Response:  Let's assume that Jerry has x red chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(2) = 10 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42 + 10 = 52 eggs per day. Now, we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This means that if he has x red chickens, then he has x + 2 white chickens. So, the number of red chickens Jerry has can be calculated as follows: x = 52 / (3x + 2). Solving for x, we get x = 17. Therefore, Jerry has 17 red chickens.
Response:  Gary will spend 2 hours walking if he walks at 3 miles per hour.
Response:  On the third day, Sloane counted 300 customers (100 + 50 + 200 = 300).
Response:  The small pool has 8 gallons of water now.
"Response:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage. In this case, the total cost is $352 ($320 + $32), and her hourly wage is $8. So, Lori would need to work for:

$352 / $8 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours to afford the shoes and belt."
Response:  To find out Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate her total payment first. The formula for calculating total payment is: Total Payment = Principal Amount x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal amount is $2000, rate is 10% (which means $200 in addition to the principal amount), and time is 12 months. So, Total Payment = $2000 x 10% x 12 = $3200. Now, if Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance at the end of 12 months will be: Remaining Balance = Principal Amount - Total Payment = $2000 - $3200 = -$1200. Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be negative $1200.
Response:  Total number of flowers in the vase = Number of roses + Number of dahlias = 4 + (7 - 4) = 15
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:
Adrian's age = 3 × (Harriet's age)
Harriet's age = Zack's age / 2

Now, we can use the first equation to find Adrian's age:
Adrian's age = 3 × (21) = 63

Next, we can use the second equation to find Harriet's age:
Harriet's age = Zack's age / 2 = 21 / 2 = 10.5

Since Harriet's age is not a whole number, we need to round it up to the nearest integer. So, Harriet's age after 3 years will be:
Harriet's age after 3 years = 10 + 3 = 13

Similarly, Adrian's age after 3 years will be:
Adrian's age after 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after 3 years is:
Average age = (66 + 13 + 21) / 3 = 49.67"
Response: 49
Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 10 x 3 = 30 minutes solving crossword puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving sudoku puzzles. Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
Response:  The amount of water in the tank before Celine used it = 120 liters. After Celine used 90 liters of water, the remaining amount of water in the tank = 30 liters (120 - 90). Then, when she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, the new amount of water in the tank = 60 liters (30 x 2)
"Response:  Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias - Number of fewer petunias

Response:  The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $22,500 ($15,000 x 2).
"Response:  To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost of each rental separately and then add them up.

For Carlos:
Cost = $30/hour x 3 hours = $90

For Benji:
Cost = $18/hour x 5 hours = $90

So, together they will pay $180 for their rentals."
"Response:  If Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, then the total number of days he will travel is equal to the time it takes to travel by bus plus the time it takes to travel by car. Since it takes half as much time to travel by car as by bus, we can say that the total time = (time by bus) / 2 + (time by car).
So, the answer is: Total number of days = (6 days by bus) / 2 + (time by car) = 6/2 + x, where x is the time taken to travel by car."
Response:  The probability of a randomly picked card being a water type after losing 8 of them and buying 14 more grass types is 50%.
"Response:  To find out how much Chad owes, we need to calculate the total cost of his meal first. Here's how:

Base Burrito ($6.50) + Extra Meat ($2.00) + Extra Cheese ($1.00) + Avocado ($1.00) + Sauces ($0.25 x 2 = $0.50) + Upgrade ($3.00) = Total Cost ($6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00)

Now, let's subtract the amount of the gift card ($5.00):
$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad owes $9.00."
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Kalinda and her mom to add one piece each. Let's assume that Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, so she adds 4 x 60 = 240 pieces in an hour. Since her mom can only add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom adds 240 / 2 = 120 pieces in an hour. Now, let's find out how many hours it will take them to complete the entire puzzle. The number of pieces in the puzzle is 360, so they will need to work for 360 / 120 = 3 hours to complete the puzzle. Therefore, it will take them 3 hours to complete the puzzle.
Response:  After two weeks, 70 baby watermelons were left on the farm (since 30% were ready in two months). So, when Ashlyn returned two weeks later, there were 70 - 30 = 40 baby watermelons left on the farm that were not yet ready to be harvested.
"Response:  To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars first. The total cost of 12 cars is:

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Then, Mark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars, which is:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

Finally, Mark pays an additional $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars, so the total amount he pays for registration is:

$240,000 x 12 = $28,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

$24,000 + $28,000 = $52,000"
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, which means Kylie collects 25 shells (Monday = 20 + 5).
On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday, so Kylie collects 49 shells on Tuesday (Tuesday = 2 x 25).
Therefore, Kylie collects 49 shells on Tuesday."
Response:  The total number of insects in the garden is 25 (half of 50).
"Response:  Total number of penguins = Number of penguins sunbathing + Number of penguins that jumped in and swam in the ocean + Number of penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner - Number of penguins that were already sunbathing before any action took place.

So, let's break it down step by step:

1. Number of penguins sunbathing = 36 (given)
2. Number of penguins that jumped in and swam in the ocean =? (we don't know yet)
3. Number of penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner =? (we don't know yet)
4. Number of penguins that were already sunbathing before any action took place = 0 (since we assume they were all sunbathing when the question started)

Now, let's calculate the total number of penguins:
Total number of penguins = Number of penguins sunbathing + Number of penguins that jumped in and swam in the ocean + Number of penguins that went inside the cave to eat their dinner - Number of penguins that were already sunbathing before any action took place
= 36 + x + y - 0
where x and y are the unknown values for the numbers of penguins that jumped in and swam in the ocean, and went inside the cave to eat their dinner respectively.
Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 1/3 \* 36 = 12
y = 1/3 \* 36 = 12

Therefore, there are 36 penguins still left sunbathing after some of them jumped in and swam in the ocean, and after some of them went inside the cave to eat their dinner."
Response:  To find out how many vines Steve needs, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes he wants to grow by the number of tomatoes each vine can produce in a week. In this case, Steve wants to grow 18 tomatoes (2 x 9 = 18). Since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve will need 6 vines (18 / 3 = 6). So, Steve needs 6 vines to grow all the tomatoes he wants.
"Response:  To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we must divide the number of friends by the number of slices per pizza. In this case, there are 20 friends and each pizza has 8 slices, so John will need to order:

20 friends / 8 slices per pizza = 5 pizzas

Therefore, John needs to order 5 pizzas to ensure that each friend gets 4 slices."
Response:  Total number of pens = Number of pens used + Number of pens made = 25 + (Number of pens mixed x Number of times ink is reused) = 25 + (5 x 4) = 25 + 20 = 45 pens.
Response:  After a year, Johnny had $30 x 3 = $90.
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, Joan's age = Mary's age + 2.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, Jessa's age = Joan's age - 5.
3. Jessa is 20 years old. So, Joan's age = 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
4. Since Mary is two years younger than Joan, Mary's age = 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, we can find the sum of the ages of the three girls by adding their individual ages:
Sum of ages = Mary's age + Joan's age + Jessa's age
= 23 + 25 + 20
= 68 years old."
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. Total number of students = 1000
2. Number of entrances (A, B, and C) = 3
3. After the meeting, 30% of the students went out through exit A, so the number of students who went out through exit A = 30% x 1000 = 300
4. Remaining students = Total number of students - Number of students who went out through exit A = 1000 - 300 = 700
5. Now, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, so the number of students who went out through exit B = 3/5 x 700 = 420
6. Finally, the rest of the students went out through exit C, so the number of students who went out through exit C = Total number of students - Number of students who went out through exit A + Number of students who went out through exit B = 1000 - 300 + 420 = 280

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. James has 6 more candies than Robert. This means that if Robert has x candies, James has x + 6 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert. This means that if Robert has x candies, John has 2x candies.
3. John has 54 candies. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

John = 2(Robert) +? (where? represents the number of candies James has)

Substituting Robert's value from point 1, we get:

John = 2(x) +?

Now, let's solve for? (the number of candies James has):

? = 54 - 2x

So, James has 54 - 2x candies. Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, we can say that James has:

James = Robert + 6

Now, substituting Robert's value from point 1, we get:

James = x + 6

Therefore, John has 54 more candies than James."
Response:  By the end of the activity, Dolly and Pandora will have read a total of 3 books between them.
"Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to know the number of days in a week and the number of letters he sends per day. Let's assume there are 7 days in a week.

Mike stops being pen pals with 2 people, so he will no longer receive or send letters from those two people. So, let's subtract 2 letters/day x 7 days/week = 14 letters/week from the total number of letters he used to send.

Now, we know that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so he can write 60 pages (1 hour / 6 minutes) in a week. Since he is sending 14 fewer letters now, he has more time to focus on the remaining letters. Therefore, he can write 60 pages / 14 letters = 4.29 pages/day.

So, Mike spends approximately 4.29 hours/week writing letters."
Response:  If Jason has used 300 minutes more than his allocated 1000 minutes, then he has used up all his minutes for the month. So, he has no minutes left.
"Response:  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 French fries initially.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 French fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, i.e., 2 × 5 = 10 French fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is equal to 5 French fries (since she had 20).
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which means he took 3 fewer than 10 French fries. So, Colby took 10 - 3 = 7 French fries.
6. In total, Griffin lost 5 + 10 - 3 = 18 French fries.
7. Therefore, the final number of French fries that Griffin had was 19 - 18 = 1 French fry.
8. Since Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is equal to 5 French fries, Ginger gave Griffin 5 French fries in total."
"Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in Aquarium A is x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, the number of snails in Aquarium B is 2x.
Now, we know that there are 4 snails in Aquarium A and 32 snails in Aquarium B, so we can write:
Aquarium A: 4 snails
Aquarium B: 2x snails
We also know that the total number of snails in both aquariums is equal to the sum of the number of snails in each aquarium, so we can write:
Total Snails = 4 + 2x
Substituting the value of x from the problem statement, we get:
Total Snails = 4 + 2(32)
Total Snails = 80
Therefore, there are 80 fish in each aquarium."
"Response:  To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services over the duration of the movie shoot.

Total Cost = Number of Hours x Rate per Hour
= 6 x $250
= $1500

Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we subtract that amount from the total cost:
Discounted Total Cost = Total Cost - Discount Percentage x Total Cost
= $1500 - ($1500 x 10%)
= $1350

Therefore, Jean paid $1350 for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot."
Response:  Each person paid $79.
Response:  The chef spent a total of $600.
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies, and her sister ate 5 cookies.
* On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 5 = 10 cookies, and her sister ate 5 cookies again.
* The total number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday and Tuesday is 20 + 10 = 30 cookies.
* The total number of cookies eaten by her sister on Monday and Tuesday is 5 + 5 = 10 cookies.

Now, let's find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

* Calories in 1 cookie = 200
* Total calories consumed by Sue on Monday and Tuesday = 30 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 6000 calories
* Total calories consumed by her sister on Monday and Tuesday = 10 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 2000 calories

So, Sue consumed 6000 - 2000 = 4000 more calories than her sister."
