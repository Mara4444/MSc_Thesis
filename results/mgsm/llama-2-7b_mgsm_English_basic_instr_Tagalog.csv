Response:  For Eliza to calculate her earnings for the week, we need to multiply her regular hourly rate by the number of hours she worked and then add any overtime pay she received. So, if Eliza worked for 45 hours at a rate of $10 per hour, her total earnings for the week would be: Total Earnings = Regular Hourly Rate x Number of Hours Worked + Overtime Pay x Number of Hours Worked Over 40 hours This week, Eliza worked for 45 hours, so her total earnings would be: Total Earnings = $10 x 45 + ($10 x 15) = $600 + $150 = $750  Therefore, Eliza's earnings for the week are $750.
Response:  To find the total number of downloads for the program over the three months, we can use the information given in the problem. In the first month, there were 60 downloads. In the second month, there were 3 x 60 = 180 downloads (since the number of downloads increased by a factor of 3). Then, in the third month, there were 180 - 30% = 126 downloads (since the number of downloads decreased by 30%). Therefore, the total number of downloads for the program over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads.

"Response: 4 years

Answer:
To find out how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree over those years, as well as the total revenue he will generate from selling the lemons.

Total Cost = $90 (planting cost) + ($3 x number of years) (maintenance cost)
Total Revenue = $1.50 x 7 lemons/year (lemon price) x number of years (number of years until earning money)

Now let's plug in the values given in the problem:

Total Cost = $90 + ($3 x 4 years) = $90 + $12 = $102
Total Revenue = $1.50 x 7 lemons/year x 4 years = $60

Since the total cost is greater than the total revenue, it will take Carlos 4 years before he starts earning money from his lemon tree."
Response:  Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners that Melanie started with. From the problem, we know that Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had (x - 1)/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house. Similarly, she had (x - 2)/4 vacuum cleaners left after selling to the red house, and she had (x - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners left after selling to the orange house. Therefore, the total number of vacuum cleaners that Melanie had left after selling to all three houses is: (x - 1)/3 + (x - 2)/4 + (x - 2)/2 = 5. Solving for x, we get x = 15. So, Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners.

Answer: x = 60

Explanation:
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

Day 1: Both trains travel westward for 80 miles, so the distance traveled by each train is 80 miles.

Day 2: One train travels northward for 150 miles, while the other train continues to travel westward for another 80 miles. So, the distance traveled by each train on Day 2 is:

Westward train: 80 miles (from Day 1) + 80 miles (on Day 2) = 160 miles
Northward train: 150 miles (on Day 2)

Now, let's find the total distance traveled by each train over the two days:

Total distance traveled by Westward train = 160 miles
Total distance traveled by Northward train = 150 miles + 160 miles = 310 miles

Therefore, the answer is x = 60 miles per hour."

"Response:  $240.00
Explanation: To find out how much Cynthia spends on ice cream after 60 days, we need to multiply the number of servings in each carton by the number of cartons she buys and then multiply that result by the cost per carton. Since there are 15 servings in each carton and Cynthia buys 3 cartons per month (since it takes her 60 days to finish them all), the total number of servings she consumes is:

15 servings/carton x 3 cartons/month = 45 servings/month
Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, she consumes 45 servings of ice cream in one month. Therefore, the total amount she spends on ice cream after 60 days is:

$4.00/carton x 45 servings/month x 2 months = $240.00

"Response: 168 points.

Answer: 168 points

Explanation:
Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, so his rate of scoring is 4/20 = 0.2 points per minute.
In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points, which means he scored (0.2 x 1.25) = 0.25 points per minute.
Therefore, Mike scored a total of 0.2 + 0.25 = 0.45 points per minute.
Since he played for 40 minutes, he scored a total of 0.45 x 40 = 168 points."

"Response: 12 min/mile

Answer:
Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* John runs 60 miles per week.
* He runs 3 days a week.
* On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
* On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as on the first day.

Now, let's calculate his running speed based on the information provided:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 60 miles / 3 hours (first day)
= 60 miles / (2 x 1.5 hours) (other two days)

Substituting the values, we get:

Speed = 60 miles / (2 x 1.5 hours)
= 60 miles / 3 hours
= 12 minutes/mile

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 12 minutes per mile."
Response:  To find out how far Dana can travel in six hours, we need to calculate her total distance traveled during that period. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can use the following formula: Distance = (Running time x Speed) + (Walking time x Walking speed) Where: Distance = Total distance traveled Time = Running time + Walking time Speed = Rate of speed when running + Rate of speed when walking Walking speed = Half the rate of speed when running Therefore, using the given values: Distance = (1/3 x 4 x 8) + (2/3 x 3 x 2) Distance = 64 + 96 Distance = 160 miles In six hours, Dana can travel 160 / 6 = 26.67 miles per hour
Response: 4 x (Ben's age of iPhone) = Brandon's age of iPhone.  Since Ben's iPhone is 2 years older than Suzy's iPhone, Ben's iPhone is 3 years old. So, Brandon's iPhone is 4 x 3 = 12 years old.
"Response:  To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to use the formula:
Distance = Speed x Time + Distance
Where:
Speed = Distance thrown by Polly without the gemstone / Time taken to throw the javelin
Time = Distance thrown by Polly with the gemstone / Speed
Distance = Total distance from where Polly stands to where the javelin hits the dragon
In this case, without the gemstone, Polly throws the javelin for a distance of 400 feet in one second (since it takes her one second to throw the javelin). So, Speed = 400/1 = 400 feet per second.
With the gemstone, Polly throws the javelin for a distance of 3 times 400 = 1200 feet in one second (since it takes her one second to throw the javelin). So, Time = 1200/400 = 3 seconds.
Now, using the formula above, we get:
Distance = Speed x Time + Distance
= 400 x 3 + 400
= 1200 + 400
= 1600 feet
Therefore, if Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can stand 1600 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin."

"Response:  To determine the number of grams of chips that you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a serving of chips, we need to use simple math. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of calories in the 300g bag of chips: 300g x 250 calories/serving = 75,000 calories (total)
2. Subtract the number of calories you have already consumed from your daily target: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories remaining
3. Divide the total number of calories in the bag by the number of calories remaining in your daily target: 75,000 calories / 200 calories = 375 grams of chips (you can eat)

So, if your daily calorie target is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, you can eat up to 375 grams of chips (based on the nutritional information provided)."

"Response:  To find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information given in the problem. Here's how we can calculate it:
Day 1 (Monday): Number of articles written = 5
Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
Total time spent writing articles on Monday = 5 x 4 = 20 hours

Day 2 (Tuesday): Number of articles written = 2/5 x 5 = 4 articles
Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
Total time spent writing articles on Tuesday = 4 x 4 = 16 hours

Day 3 (Wednesday): Number of articles written = 2 x 5 = 10 articles
Time taken to write each article = 4 hours
Total time spent writing articles on Wednesday = 10 x 4 = 40 hours

Total time spent writing articles in the three days = 20 + 16 + 40 = 76 hours
Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 76 hours writing articles in the three days."
"Response:  To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to subtract the number of Post-it notes she used from the total number of Post-it notes she had.
Let's use algebra to solve this problem:
Total number of Post-it notes = Number of Post-it notes Candice had - Number of Post-it notes used
= 80 - (23 + 220)
= 80 - 243
= -163
Since the result is negative, it means that there are more Post-it notes in the package than Candice actually used. So, the answer must be greater than or equal to zero. In other words, the number of Post-it notes in the package is greater than or equal to 163.
Therefore, the answer is 163 Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased."

Explanation:
Let's say the number of blue ties John bought is x. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is 2x.
The total amount John spent on ties is given by the equation:
Total Cost = Number of Blue Ties x Price of Blue Tie + Number of Red Ties x Price of Red Tie
= x x $40 + 2x x ($50/2)
= $80x + $100x
= $180x
Since John spent $200 on ties, we can set up the equation:
$180x = $200
Solving for x, we get:
x = $160
Therefore, John spent $160 on ties."

Response:  To find the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate x Speed. In this case, the distance traveled by Tom during his trip is 20 miles (since he sails from 1 to 4 PM). The rate at which he travels is 10 miles/hour when he is going north and 6 miles/hour when he is going south. So, if we plug in these values into the formula, we get: Time = 20 miles / (10 miles/hour x 2 hours) + (20 miles / (6 miles/hour x 2 hours)) = 5 hours + 3.33 hours = 8.33 hours. Therefore, it will take Tom 8.33 hours to get back.
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the formula: Total weight of book bag - Weight of comic books = Number of toys to be removed Let's substitute the given values in the formula: Total weight of book bag = 15 pounds Weight of comic books = 1/4 pound x 30 comic books = 7.5 pounds So, the total weight of the book bag without the comic books is: 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove 7.5 pounds from his book bag to make it lighter. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, he needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 pound = 15 toys from his book bag. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag to make it lighter by 7.5 pounds.

Response:  Let R be the number of pounds of laundry done by Raymond, D be the number of pounds of laundry done by David, and S be the number of pounds of laundry done by Sarah. We know that R = (1/2)S, since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Also, we know that D = 4S, since David does 4 times as much laundry as Sarah. Now, we can use these two equations to solve for R: R = (1/2)S = (1/2)(400) = 200 pounds of laundry done by Raymond. Therefore, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 200 - 400 = -200 pounds.

Response:  Let's assume that the number of pet dogs = x, then the number of pet cats = 2x. Since the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, we can write: x + (2x) - 12 = 60. Solving for x, we get: x = 30. Therefore, there are 30 pet dogs and 60 pet cats in the neighborhood.

Answer: 16

Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the problem to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scout.

From the problem, we know that:

* Out of 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 = 40 are boys (since 2/5 is equal to 80%).
* 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout, which means that 2/3 x 140 = 98 girls are in the Girl Scout.

So, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout is:
140 - 98 = 42

Therefore, there are 42 girls who are not in the Girl Scout."

Ang ibig sabihin dito ay naisipan mo na Harry at James ang nagkakaintindi kung baga ang oras na napupuno ni Harry. Kaya may mga linggong hindi kaagad na napupuno ng isang oras. Ang ginawa mo ay tumuklasa kung gaano kalaki ang oras na napupuno ni Harry habang nasa 9 oras siya. At ngunit ang oras na napupuno ni James ay hindi pa rin complete na 9 oras. So, ang difference between Harry and James is 9 - 2/3 x 9 = 4 hours."
Response:  To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to divide the volume of the tomato sauce by the volume of each tomato. Since each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes and Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, we can calculate as follows: Number of tomatoes = Volume of tomato sauce / Volume of one tomato  Number of tomatoes = 32 ounces / 16 ounces per can  Number of tomatoes = 2 cans  Therefore, Freda used 2 cans of tomatoes or 6 tomatoes in total.
Response:  The number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 10 (20 - 5).
Response:  Mary will remain with 36 potted plants (18 new + 2 existing x 40 window ledges).
Response:  Let X be the total number of doorbell rings made by all 4 friends combined. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, their contribution to X is 20. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, so their contribution to X is (20 x 1/4) = 5. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so their contribution to X is (60 - 40) = 20. Therefore, the total contribution of all 4 friends to X is 20 + 5 + 20 = 55. So, the answer is 55.
Response:  To find out the number of pages that Solo needs to read per day, we can use the formula: Total Number of Pages / Number of Days = Average Number of Pages Per Day. In this case, the total number of pages is 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 pages. Since Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading, we divide the total number of pages by 4: 49 pages / 4 days = 12.25 pages per day. So, on average, Solo needs to read 12.25 pages per day to finish all his assigned reading within the given time frame.

"Response:  The time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city can be calculated as follows:
Time = Distance / Rate
Distance = 42 miles
Rate = Speed at which the fog bank covers 3 miles (in this case, 10 minutes/3 miles)
Speed = 10 minutes / 3 miles = 3.33 miles per minute
Now we can calculate the time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city:
Time = Distance / Rate
= 42 miles / 3.33 miles/minute
= 12.5 minutes
So it will take approximately 12.5 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."

"Response:  To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then add them up.
The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:
Volume = Length x Width x Height
So, the volume of the first box is:
V1 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
The volume of the second box is:
V2 = 5 inches x 7 inches x 4 inches = 140 cubic inches
The volume of the third box is:
V3 = 5 inches x 8 inches x 4 inches = 160 cubic inches
Now, let's add the volumes of all three boxes together to get the total inner volume:
Total Volume = V1 + V2 + V3 = 120 + 140 + 160 = 420 cubic inches
Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is 420 cubic inches."

Response:  After using the cashback reward, the cost of 10 gallons of gas will be $28.00 ($3.00 x 10).  So, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas including the cashback reward will be $28.00 - $20.00 = $8.00.
Response:  Average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell = (Number of roll-ups in his container) / (Width of his container + Width of Beatrice's container) x 100 Average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Beatrice = (Number of roll-ups in her container) / (Width of her container + Width of Marcell's container) x 100 Solution: Let's start with Marcell's problem. The width of Marcell's container is 3 roll-ups wide, which means he has 3x as much space as Beatrice does. Since Beatrice's container is 24 roll-ups long, she has 24/3 = 8 times as much space as Marcell does. So, if Marcell ate all of his roll-ups, he would have eaten 3x8 = 24 roll-ups. Now, let's do the same calculation for Beatrice. Her container is 24 roll-ups long, but since it's 2 roll-ups wide, she has 24/2 = 12 times as much space as Marcell does. If Beatrice ate all of her roll-ups, she would have eaten 12x24 = 288 roll-ups. To find out how many roll-ups each person averaged, we need to divide the total number of roll-ups they ate by the combined width of their containers. For Marcell, that works out to be 24 / (3 + 2) = 60 roll-ups per person. For Beatrice, it works out to be 288 / (2 + 3) = 97 roll-ups per person. Therefore, on average, Marcell ate 60 roll-ups and Beatrice ate 97 roll-ups.
Response:  To find the amount of water that the boat took on, we need to use the formula: Water taken on = Distance rowed x Rate at which water is entering the boat / Time it took to row that distance. In this case, the distance Julia rowed was 20 feet, and the rate at which the boat was taking on water was 2 liters per 10 feet. So, to find the amount of water that the boat took on, we can plug these values into the formula like this: Water taken on = 20 ft x 2 L/10 ft / 16 sec = 320 L. Therefore, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 320 liters of water.

Response:  Profit = Total Revenue - Cost Price Total Revenue = Number of Boards Sold x Price per Board  For 2 x 4 boards: 10 boards x $10/board = $100 For 4 x 4 boards: 5 boards x $16/board = $80 Total Revenue = $100 + $80 = $180 Cost Price = Total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = Sum of Cost of Each Board x Quantity of Each Board COGS for 2 x 4 boards: 10 boards x $10/board = $100 COGS for 4 x 4 boards: 5 boards x $16/board = $80 Total COGS = $100 + $80 = $180 Profit = Total Revenue - Cost Price = $180 - $180 = $0 So Sasha doesn't make any profit from selling the leftover lumber.
Response:  The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used by Katy is 840. To find this answer, we can use the formula: Number of teaspoonfuls = Total amount of sugar / Ratio of sugar to water. In this case, the total amount of sugar used was 120 teaspoons, and the ratio of sugar to water was 7:13, or 7/13. So, we divide the total amount of sugar by the ratio to get the number of teaspoonfuls: 120 / 7/13 = 840.

"Response:  To find out how many containers were imported on the second day, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, 2 containers were imported with 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles.
2. On the second day, additional containers were brought in, bringing the total number of vehicles at the port to 30. This means that the number of containers imported on the second day is 30 / 5 = 6 containers.

Therefore, there were 6 containers imported on the second day."
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find out how much Adrien's salary increased over time. We can do this by using the formula:

New Salary = Old Salary x (1 + Increase Percentage) ^ Number of Years

We know that Adrien's salary is now $60000, so we can plug this value into the formula along with the other known values:

New Salary = $40000 x (1 + 40%)^4

Simplifying the calculation gives us:

New Salary = $56000

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $56000."

"Response: 20

Answer: 20

Explanation:
Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let X be the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started working on them. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she put stamps on X/3 letters. Now, there are (X - X/3) letters left in the pile of already-stamped letters. Since there are now 30 letters in this pile, we can set up the equation:

(X - X/3) = 30

Simplifying the equation, we get:

X = 20

So, there were 20 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began working on them."

Response:  The total amount of money that Dillon will spend for the fruits can be calculated as follows: Watermelon x price = $3x + $5 (orange) Pepper x price = $15 For watermelon, since it costs 3 times the price of pepper, we have: $3x + $5 = $45 For pepper, since it costs $15 per piece, we have: $15x = $600 Total amount spent by Dillon = $45 + $600 = $645 Therefore, the total amount of money that Dillon will spend for the fruits is $645.
"Response: 
The hospital makes a total profit of $37,500 per day.
To calculate this, we need to first find out how many hours the doctors work in a day. Let's assume that they work 8 hours a day (this is just an assumption, as the actual number of hours worked may vary).

Next, we need to find out how much the hospital pays the doctors per hour. Since the doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, and the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, we can deduce that the hospital pays the doctors $50 per hour ($200 - $150 = $50).

Now, let's calculate the total amount of time the doctors spend with each patient. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 500 patients per day, the total amount of time the doctors spend with patients is:

Time spent with patients = Number of patients x Time per patient
= 500 x 24/60
= 10,000 minutes

Finally, we can calculate the profit per day by multiplying the total amount of time the doctors spend with patients by their hourly rate:

Profit per day = Time spent with patients x Hourly rate
= 10,000 x $50
= $500,000

So, the hospital makes a daily profit of $500,000 from seeing 500 patients per day."

"Response:  To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to subtract the number of questions he answered in both tests from the total number of questions in each test.
For the first test, Mark answered 75/5 = 15 questions per hour. So, it took him 8 hours to answer 8 x 15 = 120 questions. This means he left 75 - 120 = 45 questions incomplete.
For the second test, Mark answered 100/5 = 20 questions per hour. So, it took him 6 hours to answer 6 x 20 = 120 questions. This means he left 100 - 120 = 20 questions incomplete.
Therefore, Mark left 45 + 20 = 65 questions incomplete."
Response:  Let x be the number of pink gumballs. Since there are 4 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, the number of blue gumballs is 4x/5.

Response:  To find out how much profit Lucas will make each week, we need to subtract his total expenses from his total income. His total income per week is $92, and his total expenses are $10 (2 x $2 = $4 for each of the 5 clients + $5 x 5 = $25 for the other 5 clients). So, his profit per week is: $92 - $10 - $25 = $57. Therefore, Lucas will make $57 in profit each week.
"Response: 400 pineapples.

Answer: 400 pineapples

Explanation:
To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total area of the field (in this case, 10 hectares). Since there are 100 pineapples per hectare, the total number of pineapples in John's field is:

100 pineapples/hectare x 10 hectares = 1000 pineapples

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (since there are 4 seasons in a year):

1000 pineapples / 4 harvests per year = 250 pineapples per harvest

Therefore, John can harvest 400 pineapples within a year ( since there are 4 harvests per year and each harvest yields 250 pineapples)."

Explanation:  At the start of the day, there are 30 bees in the hive. In the first 6 hours, half of them (or 15 bees) leave the hive and don't return. So at this point, there are 15 bees left in the hive. Then, twice as many bees leave the hive as had left earlier (i.e., 2 x 15 = 30 bees). Of these, half (or 15 bees) have not yet returned, so there are now 15 + 15 = 30 bees back in the hive. Therefore, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 30."

Response:  To find out when the winner will arrive at their house, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Where: Time - time it takes for the person to reach their house Distance - distance between the school and the person's house Speed - speed of the person (in this case, either Steve or Tim) In this problem, Steve lives 3 miles away from the school, which means the distance between the school and Steve's house is 3 miles. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, which means the distance between the school and Tim's house is also 2 miles. Now, let's find out how fast each of them can move: Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, which means he can cover 1 mile in 2 minutes (since there are 5,280 feet in a mile). So, if Steve starts biking as soon as he leaves the school, he will take 2 minutes to cover the distance of 3 miles, which means he will arrive at his house after 4 minutes (or 240 seconds). As for Tim, since he can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, he can cover 1 mile in 4 minutes (since there are 5,280 feet in a mile). So, if Tim starts skateboarding as soon as he leaves the school, he will take 4 minutes to cover the distance of 2 miles, which means he will arrive at his house after 8 minutes (or 480 seconds). Since Steve started earlier than Tim, he will arrive at his house first. Therefore, the winner will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

Answer: 48

Explanation:
Anakin caught 10 starfish, which is equal to 10 x 1 = 10 fish. He also caught 6 sea horses, which is equal to 6 x 1 = 6 fish. Additionally, he caught 3 clownfish, which is equal to 3 x 1 = 3 fish. In total, Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so she caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. She also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so she caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Finally, she caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so she caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish. In total, Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.
Therefore, the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin is 19 + 13 = 32 fish."

"Response: 105 + 3x + x = 270

Answer: 105 + 3x + x = 270

Explanation:
Let's break down the given information step by step:

* ""In a room, there are various toys"" means that we have a set of toys with different items.
* ""5 red cars"" means that there are 5 red toy cars in the set.
* ""3 action figures"" means that there are 3 action toys in the set.
* ""a doll"" means that there is one doll in the set.
* ""The doll cost as much as 3 action figures"" means that the value of the doll is equal to 3 times the value of an action figure.
* ""One red car cost $4"" means that each red toy car costs $4.

Now, let's formulate the equation based on the given information:

Total value of all toys = Value of doll + Value of red cars
= (Cost of doll) + (Cost of one red car) x Number of red cars
= ($5) + ($4 x 5)
= $105 + $20
= $125

Therefore, the total value of all toys in the room is $125."

Rationale: To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes him to prepare one potato. Since it takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato (1.5 minutes), and only about 5 seconds to cut it up, it will take him approximately 18 minutes to prep all 60 potatoes. That's 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes."
"Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to subtract the cost of lemons from their total earnings. Let's do that:
Total earnings = Number of glasses sold x Price per glass
= 20 glasses/gallon x $0.50/glass
= $10/gallon
Profit = Total earnings - Cost of goods sold (lemons + sugar)
= $10/gallon - ($3/gallon x number of gallons sold)
= $10/gallon - $6/gallon

"Response:  To determine the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, we can use the formula for the normal distribution:

Probability(X > 3) = 0.5 - 0.5 \* P(X < 3)

where X represents the value of the die roll. Since the minimum possible value of X is 1 and the maximum possible value is 6, we have:

P(X < 3) = 0.25 or 25%

Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is:

Probability(X > 3) = 0.5 - 0.5 \* 0.25 = 75% or 75%

To determine the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll, and then finding another even number on the second roll. We can use the same formula as before:

Probability(X_1 > 0 and X_2 > 0) = P(X_1 > 0) \* P(X_2 > 0 | X_1)

Since there are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of six possible values on a six-sided die, we have:

P(X_1 > 0) = 0.5 or 50%

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll given that an even number was rolled on the first roll is:

P(X_2 > 0 | X_1 = 2) = 0.5 or 50%
P(X_2 > 0 | X_1 = 4) = 0.5 or 50%
P(X_2 > 0 | X_1 = 6) = 0.5 or 50%

Therefore, the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row is:

Probability(X_1 > 0 and X_2 > 0) = 0.5 \* 0.5 = 25% or 25%.

So, based on these"

Answer: $102"
"Response: 50 bags.

Answer: 50 bags

Explanation:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The trader paid $20 for each bag of wheat. This means that the cost price of one bag is $20.
2. It costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse. So, the total cost of transporting one bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
3. After selling all the bags, the trader made a total profit of $400. Since there are 50 bags in total (as given in the question), we can find the profit per bag as follows:

Profit per bag = Total profit / Number of bags
= $400 / 50 bags
= $8 per bag
4. Now, let's use this information to find out how many bags the trader sold. We know that the trader made a profit of $8 per bag, so if he sold x bags, his total profit would be:

Total profit = Profit per bag x Number of bags sold
= $8 x x

We want to find out what value of x will make the trader's total profit equal to $400. Solving for x, we get:

x = 400 / $8
= 50 bags

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."

"Response: 1700g

Answer: 1700g

Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the problem to find out the weight of Joe's bag of candy.

Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can say that the weight of each chocolate bar is 2 times 40g = 80g.

So, the total weight of all the chocolate bars is 25 x 80g = 2000g.

Adding the weight of the candied apples, which are 80 x 80g = 6400g, we get a total weight of:

2000g + 6400g = 8400g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 8400g."
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Rose went to the store and bought 4 cakes.
* On Tuesday, Rose went to a different store and bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 12 cakes (since 3 x 4 = 12).
* On Wednesday, Rose went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 60 cakes (since 5 x 12 = 60).

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:

4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes

Therefore, the answer is 76 cakes."
Response: 300
"Response: 4 times
Explanation: To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we need to subtract the amount she already has from the total cost of the items she wants to buy. Let's do that:
Total cost = Cost of jacket + Cost of 2 pairs of shoes
= $30 + ($2 x 2)
= $30 + $40
= $70
Sara already has $10, so she needs to mow the lawn 60 / $10 = 6 times
Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 4 times to afford the jacket and shoes."
Response:  Let R be the number of red chickens. Since every red chicken produces 3 eggs/day, the total number of eggs produced by red chickens per day is 3R. Similarly, since every white chicken produces 5 eggs/day, the total number of eggs produced by white chickens per day is 5W, where W is the number of white chickens.  We know that the total number of eggs collected by Jerry per day is 42, so we can set up the equation:  3R + 5W = 42. Now, we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we can write: W = R + 2. Substituting this into the previous equation gives us: 3R + (R + 2) = 42. Simplifying, we get: 3R + 2 = 42. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us: 3R = 40. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: R = 13. Therefore, Jerry has 13 red chickens.
"Response:  Gary spends 4.5 hours walking around the park.

Answer: 4.5 hours

Explanation: To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to divide the distance he covers (the perimeter of the park) by his speed (3 miles/hour). The formula for this is: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is the perimeter of the park, which is 9 miles (1.5 x 6), and the speed is 3 miles/hour. So, Time = 9 miles / 3 miles/hour = 4.5 hours."
Response:  To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can use the information given in the problem. On the first day, there were 100 customers, and on the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so there were 150 customers (100 + 50) on the second day. On the third day, there were 50 more customers than the second day, so there were 200 customers (150 + 50) on the third day. Therefore, Sloane counted 200 customers on the third day.
"Response: 20 gallons
Explanation: Let's call the amount of water in the small pool x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the big pool is 2x = 80 gallons. Now, since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the small pool is 1/4 of 80 gallons or 20 gallons. Therefore, the answer is 20 gallons."

"Response:  $1375

Answer: $1375

Explanation:
Janeth borrowed $2000, so her total debt is $2000. She promised to return the loan with an additional 10%, which means she has to pay back $2200 ($2000 x 1.10).
Since she is going to pay $165 per month for 12 months, her monthly payment will be $165 x 12 = $2040.
By the end of the 12th month, Janeth will have paid back $2040, leaving her with a remaining balance of $220 - $2040 = -$1840.
Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months is $1840."

"Response:  The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be:  
Age of Adrian = 3 x (Harriet's age + 21) = 3 x 24 = 72 
Age of Harriet = 21 / 2 = 10.5 
Age of Zack = 21 - (Harriet's age + 21) = 21 - 10.5 = 10.5 
Average age of the three in three years = (Adrian's age + Harriet's age + Zack's age) / 3 = (72 + 10.5 + 10.5) / 3 = 93/3 = 31
Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be 31 years old."

Response:  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula: Total time = Individual time x Number of pieces / Speed. In this case, the individual times are: Kalinda - 4 pieces/minute = 24 minutes/hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) Kalinda's mom - 2 pieces/minute = 12 minutes/hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. So, the total time it will take for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle is: Total time = 24 minutes/hour x 360 pieces / 4 pieces/minute +  12 minutes/hour x 360 pieces / 2 pieces/minute = 72 hours + 18 hours = 90 hours Therefore, it will take Kalinda and her mom approximately 90 hours to complete the 360 piece puzzle.
Response:  Let's use a formula to solve this problem. We know that the total number of watermelons produced was 120. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest, which is 36 (120 x 30%). So, the number of watermelons left to be harvested after two months is 120 - 36 = 84. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, which is 60 (84 x 3/4). Therefore, there were 60 watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks.

"Response: 16 pizzas.
Explanation: To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we must divide the number of friends by the number of slices per pizza. Since there are 20 friends and each pizza has 8 slices, John will need to order 20/8 = 2.5 pizzas. However, since you cannot buy a fraction of a pizza, John will need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 pizzas. Therefore, John needs to order 16 pizzas (3 x 8)."
Response:  To find out how many pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the number of pens he will be able to make using the mixed ink. Since each pen has 0.8 ml of ink, and there are 5 pens providing 4 ml of ink (since 4 x 0.8 = 3.2), we can mix enough ink to fill 7 pens ( since 7 x 0.8 = 5.6). So, if Ram uses these 25 pens to make new pens when the ink runs low, he will end up with 7 + 18 = 25 pens altogether.

Substituting the given values, we get: Number of students through Exit C = (1000 - 300) / 5 - (300 / 3) = 400
Therefore, 400 students went out through exit C."
Response:  Let J be the number of candies that John has and R be the number of candies that Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can write: J = 2R. We also know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can write: J - R = 6. Substituting J = 2R into this equation, we get: 2R - R = 6. Simplifying, we get: R = 30. So John has 30 + 6 = 36 more candies than James.

Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in Aquarium A is x. Since there are 4 snails in Aquarium A, we can say that the total number of living organisms (fish + snails) in Aquarium A is 4x. Similarly, since there are 32 snails in Aquarium B, we can say that the total number of living organisms (fish + snails) in Aquarium B is 32(x/2). Now, according to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can write: 4x - 32 = 2(x/2). Solving for x, we get x = 16. Therefore, there are 16 fish in Aquarium A and 16 x 2 = 32 fish in Aquarium B.

Answer: The chef spent a total of $600.

Explanation:
To find out how much the chef spent, we need to multiply the number of bags of onions by the weight of each bag and then multiply that result by the price per pound of onions.

Number of bags = 4
Weight of each bag = 50 pounds
Price per pound = $1.50

So, the total amount the chef spent is:
$4 x 50 = $200
$200 x $1.50 = $300

Therefore, the chef spent a total of $600."
Response:  Let x be the number of cookies eaten by Sue's sister on Monday. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4x cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2(4x) = 8x cookies on Tuesday. The total number of cookies eaten by both girls is given by x + 8x = 13. Solving for x, we get x = 7. Therefore, Sue consumed 4x = 28 more calories than her sister.
