"Response:  First, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on renovations. So, the total amount he invested in the house is:  
$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (renovation cost) = $130,000  Next, we are told that the value of the house increased by 150% after the renovations. This means that the new value of the house is:  
New value = Old value x 1.5 = $130,000 x 1.5 = $195,000  Now, we can calculate the profit as follows:  
Profit = New value - Old value = $195,000 - $80,000 = $115,000  Therefore, Josh made a profit of $115,000 from his investment in the house."
"Response:  First, we know that James runs three times a week, so he runs for 3 x 7 = 21 days in a week.  Next, we know that he runs 60 meters each time, so his total distance run per week is:  
21 days x 60 meters/day = 1260 meters/week  Therefore, James runs 1260 meters per week."
"Response:  First, we know that Wendy gives her pigs three separate meals per day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We also know that she gives each pig 15 cups of food in the morning and 25 cups of food in the afternoon. So, if we add up all these amounts, we get:  
3 meals/day x 15 cups/meal (morning) + 25 cups/meal (afternoon) = 45 cups/pig/day  
Now, let's find out how many cups of food Wendy needs to give to her 20 pigs for their last meal of the day. To do this, we can simply multiply the total number of cups per pig per day by the number of pigs:  
45 cups/pig/day x 20 pigs = 900 cups  
So, Wendy needs to give her 20 pigs 900 cups of food for their last meal of the day."
Response:  First, we know that each cup costs $5, so 16 cups would cost:  16 x $5 = $80  Now, we know that every second cup costs 60% of the regular price, so the remaining 14 cups (since there are 16 in total) will cost:  14 x ($5 x 0.6) = $92  Therefore, the total amount that Kylar needs to pay is:  $80 + $92 = $172
Response:  First, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So if Charleston has x sheep, then Toulouse has 2x sheep.  Next, we know that Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle. So if Seattle has y sheep, then Charleston has 4y sheep.  Now we can set up an equation based on this information:  2x + 4y =?  To find out how many sheep all three cities have together, we need to add the number of sheep they each have.  So our final answer is:  2x + 4y + 20 =?  Can you solve for x and y using the given information?
Response:  We know that Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute and that it takes 20 minutes for Windows to install updates after restarting. Therefore, we need to calculate how long it will take to download the entire file.  First, let's convert the size of the file from gigabytes (GB) to megabytes (MB): 200 GB x 1024 MB/GB = 204800 MB Now, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the total time it takes to download the file, r is the download rate in megabytes per minute (MB/min), and t is the total size of the file in megabytes: d = rt = (204800 MB) / (2 GB/min) = 10240 min or approximately 170 hours or about 6.9 days So, it would take approximately 6.9 days to download the entire 200 GB file if Carla could download at a constant rate of 2 GB per minute without any interruptions or system restarts.
"Response:  John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour, which means he covers a distance of:  
D1 = 3 h x 60 mi/h = 180 miles  
Then, he spends 2 hours stuck in traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time.  Next, he drives for half an hour (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 miles per hour, which means he covers a distance of:  
D2 = 0.5 h x 30 mi/h = 15 miles  
Finally, he drives for another 2 hours at a speed of 80 miles per hour, which means he covers a distance of:  
D3 = 2 h x 80 mi/h = 160 miles  
So, in total, John has driven a distance of:  
Total Distance = D1 + D2 + D3 = 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles  
Therefore, after driving for 4 hours, John is 355 miles away from his home."
Response:  First, we know that Eliza works for 45 hours this week. We also know that she is paid $10 per hour for her first 40 hours of work. So, let's calculate how much she earns from those 40 hours:  40 hours x $10/hour = $400 Now, we need to find out how much she earns for the extra 5 hours (since she worked 45 hours in total). We know that her overtime pay is 1.2 times her normal hourly rate, so let's calculate her overtime pay as follows:  5 hours x ($10/hour x 1.2) = $60 Therefore, Eliza earns a total of $400 + $60 = $460 for the week.
Response:  First month: 60 downloads Second month: three times as many downloads = 180 downloads Third month: 30% decrease from 180 = 126 downloads Total number of downloads for three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads
"Response:  First, we know that Tulа bought 3 dozen ponchik for $68 per dozen, so she spent:  
$68 x 3 = $204 on ponchik. Next, she bought 2 dozen mini cheesecakes for $80 per dozen, so she spent:  
$80 x 2 = $160 on mini cheesecakes. Finally, she bought 6 dozen mini chocolate chip cookies for $55 per dozen, so she spent:  
$55 x 6 = $330 on mini chocolate chip cookies. In total, Tulа spent:  
$204 + $160 + $330 = $794."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Carlos will spend on the lemon tree each year.  The cost of the tree is $90, and he needs to add $3 per year for irrigation and fertilization, so his total annual expense will be:  $90 + $3 = $93 per year. Next, we need to calculate how many lemons the tree will produce each year. According to the problem, the tree will produce 7 lemons per year, so Carlos will have 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon = $10.50 in revenue per year. Now, let's calculate when Carlos will start making a profit from the tree. To do this, we need to subtract his annual expenses ($93) from his annual revenue ($10.50), which gives us: Profit = Revenue - Expenses = $10.50 - $93 = -$82.50 loss per year. Since Carlos wants to make a profit, it means that he won't start making a profit until his profits exceed his losses. In other words, he won't start making a profit until the negative number becomes positive. So, we need to find out how many years it will take for the negative profit to become positive. To do this, we can divide the loss per year (-$82.50) by the profit per year ($10.50): Number of years to break even = Loss per year / Profit per year = -$82.50 / $10.50 = 8 years It takes 8 years for Carlos to start making a profit from the lemon tree.
Response: 1. Melanie started with x praxosmukachki in total. 2. She sold one-third of her stock to the green house, so she has (x / 3) left for sale. 3. She sold two more to the red house, so she has (x / 3) - 2 left for sale. 4. She sold half of what was left to the orange house, so she has (x / 3) - 2 / 2 = (x / 3) - 1 left for sale. 5. Since Melanie has 5 praxosmukachki left, we can set up the equation: (x / 3) - 1 = 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 15. So Melanie had 15 praxosmukachki at the beginning.
"Response:  We know that there are 20 students in total and 20% of them (4) are enrolled in contemporary dance.  That means there are 16 remaining students (20 - 4 = 16). Of those 16, 25% (4) are enrolled in jazz dance. So how many students are left for hip hop dance?  
We can set up an equation to represent this information:  
Let X be the number of students enrolled in hip hop dance. Then we know:  
X + 4 + 4 = 16 (since 4 are enrolled in contemporary dance, and 4 are enrolled in jazz dance)  
Simplifying the equation:  
3X + 8 = 16  
Solving for X:  
3X = 16 - 8  
3X = 8  
Dividing both sides by 3:  
X = 8/3  
X = 2  
Therefore, 2 students out of 20 (or 10%) are enrolled in hip hop dance."

Response:  First day: Both trains travel west for 80 miles (130 km). Second day: They both travel north for 240 km. Total distance traveled by each train = Distance traveled on first day + Distance traveled on second day. For the first train: Total distance = 80 mi + 0 mi = 80 mi. For the second train: Total distance = 0 mi + 240 km = 240 km. So, the distance traveled by each train is 80 miles (130 km) and 240 kilometers (150 miles), respectively.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Jill earns per week as a teacher and as a coach.  As a teacher, she works 35 hours per week and is paid $20 per hour, so her weekly income is:  
$20/hour x 35 hours/week = $700/week  As a coach, she works 15 hours per week and is paid $30 per hour, so her weekly income is:  
$30/hour x 15 hours/week = $450/week Total weekly income = $700 + $450 = $1,150 per week Now, let's calculate Jill's annual income. She works for 50 weeks in a year (assuming two weeks of vacation), so her annual income would be:  
$1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year"
Response:  If Клеър makes 3 omelets per day and each omelet requires 2 eggs, then she uses 6 eggs per day (3 x 2 = 6). Since there are 7 days in a week, Клеър uses a total of 6 x 7 = 42 eggs per week. To find out how many eggs she will use in 4 weeks, we can multiply 42 by 4: 42 x 4 = 168 eggs. So, Клеър will use 168 eggs in 4 weeks.
Response:  Marisa has already walked for 4 miles in the first hour, so she has 8 miles left to walk. Since she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 4/8 = 0.5 miles per hour. Therefore, Marisa needs to walk the last 8 miles at a speed of 0.5 miles per hour.
Response:  We have 24 liters of pineapple juice that is 3/4 water and we add 10 liters of portokalov juice which is 2/3 water. So, first, let's calculate how much water is in the pineapple juice: 3/4 x 24 = 18 liters Now, let's subtract the amount of water spilled (1 liter) from the total amount of water in both juices: 18 - 1 = 17 liters Therefore, there are 17 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of pineapple juice after adding the portokalov juice and accounting for the spillage.

"Response:  We know that the first three clients bought one DVD each, so we can write:  
1 + 1 + 1 = 3 DVDs sold to the first three clients.  The next two clients bought two DVDs each, so we can write:  
2 + 2 = 4 DVDs sold to the next two clients.  Finally, the last three clients did not buy any DVDs, so we can write:  
0 + 0 + 0 = 0 DVDs sold to the last three clients.  Now let's add up all the DVDs sold:  
3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs sold in total.  So Billy sold seven DVDs on Tuesday."
Response:  We know that the candle burns at a rate of 2 cm per hour. So if we want to find out how long it will take for the candle to burn from 13:00 to 17:00 (4 hours), we need to calculate how much it will burn during each hour and then add up all those amounts.  First, let's convert the time from hours to centimeters: 1 hour = 2 cm (since the candle burns at a rate of 2 cm/hour)  Therefore, 4 hours = 4 x 2 cm = 8 cm  Now we can calculate how much the candle will burn during each hour: 13:00 - 14:00 = 1 hour (8 cm) 14:00 - 15:00 = 1 hour (8 cm) 15:00 - 16:00 = 1 hour (8 cm) 16:00 - 17:00 = 1 hour (8 cm)  Total amount of burning = 8 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm = 32 cm  Finally, we can calculate how short the candle will be after burning for 4 hours: Original length of the candle = 30 cm (given in the problem) Total amount of burning = 32 cm (calculated above) New length of the candle = original length - total amount of burning = 30 cm - 32 cm = 2 cm  The candle will be 2 cm shorter after burning for 4 hours.
Response:  First, we know that Kale bought the book at a discount of 25%. This means that if the original price was x dollars, then the discounted price would be:  x - (25% of x) = x - (x/4) = 3x/4  Since Kale paid $19.50 for the book, we can set up an equation to represent this information:  3x/4 = 19.50  Now solve for x:  x = 4 x 19.50 = 78  So the original price of the book was $78.
Response:  First, we know that the total cost of all items is $50.  We also know that the price per unit of each item is as follows:  milk ($3), apples ($1.50), and pizza ($8.50).  So, to calculate how many units of each item were purchased, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem.  Here's one way to do it:  Milk:  Total cost of milk = Number of cups x Price per cup  Apples:  Total cost of apples = Number of apples x Price per apple  Pizza:  Total cost of pizza = Number of boxes x Price per box  Now, let's substitute the values we know into these equations.  For milk:  Total cost of milk = (Number of cups) x $3  For apples:  Total cost of apples = (Number of apples) x $1.50  For pizza:  Total cost of pizza = (Number of boxes) x $8.50  Since the total cost of all items is $50, we can set up a system of linear equations using these three equations:  $3x + $1.50y + $8.50z = 50  where x represents the number of cups of milk, y represents the number of apples, and z represents the number of boxes of pizza.  To solve for x, y, and z, we can use substitution or elimination methods.  Let's use substitution method.  Solving the first equation for x, we get:  x = $\frac{Total\ cost\ of\ milk}{Price\ per\ cup}$  x = $\frac{50}{3}$  x = 16 7/9  Now, substituting this value of x into the second equation, we get:  $1.50y + $8.50z = 50  Substituting x = 16 7/9, we get:  $1.50y + $8.50z = 50  $1.50(y) + $8.50(z) = 50  y = $\frac{50 - 1.50z}{
Response:  First, we know that Mishka bought three sets of shorts, so she spent 3 x $16.50 = $49.50 on shorts. Next, she bought three sets of pants, so she spent 3 x $22.50 = $67.50 on pants. Finally, she bought three sets of shoes, so she spent 3 x $42 = $126 on shoes. In total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243. Total cost for all clothes is $243.

Response:  We know that Henry made two stops during his 60-mile journey with his bicycle. The first stop was after 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find out how many miles were between the two stops, we need to subtract the distance from the first stop from the total distance traveled. So, if Henry traveled for 20 miles before making his first stop, he had already covered 20/60 = 1/3 of the total distance. Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, there are 60 - 15 = 45 miles left to cover until the end of the trip. Now, let's calculate the distance between the two stops:  Distance between first and second stops = Total distance traveled - Distance covered before first stop = 60 miles - (1/3) x 60 miles = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles Therefore, Henry traveled 40 miles between his first and second stops.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one pair of boots is $33 and the price of two pairs of shoes with high heels together is $5 less than the price of the boots. So, we can write an equation based on this information:  Price of boots = $33 (1) Price of two pairs of shoes with high heels = $33 x 2 = $66 (2) Since the total cost of both options should be equal to each other, we can set up another equation: $66 + $33 = $99 (3) Now, let's solve for the variable in equation (3): $99 - $66 = $33 (4) Therefore, the price of the boots is $33.
Response:  First, we know that Darrel is 7 years older than Alan. So if Alan is x years old now, Darrel is x + 7 years old. Now, we are given that their total age is 162 years. So we can set up an equation based on this information: x + (x + 7) = 162...
Response:  First, we know that Günter is trying to count the eggs in a basket (burkan). One of his friends says there are 80 eggs. Another friend says there are 20 more than half of the first number, which means there are 20 + (half of 80) = 20 + 40 = 60 eggs. The third friend says there are 25% more than the first number, which means there are 80 + (25/100 x 80) = 80 + 20 = 100 eggs. So, the median estimate is 90 eggs.
Response:  John has 10 dogs and each dog spends half an hour per day for exercise and work. So, if we multiply 10 (dogs) x 0.5 (hours/dog/day), we get: Total time spent on caring for dogs = 10 x 0.5 = 5 hours/day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of hours that John spends on taking care of his dogs per week is: Total time spent on caring for dogs per week = 5 hours/day x 7 days/week = 35 hours/week.
"Response:  We know that Grech has 110 coins in total and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let G be the number of gold coins, then we can write an equation based on the information given:  
G + 30 = S + 110... (1) where S is the number of silver coins. Now, we can solve for G using equation (1): G = S + 110 - 30 G = S + 80... (2) Since we know that Grech has 110 coins in total, we can set up the following equation: S + G = 110... (3) Substituting equation (2) into equation (3), we get: S + (S + 80) = 110... (4) Combine like terms: 2S + 80 = 110... (5) Subtract 80 from both sides: 2S = 30... (6) Divide both sides by 2: S = 15... (7) Now that we have found the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins: G = S + 80 = 15 + 80 = 95... (8) Therefore, Grech has 95 gold coins."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Aaron has half of Raymond's beads plus five more. So, if Raymond has 40 beads, Aaron will have:  Half of 40 = 20 + 5 = 25 beads. Now, let's find out how many beads Sheiban has. We know that Sheiban has two fewer than Aaron. Therefore, Sheiban has: 25 - 2 = 23 beads.
Response:  In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. So in those 20 minutes, he scored at a rate of 4 points per 20 minutes, or 1 point every 5 minutes.  Now, in the next 20 minutes, if he scores 25% more points than before, that means he will score 1 + (25/100) = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25 points every 5 minutes.  Since there are 40 minutes in total, Mike will score:  40 x 1.25 = 50 points in total.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Teri spends per day on kefir. We know that she consumes 2 kefirs per day and each costs $5.00. So, her daily expense is:  
$5 x 2 = $10 per day  Now, let's calculate her total expenditure for 30 days:  
$10 x 30 = $300  Therefore, Teri will spend $300 on kefir for 30 days."
"Response:  First, we know that John sold all his toys for $15 each, so he made a total of:  13 x $15 = $195  Second, we know that he spent $20 on each video game, so he spent a total of:  8 x $20 = $160  Finally, we know that he has $5 left over, so we can add this to the previous amounts to find out how much money he has in total:  $195 + $160 + $5 = $355  So, John still has $355 left after buying the video games.  To find out how many Lego sets he has left, we need to subtract the number of sets he sold from the total number of sets he had:  Total number of Lego sets = Number of sets sold + Number of sets left  We know that he sold 13 sets, so we can substitute this into the equation above:  Total number of Lego sets = 13 + Number of sets left  Now solve for ""Number of sets left"" to find out how many Lego sets John has left:  Total number of Lego sets = 13 + Number of sets left  Number of sets left = Total number of Lego sets - 13  Number of sets left = $355 / $15 per set  Number of sets left = 23  Therefore, John has 23 Lego sets left."
"Response:  Firstly, we know that John runs for 3 hours on the first day of the week and for less time on the other two days. So, let's call the total distance he runs in one week as follows: Day 1: 3 hours x (speed per hour) = distance covered on Day 1 Day 2 and 3: (speed per hour) x (less time than Day 1) = distance covered on Days 2 and 3 Total distance covered in one week = distance covered on Day 1 + distance covered on Days 2 and 3 We also know that John covers 100 km in one week. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information: Total distance covered in one week = 100 km Now, we need to find out the speed at which John runs. To do this, we will use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Where ""Distance"" is the total distance covered in one week, and ""Time"" is the time taken to cover that distance. In our case, the distance is given as 100 km, and the time is the sum of the times taken to cover the distance on each of the three days. So, we can write: Speed = 100 km / (3 hours + (less time on Days 2 and 3)) Since we don't know the exact time taken on Days 2 and 3, we will assume that the time is half of the time taken on Day 1, i.e., 1.5 hours. Then, we can calculate the speed as follows: Speed = 100 km / (3 hours + 1.5 hours) = 100 km / 4.5 hours = 22.22 km/hour Therefore, John runs at a speed of approximately 22.22 km/hour."
Response:  Dan can run at a speed of x miles per hour and walk at a speed of y miles per hour, where x > y. Since he spends one third of his time running and two thirds walking, we know that his total distance traveled is equal to the sum of his running distance and his walking distance.  We are given that Dan can jump with a speed of z miles per hour, where z is half of his running speed (x/2).  So, if he jumps for t hours, his distance traveled will be:  Distance = Speed x Time = z x t  Now, let's find out how far Dan can travel in 6 hours.  He spends 1/3 of his time running and 2/3 of his time walking, so he runs for 2/9 of his total time and walks for 7/9 of his total time.  If he runs for t hours, he will cover a distance of:  Distance = x x t / 3  And if he walks for t hours, he will cover a distance of:  Distance = y x t / 2  Since Dan has to cover a total distance of 3 miles in 6 hours, we can set up the following equation:  x x t / 3 + y x t / 2 = 3  Now solve for t.  We get:  t = 3(x+y)/(2x)  Plugging in values, we get:  t = 3(50+75)/(2\*50) = 3(125)/100 = 4  So, Dan can travel 4 miles in 6 hours.
Response:  First, we know that Brandan's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. So if Ben's iPhone is two years old, then Brandan's iPhone is eight years old (2 x 4 = 8).  Next, we know that Suzi's iPhone is one year old. So if Brandan's iPhone is eight years old, then it is seven years older than Suzi's iPhone (8 - 1 = 7).  Therefore, Brandan's iPhone is seven years old.
Response:  First, we know that Polly can throw the golden spear three times farther when she holds the sapphire than when she doesn't hold it. So if she throws the spear from a distance of 400 feet (the distance at which she can hit the dragon), without holding the sapphire, she will hit the dragon at a point 1200 feet away (3 x 400).  Now let's consider the distance at which Polly must stand in order to hit the dragon with the spear while avoiding the flames. Since the dragon is breathing fire up to 1000 feet away, and the flames are 500 feet wide, Polly needs to be at least 500 feet away from the dragon to avoid getting burned. Therefore, she must stand at a distance of at least 900 feet from the dragon (500 + 400) to hit him with the spear.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Babba Jounes baked five apple pies for the firefighters. She cut each pie into eight pieces and placed five of them on the serving dish for her guests. At the end of the evening, after all the guests had taken and eaten their share of the pie, there were 14 remaining pieces. So, if we let X be the number of pieces taken by the guests, we can set up the following equation: 5 (8) = X + 14  Now, we need to solve this equation. We know that 5 times 8 is equal to 40. Therefore, we can write:  40 = X + 14  Subtracting 14 from both sides gives us:  26 = X  Finally, we have our answer! The guests took 26 pieces of pie in total.
"Response:  We know that each portion of chips has 250 calories and there are 5 portions in the 300g bag. So, the total number of calories in the bag is:  
Calories per bag = Number of portions x Calories per portion  
= 5 x 250  
= 1250 calories  Since you have already consumed 1800 calories today, we need to subtract the number of calories you have eaten from the total number of calories in the bag:  
Number of calories left in the bag = Total calories - Calories consumed  
= 1250 - 1800  
= -550 calories This means that if you eat the entire 300g bag of chips, you will consume an additional 550 calories beyond your daily goal of 2000 calories. Therefore, the correct answer is:  
You can safely eat 300 grams of chips if you want to stay within your daily calorie limit."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Charlie will make if he sells all 20 candles at $2 each.  Total revenue = 20 x $2 = $40  Next, let's subtract the cost of the materials: Cost of materials = 1 kg beeswax + 10 cones (at $1 per cone) = $10 + $10 = $20 So, Charlie's profit is: Profit = Revenue - Cost of materials = $40 - $20 = $20 Now, let's check our calculation: We know that Charlie sold 20 candles at $2 each, so the total amount of money he made is: Total amount = 20 x $2 = $40 And we just calculated that his profit is $20, which confirms our answer.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Meredith spent writing articles each day of the week. Then, we can add up these daily totals to find her total time spent writing for the week.  Monday: 5 articles x 4 hours per article = 20 hours Tuesday: 7 articles x 4 hours per article = 28 hours Wednesday: 14 articles x 4 hours per article = 56 hours Total time spent writing for the week: 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours So, Meredith spent 104 hours writing articles during that week.
"Response:  Firstly, Candice had 23 sticky notes in her bag before she went to work at the café. Secondly, she bought a pack of sticky notes with 80 pieces. Thirdly, she placed one sticky note on each of the 220 different cups of coffee. Therefore, we can calculate how many sticky notes were in the pack that Candice bought:  
23 (initial sticky notes) + 80 (pack size) = 103 sticky notes."
Response:  First, we know that John bought twice as many red ribbons as blue ones. So if he bought x blue ribbons, he bought 2x red ribbons.  Second, we know that the price of each red ribbon is 50% more than the price of each blue ribbon. So the price of one red ribbon is $1.50 (50% increase over $4).  Third, we know that John spent $200 in total for all the ribbons.  Now we can set up an equation to represent this information:  Let x be the number of blue ribbons and y be the number of red ribbons. Since John bought twice as many red ribbons as blue ribbons, we have: 2x + y = 200... 3...  We also know that the price of each red ribbon is 50% more than the price of each blue ribbon, so we have: y = 1.5x  Substituting y = 1.5x into the first equation, we get: 2x + 1.5x = 200  Combine like terms:  3.5x = 200  Divide both sides by 3.5:  x = 60  So John bought 60 blue ribbons and 2 times 60 = 120 red ribbons.  Finally, we can calculate how much John paid for all the ribbons:  Total cost = 60 x 40 + 120 x 1.50  Simplify:  Total cost = 2400 + 1800  Total cost = 4200  Therefore, John paid $4200 for all the ribbons.
Response:  We know that Tracy has a piece of string with a length of 4 feet (ft). She wants to use it to tie up her home-grown plants in the garden. The provocation was cut into pieces with a length of 15 cm. So we need to find out how many pieces she received. First, let's convert the length from feet to centimeters: 4 ft = 4 x 30 cm/ft = 120 cm Now we can divide the total length by the length of each piece to get the number of pieces: 120 cm / 15 cm/piece = 8 pieces Tracy received 8 pieces of string.
"Response:  We know that there are 15 floors in the building and each floor has 8 units. This means that the total number of units in the building is:  
15 x 8 = 120 units Now we need to find out how many of these units are free. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, so we can calculate the number of occupied units as follows:  
3/4 x 120 = 90 units So, the number of free apartments in the building is:  
120 - 90 = 30 units"
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many dozen eggs Loyd sells in one week (7 days x 24 hours/day = 168 hours/week). Then, we can multiply that number by the price per dozen to find out how much he earns from eggs in one week:  
168 hours/week x 2 dozen/hour x $2/dozen = $336/week  
So, Loyd earns $336 per week from his egg business."
"Response:  First, we know that Tom's ship can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour. We also know that it departs between 1 and 4 hours (inclusive). So, if we let T be the time at which the ship departs, we have:  
T = 1 + 2 + 3 +... + 4 = 25 hours (since there are 25 possible departure times) Now, we know that the ship returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour. So, we can use the formula for distance traveled to find the time it takes for the ship to return: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 6 miles/hour x Time Since we know that the total distance traveled is 25 miles (the distance from the starting point to the ending point, plus the distance back), we can set up the equation: 25 = 6x Time To solve for time, we can divide both sides by 6: Time = 25 / 6 Time = 4.17 hours (approximately) Therefore, it will take approximately 4.17 hours for Tom's ship to return after departing between 1 and 4 hours."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Chantata needs to lose 5 kilograms in total. Secondly, each comic book weighs 1 kilogram, and each toy weighs 1 kilogram as well. Finally, we are given that Chantata has 30 comic books. So, if we subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to lose, we will get the amount of toys he needs to remove. Here is the calculation: Total weight to be lost = 5 kg Comic books (each weighing 1 kg) = 30 x 1 kg = 30 kg Toys (each weighing 1 kg) = 30 kg - 30 kg = 0 kg Therefore, Chantata needs to remove 0 toys to achieve his goal of losing 5 kilograms.
"Response:  First, we know that for each tire repair on a truck, the mechanic earns $60. For each car tire repair, he earns $40. On Thursday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so his total income from Thursday is:  
6 x $60 = $360 + 4 x $40 = $160 = $520  Now let's look at Friday. He repaired 12 cars, but not any tires, so his income from Friday is zero. Therefore, the mechanic earned a total of $520 on Thursday."
Response:  First, we know that Patchi had three times as many kittens as Duffy and her sisters have now (7). So, if Patchi had three times 7 = 21 kittens. Secondly, we are told that Trixie had 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens born to both cats is 21 + 12 = 33 kittens. Finally, since two of these kittens were already adopted by the local animal shelter, there would be 33 - 2 = 31 kittens left in the family.
Response:  First, Dijin has 30 ledenci and eats two of them. That means he has 30 - 2 = 28 ledenci left. Now, he wants to pack 2 ledenci in one bag. So, he can make 28 / 2 = 14 bags.
Response:  First, we know that Peter has $42 for the week and he always spends $7 for a ticket and $7 for popcorn. So, if he wants to go to the movies multiple times, how many times can he go based on his budget?  We can start by subtracting the cost of one movie from his total amount of money: $42 - $7 = $35. Now, we have $35 left after buying one ticket and popcorn. Can he go again? Yes, he can! He has enough money to buy another ticket and popcorn: $35 - $7 = $28. So, he can go to the movies twice. But wait, there's more! After two trips to the movies, he still has some money left over: $28 - $7 = $21. That means he can go again! And again! In fact, he can go four more times: $21 - $7 = $14, $14 - $7 = $7, $7 - $7 = $0. Wow, that's five trips to the movies! So, the answer is 5. Peter can go to the movies 5 times with his $42 for the week.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total weight of all the cups: 5 kg x 12 cups = 60 kg.  Next, we add the weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 lb + 60 kg = 3815 kg.  Now, let's check if this weight is less than or equal to the maximum capacity of the bridge: 3815 kg <= 5000 lb (bridge capacity).  Since 3815 kg is less than 5000 lb, it means that up to 12 cups can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's capacity.
Response:  First we know that the total cost of food was $40.00 and then there is an additional 25% tax which would be:  $40 x 0.25 = $10 So now the new total with taxes would be: $40 + $10 = $50 Next, STEVEN added a tip of $4.00 so the final total would be: $50 + $4 = $54
"Response:  First, we know that each cluster has 20 fruits and there are 6 clusters in total. So, the number of fruits in all clusters is:  
6 x 20 = 120  Now, we know that there are also 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the bush. To find out how many more fruits there are beyond the clusters, let's add 67 to 120:  
120 + 67 = 187  Therefore, there are 187 malini (fruits) in total."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 portocals in total and 1 is bad. So, the number of good portocals is 25 - 1 = 24.  Secondly, we know that 20% of the portocals are not ripe, which means 20/100 x 24 = 4.8 portocals are not ripe. Therefore, the number of good portocals after removing the not-ripe ones is 24 - 4.8 = 19.2. Finally, we know that 2 portocals are sour, so we need to subtract them from the previous result. Thus, the final answer is 19.2 - 2 = 17.2.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Janet paid for the materials and construction of the brooch. We know that she paid $500 for the materials and $800 for the bi...
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount of Marcy's pension over her 40 years of service. We know that she receives an annual pension of $50,000 and has been working for 40 years, so the total amount of her pension is: Total Pension = $50,000 x 40 years = $2,000,000 Next, we know that after 20 years, Marcy will receive 5% of the total pension each year, so we need to calculate what that amount would be. 5% of $2,000,000 is: 5% of $2,000,000 = $100,000 So, after 20 years, Marcy will receive an additional $100,000 per year, bringing her total annual pension to: New Annual Pension = $50,000 + $100,000 = $150,000 Now, let's consider how much Marcy will receive if she retires after 30 years. She will have received $100,000 per year for 10 years (from years 20-30), so the total amount she will have received in addition to her original pension is: Additional Amount = $100,000 x 10 years = $1,000,000 Her new annual pension, including both the original pension and the additional amount, will be: New Annual Pension = $150,000 + $1,000,000 = $1,150,000 Therefore, if Marcy retires after 30 years, her annual pension will be $1,150,000.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount paid for the first half of the year: 140 x 6 = 840. Next, we need to calculate the discount for the second half of the year (10% of 840): 840 x 0.1 = 84. Now, we add the total amount paid for the first half of the year and the discount for the second half of the year: 840 + 84 = 924. Therefore, Alina has paid a total of $924 for her streaming service over the course of the year.
Response:  First, we know that Sofia has already driven 160 km since her last fill-up and she needs to add 4 gallons of gasoline to refill her tank. This means she has used 160 - 4 = 156 kg of gasoline so far. Since her tank can hold 12 gal, we know that she still has 12 - 156 = 9 gal left in her tank. Now, we want to find out how many miles she can drive with the remaining 9 gal of gasoline. We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled (in miles), r is the rate at which she is traveling (in mi/gal), and t is the amount of fuel left in her tank (in gal). In this case, r = 12 / 9 = 1.33 mi/gal, because she can travel 12 miles for every 9 gallons of gasoline she burns. Therefore, d = rt = 1.33 x 9 = 11.97 miles. So, Sofia can drive approximately 11.97 miles with one reserve of gasoline.
Response:  First, we know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each day. So, in one week, he spends 2 x 7 = 14 hours watching TV. Next, we know that after watching TV, he reads for half of the remaining time. So, if he watches TV for 14 hours, he spends 14/2 = 7 hours reading. Therefore, over the course of 4 weeks (or 4 se
Response:  There are four schools participating in the tournament.  Each school sends one team of five players (20 players total) and one coach for each team (four coaches). Therefore, there will be a total of 4 x 20 = 80 participants from all schools.
Response:  First, we know that there were 175 diamonds.  Next, we know that there were 35 rubies, which is less than half of the number of diamonds (since there are twice as many sapphires as rubies). Finally, we know that there were two times more sapphires than rubies, so there were 2 x 35 = 70 sapphires. Therefore, the total number of precious stones in the chest was: 175 + 70 = 245.
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls in school and each class has 5 students. So, if we divide 60 by 5, we get: 60 / 5 = 12 classes. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there must be twice as many boys as well. Therefore, there will be 2 x 12 = 24 classes for boys. In total, there will be 12 + 24 = 36 teachers.
"Response:  First, we know that Baily started with some amount of money x. Then she received a weekly addition of $5 for 8 weeks, so she got:  
x + (5 x 8) = x + 40  
Now we know that at the end of the eight weeks, Bailey had a total of $100, so we can set up an equation:  
x + 40 = 100  
Solving for x, we get:  
x = 60  
So, Bailey started with $60."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Judy teaches per week.  She teaches for 5 hours each day from Monday to Friday, so she teaches for a total of 5 x 5 = 25 hours per week.  In addition, she teaches for 8 hours on Saturday, so her total teaching time per week is 25 + 8 = 33 hours.  Next, let's calculate how much money Judy earns per hour.  If she charges $15 per student and has 15 students in each class, then she earns $15 x 15 = $225 per class.  Since she teaches 4 classes per day (Monday to Friday), she earns $225 x 4 = $900 per day.  Therefore, her daily income is $900.  Now, let's calculate her weekly income.  She works 7 days per week, so her weekly income is $900 x 7 = $6,300.  Finally, let's calculate her monthly income.  There are 4 weeks in a month, so her monthly income is $6,300 x 4 = $25,200.  So, Judy earns $25,200 per month.
Response:  If the first recipe has 20 instructions and the second recipe has twice as many instructions, then the second recipe has 2 x 20 = 40 instructions.  To prepare both dishes, we need to add the number of instructions for each recipe: 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.  Therefore, Kelian needs to read 60 instructions to prepare both dishes.
Response:  First, we know that Tomi sells biscuits for $3 per pack and cheesecake for $4 per piece. So if he sells x packets of biscuits and y pieces of cheesecake, his total revenue will be: Revenue = 3x + 4y Now we are given that Tomi sold 43 brownies and 23 pieces of cheesecake. So we can substitute these values into our equation to find out how much money Tomi made in total: Revenue = 3(43) + 4(23) Revenue = 139 + 92 Revenue = 231 dollars Therefore, Tomi made $231.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total amount that Shilpa will pay for all five phones: Total = $150 x 5 = $750 Next, we need to calculate the monthly interest rate as a decimal: 2%/12 = 0.0167 (monthly) Now, let's calculate the monthly payment for each phone: Monthly Payment = Total / (1 - (1 + monthly interest rate)^(-number of months)) Monthly Payment = $750 / (1 - (1 + 0.0167)^(-3)) Monthly Payment = $250 per month So, Shilpa will pay $250 per month for 3 months, or a total of $750.
Response:  First, we know that Artie has 12 gerneta of marigolds, which he sells for $2.74 per gerne. So, he will sell them for: 12 x $2.74 = $33.08  Next, we know that Artie has 9 gerneta of petunias, which he sells for $1.87 per gerne. So, he will sell them for: 9 x $1.87 = $16.83  Finally, we know that Artie has 17 gerneta of begonias, which he sells for $2.12 per gerne. So, he will sell them for: 17 x $2.12 = $35.54  Now, let's add up all the amounts that Artie will receive: $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.54 = $85.45
Response:  First, we know that each level of the sand castle will have half the area of the level below it. So if the top level has an area of 16 square meters, then the second level down will have half that area, or 8 square meters. The third level down will have half the area of the second level, which is 4 square meters. And so on.  Now let's find out what the average area of all the levels is. We can do this by adding up all their areas and dividing by the total number of levels.  Here are the areas of each level:  Level Area  Top (1st) 16 sq m  Middle (2nd) 8 sq m  Bottom (3rd) 4 sq m  Total Area = 16 + 8 + 4 = 38 sq m  There are 3 levels in total, so we divide the total area by 3 to get the average area per level:  Average Area = 38 / 3 = 12.67 sq m  Therefore, the median square meterage of each level of the sand castle is approximately 12.67 square meters.
Response:  First, we know that Cecilia needs to feed her puppy with 1 cup of food for dogs every day during the first 180 days. That means she will need 180 cups of food in total for the first year. Since one bag contains 110 cups, Cecilia will use 1.67 bags (180/110) of food during the first year. After the first year, Cecilia needs to feed her puppy with 2 cups of food for dogs every day, so she will use 365 bags (2 x 365 = 730) of food in total for the entire life of the puppy if she uses one bag per day.

"Response:  We know that two girls drank 1/6 of 24 liters of water, so we can start by finding out how much they drank together:  
2 girls x 1/6 =?  Now, we are told that one boy received 6 liters of water. So, if we subtract what the boys received from the total amount of water, we will find out how much water is left:  
24 - 6 =?  Finally, we need to divide the remaining water among the two girls:  
(24 - 6) / 2 =?  Solution:  First, let's calculate the amount each girl drank:  
2 girls x 1/6 = 2 x 4 = 8 liters  Next, let's subtract the amount the boys received from the total amount of water:  
24 - 6 = 18  Finally, we divide the remaining water equally between the two girls:  
18 / 2 = 9 liters  Therefore, there are 9 liters of water left after the boys received their share."
"Response:  First, Charlie had 10 stickers.  Then he bought 21 more from a store and received 23 as birthday gifts, so in total he has:  
10 + 21 = 31 stickers.  Next, he gave 9 of them to his sister, leaving him with:  
31 - 9 = 22 stickers. Finally, he used 28 of those remaining stickers for decorating a greeting card, leaving him with:  
22 - 28 = 4 stickers left.  So, there are 4 stickers left with Charlie after he decorated the greeting card."
Response:  First, we know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So if Grace weighs x pounds, then Alex weighs x - 2 pounds. Now we can substitute this expression for Alex's weight in the equation:  Grace weighs 125 pounds, so her weight is 125x.  Since both Grace and Alex have the same amount of mass (in kilograms), we can convert their weights to kilograms by dividing by 2.2 (since there are approximately 2.2 pounds in a kilogram).  Therefore, Grace weighs 125x / 2.2 = 56.8 kg, and Alex weighs 56.8 x - 2 = 54.8 kg.
Response:  We know that there are three pink trees and each tree has 25 roses. Each rose has eight thorns. So, we can start by multiplying the number of trees by the number of roses per tree:  3 x 25 = 75 roses  Now, let's multiply the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:  75 x 8 = 600 thorns  Therefore, there are 600 thorns in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the team played 22 matches and won eight times more than they lost. So, if x is the number of matches they lost, then they won 8x + 22. Since they won eight times more than they lost, we can say that their total wins are equal to their losses plus the number of matches they played. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information: 8x + 22 =?  Now let's substitute x with the value of the number of matches they lost. If they lost x matches, then they won 8x + 22 - x = 7x + 22. Simplifying the expression, we get: 7x + 22 =?  The problem states that they specially won eight times more than they lost, so we can say that their win-loss ratio is 8:1. This means that for every one match they lost, they won eight matches. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 7x + 22 = 8(x) \* 8. Substituting x with the value of the number of matches they lost, we get: 7x + 22 = 8x \* 8. Simplifying the expression, we get: 7x + 22 = 64x. Solving for x, we get: x = 9. Therefore, the team lost nine matches.  Now that we have found the number of matches they lost, we can calculate the number of matches they won: 8x + 22 = 8(9) + 22 = 72 + 22 = 94. Therefore, the team won 94 matches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that he has been going on vacation for 11 years (from 23 to 34). Secondly, each year he buys a new shirt as a souvenir, so he has 11 shirts in total. Thirdly, each shirt is made of different fabric from previous ones, so they are all unique. Finally, each shirt has its own patch representing that particular year's vacation. Therefore, the total number of patches is also 11.
Response:  First time alarm rings, it rings four times. Second time, it rings three times longer than the first time, so it rings (4 x 3) = 12 times. Third time, it rings half as long as the second time, so it rings (12 / 2) = 6 times. Therefore, the total number of times the alarms rang is 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.
Response:  First, we know that Silvi has been working for the company for 5 years already, so she has reached her fifth year of service in December of last year. This means that she is eligible for a 10% increase in salary based on her starting salary.  Next, we need to calculate what her starting salary was. We are given that the company pays all employees $600 per month, so Silvi's starting salary would have been: Starting Salary = Monthly Pay x Number of Months Worked in Year Starting Salary = $600 x 12 Starting Salary = $7,200 Now that we have Silvi's starting salary, we can calculate her current salary after five years of service: Current Salary = Starting Salary + (10% of Starting Salary) x Years of Service Current Salary = $7,200 + ($7,200 x 10%) x 5 Current Salary = $7,200 + $720 x 5 Current Salary = $7,200 + $3,600 Current Salary = $10,800 So, Silvi's current salary after five years of service is $10,800 per year. To find out how much she will earn three years from now, we simply add the annual salary increase to her current salary: Future Salary = Current Salary + Annual Salary Increase Future Salary = $10,800 + $1,080 Future Salary = $11,880 Therefore, Silvi's future salary three years from now will be $11,880 per year.
"Response:  We know that the first album of Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald's album. So if Marilyn sold x copies, Harald sold 10x copies.  We also know that the total number of albums sold is 88000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  
Marilyn sales + Harald sales = Total sales 88000  
x + 10x = 88000  
11x = 88000  
x = 8000  
So, Harald sold 8000 copies."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many guests will actually show up, since not all of them might come. So, if 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, then: Number of actual guests = Total number of invited guests x Probability of a guest showing up (which is 3/4 or 0.75) Number of actual guests = 16 x 0.75 = 12 Now, let's calculate the total cost of the party: Total cost = Number of actual guests x Cost per guest Total cost = 12 x $2 = $24 Therefore, Kristina will spend $24 on the party.
Response:  First, we know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of coleslaw (that's how much Ted has planned to bring). Since there are 20 adults, we need to calculate how many pounds of coleslaw each adult will get. We can do this by dividing the total amount of coleslaw by the number of adults: 10 pounds / 20 adults = 0.5 pounds per adult. Now, let's consider the children. We know that half of what an adult eats is what a child will eat. So, if an adult eats 0.5 pounds of coleslaw, a child will eat 0.5 pounds / 2 = 0.25 pounds. There are 5 children, so we need to add up the amount of coleslaw they will eat: 0.25 pounds x 5 children = 1.25 pounds. Finally, we need to add up the total amount of coleslaw needed for all the guests: 0.5 pounds x 20 adults + 1.25 pounds x 5 children = 10 pounds + 1.25 pounds = 11.25 pounds. Therefore, Ted needs to bring 11.25 pounds of coleslaw to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.
Response:  First, we know that Marsha has three times as many pets as Jan. So if Jan has x pets, Marsha has 3x pets.  Next, we know that Cindy has four more pets than Syndee. So if Syndee has y pets, Cindy has y + 4 pets. Now let's add up all the pets: 3x + (y + 4) =?  To solve for x, first combine like terms: 3x + y + 12 =?  Now subtract y from both sides: 3x + 12 =?  Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find x: x = 4.  Therefore, there are four pets in total.
"Response:  We know that Emy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. So we can start with these two statements:  
Emy - Jackson = 5 years  
Corey - Emy = 2 years Now let's add the third statement: James is 10 years old and is one year younger than Corey. So we can write:  
James - Corey = 1 year Using the first two equations, we can solve for Jackson's age:  
Jackson = Emy - 5 + 2 = 7 years old Therefore, Dajason is 7 years old."
Response:  First, we know that Liy can run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds. Second, we are told that Gerald has improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet. So, to find out how fast Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles, we need to calculate 10% of 38 seconds.  Percent increase = (new value - old value) / old value x 100  New value = 38 seconds x 1.10 = 41.8 seconds  So, Gerald can run 400 meters with obstacles in 41.8 seconds.
Response:  We know that there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined. So if we let D be the number of dogs and C be the number of cats, then the number of rabbits is 12 less than D + C.  Since there are two cats for each dog, we can write:  C = 2D  Now we have three equations:  D + C = 60 (total number of dogs and cats)  C = 2D (number of cats)  R = D + C - 12 (number of rabbits)  Can you solve these equations to find out how many domestic pets there are in the quarter?
Response:  We know that there are 200 students in the fifth grade and 2/5 of them are boys. This means that there are 200 x (1 - 2/5) = 200 x 3/5 = 40 girls in the class. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scouts, we can find out how many girls are not in the girl scouts by subtracting 2/3 of 40 from 40: 40 - (2/3 x 40) = 40 - 26 = 14. Therefore, there are 14 girls who are not in the girl scouts.
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours last night and his friend James slept for 2/3 of that amount. So we can start by finding out how many hours James slept.  
2/3 of 9 is equal to... (we divide 9 by 3)...6! That means James slept for 6 hours.  Now let's find out how many more hours Harry slept than James.  
We subtract 6 from 9... (we subtract 6 from 9)...3! That means Harry slept 3 more hours than James.  Therefore, Harry slept for 9 + 3 = 12 hours, while James slept for 6 hours."
Response:  Firstly, we know that when Freda canned tomatoes in sauce, she lost half of their volume. Secondly, each box of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. Finally, the last portion of tomato sauce was 32 ounces. So let's start with the total number of tomatoes used by Freda:  Since each box contains three tomatoes, and Freda used 32 ounces of tomato sauce, she must have used boxes of tomatoes:   Now, since each box contains three tomatoes, Freda used a total of:   Therefore, Freda used 96 tomatoes (3 x 32).
"Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 30 cars on the highway and 5 of them exited before the jam started. So, the number of cars that passed through the bottleneck during the first 15 minutes is:  
30 - 5 = 25 cars.  Now, we are told that after the first 15 minutes, another 20 cars passed through the bottleneck in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of cars that passed through the bottleneck during the entire 30-minute period is:  
25 + 20 = 45 cars."
"Response:  First, we know that Meri has 18 new plants in her garden and she wants to give one plant to each of her 40 friends and family members. So, if we subtract 40 from 18, we get:  
18 - 40 =?  
Yes, you are right! There will be 0 plants left for Meri after giving them away to her friends and family."
Response:  First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened the door. Second, we know that the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend, so they pressed it 5 times (20 x 1/4). Third, we know that the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend, so they pressed it 60 times (5 x 10). Finally, we know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times in total. So, if we add up all these numbers, we get: 20 + 5 + 60 = 85 presses of the doorbell.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Solo has to read in total pages of his books as follows: Science - 4 x 20 = 80 pages Social sciences - 20 pages History - 7 pages Geography - 8 pages Total pages = 80 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 195 pages Now, we are given that Solo reads 15 pages per day, so we need to find out how many days he needs to finish reading all the books. To do this, let's divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: Days = Total pages / Pages per day Days = 195 pages / 15 pages/day Days = 13 days So, Solo needs to spend 13 days to finish reading all his books.
Response:  John drinks water before each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and also before bedtime. So he drinks 3 times per day x 7 days = 21 glasses of water per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that it takes 10 minutes for mug to cover 3 miles of the city. So, if we want to calculate how long it will take for the fog to cover the entire city (which is 42 miles away), we need to divide the distance of the city into smaller parts and find out how much time it would take for each part.  We can start by dividing the distance of the city into four equal parts: 3 + 3 + 7 + 9 = 42 miles. Now, let's calculate the time it would take for each part separately:  For the first 3 miles, it would take 10 minutes as before. For the next 3 miles, it would also take 10 minutes because the speed remains constant. For the next 7 miles, it would take 7 x 10 / 60 = approximately 11.67 minutes (rounded off to the nearest minute). And finally, for the last 9 miles, it would take 9 x 10 / 60 = approximately 15 minutes.  Therefore, the total time it would take for the fog to cover the entire city is: 10 + 10 + 11.67 + 15 = 46.67 minutes or approximately 47 minutes.
Response:  First, we know that the mother has placed one-third of the remaining figures on the board, so there are two-thirds left to be placed.  Now, the daughter has placed one-quarter of the figures on the board, so there are three-quarters left to be placed.  Therefore, there are two-thirds x three-quarters = 4/5 of the figures left to be placed.  So, out of 1000 parts, 400 remain to be placed (1000 x 4/5).
Response:  If Amir eats 3 times more biscuits than his friend, and he eats 5 biscuits, then his friend eats: 5 x 3 = 15 biscuits.  So together they eat: 5 + 15 = 20 biscuits.
Response:  First we need to find the volume of one cube.  We know that each side is 5 inches long, so the area of one face is 5 x 6 = 30 square inches. Since all sides are equal, we can multiply this area by 3 to get the total area of all three faces: 3 x 30 = 90 square inches. Now we just need to multiply this area by the thickness of the walls (1 inch) to get the total volume of one cube: 90 x 1 = 90 cubic inches.  Since there are three cu...
"Response:  We know that Franky watched television for 7 hours in total. On Monday and Tuesday, she watched one hour of her favorite show each evening. On Wednesday, she watched several episodes of a 30-minute show. And on Friday, she watched two one-hour episodes. So let's break it down like this:  Monday + Tuesday = 2 hours (of favorite show)  Wednesday = x hours (of 30-minute show)  Friday = 2 hours (of favorite show) Total hours watched = 2 + x + 2 = 7 Now we need to find out what value of ""x"" makes the equation true. To do this, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution first. Rearranging the equation, we get: 2 + x + 2 = 7 Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us: x + 2 = 5 Adding 2 to both sides gives us: x = 3 Therefore, Franky watched 3 hours of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Response:  Firstly, Henry made twice as many biscuits last year as he did this year. This means that if he made x biscuits last year, then he made 2x biscuits this year.  Secondly, we know that Henry had 110 biscuits in total after baking and discarding 5 of them. Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
2x + 5 = 110  Now solve for x to find out how many biscuits Henry made last year.  Answer:  To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable x. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:  
2x + 5 - 5 = 110 - 5  This simplifies to:  
2x = 105  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:  x = 52  So, Henry made 52 biscuits last year."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much cashback the customer will receive for 10 gallons of gasoline. We know that the company offers $20 cashback per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the cashback would be: Cashback = $20 x 10 = $200 Now, let's subtract the cashback amount from the total cost of the gasoline: Total Cost = $3 x 10 = $30 - $200 = -$170 So, after receiving the cashback, the customer will have negative $170. This means that they will owe money to the gas station instead of getting paid.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many cubic meters of fruit each person has eaten. Marcel had three packages of width and 14 packages of length, so he ate a total of 3 x 14 = 42 cubic meters of fruit. Beatrice had two packages of width and 24 packages of length, so she ate a total of 2 x 24 = 48 cubic meters of fruit. Now, let's divide the total amount of fruit eaten by each person by the number of packages they ate to find out their average consumption per package: For Marcel: 42 / 3 = 14 cubic meters per package For Beatrice: 48 / 2 = 24 cubic meters per package So, on average, Marcel consumed 14 cubic meters of fruit per package, while Beatrice consumed 24 cubic meters of fruit per package.
Response:  We know that the boat took 16 seconds to travel 20 feet (or 600 inches). That means it traveled at a rate of 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this to inches per second as follows: 1.25 x 12 = 15 inches/second. Now we need to find out how much water was in the boat when Julia reached the shore. We know that the boat traveled 20 feet and took 16 seconds to do so. So, if we divide the distance traveled by the time taken, we get: 20 / 16 = 1.25 feet/second 15 inches/second x 20 feet = 300 inches  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we have our final answer: 300 / 12 = 25 feet of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore.
Response:  There are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 classes per day. That means there will be 8 classes in total (4 teachers x 2 classes per teacher). Since the blackboard is cleaned 3 times during each class, the blackboard will be cleaned a total of 8 x 3 = 24 times per day.
Response:  If Ryan plants 2 flowers per day and there are 15 days in total, then he will have planted a total of 2 x 15 = 30 flowers. However, if 5 of them have not yet germinated, then we need to subtract 5 from 30 to find out how many flowers have actually germinated. So, the final answer is:  30 - 5 = 25 flowers have germinated.
Response:  First, we know that Djalal's phone can store 1800 pictures. Secondly, we know that Brittany's phone can store 50 times more pictures than the number of birds on Djalal's picture of penguins in the zoo. So if we find out how many birds are on Djalal's picture of penguins in the zoo, we can calculate how many pictures Brittany's phone can store. Finally, we will divide the total number of pictures that Djalal's phone can store by the number of pictures that Brittany's phone can store to determine how many penguins are visible on Djalal's picture of penguins in the zoo.  To begin with, let's count the number of birds on Djalal's photo of penguins at the zoo. We see five penguins in the image. Therefore, there are five birds in the photograph. Now, we must multiply this number by 50 to obtain the maximum number of images that Brittany's phone may hold. This gives us:  5 x 50 = 250  Since Brittany's phone can hold 250 times as many photos as Djalal's phone, we can estimate how many photos Brittany's phone can take by dividing the number of photos Djalal's phone can take by the number of photos Brittany's phone can take:  1800 / 250 = 7 200  As a result, Brittany's phone can save approximately 7200 images.  Finally, to determine how many penguins are visible on Djalal's picture of penguins in the zoo, we can divide the total number of images that Djalal's phone can store by the number of images that Brittany's phone can store:  1800 / 7200 = 1/4 or 25%  As a result, one-quarter (or 25%) of the penguins visible on Djalal's picture of penguins in the zoo.

Response:  First, we know that Katy has used 120 cups of coffee, sugar, and water in total. We also know that the ratio of coffee to sugar is 7:13. This means that for every 7 cups of coffee, she has used 13 cups of sugar. Now, let's use algebra to solve for x (the number of cups of coffee).  We can write an equation based on the information given:  7x + 13y = 120... where y represents the number of cups of sugar. To find out how many cups of coffee Katy has used, we need to isolate x. We can do this by subtracting 13y from both sides of the equation:  7x + 13y - 13y = 120 - 13y 7x = 120 - 13y Now, we can simplify the left side of the equation:  7x = 107 Simplifying further gives us:  7x = 107 So, Katy has used 7 x 107 = 759 cups of coffee.
Response:  John has three children and he buys two pairs of shoes for each child. So, in total, John buys 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair costs $60, so the total amount John pays is 6 x $60 = $360.
Response:  We know that there were 2 containers with transportation means brought in on the first day and a total of 30 transportation means in the port on the second day. So we can start by finding out how many containers were brought in on the second day. To do this, we divide the total number of transportation means (30) by the number of transportation means in each container (5): 30 / 5 = 6. Therefore, 6 containers were brought in on the second day.
Response:  First, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Laila's four years ago. So if Laila earned x dollars per year, Adrien earned x + (30% of x) = x + 0.3x = 1.3x dollars per year.  Four years later, Adrien's salary has increased by 40%. So his current salary is 1.3x x 1.4 = 1.84x dollars per year.  We also know that Adrien earned $40,000 more than he did four years ago. So his current salary is 1.84x - 40,000 = 1.84x - 40,000.  To find out what Laila's current salary is, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let y be Laila's current salary. Then we have:  Adrien's current salary = 1.84y - 40,000  Since Adrien's current salary is 1.84 times Laila's current salary, we can write: 1.84y - 40,000 = 1.84(Laila's current salary) - 40,000  Simplifying and solving for Laila's current salary gives us: y = 270,000  Therefore, Laila's current salary is $270,000.
Response:  If Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for his drawings and there are 4 weeks in a month, then he uses 8 sheets of paper per month. Since there are 30 sheets of paper per notebook, Miguel uses 30/8 = 375 sheets of paper per month.
Response:  First, we know that Morizet brought 5 apples and 8 portocals.  Second, we know that Kael brought twice as many apples as Morizet and half as many portocals. So, if Morizet brought 5 apples, then Kael brought 10 apples (2 x 5). Additionally, since Kael brought half as many portocals as Morizet, he brought 4 portocals (half of 8). Now, let's add up all the fruits that both Morizet and Kael brought: 5 + 10 + 4 = 19 apples and 8 + 4 = 12 portocals. Therefore, in total, there are 19 + 12 = 31 fruits.
Response:  First, we know that Seidi slept for 8 hours on Monday.  Next, we know that she slept for 2 hours less each of the next two days, so she slept for 6 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Wednesday.  Finally, we know that she slept for 1 hour more than those two days for the rest of the week, so she slept for 5 hours on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Total sleep time for the week = 8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 30 hours.
"Response:  First, we know that Roxy can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers a distance of:  

10 mi/h x 3 h = 30 mi 

Now, we are told that after 3 hours, she runs at a constant speed of 8 km/h. So, if she runs for an additional 4 hours (since the total time is 7 hours), she covers a distance of:  

8 km/h x 4 h = 32 km 

Therefore, the total distance Roxy covers in 7 hours is:  

30 mi + 32 km = 62 km or approximately 39 miles"
Response: 1) There are 60 letters in total that need to be stamped. 2) Jenny has already stamped one-third of them (i.e., 20). 3) The remaining letters are those that have not been stamped yet. 4) Among these unstamped letters, there are 30 that have already been written (i.e., they do not require any stamps). 5) Therefore, the number of letters that were in the cup when Jenny started working is: 60 - 30 = 30.
Response:  We know that Julia had three new plastic spoons in her package and she used three of them to taste the yogurt. So, if we subtract the number of spoons she used from the total number of spoons in the package, we can find out how many spoons were left in the package.  First, let's calculate how many spoons Julia used:  3 (spoons used) = 3 x 5 (number of spoons per pack) = 15   Now, let's subtract the number of spoons Julia used from the total number of spoons in the package:  12 (total spoons) - 15 (spoons used) = 7   Therefore, there were 7 spoons left in the package after Julia used three of them.
Response:  We know that Di...
Response:  First, we know that Amy had 20 more friends than Lily after they moved to a new school. So, if Lily has 50 friends, then Amy would have had 50 + 20 = 70 friends. Therefore, Lily has 50 friends and Amy has 70 friends.
"Response:  We know that one pepper costs $15 and we need to buy 20 of them. So, the total cost of peppers will be:  
20 x $15 = $300  Now, let's find out how much Dylan will spend on potatoes. We know that one potato costs $5 less than one pepper, so the price of one potato is:  
$15 - $5 = $10  And we need to buy 10 of them. So, the total cost of potatoes will be:  
10 x $10 = $100  Finally, let's add up the total cost of all three items:  
Total Cost = $300 + $100 + $4 (the cost of 4 dia) = $404  Therefore, Dylan will spend a total of $404 if each pepper costs $15."
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours each doctor spends with patients per day. We know that there are 500 patients and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. So, the total time spent with patients per day is: Total Time = Number of Patients x Average Time Per Patient Total Time = 500 x 24 min/patient = 12,000 min/day Now, let's convert this to hours: Total Time (hours) = Total Time (minutes) / 60 Total Time (hours) = 12,000 min / 60 = 200 hours/day Next, we can calculate the revenue generated by each doctor per day: Revenue = Number of Patients x Rate per Patient Revenue = 500 x $200/patient = $100,000/day Finally, we can calculate the daily loss of the hospital as follows: Daily Loss = Total Revenue - Total Cost Total Loss = $100,000 - ($200 x 200 hours) Total Loss = $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000/day Therefore, the daily loss of the hospital is $60,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Nisa hired 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her universal village. Secondly, one-third of the elves (20) refused to work after children vomited on them. Thirdly, 10 more elves left their jobs because their children were beaten by other children. Finally, we need to find out how many elves are left. To do this, we subtract the number of elves who left from the total number of elves hired: 60 - (20 + 10) = 60 - 30 = 30. So, there are 30 elves left working for Nisa.
"Response:  We know that Joseph spent $500 in May and $60 less in June. So we can start by finding out how much he spent in June:  
$500 - $60 = $440  
Now we add the amount he spent in both months to find the total amount he spent for both months:  
$440 + $500 = $940  
Therefore, Joseph spent a total of $940 during those two months."
Response:  First, Pam and Fred rode the Ferris wheel twice each, so they used 2 x 2 = 4 tickets for the rides. Then, they both climbed the slide twice, so they used another 2 x 2 = 4 tickets. In total, they used 4 + 4 = 8 tickets.
Response:  On Monday, Walt ran 6 km. So, he ran 6 x more miles on Tuesday than he did on Monday. This means that on Tuesday, Walt ran 6 x 6 = 36 miles. Now we know that Walt ran a total of 36 + 6 = 42 miles from Monday to Wednesday. Therefore, on Wednesday (the day after Tuesday), Walt ran 42 - 6 = 36 miles.
Response:  There are 12 months in a year, so Tom has 12 x 4 = 48 auto rides per year. The cost of each ride is $15, so the total cost for the year is: 48 x $15 = $720.
Response:  First, we know that Brian has 20 video games.  If he lost 5 of them before the comparison, then he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left.  Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobbi has if Brian has 15 video games left.  To do this, we can use the information that Bobbi has 5 fewer video games than Brian.  So, if Brian has 15 video games, Bobbi will have 15 - 5 = 10 video games.  Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response: 1/3 of the remaining unicorns are in Scotland, and 2/3 of the Scottish unicorns are female. So, if we multiply 1/3 by 2/3, we get 2/9 or 0.22. Therefore, there are approximately 22 female unicorns in Scotland.
"Response:  First we need to calculate the cost of each item:  
* 2 x 7.50 = 15.00 (underwear)  
* 2 x 1.50 = 3.00 (chips)  
* 2 x 1.00 = 2.00 (cookies) Total cost = 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00 Now let's add the delivery fee and the tip:  Delivery fee = 20% of 20.00 = 4.00 Tip = 5.00 So the total cost will be: 20.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 39.00"
Response:  First, we know that Mark took 5 hours to finish the first test with 75 questions, so he spent 5/75 = 1/15 of an hour on each question.  Now, let's calculate how long it would take him to finish the second test with 100 questions:  Time for second test = Time for first test x (Number of questions in second test / Number of questions in first test)  Time for second test = 5 hours x (100/75)  Time for second test = 5 hours x 1.33  Time for second test = 6.67 hours  Since Mark has 8 hours to finish the first test and 6 hours to finish the second test, we can set up two equations:  Equation 1: 8 hours - Time for first test = 0  Equation 2: 6 hours - Time for second test = 0  Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:  Time for first test = 4 hours (since Mark finished it in 8 - 4 = 4 hours)  Time for second test = 2.67 hours (since Mark finished it in 6 - 2.67 = 2.67 hours)  Therefore, Mark left 2.67 \* 100 = 267 unfinished questions.
"Response:  We know that there are four times as many pink dumbbells as blue ones. So if we have x blue dumbbells, we will have 4x pink dumbbells.  The total number of dumbbells is 22 + 12 = 34.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
x + 4x = 34...  Simplifying this equation, we get:  
5x = 34...  Dividing both sides by 5, we find that:  x = 6  So there are 6 blue dumbbells and 24 (4 x 6) pink dumbbells."
Response:  We know that there are 20 cars in total, and we have already divided them into three categories: automatic (12), manual (4), and semi-automatic (the remaining 4). To find out what percentage of cars are semi-automatic, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100%. So, let's calculate:  Number of semi-automatic cars = 4  Total number of cars = 20  Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4/20) x 100% = 20%  Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many worker bees as queen bees and twice as many worker bees again. So if we have x queen bees, we will have 2x worker bees.  Now, we also know that the total number of bees is 700.  Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information:  
Queen bees + Worker bees = Total Bees 2x + x = 700 3x = 700  x = 233  So, there are 233 queen bees."
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games per week. We know he plays for 2 hours every day, so in one week (7 days), he plays for:  
2 hours/day x 7 days = 14 hours/week  
Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job. We know he earns $10 per hour, so in one week (7 days), he earns:  
$10/hour x 7 days = $70/week  
Now, let's subtract the amount of money Jordan earns from his part-time job from the total number of hours he spends playing video games. This will give us the number of hours Jordan spends playing video games that he could have spent working:  
14 hours/week - 70 hours/week = -56 hours/week  
Since Jordan is not working those 56 hours, we can assume that he would have earned the same amount of money as he did from his part-time job if he had worked instead of played video games. So, the answer to the question ""How much money would Jordan have earned if he had spent all his time working?"" is:  
-$70/week x 7 weeks = $-490/month  
Therefore, if Jordan spent all his time playing video games instead of working and going to school, he would have earned $490 less in a month."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all items before taxes: John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, bread for $3, cups for $3, and cookies for $4, so the total cost is:  Milk: $2 Eggs: $3 Bread: $3 Cups: $3 Cookies: $4 Total: $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15 Now, if there is a 10% sales tax on all non-food items, we can calculate the tax as follows: Tax rate: 10% (given) Total cost before taxes: $15 Tax amount: $15 x 10% = $1.50 So, the total cost with taxes would be: Total cost before taxes: $15 Tax amount: $1.50 Total with taxes: $15 + $1.50 = $16.50 Therefore, the total cost with taxes would be $16.50.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate how much money Lucas will make from each client. We know that he has 3 clients now and is negotiating with 5 potential clients. Each client needs two bottles of bleach and a package of cleaning cloths. The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of the package of cleaning cloths is $5. So, the total amount that Lucas will receive from each client is:  
$2 x 2 (bottles) + $5 (package of cleaning cloths) = $6 per client.  Since Lucas already has 3 clients, his weekly income from them is:  
$6 x 3 = $18. Now, let's add the potential clients. If he gets all 5 potential clients, his weekly income from them would be:  
$6 x 5 = $30. Therefore, Lucas's total weekly income would be:  
$18 + $30 = $48. His weekly profit would be:  
$48 - $2 x 2 (cost of bottles and cleaning cloths) = $48 - $4 = $44. So, Lucas's weekly profit would be $44."
Response:  We know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple fields and each hectare has 100 pineapples. So, in total, John has 10 x 100 = 1000 pineapples per hectare. Since he can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, he can harvest 4 times a year (since there are 3 months in a season). Therefore, John can collect 1000 x 4 = 4000 pineapples per year.
"Response:  First, Johnny has collected all the Lego pieces from the floor and put them in his room.  We know that he had 500 pieces of Lego in one set, 3 times as many pieces (i.e., 1500 pieces) in another set, and 1/4 of the total number of pieces (i.e., 1250 pieces) in a third set.  To find out how many pieces Johnny will have altogether, we need to add up these three amounts:  
500 + 1500 + 1250 = 3250  So, Johnny will have 3250 Lego pieces altogether if he collects all the pieces."
Response:  First, we know that there were initially 30 pbees that left the hive in the first 6 hours. This means that there were 30 - 15 = 15 bees that did not return to the hive during the first 6 hours.  Next, we are told that half of the remaining bees returned to the hive during the next 6 hours. Since there were originally 30 bees and half of them returned, this means that 30 / 2 = 15 bees returned during the second period.  Now, let's add up all the bees that have returned to the hive: 15 + 15 = 30. So, a total of 30 bees have returned to the hive over the last 6 hours.
Response:  We know that the adult ticket price is $12 and the child ticket price is $10. If the mother paid $8 for both tickets, she must have paid $12 - $10 = $2 more than the cost of the adult ticket. So, the amount she paid can be represented as follows: Adult ticket price + Child ticket price = $2 + $10 = $12 + $10 = $22. Therefore, the mother paid $22 to the cashier.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends in Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends in Facebook, then Charlie has 3x friends in Facebook.  Now we are given that James has four times as many friends in Facebook as Dorothy does. So if Dorothy has x friends in Facebook, then James has 4x friends in Facebook.  Since Charlie has three times as many friends in Facebook as Dorothy does, and James has four times as many friends in Facebook as Dorothy does, we can set up the following equation based on this information:  3x = 4(x)  Simplifying this equation, we get:  3x = 4x  Solving for x, we get:  x = 9  Therefore, Dorothy has 9 friends in Facebook.  And since Charlie has three times as many friends in Facebook as Dorothy does, Charlie has:  3(9) = 27  friends in Facebook.  Similarly, James has four times as many friends in Facebook as Dorothy does, so James has:  4(9) = 36  friends in Facebook.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how long it will take Steve to get home from school if he rides his bike at 440 feet per minute.  Since Steve lives 3 miles away from school, and there are 5,280 feet in a mile, we can calculate that Steve will travel for: 3 miles x 5,280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet  At 440 feet per minute, Steve will travel for: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 35 minutes  Now let's calculate how long it will take Tim to get home from school if he skateboards at 264 feet per minute.  Since Tim lives 2 miles away from school, and there are 5,280 feet in a mile, we can calculate that Tim will travel for: 2 miles x 5,280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet  At 264 feet per minute, Tim will travel for: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 39 minutes  So, based on our calculations, Steve will arrive home before Tim does. The difference between their arrival times is: 35 minutes - 39 minutes = 4 minutes  Therefore, Steve will wait for Tim for 4 minutes after arriving home before Tim finishes his journey.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Shonda has two tires for each of the five customers who came to inflate their tires, so she earned $25 x 5 = $125 from the first day.  Next, three customers came to inflate their tricycle tires, and since each tricycle tire costs $25, Shonda earned an additional $25 x 3 = $75 from these customers. Finally, one customer came with a unicycle, which requires only one tire, so Shonda earned $25 from this customer as well. Therefore, the total amount Shonda earned in the first day is $125 + $75 + $25 = $225.
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of biscuits and each package has six biscuits inside, then he will buy a total of 10 x 6 = 60 biscuits.  Since each biscuit costs $0.10, Carl will pay a total of 60 x $0.10 = $6.
Response:  Dave bought a large package of potatoes and ate fourteen before a hungry crow stole the package from his hand. The crow ate half of the remaining potatoes that Dave had not eaten yet. Then, three jackdaws pushed him away from the food and each bird ate three potatoes. Later, an otter stole two thirds of the remaining potatoes. Finally, the mice took the last one, leaving five. So, let's calculate how many potatoes were in the package when Dave bought it:  5 (remaining potatoes) = 3 x 14 + 2/3 x (14 - 7) + 2/3 x (14 - 7) + 1 (initial number of potatoes)  5 = 3 x 14 + 2/3 x 7 + 2/3 x 7 + 1  5 = 3 x 14 + 14 + 14 + 1  5 = 3 x 14 + 39 + 1  5 = 42 + 39 + 1  5 = 82 + 1  5 = 83   Therefore, there were 83 potatoes in the package when Dave bought it.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in one week, Kim has 3 hours per day for three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), so he has a total of 9 hours per week.  For two days (Thursday and Friday), he has 2 hours per day, so he has a total of 4 hours per week.  Therefore, in one month (four weeks), Kim spends 9 + 4 = 13 hours per month.  Now, let's calculate how many hours Kim spends in one semester (16 weeks).  We can multiply the number of hours per month by 16/4 = 4 months.  So, Kim spends 13 x 4 = 52 hours in one semester.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many inches of bread Bill has baked in total. There are 300 rolls x 4 inches per roll = 1200 inches of bread. Next, there are 120 chocolate croissants x 6 inches per croissant = 720 inches of bread. Finally, there are 60 bagels x 2 feet per bagel = 120 inches of bread. In total, Bill has baked 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches of bread. Now, let's convert this amount into hours. There are 12 inches in one foot, so we can divide the total number of inches by 12 to get the number of hours: 2040 / 12 = 170 hours. Therefore, if Bill places all his baked goods end to end, they will be approximately 170 hours long.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many bananas are needed for each species of monkey over two months.  For gorillas, they need 400 bananas per month x 2 months = 800 bananas.  For orangutans, they need 200 bananas per month x 2 months = 400 bananas.  For paviants, they need 100 bananas per month x 2 months = 200 bananas.  In total, the zoo needs 800 + 400 + 200 = 1400 bananas.  Therefore, the zoo should order 1400 bananas every two months.
Response:  First, we know that Blake runs forward and backward 15 times, so he covers a distance of 15 x 2 = 30 yards.  Next, we know that Kelly runs forward and backward once each time, so she covers a distance of 1 x 2 = 2 yards.  However, instead of running back and forth like Blake, Kelly decides to run towards the 40-yard line and back, for a total of 34 trips.  Since the football field is 100 yards long, we can calculate the total distance traveled by both players as follows:  For Blake: 30 + (15 x 2) = 30 + 30 = 60 yards  For Kelly: 2 + (34 x 2) = 2 + 68 = 70 yards  Therefore, the winner of this race would be Blake, who ran 60 yards, while Kelly ran 70 yards.
Response:  First, we know that Rafaela bought four bottles of glue, and each bottle cost $1.5. So, she spent $1.5 x 4 = $6 on glue. Next, we know that she bought two notebooks, and each notebook cost $4. So, she spent $4 x 2 = $8 on notebooks. Finally, we know that she bought one ream of paper for $20. So, in total, Rafaela spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.
Response:  First, we know that FIN sees 11 puppies swimming in the lake. Then, he sees six of them come out from hiding under the lily pads. Finally, he sees two more puppies hide under a rock. So, if we subtract the number of puppies that were already hidden (6) from the total number of puppies FIN saw initially (11), we get:  11 - 6 = 5  Therefore, FIN sees 5 puppies left swimming in the lake after the other five have hidden.
Response:  First, we know that in Tuesday, the water level was 7 feet higher than on Monday. So if the water level on Monday was x meters deep, then on Tuesday it was x + 7 meters deep. Next, we are told that on Wednesday, the water level was two-thirds of the water level on Tuesday. So if the water level on Tuesday was x + 7 meters deep, then the water level on Wednesday would be (x + 7) / 3 meters deep. Finally, we are given that the depth of the water on Wednesday is 5 meters deep. Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve for x:  5 = (x + 7) / 3  To solve this equation, we can first multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:  15 = x + 7  Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us:  8 = x  Therefore, the depth of the water on Monday was 8 meters deep.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Anakin has hunted more than Locksin because he has caught 10 marine stars, 6 marine horses and 3 clown fish, while Locksin has caught less than Anakin. So let's start with Anakin's catch:  
* Marine Stars: 10 x 2 = 20 (since each star is worth 2)  
* Marine Horses: 6 x 4 = 24 (since each horse is worth 4)  
* Clown Fish: 3 x 1 = 3  
Total: 20 + 24 + 3 = 47 points. Now, let's move to Locksin's catch:  
* Marine Stars: 5 x 2 = 10 (since each star is worth 2)  
* Marine Horses: 3 x 4 = 12 (since each horse is worth 4)  
* Clown Fish: 2 x 1 = 2  
Total: 10 + 12 + 2 = 24 points. Since Locksin has caught less than Anakin, Anakin wins with 47 points, and Locksin gets 24 points. Therefore, they have caught a total of 47 + 24 = 71 points."
Response:  First, we need to calculate the price of the bag after each two-month period.  We can do this by multiplying the initial price by 1 + (20/100), which gives us:  Price after 2 months = $20 x 1.20 = $24 Next, we need to repeat this process for each two-month period until we reach 36 months.  Here's how the prices would look:  Month 2: $24 Month 4: $24 x 1.20 = $28.80 Month 6: $28.80 x 1.20 = $34.56 Month 8: $34.56 x 1.20 = $41.47 And so on... After 36 months, the price of the bag would be: $41.47 x 1.20 = $49.76 Therefore, the bag with toppings that initially costed $20 would cost $49.76 after 36 months if the price increases by 20% every two months.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 5 red cars and each costs $4, so the total cost of all red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.  Secondly, we know that there are 3 figurines and each costs $5, so the total cost of all figurines is 3 x $5 = $15.  Finally, we know that the doll stuarts $3 for each action figure, so the total cost of all action figures is (3 x $3) = $9.  Therefore, the total cost of all toys is $20 + $15 + $9 = $44.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jackie will earn if she works as a freelancer for three hours less per week (21 hours instead of 24). This means she will have 21 hours x $75 per hour = $1,575 per week.  Secondly, let's calculate how much Jackie will pay to the accountant. The accountant charges $90 per month, so for one year, it would be $90 x 12 = $1,080.  Now, let's subtract the cost of hiring an accountant from the amount Jackie earns: $1,575 - $1,080 = $495.  Therefore, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $495 more per year than if she were to do her own taxes.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Elvira spent on the computer and its accessories: Computer + Ekan + Keyboard + Mouse = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 euro. Next, let's subtract the amount she spent from her budget of 1500 euros: 1500 - 1423 = 77 euros. So, Elvira will have 77 euros left for clothes.
Response:  Firstly, SANDRA needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan. Secondly, her neighbor gives her a basket with 9 eggs every time she looks at her baby. Therefore, if Sandra wants to make 15 Spanish flans, she will need 15 x 3 = 45 eggs in total. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time, she will need to look at her baby 45/9 = 5 times to get all the eggs she needs.
Response:  We know that Brook is 14 years old and Set is twice as old as Brook. So, Set is 2 times 14 = 28 years old.
Response:  We know that Eatal has $8 and Jimi has $2 more than Eatal. So, we can write an equation to represent this information:  Eatal = 8  Jimi = Eatal + 2  Therefore, Jimi = 8 + 2  Jimi = 10  So, Jimi has $10.
Response:  We know that Pancho walks for 30 km per day during the weekdays and for 10 miles (which is approximately equal to 16 km) during the weekends. To find out how many kilometers he walks in a week, we need to calculate his daily distance first. Daily distance = Weekday distance + Weekend distance Daily distance = 30 km + 16 km Daily distance = 46 km Now, let's calculate the total distance walked by Pancho in one week: Total distance = Daily distance x Number of days in a week Total distance = 46 km x 7 days Total distance = 322 km So, Pancho walks approximately 322 kilometers in one week.
Response:  First, we know that the price of each uniform is three times the price of the hat plus the price of the pants. So if we can find out the price of one hat and one pair of pants, we can calculate the price of an entire uniform.  We are given that the price of the hat is $25, so let's use this information to find the price of one pair of pants.  Since the price of the pants is equal to the price of the hat plus the price of the pants, we can set up the equation: Price of pants = $25 + Price of pants.  Solving for the price of the pants, we get: Price of pants = $25 + $25 = $50.  Now that we have found the prices of both the hat and the pants, we can calculate the price of an entire uniform as follows: Price of uniform = Price of hat x 3 + Price of pants = $25 x 3 + $50 = $75.  Therefore, the price of each uniform is $75.
Response:  First, we know that there are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so the total number of legs is 80 x 8 = 640 legs.  Next, we know that there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so the total number of legs is 90 x 6 = 540 legs. Finally, we know that there are 3 rare mutated creatures with 10 legs each, so the total number of legs is 3 x 10 = 30 legs. To find out how many legs in total, we add up all these numbers: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs. So, in total, Jake sees 1210 legs.
Response:  First, we know that Salli 2 is 3 years older than Baba Czerwona. So if Baba Czerwona is x years old, then Salli 2 is (x + 3) years old.  Next, we know that Baba Czerwona is twice as old as Salli Cztery. So if Salli Cztery is y years old, then Baba Czerwona is 2y years old.  Finally, we are told that Salli Trzydziestu i Dwa is 8 years old.  Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations:  Salli 2 = (x + 3)  Baba Czerwona = 2(y)  Salli Cztery = y  Salli Trzydziestu i Dwa = 8  Now solve for x, y, and z (since there are three unknowns).  We have:  Salli 2 = (x + 3)  Baba Czerwona = 2(y)  Salli Cztery = y  Salli Trzydziestu i Dwa = 8  Substituting the first equation into the second gives us:  Baba Czerwona = 2(y) = 2(Salli Cztery)  Since Baba Czerwona is twice as old as Salli Cztery, this means that Baba Czerwona is 2y years old.  Substituting this back into the third equation gives us:  Salli Trzydziestu i Dwa = 8  Salli Cztery = y  Baba Czerwona = 2y  Salli 2 = (x + 3)  Solving for x, we get:  x = 5  Therefore, the ages of the four birds are:  Salli 2 = 5 + 3 = 8 years old  Baba Czerwona = 2(y) = 2(6) = 12 years old  Salli Cztery = y = 6 years old  Salli Trzydziestu i Dwa = 8 years old  The total age of all four birds is therefore: 8 + 12 + 6 + 8 = 30 years old.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total monthly payments for each debt.  For the student loans, the minimum payment is $300 per month, so the total monthly payment will be: Total Monthly Payment = Minimum Payment x Number of Months in a Year Total Monthly Payment = $300 x 12 Total Monthly Payment = $3600 per year For the credit card debt, the minimum payment is $200 per month, so the total monthly payment will be: Total Monthly Payment = Minimum Payment x Number of Months in a Year Total Monthly Payment = $200 x 12 Total Monthly Payment = $2400 per year For the mortgage debt, the minimum payment is $500 per month, so the total monthly payment will be: Total Monthly Payment = Minimum Payment x Number of Months in a Year Total Monthly Payment = $500 x 12 Total Monthly Payment = $6000 per year Now that we have the total monthly payments for each debt, let's calculate the total annual payments. Total Annual Payment = Total Monthly Payment x Number of Months in a Year Total Annual Payment for Student Loans = $3600 x 12 Total Annual Payment for Credit Card Debt = $2400 x 12 Total Annual Payment for Mortgage Debt = $6000 x 12 To calculate the total annual payments, we multiply the total monthly payments by the number of months in a year (12). So, the total annual payments would be: Total Annual Payment for Student Loans = $3600 x 12 Total Annual Payment for Credit Card Debt = $2400 x 12 Total Annual Payment for Mortgage Debt = $6000 x 12 Finally, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, she will pay: Total Additional Payment = Total Annual Payment x 50% Total Additional Payment for Student Loans = $3600 x 50%
"Response:  We know that Billy takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds to peel one potato (1 min 30 sec). And it takes him only approximately 5 seconds to cut one potato after peeling (5 sec). So, if he has 60 potatoes to prepare for the big family barbecue, we can calculate how much time he will need in total as follows:  
Time = Number of potatoes x Time per potato  
Time = 60 x (1 min 30 sec + 5 sec)  
Time = 60 x 1 min 35 sec  
Time = 690 seconds  
Therefore, Billy will need approximately 690 seconds or about 11.5 minutes to finish preparing all the potatoes for the barbecue."
Response:  First, we know that they sell each gallon of lemonade for $3 + $2 = $5. Since they sold 25 gallons and received $25 in revenue, their total cost can be found out by subtracting the amount they spent on lemons from the revenue. We are given that they spend $2 per gallon on lemons, so their total cost is: Total Cost = Revenue - (Number of Gallons x Cost per Gallon) Total Cost = $25 - ($5 x 25) Total Cost = $25 - $125 Total Cost = $100 Therefore, they have spent $100 on lemons.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 240 participants in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the number of Chinese participants is 240 - 80 = 160. Since there are 60 boys in the Chinese team, the number of girls in the Chinese team must be:  160 - 60 = 100.
Response:  First, we know that Zayid gives his daughter $200 per week and his wife $700 for household expenses and other necessities. This means he spends $900 per month ($200 x 4 weeks + $700) on these two items. Next, we know that Zayid donates half of what remains after deducting these expenses to his favorite charity. So if we subtract the amount he spends on his family from his total income, we get: Total Income - Family Expenses = Amount Donated Half of this amount is then given to the charity. Therefore, the amount left over for himself can be calculated as follows: Total Income - Family Expenses - Charitable Donation = Amount Left Over For Himself To find out how much money will remain for Zayid after all these transactions have taken place, we need to substitute the values we know into this equation: Total Income - Family Expenses - Charitable Donation = Amount Left Over For Himself Total Income = $6000 (given in the problem) Family Expenses = $900 (calculated above) Charitable Donation = Half of $6000 - $900 = $3500 (since half of $6000 is $3000, minus $900 spent on family expenses) Substituting these values into the equation above, we get: Total Income - Family Expenses - Charitable Donation = Amount Left Over For Himself $6000 - $900 - $3500 = $2200 $2200 is the amount that will remain for Zayid after all these transactions have taken place.
Response:  First, we know that Monik has 4 rak less than Bo, so Monik has 40 - 4 = 36 rak.  Now, Rani has 10 more than Monik, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 rak.  Therefore, together they have 40 + 46 = 86 rak.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Lloyd has earned during the first week.  During the first week, he taught for 5 hours, so his earnings are:  5 hours x $10 per hour = $50  Now, let's calculate his earnings for the second week.  During the second week, he taught for 8 hours, so his earnings are:  8 hours x $10 per hour = $80  Therefore, Lloyd's total earnings for both weeks are:  $50 + $80 = $130
"Response:  We know that the total number of votes is 80 and the winner received 3/4 of the votes. So we can start with this information:  
Winner received 3/4 x 80 = 60 votes Losing candidate received (80 - 60) = 20 votes Now we have our answer! The losing candidate received 20 votes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white gvozdei. So if she ordered x white gvozdei, she ordered 4x x = 4x white roses.  Secondly, we know that Sandra also ordered 200 pink lilies, which were five times more than the number of white gvozdei. So if she ordered y white gvozdei, she ordered 5y pink lilies.  Now, let's add up all the orders:  x + (4x) + y + (5y) =?  We can simplify this equation as follows:  6x + 5y =?  Since Sandra wants to receive all the missing red roses before 5 pm, we know that x + 4x = 20 (since there are 20 missing red roses).  Therefore, our final equation is:  6x + 5y = 20.  Solving for x and y, we get:  x = 8 and y = 4.  So Sandra needs 8 red roses and 4 pink lilies to be delivered before 5 pm.
Response:  We know that Jean is two years older than Mark and that Mark was five years younger than Yan two years ago. So, we can start with the fact that Yan is 30 years old now.  If Mark was five years younger than Yan two years ago, then Mark was 25 years old two years ago (30 - 5 = 25).  And if Jean is two years older than Mark, then Jean was also 25 years old two years ago.  Therefore, Jean is currently 27 years old (25 + 2 = 27).
Response:  First, we need to calculate how long it will take for each member of the faster team to run their respective laps. We know that the first runner will finish in 60 seconds, so the second runner will finish in 57 seconds (since they are 3 seconds faster), and so on. The fourth runner will finish in 53 seconds. Now, let's calculate the total time it will take for the faster team to complete the race: Total time = Time of first runner + Time of second runner + Time of third runner + Time of fourth runner = 60 + 57 + 54 + 53 = 224 seconds. Now, let's compare this to the slower team. Since each member of the slower team takes 55 seconds to complete their lap, the total time it will take for the slower team to complete the race is: Total time = Time of first runner + Time of second runner + Time of third runner + Time of fourth runner = 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220 seconds. As you can see, the faster team will finish the race 4 seconds before the slower team, which means they will win by 4 seconds.
"Response:  First, we need to calculate the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers under 3.  Then we will subtract that from 100% to get the probability of throwing a number greater than 3.  
Step 1: Calculate the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers under 3.  We have six sides and four even numbers (2,4,6,8), so the probability of throwing an even number is 4/6 = 2/3. The probability of throwing two consecutive even numbers is (2/3)^2 = 2/9.  
Step 2: Subtract the probability of throwing two consecutive numbers under 3 from 100% to get the probability of throwing a number greater than 3.  100% - 2/9 = 78%. Therefore, the probability of throwing a number greater than 3 is approximately 78%."
Response:  If Jena has collected half of the apples that her mother received, then Jena has collected 20/2 = 10 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples that Jena and her mother have collected is 10 + 20 = 30 apples.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 160 pieces of slamka in total and they need to be distributed among the small animals in the pet store. We also know that each hamster gets 5 pieces of slamka, so there are 160/5 = 32 hamsters in total. Next, we know that each pig gets 6 pieces of slamka, so if there are 10 klets for pigs, then there are 10 x 6 = 60 pigs in total. Finally, we know that there are 20 parcels of slamka for the rabbits, so there must be 20/6 = 3 rabbits in total. Therefore, the number of plugs in each cage is 3 + 60 + 3 = 69.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months at an interest rate of 2% per month. We can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the future value (the amount Mandy owes Benedict), P is the principal (the $100 that Mandy borrowed), r is the monthly interest rate (2%/month), and n is the number of periods (in this case, 3 months). Plugging in the values, we get: A = $100(1 + 0.02)^3 = $104.68 So, after 3 months, Mandy owes Benedict $104.68.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each bag of wheat costs $2 to transport from the farm to the warehouse. So if the trader bought x bags of wheat, then he paid $2x for transportation. Secondly, we know that the trader sold all the bags at $30 per bag, so his total revenue is $30x. Finally, we are told that the trader made an overall profit of $400, so his total profit must be equal to his total revenue minus his total cost: Profit = Revenue - Cost Profit = $30x - $2x Profit = $30x - $2x $400 Therefore, we can solve for x as follows: $400 = $30x - $2x $400 = $30x - $2x $400 / $30 = x x = 13 So the trader sold 13 bags of wheat.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much each person spent on food. Since they spent $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, we can subtract that amount from the total cost of the tickets:  Total cost of tickets = $20.25  Cost per ticket = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75  Now, let's calculate how much each person spent on food:  Food cost per person = (Total cost of tickets - Cost per ticket) x Number of people = ($20.25 - $6.75) x 3 = $13.50 x 3 = $40.50  Finally, let's add up all the expenses for each person:  Total expenses per person = Cost per person + Food cost per person = $6.75 + $40.50 = $47.25  So, if the three friends are sharing expenses equally, each person will pay $47.25.
Response:  John can collect 2 prawns in one minute, so he can collect 2 x 3 = 6 prawns in 3 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each chicken needs to eat one kilogram of insects per week to survive. Secondly, there are ten chickens in total. Therefore, the total amount of insects needed for all ten chickens is ten times one kilogram, which equals ten kilograms of insects per week. To find out how much insects each chicken needs to eat daily, we can divide the total amount by seven days: ten kilograms / seven days = approximately 1.43 kilograms (or about 1 kilogram and 290 grams) of insects per day for each chicken.
Response:  First, we know that Tom plants 10 trees per year and cuts down 2 trees per year. So after 10 years, he will have planted 10 x 10 = 100 trees and cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. Therefore, he will have 100 - 20 = 80 trees left.  Now, we are told that 30% of the trees die. This means that 30% of 80 is 80 x 0.3 = 24 trees will die. So, after 10 years, Tom will have 80 - 24 = 56 trees left.
"Response:  First, we know that there were 18 plastic flamingos on the yard of Sui on Friday morning. Then, on Saturday morning, one-third of the flamingos were taken away and painted white, so we have:  
18 - (1/3) \* 18 = 18 - 6 = 12 flamingos left.  On Sunday morning, another 18 plastic flamingos were added to the yard, so now we have:  
12 + 18 = 30 flamingos in total.  Finally, on Sunday afternoon, 18 more plastic flamingos were placed on the yard, giving us a total of:  
30 + 18 = 48 flamingos.  So, on Sunday afternoon, there were 48 rosy plastic flamingos outside Sui's house."
Response:  First, we know that one moliv costs $2, so if Violeta wants to buy 5 different colors of molyv, she will need to spend 5 x $2 = $10. Since she has prepared $20 for this purchase, she will have enough money and will not need to change anything.
Response:  First, we know that one moliv costs $1.20 and one guma costs $0.30. So, to find out how much eight pens will cost, we need to multiply the cost of one pen by eight.  Therefore, the total cost of eight pens is:  8 x $1.20 = $9.60 + 8 x $0.30 = $2.40 Total Cost = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00
"Response:  First, we know that there are 200 pounds of carrots and we need to distribute them among 40 restaurants. Since each restaurant will receive 2 pounds of carrots, we can calculate how many kilograms of carrots will be used as follows:  
200 pounds = 90.7185 kilograms (rounded to the nearest hundredth) Therefore, approximately 90.7185 kilograms of carrots will be used in total."
Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 people living in Soda and we also know that the number of men is 8417 and the number of women is 9092. So, if we subtract the number of men from the total population, we get the number of women: Total Population - Men = Women + Children 23786 - 8417 = 9092 + Children Now, let's add the number of children to the number of women: 9092 + Children =? To find out how many children there are, we can use the fact that the total population is made up of men, women, and children. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 23786 = 8417 + 9092 + Children Subtracting 8417 and 9092 from both sides gives us: 23786 - 8417 - 9092 = Children + Children +... (since we have already accounted for all adults) Simplifying the equation, we get: 5387 = Children There are 5387 children living in Soda.
Response:  First month, she had 20 cards. Second month, she had 20 fewer cards than the first month (since she collected 20 fewer). Third month, she had twice as many cards as in the first two months combined. So let's calculate how many cards she had in each month:  First month: 20 cards Second month: 20 - 20 = 0 cards (she didn't collect any) Third month: 2 x (20 + 0) = 2 x 20 = 40 cards Therefore, Ilya has 40 cards of Pokemon now.
Response:  First, we know that Mark edits 1000 sentences per week for both publishers A and B.  Second, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so he earns $50 from Publisher A (1000 x 5 = 50). Third, we know that Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays him $100 (2 x 50 = 100). Therefore, in total, Mark earns $150 per week ($50 + $100).
Response:  First, we know that Balduir receives 5 cups of water in the morning and 6 cups of water every afternoon.  Second, each cup contains 5 liters of water. So, to find out how much water Baldur receives daily, we need to multiply the number of cups he receives with the amount of water in each cup.  Morning: 5 cups x 5 liters/cup = 25 liters Afternoon: 6 cups x 5 liters/cup = 30 liters Total Daily Water Intake: 25 + 30 = 55 liters
Response:  First, we know that John receives $2000 per week, or $104,000 per year (2000 x 52).  If he wins the award in the first day of the year and receives a one-time cash prize of $5000, his total earnings for the year will be: $104,000 + $5000 = $119,000.
Response:  First, we know that each acre of grapes produces 5 tons per year.  Second, we know that from every ton of grapes, 2 barrels (bushels) of wine are produced. So, if we multiply the number of tons by 2, we get the total number of barrels produced per year.  Therefore, the ferme produces 5 x 2 = 10 barrels of wine per year.
Response:  Firstly, Carl eats sandwiches every day for lunch and uses 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. That means he consumes 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese per week.  Secondly, he also eats eggs for breakfast 3 days a week and uses one more slice of cheese for his omelette than for his sandwich. So, he consumes an additional 3 x 1 = 3 slices of cheese per week.  Finally, he made a large macaroni and cheese dish to last several evenings during the week, using 8 slices of cheese in total. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese that Carl consumed is: 14 + 3 + 8 = 25 slices of cheese.
Response:  First, we know that Janet had 22 green and 10 yellow bottles of chemicals.  Next, she bought 6 packets of blue chemicals and 2 packets of red chemicals.  We are told that each packet of blue chemicals contains 9 bottles, and each packet of red chemicals contains 6 bottles.  So, let's add up how many bottles of each color Janet now has:  Green: 22 + 0 (from blue or red) = 22  Yellow: 10 + 0 (from blue or red) = 10  Blue: 0 + 6 x 9 = 54  Red: 0 + 2 x 6 = 12  Therefore, Janet now has a total of 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 bottles of chemicals.
Response:  First, we know that Brinly has already taken five tests and has received scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. We also know that Mr. Burt allows students to drop their lowest score each semester. So, if Brinly wants to have an average of 93, she should aim for a high score on her sixth test to make up for any low scores she may have received earlier in the semester. To calculate what score Brinly needs on the sixth test, let's use some algebra!  First, we can find the mean (average) of Brinly's first five scores: Mean = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 Mean = 450 / 5 Mean = 90 Now, we need to subtract the mean from each of Brinly's scores to find out how much each score is above or below the mean: 89 - 90 = -1 71 - 90 = -2 92 - 90 = 2 100 - 90 = 10 86 - 90 = 4 Now, we add up all these values to get the total amount Brinly needs to achieve on the sixth test to get an overall average of 93: -1 + 2 + 4 + 10 = 11 So, Brinly needs to score at least 11 points more than her current highest score (92) to achieve an overall average of 93. Therefore, she should aim for a score of at least 103 on the sixth test.
Response:  First, we know that Michael has been driving for four weeks (four sevens), and each week he drives twice (two times seven). So, in total, he drove eight weeks \* two times = sixteen times.  Next, we know that each time he drove, he covered 25 kilometers, so his total distance traveled is:  16 x 25 km = 400 km.  Now, let's look at the second part of the problem. We are told that Michael decided to drive only twice a week, but this time for 60 kilometers each time. He did this for three weeks, so:  3 x 2 x 60 km = 360 km.  To find out how many kilometers Michel traveled in total, we need to add up both parts:  400 km + 360 km = 760 km.  Therefore, Michel traveled 760 kilometers.
Response:  First, we know that there are 25 chocolate bars and each bar has 80 confiscated apples.  Second, we know that each chocolate bar contains two times as much weight in confiscated apples.  Third, we know that each confiscated apple weighs 40 grams.  So, let's start by finding out how many grams of apples are in one chocolate bar:  Number of grams of apples in one chocolate bar = Weight of one chocolate bar / Number of confiscated apples per bar  = 40 grams / 80 apples  = 0.5 grams/apple  Now, let's find out how many grams of apples are in the entire bag of bonbons:  Total number of grams of apples in the bag = Number of chocolate bars x Number of grams of apples per bar  = 25 bars x 0.5 grams/bar  = 12.5 kilograms (or 12,500 grams)  Finally, to find the total weight of the bag of bonbons, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the apples:  Total weight of the bag = Weight of the chocolate bars + Weight of the apples  = 12.5 kg (chocolate bars) + 12.5 kg (apples)  = 25 kg (or 25,000 grams)  Therefore, the total weight of the bag of bonbons is 25 kilograms or 25,000 grams.
Response:  On Monday, Rose bought 4 tortes.  On Tuesday, she bought three times more torte than on Monday, so she bought 3 x 4 = 12 torte.  On Wednesday, she bought five times more torte than on Tuesday, so she bought 5 x 12 = 60 torte.  In total, Rose bought 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 torte.
Response:  Firstly, we know that half a dozen cups cost $6000, so one cup costs $6000/6 = $1000.  Secondly, we are told that two dozen cups cost less than $1200, so we can set up an equation based on this information:  24 cups = 2 x (12 cups) = 2 x ($1000) = $2000.  Therefore, the total cost of purchasing each cup is $1000.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sarah wants to buy a jacket and two pairs of shoes, which cost $30 + $20 = $50 in total. She has saved $10 before starting to watch children, so she needs to earn enough money to cover the remaining amount.  Secondly, we are given that each time Sarah watches children, she earns $5. Therefore, if she watches them n times, she will earn $5n dollars.  Now, let's find out how many times Sarah needs to watch children to earn enough money for her purchases. We can set up an equation based on this information:  
$50 (total cost) = $5n (amount earned from watching children)  To solve for n, we can divide both sides of the equation by $5:  
$50 / $5 = n  Simplifying, we get:  
n = 10  So, Sarah needs to watch children 10 times to earn enough money for her purchases."
Response:  We know that the total number of eggs collected daily is 42 and the ratio of red to white eggs is 3:5 or 1:1.75 (since there are twice as many white eggs). So if we let x be the number of red eggs, then the number of white eggs would be 1.75x. Since all eggs together produce 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation: 3x + 1.75x = 42. Combine like terms: 5x = 42. Divide both sides by 5: x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 red eggs.
Response:  First, we need to convert the distance of the park from miles to meters. There are 1609.34 meters in a mile, so: Park length = 1.5 x 1609.34 = 2413.97 m Park width = 6 x 1609.34 = 9655.84 m Total area of the park = Park length x Park width = 2413.97 x 9655.84 = 23,571,521.88 m^2 Now, let's calculate how long Garry spends walking around the park at 5 km/h. We know that there are 3600 seconds in an hour, so: Time spent walking = Distance / Speed = 23,571,521.88 m^2 / 5 km/h = 4714.304 hours or approximately 195 days and 12 hours.
Response:  On the first day, Sloan counted 100 clients who entered the store.  On the second day, she counted 50 more than the previous day, so on the second day, there were 100 + 50 = 150 clients.  Now, let's find out how many clients Sloan counted on the third day.  She counted 50 more than the previous day, so on the third day, there were 150 + 50 = 200 clients.
Response:  We know that initially, the large basin had twice as much water as the small basin. So if the large basin has x gallons of water now, the small basin must have had half that amount, or x/2 gallons.  Since both basins are draining at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:  Large basin: 4x gallons/minute = Small basin: 4(x/2) gallons/minute  Now we need to find out how many gallons of water are in the small basin after 4 minutes. To do this, we can multiply the number of gallons flowing into the small basin each minute (4(x/2)) by the number of minutes that have passed (4): 4(x/2) gallons/minute x 4 minutes = Total gallons in small basin  Simplifying and solving for x gives us:  2x = 32  Therefore, there are 16 gallons of water in the small basin now.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Loris needs to work in order to earn enough money to buy the shoes and collar. We know that she wants to spend $320 on the shoes and $32 on the collar, so together, she needs to earn $352. Since she gets paid $8 per hour, we can calculate how many hours she needs to work as follows:  $$ \begin{aligned} Total\ Earnings &= Shoes + Collar \\ &= 320 + 32 \\ &= 352 \end{aligned}$$  Now we can divide the total earnings by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:  $$ \begin{aligned} Hours\ Worked &= Total\ Earnings / Wages \\ &= 352 / 8 \\ &= 44 \end{aligned}$$  So Loris needs to work for 44 hours before she has earned enough money to buy both items.
Response:  First, we know that Janet borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. So, she will have to pay back the principal amount of $2000 plus the interest. Now, if she pays $165 per month for 12 months, how much will be the remaining balance after all these payments? To find out, let's calculate the total amount paid by Janet over the 12-month period: Total Amount Paid = Principal + Interest Principal = $2000 Interest = 10% of $2000 = $200 Therefore, Total Amount Paid = $2000 + $200 = $2200 Now, since Janet is paying $165 per month, we can calculate the number of months required to pay off the entire amount: Number of Months = Total Amount Paid / Monthly Payment Number of Months = $2200 / $165 = 13 months And finally, we need to find out the remaining balance after all these payments: Remaining Balance = Total Amount Paid - (Number of Months x Monthly Payment) Remaining Balance = $2200 - ($165 x 13) = $2200 - $2045 = $155 The remaining balance after all payments would be $155.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more daisies than roses. This means we can write an equation based on this information:  
Number of daisies = Number of roses + 7  Since we know that there are 4 roses, we can substitute this value into the equation:  Number of daisies = 4 + 7  Simplifying the equation:  Number of daisies = 11  Therefore, there are 11 daisies in the vase."
Response:  First, we know that Adrian is three times as old as Harriet now, so Adrian's current age is 3 x 21 = 63 years old.  Second, we know that Harriet is half as old as Zach, so Zach's current age is 2 x 21 = 42 years old.  Finally, we want to find the average age of all three people after three years, so we add their ages and divide by three: (63 + 42 + 21) / 3 = (104 + 42 + 21) / 3 = 167 / 3 = 55.83 years old. So, after three years, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zach will be approximately 55.83 years old.
Response:  First, we know that Naomi has scored 68 points. Second, we know that Yuri has scored 10 more than Naomi, so Yuri has scored 68 + 10 = 78 points. Third, we know that Brian has scored 17 more than Naomi, so Brian has scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Finally, we want to find out how many points Joe Joe has scored. We can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:  4 students have collected together 251 points.  So, if we divide 251 by 4, we get:  251 / 4 = 63  Therefore, Joe Joe has scored 63 points.
"Response:  We know that she spent 10 minutes solving each crossword puzzle and 5 minutes solving each Sudoku puzzle.  So, if she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 Sudoku puzzles during the weekend, we can calculate the total time as follows:  
Time spent on crossword puzzles = 3 x 10 min = 30 min  
Time spent on Sudoku puzzles = 8 x 5 min = 40 min  
Total time spent on both games = 30 + 40 = 70 min"
Response:  First, we know that Selin used 90 liters of water from the reservoir to irrigate her garden. This means that there were 90 - 90 = 0 liters of water left in the reservoir after she finished using it.  Next, we are told that Selin collected twice as much rainwater as was left in the reservoir. So if there were 0 liters of water left in the reservoir, then she collected 0 x 2 = 0 liters of rainwater.  Therefore, there is no water left in the reservoir.  The final answer is 0 liters.
Response:  First, we know that Andi has planted 90 geraniums and 40 petunias.  Second, we are asked how many flowers she has planted in total.  To find out, we need to add the number of geraniums and petunias together.  So, if we add 90 + 40, we get: 90 + 40 = 130.  Therefore, Andi has planted 130 flowers in total.
Response:  First year: The company spends $15,000 on advertising. Second year: The company spends one-third of the previous year's amount, which is $15,000 / 3 = $5,000. Total spent on advertising over two years: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Carlos will pay for his canoe rental. Since he rented it for 3 hours, and the cost is $30 per hour, then: Carlos' total cost = $30 x 3 = $90. Next, let's calculate Benji's cost for his banana boat rental. He rented it for 5 hours, and the cost is $18 per hour, so: Benji's total cost = $18 x 5 = $90. Both Carlos and Benji paid the same amount - $90 each.
Response:  First, we know that it takes half the time to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car compared to bus. So if it takes 6 days to travel by bus, it would take 3 days to travel by car.  Now, we need to add the return trip. If Andrew travels by car from Rochester to New Jersey, it will also take 3 days. Therefore, the total number of days for Andrew to travel to Rochester and back by car is 3 + 3 = 6 days.  However, if he travels by bus, he needs to add an extra day for the return trip, so the total number of days for him to travel to Rochester and back by bus is 6 + 1 = 7 days.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total number of cards that James has after he buys new ones.  Total = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 Then, we subtract the number of water cards he loses:  Total - 8 = 90 - 8 = 82 Next, we add the number of grass cards he buys: 82 + 14 = 96 So, there are 96 cards in total, and we want to find out the probability that a randomly selected card is a water card. To do this, we divide the number of water cards he had before by the total number of cards: 8/96 = 1/12 Probability = 1/12 or approximately 0.083 (rounded to the nearest whole number) Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected card from James' deck will be a water card is approximately 0.083 or 8.3%.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the meal without any discounts or promotions.  To do this, we add up all the costs of each item:  Meat ($2), cheese ($1), avocado ($1), and two sauces ($0.25 x 2 = $0.50). Total cost before discounts: $6.75. Next, we know that Chad wants to improve his meal with additional items, so he adds chips and a drink for an extra $3. This brings the new total to: $9.75 (total cost) + $3 (improvement amount) = $12.75. Finally, we subtract the $5 gift card, which leaves us with: $12.75 - $5 = $7.75. So, Chad owes $7.75 for his meal after using the gift card.
Response: 1) Calinda works at a rate of 4 pieces per minute. 2) Her mother can do half as much work in one minute. So her mother's rate is 4/2 = 2 pieces per minute. 3) The total number of pieces they need to make is 360.  To find out how many minutes it will take them to finish the puzzle, we can divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate: 360 / (4 + 2) = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.  Therefore, it will take them 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.
Response:  Firstly, Ashley took 30% of the eggs from the farm after two months, so we need to find out how many eggs were left on the farm at that time. We know that 30% of the total number of eggs is equal to 30/100 = 0.3 x 120 = 36 eggs (since there are 120 eggs in total). Therefore, the number of eggs left on the farm was: 120 - 36 = 84 eggs. Now, we want to find out how many eggs were ready for collection two weeks later. According to the problem, 3/4 of the remaining eggs were ready for collection, which means we can calculate the number of eggs ready for collection as follows: 3/4 x 84 = 0.75 x 84 = 63 eggs. So, there were 63 eggs ready for collection two weeks later.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all cars: 12 x $20,000 = $240,000. Next, we add the registration fee for each car: 12 x $1,000 = $12,000. So, the total amount paid is: $240,000 + $12,000 = $252,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in Monday, Kaili collected 5 more shells than Robert, so if Robert collected x shells, then Kaili collected x + 5 shells.  Secondly, we are told that on Tuesday, Kaili collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday, so if she collected x + 5 shells on Monday, then she collected 2(x + 5) = 2x + 10 shells on Tuesday.  Therefore, the number of shells Kaili collected on Tuesday is 2x + 10.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 50 mravki in the garden. Secondly, each mraka can collect half of the number of bees in the garden. So if there are x bees in the garden, then each mraka can collect x/2 bees. Therefore, the total number of bees collected by all mravki will be:  x / 2. Now we need to find out how many bees are in the garden. We know that Daax went to the farm and brought back half of the number of bees in the garden. So the number of bees in the garden before Daax went to the farm is twice the number of bees he brought back: 2x. Since Daax brought back 50 mravki, the number of bees he brought back is 50. Therefore, the total number of bees in the garden before Daax went to the farm is:  2x = 100. Solving for x, we get:  x = 50. Therefore, there were 50 bees in the garden before Daax went to the farm.
Response: 1/3 of the penguins are basking in the sun (36 / 3 = 12). 1/3 of the remaining penguins are entering the cave for dinner (36 / 3 = 12), so there are 12 - 12 = 0 penguins left to warm up. Therefore, there are no penguins left to warm up.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve eats twice as much as his friend, so if his friend eats 6 tomatoes per day, Steve eats 12 tomatoes per day. Secondly, we are told that one loza can produce 3 tomatoes per week, so to calculate how many lozases Steve needs, we need to divide the number of tomatoes he eats per day by the number of tomatoes produced per week by one loza.  So, let's do it: 12 (tomatoes/day) / 3 (tomatoes/week/loza) =? lozases needed per week.  Do you want me to give you the final answer or would you like to try to solve it yourself?
Response:  First, we know that John wants to share his pizza with all of his friends (20 people). We also know that each person can have 4 pieces of pizza. So, if we divide 20 by 4, we get: 20 / 4 = 5. This means that John needs to order 5 large pizzas (since each pizza has 8 slices).
"Response:  If Ram uses 1/5 of each bottle to fill his next one, and he has 25 bottles in total, then he will use:  
25 x (1/5) = 50 portions of chemicals.  So, after using all 25 bottles, Ram will have 50 portions of chemicals left over."
Response:  First, Johnny invested $20 and added another $10, so he has a total of $30. If this amount doubles in one year, then after one year, he will have $60.
Response:  First, we know that Meri is two years younger than Joan, so Joan must be five years older than Jessa.  Now, we are given that Jessa is twenty years old.  So, if Joan is five years older than Jessa, then Joan must be twenty-five years old (twenty + five).  Therefore, Meri is two years younger than Joan, and her age can be found by subtracting two from twenty-five:  Meri is twenty-three years old (twenty-five - two).  The sum of the ages of the three girls is:  Twenty (Jessa) + Twenty-five (Joan) + Twenty-three (Meri) = Fifty-eight (20 + 25 + 23).
Response:  Firstly, we know that 30% of the students have left through exit A, so the number of students who have left through exit A is:  30% x 1000 = 300  Next, we know that 3/5 of the remaining students have left through exit B, so the number of students who have left through exit B is:  3/5 x (1000 - 300) = 3/5 x 700 = 420  Finally, we know that all the remaining students have left through exit S, so the number of students who have left through exit S is:  1000 - (300 + 420) = 1000 - 720 = 280  Therefore, the number of students who have left through exit S is 280.
"Response:  First, we know that John has twice as many bonbons as Robert, so if Robert has x bonbons, John has 2x bonbons.  Second, we know that James has 6 more bonbons than Robert, so if Robert has x bonbons, James has x + 6 bonbons.  Finally, we are told that John has 54 bonbons.  So, we can set up an equation based on these facts:  
2x + 6 = 54  Simplify the left side of the equation:  
2x + 6 = 108 (since 6 + 6 is equal to 108) Now solve for x:  
2x = 108 - 6 2x = 102  Divide both sides by 2 to find x:  
x = 51  Therefore, Robert has 51 bonbons and James has 51 + 6 = 57 bonbons.  To find out how much more bonbons John has than James, subtract their number of bonbons:  
John has 54 - 57 = 3 fewer bonbons than James."
Response: 1. Pandora reads her own book, which has one chapter. So she will read one chapter. 2. Dolly also reads her own book, which has two chapters. So she will read two chapters. 3. Now, they both read each other's books. Since Pandora's book has only one chapter, Dolly will read only one chapter from Pandora's book. And since Dolly's book has two chapters, Pandora will read two chapters from Dolly's book. Therefore, together they will have read three chapters (one + two).
Response: 1. Mike writes to two people every week for 5 pages each (total of 10 pages per week). 2. Each letter takes him 6 minutes to write, so he spends 60 minutes writing each letter (10 pages x 6 minutes/page = 60 minutes). 3. Since there are 7 days in a week, Mike spends 60 minutes x 7 days = 420 minutes or 7 hours per week writing letters.
"Response:  First, we know that Jason has 1000 minutes per month.  Second, he has 15-minute conversations with his boss every day, so that's 15 x 30 = 450 minutes of conversation with his boss this month.  Third, he had an additional 300 minutes of other conversations this month.  So, how many minutes does Jason have left?  
Answer: 1000 - (450 + 300) = 250 minutes."
Response:  First, Kyle took 5 carrots from Griffin, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 carrots left. Then, Ginger gave Griffin some carrots, but we don't know how many. Next, Colby took 3 fewer than the number of carrots that Kyle took, so Colby took 3 - 5 = 2 carrots from Griffin. Finally, Griffin has 19 + 2 = 21 carrots. So, Ginger must have given Griffin 21 - 19 = 2 carrots.
"Response:  We know that there are twice as many oysters in one aquarium than in the other. So if we let x be the number of fish in one aquarium and y be the number of fish in the other, then we can write an equation based on the information given:  
x + y = 4 (since there are 4 oysters in total)  
2x + 3y = 32 (since there are 32 oysters in all)  
Now we have two equations and two unknowns. Can you solve for x and y using substitution or elimination?"
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much time Grimior spends working on each day of filming. There are 6 hours per day x 4 days per week = 24 hours per week. Since there are 5 weeks of filming, that's a total of 120 hours worked. Next, let's calculate how much money Grimior earns for each hour worked. We know she charges $250 per hour, so her total earnings for the 120 hours worked would be: 120 hours x $250/hour = $30,000. Now, we need to subtract the percentage that Grimior gives as a discount to Diane. We know that Grimior gives a 10% discount, so we can calculate the amount owed to Grimior as follows: $30,000 x 90% (100% - 10%) = $27,000. Therefore, Diane owes Grimior $27,000 for the grip work done during the 5-week film shoot.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Isabelle spent in total for all the party supplies.  Total cost = Cost of ingredients + Cost of gifts + Decorations + Invitations + Party bags Total cost = 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 98 dollars Next, we need to divide this amount among three people - Isabelle and her two parents. Since there are three people, each person will pay one-third of the total cost. One-third of 98 is: 98 / 3 = 32 So, each person (Isabelle and her two parents) will pay $32.
Response:  First, we know that each bag of onions costs $1.50.  If the cook bought 4 bags, then the total cost would be:  4 x $1.50 = $6.00  So, the cook spent $6.00 on onions.
Response:  First, we know that Sue eats 4 times more biscuits than her sister on Monday. So if her sister eats x biscuits, Sue eats 4x biscuits.  On Tuesday, Sue eats twice as many biscuits as her sister, so she eats 2(x) = 2x biscuits.  We also know that Sue's sister eats 5 biscuits on Monday and 13 biscuits on the next day. So, in total, she eats 5 + 13 = 18 biscuits.  Now, let's calculate how many calories Sue consumes:  If one biscuit has 200 calories, then Sue consumes:  4x \* 200 = 800 calories (on Monday) + 2x \* 200 = 400 calories (on Tuesday)  Total calories consumed by Sue = 800 + 400 = 1200 calories.  Therefore, Sue consumes 1200 calories more than her sister.
