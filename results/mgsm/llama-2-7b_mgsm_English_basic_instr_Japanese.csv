Janet has 16 ducks that lay eggs everyday. Each duck lays 3 eggs per day which means Janet gets 48 eggs from all of her ducks each day(16 x 3 = 48). Since she eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day, she has 45 eggs left to sell at the farmer's market (48 - 3 = 45). At $2 per egg, Janet makes $90 from selling her eggs at the farmer's market each day ($2 x 45 = $90). Therefore, Janet makes $90 at the farmer's market every day."

Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%. To calculate the profit, we can use the formula: Profit = Selling Price - Original Cost. In this case, the selling price is $130,000 (the original cost plus the amount spent on repairs) and the original cost is $80,000, so the profit is: Profit = $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000. Therefore, Josh made a profit of $50,000 from flipping the house."

Here's how I arrived at that answer:

Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10, so her earnings for the first 40 hours she works are $400 ($10/hour x 40 hours).
For the additional 5 hours she worked (from 40 to 45 hours), she received 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $12 ($10/hour x 1.2 = $12). So her total earnings for those extra 5 hours are $60 ($12 x 5 hours).
Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460 ($400 + $60)."

質問: どこにいる?

* 解釋: This question is asking for the location of something. It could be a person, an object, or even an idea.
* 答え: Based on the information provided in the question, we can infer that the thing being asked about is located somewhere outside of the United States, since it has been downloaded ""in another country."" Therefore, the answer is ""outside of the United States.""

質問: A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?

* 解释: This question is asking for the total number of downloads of a program over a period of three months. We are given some information about the number of downloads in each of those months, and we need to use that information to calculate the total number of downloads.
* 答え: To calculate the total number of downloads, we need to multiply the number of downloads in the first month by 3 (since there were three times as many downloads in the second month), and then subtract 30% of that result (to account for the reduction in downloads in the third month).

So, if the program had 60 downloads in the first month, and there were three times as many downloads in the second month (i.e., 180 downloads), then the total number of downloads over the three months would be:

60 + (180 x 3) - 30 = 210

Therefore, the program had a total of 210 downloads over the three months."

"Response: 6,375 dollars。

解釈:

Firstly, we need to calculate the present value of each option based on their expected future prices. Let's assume the probability distribution for both markets are normal distributions with mean and standard deviation as follows:

Jewelry Market: Mean = 5,000 + 2.5% x 5,000 = 5,250; Standard Deviation = ±$250
Electronic Gadgets Market: Mean = 8,000 + 1.2% x 8,000 = 8,240; Standard Deviation = ±$400

Using these probabilities, we can calculate the expected values of each option:

Option 1 (Jewelry): Expected Value = $5,000 x 0.59 = $2,950
Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets): Expected Value = $8,000 x 0.41 = $3,280

Now, let's calculate the profit from each option after one month:

Option 1 (Jewelry): Profit = $5,000 - ($2,950 / 1.02) = $6,375
Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets): Profit = $8,000 - ($3,280 / 1.01) = $6,375

As you can see, both options have the same profit of $6,375 after one month. Therefore, the merchant should choose the option that has a higher expected value, which in this case is Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets)."
Response: 240 miles. On the first day, both trains traveled westward for 80 miles, so the total distance covered was 80 miles x 2 = 160 miles. On the second day, one train traveled northward for 150 miles, while the other train continued to travel westward for another 80 miles, so the total distance covered by the train that traveled north was 150 miles + 80 miles = 230 miles. Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 160 miles + 230 miles = 240 miles.
"Response:  $48,000 です。

Jill makes $20 per hour teaching and $30 per hour coaching. If she works 50 weeks a year at 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, her total hours worked is:

Teaching hours = 35 x 50 = 1750 hours
Coaching hours = 15 x 50 = 750 hours
Total hours worked = 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours

Since Jill works 2500 hours in a year, her annual salary can be calculated as follows:

Annual salary (teaching) = $20/hour x 1750 hours = $35,000
Annual salary (coaching) = $30/hour x 750 hours = $22,500
Annual salary = $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
Response: 12 dozen eggs です。Claire makes 3 egg omelets every morning for breakfast, which means she eats 3 x 7 = 21 eggs per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she will eat 21 x 4 = 84 eggs in a month. Therefore, she will eat 84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs per month. So, in 4 weeks, she will eat 7 x 4 = 28 dozen eggs.

Here's how I arrived at the answer:

The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, so it will melt 2 x 4 = 8 centimeters in total during the 3-hour period from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Since the candle is initially 10 centimeters tall, it will be 10 - 8 = 2 centimeters shorter after burning for 3 hours. Therefore, the answer is 2 centimeters."
"Response: 78.75 dollars です。

解釈:

Kyle paid $19.50 for the book after a 25% discount, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage)

In this case, the discount percentage is 25%, and the discounted price is $19.50. So, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the original price:

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
= $19.50 / 0.75
= $78.75

Therefore, the original price of the book before the discount was $78.75."

Since Marie paid a total of $50, we can set up an equation using these values: $12 + $15 + $6 + $6 = $50. Solving for? (the number of boxes of pizza), we get:? = $6 / $8.50 = 6. Therefore, Marie ordered 6 boxes of pizza.

Dana's speed when skipping is half as fast as her speed when running, so her rate of travel when skipping is 3/2 = 1.5 miles per hour. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she runs for 2/3 \* 6 = 4 hours and walks for 1/3 \* 6 = 2 hours. Therefore, her total distance traveled is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 1.5 miles/hour x 4 hours + 0.5 miles/hour x 2 hours = 18 miles

So, Dana can travel 18 miles in six hours."

Here's the calculation:

Total calories in a 300g bag of chips = 250 x 5 = 1250 calories
Daily calorie target = 2000 calories
Number of calories consumed so far = 1800 calories

To determine how many grams of chips you can eat based on your remaining calorie target, we divide the number of calories left by the number of calories in each gram of chips:

Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories
Calories per gram of chips = 250 calories / 300g (weight of bag) = 83 calories per 100g

Therefore, you can eat up to 200/83 = 240 grams of chips based on your remaining calorie target."

Charlie has a total of 1 lb of beeswax and 20 wicks. He can make 10 tapered candles with each pound of beeswax, so he will be able to make 10 x 10 = 100 candles altogether. Since it costs him $10.00 in supplies (beeswax + wicks) to make one candle, his total supply cost will be $10.00 / 10 = $1.00 per candle. Therefore, if he sells each candle for $2.00, his net profit from making and selling 20 candles will be $2.00 x 20 = $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00."

John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties. Let's say the number of blue ties is x. Then, the number of red ties is 2x.

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of one red tie is 1.5 times the cost of one blue tie. If the cost of one blue tie is $40, then the cost of one red tie is $60 ($40 x 1.5).

Since John spent $200 on blue ties, and the cost of one blue tie is $40, then he spent a total of $800 ($200 x 4) on all ties (blue and red combined).

Therefore, John spent $350 on red ties ($60 x 2x = $350)."

Since he wants to remove 15 pounds from his book bag, he will need to remove 7.5 - 15 = -7.5 pounds of toys. However, since the toys weigh 1/2 pound each, removing -7.5 pounds of them would actually be 7.5 / 2 = 3.75 toys. So, he needs to remove 37.5 toys from his book bag.

To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight limit of the bridge.

Total weight limit of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Weight of truck + weight of driver = 3755 pounds (given)

Subtracting the weight of the truck and the driver from the total weight limit gives us the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:

Maximum number of boxes = Total weight limit - Weight of truck - Weight of driver
= 5000 - 3755
= 1245

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 1245."

Marcy has worked for the same company for 40 years, so she is eligible for a pension of $50,000/year starting from year 40. Since she became entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years of service, she will receive $50,000 x (1 + 0.05) = $52,500 in year 60. In addition, since she quit after 30 years of service, she will also receive $50,000 x (1 + 0.05) = $57,500 as a lump sum payment at retirement. Therefore, her total annual pension benefit at retirement will be $52,500 + $57,500 = $110,000."

To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to use the information provided in the problem. We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank, which means she has used 1/4 of her total fuel capacity (since she needs 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank). Therefore, if her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, then she has 9 gallons left in her tank after driving 100 miles (12 - 4 = 9).

Now, let's convert this amount of gas from gallons to miles. There are 3.785 liters in each US gallon, so Sophia has 9 / 3.785 = approximately 2.36 hours of driving left in her tank. This is equivalent to about 37.5 miles, as there are approximately 15.5 miles per hour of driving time (based on an average speed of around 60 mph).

Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?"" is 37.5 miles."

The problem states that Luke is building a 4-leveled sandcastle with a total square footage of 16 on the top level. Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can set up the following equation to represent the relationship between the levels:

Level i's square footage = (i - 1) × Level i-1's square footage

Where i ranges from 1 to 4, and represents the number of levels in the sandcastle.

Plugging in the value for Level 4 (16), we get:

Level 4's square footage = (4 - 1) × Level 3's square footage = 3 × 8 = 24

Therefore, the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle is 24/4 = 6.

So, the answer is 8."

Here's how we can calculate the cost of the grooming:

Original price = $100 (as mentioned in the question)
Discount amount = $30 (30% of $100)
New price = Original price x (1 - Discount percentage)
= $100 x (1 - 0.30)
= $70

Therefore, the cost of the grooming is $70."

Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. To find the combined weight of Grace and Alex, we can use the following equation:
Combined weight = Grace's weight + (Alex's weight - 2 pounds)
Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
Combined weight = 125 + (4 x 125 - 2)
= 125 + 500 - 2
= 627 pounds
Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 627 pounds."

根據該質問的背景和情況，我們可以知道：

* 每名 employee  receives $600 per month from the company.
* The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each employee by 10% of their initial salary every year for those who have stayed in the company for five years.
* Sylvie has been working at the company for five years as of last December (i.e., she has completed 5 years of service).

Therefore, we can calculate Sylvie's current annual salary as follows:

Initial Salary = $600 x 5 = $3000 (since she has worked for 5 years)
Annual Increase = $3000 x 10% = $300 (based on the company's policy)
New Annual Salary = Initial Salary + Annual Increase = $3000 + $300 = $3300

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $3300."
"Response: 43,750 です。

Let's break it down step by step:

Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. This means that if Harald sold x copies of his record, Marilyn sold 10x copies of her record.

The combined total of both records is 88,000 copies. So, the sum of Harald's and Marilyn's sales must be equal to this total:

Harald's sales = 88,000 - Marilyn's sales

Now we can substitute the information given in the problem:

Harald's sales = 88,000 - (10x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 43,750

So, Harald sold 43,750 copies of his record."

"Response: 60 lb (pounds) です。

以下が、Ted's calculations:

Adults: x = 20
Childrens: y = 5
Total amount of potato salad needed: x + y = 30
Since an adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, x = 10(20) = 200 lbs
Since a child eats half as much as an adult, y = 5(20) = 100 lbs
Therefore, total amount of potato salad needed is 200 + 100 = 300 lbs
So, Ted needs to bring 300 lbs of potato salad to the picnic."

"Response: 120 です。

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The number of rabbits pets is 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. This means that if we know the number of dogs and cats, we can find the number of rabbits.
2. There are two cats for every dog, so if there are 60 dogs, there are 60 x 2 = 120 cats.
3. Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 60 + 120 = 180.

So, the answer to the question ""How many pets are in the neighborhood?"" is 180."

Harry slept for 9 hours, so he slept for x - 2 hours. Since James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept, James slept for (x - 2) / 3 hours. Therefore, the difference between the amount of time Harry slept and James slept is 6 hours (x - 2)."
"Response: 9 tomatoes です。
以下のような計算を行いましょう:

* 16 ounce can of tomatoes = 3 tomatoes (since each can loses half its volume)
* Total amount of tomatoes used in the batch = 3 x 32 ounces = 96 ounces
* Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can convert the total amount of tomatoes to pounds by dividing by 16: 96 ounces / 16 = 5.75 pounds
* Finally, since there are 3 tomatoes per pound, we can find out how many tomatoes were used in the batch by dividing the weight of tomatoes by 3: 5.75 pounds / 3 = 1.90 tomatoes
Therefore, Freda used 9 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce."

根據詢問中的資料，我們知道：

* There are 30 cars on the motorway initially.
* In the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam, some cars (but not all) drive through.
* In the remaining 15 minutes of the jam, another 20 cars drive through.
* 5 cars from the line take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

So, if there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, and some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, then the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:

30 - (some cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes) = 15

Therefore, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."

"Response: 288 cubic inches (or 47.6 cubic cm)。

To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then add them up.
The volume of a rectangular prism can be calculated using the formula:
V = length x width x height

For Box 1:
length = 5 inches = 0.05 feet
width = 6 inches = 0.06 feet
height = 4 inches = 0.04 feet
V = 0.05 x 0.06 x 0.04 = 0.008 cubic feet

For Box 2:
length = 5 inches = 0.05 feet
width = 6 inches = 0.06 feet
height = 4 inches = 0.04 feet
V = 0.05 x 0.06 x 0.04 = 0.008 cubic feet

For Box 3:
length = 5 inches = 0.05 feet
width = 6 inches = 0.06 feet
height = 4 inches = 0.04 feet
V = 0.05 x 0.06 x 0.04 = 0.008 cubic feet

Since there are 3 boxes, we add their volumes together to get the total inner volume:
Total volume = Volume of Box 1 + Volume of Box 2 + Volume of Box 3
= 0.008 + 0.008 + 0.008 = 0.024 cubic feet

Now, since there are 17 cubic inches in a cubic foot, we can convert the total volume from cubic feet to cubic inches:
Total volume (in cubic inches) = Total volume (in cubic feet) x 17
= 0.024 x 17
= 40.96 cubic inches

Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is approximately 40.96 cubic inches or 67.92 cubic cm."

"Response: 17.5 です。

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fruit roll-ups that each person has eaten. Let's start by finding out how many roll-ups Beatrice had. Since her roll-up was 24 rolls long, she had 24 x 1 = 24 fruit roll-ups. Similarly, since Marcell's roll-up was 14 rolls long, he had 14 x 1 = 14 fruit roll-ups.

Now, let's find the average number of fruit roll-ups each person ate. To do this, we divide the total number of roll-ups each person had by the width of their roll-up. For Beatrice, the width of her roll-up is 2 rolls, so she averaged 24 / 2 = 12 fruit roll-ups per roll. For Marcell, the width of his roll-up is 3 rolls, so he averaged 14 / 3 = 11 fruit roll-ups per roll. Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups each person ate is 12 + 11 = 23."

以下のように計算します。
1. 2L/10ft x distance = amount of water taken on
2. distance = 20ft (Julia rowed 20 feet)
3. amount of water taken on = 2L x 20ft = 40L
4. Since Julia rowed 64 seconds to reach shore, and it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, she rowed a total of 800feet (64 sec / 16 sec per 20 ft).
5. Therefore, the amount of water taken on is 40L + (800ft x 2L/10ft) = 40L + 160L = 200L = 13 liters."

以下のような計算が行われます。

* Teacher A uses the whiteboard for 2 lessons per day, so the whiteboard is used 8 times per day by Teacher A (2 x 2 = 8).
* Teacher B uses the whiteboard for 2 lessons per day, so the whiteboard is used 8 times per day by Teacher B (2 x 2 = 8).
* Teacher C uses the whiteboard for 2 lessons per day, so the whiteboard is used 8 times per day by Teacher C (2 x 2 = 8).
* Teacher D uses the whiteboard for 2 lessons per day, so the whiteboard is used 8 times per day by Teacher D (2 x 2 = 8).

Total number of times the whiteboard is used per day = Number of times each teacher uses it x Number of lessons they teach per day
= 8 x 4 = 32

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day is 32 / 3 = 10.67 times per day. Therefore, the answer is 16 times."

Since Sasha paid $10 per board for the leftovers, she makes a profit of $80 ($180 - $100)."
"Response: 840 teaspoonfuls of sugar です。

Explanation:
Let's use the given information to find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used. We know that for every 7 cups of water, she uses 1 teaspoon of sugar, and for every 13 cups of water, she uses 1 teaspoon of sugar as well. Therefore, if she used a total of 120 cups of water, we can calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used by multiplying the number of cups of water by the ratio of sugar to water. So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

120 cups x (1/7) = 840 teaspoonfuls of sugar

Therefore, the answer is 840 teaspoonfuls of sugar."

"Response: 6 containers です。
以下のような計算が行われました:

Day 1:

* Number of containers with vehicles = 2
* Total number of vehicles = 2 x 5 = 10

Day 2:

* New number of containers with vehicles =?
* Total number of vehicles =? x 5 =?

From the problem statement, we know that the total number of vehicles at the port increased by 20 (from 10 to 30) on the second day. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers must have increased by a factor of 4 (from 2 to 6). Therefore, the answer is 6 containers were imported on the second day."
"Response: 65280 です。

Let's break down how we can solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary is x, then Adrien's salary is 30% higher, which means it is x + 30%.
2. Four years later, Adrien's salary has increased to A = 40% more than what he was making four years ago. This means that Adrien's new salary is A = (x + 30%) × 1.4 = x + 42%.
3. Since both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's. So, Lylah's new salary is L = x + 42%, which is equal to Adrien's new salary.
4. Now, we need to find out what x and x + 30% are. We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, so we can set up the equation:

A = x + 30%
L = x + 42%

Solving for x, we get:

x = $30,000

So, Adrien's salary four years ago was $30,000, and his current salary is $65,280 ($30,000 + (30% + 42%))). Similarly, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,000, and her current salary is $42,960 ($30,000 + (30% + 42%))."

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. Therefore, Kael has a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.
In total, Morisette and Kael have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits."
"Response: 40 hours です。
Sadie slept for 8 hours on Monday, so she slept a total of 8 + 2 = 10 hours that day. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less per day, which means she slept 10 - 2 = 8 hours on Tuesday and 10 - 4 = 6 hours on Wednesday. Therefore, her total sleep time for the week was 8 + 6 = 14 hours. Finally, since she slept 1 hour more than those two days, she slept a total of 14 + 1 = 15 hours throughout the week."
"Response: 42 miles です。
Rosie's running speed is given by the equation:
Speed = 10 miles/hour x (time) + 5 miles/hour
Where time is the amount of time Rosie has been running.
In this case, Rosie has been running for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles/hour, which means she has covered 30 miles (10 miles/hour x 3 hours). Then, she slowed down to 5 miles/hour and ran for another 4 hours (7 - 3 = 4 hours), which means she covered an additional 20 miles (5 miles/hour x 4 hours). Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:
Total distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles
So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours."

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The price of a watermelon is 3 times the price of a pepper. So, if a pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs $15 x 3 = $45.
2. An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs. So, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.
3. Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, which cost $45 x 4 = $180.
4. He also needs to buy 20 peppers, which cost $15 x 20 = $300.
5. Finally, he needs to buy 10 oranges, which cost $40 x 10 = $400.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend on the fruits is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880."
"Response: 36000$です。

The hospital makes $36,000 in profit per day by seeing 500 patients each spending an average of 24 minutes with the doctor.

Here's how we calculated it:

* Number of patients seen per day = 500
* Average time spent with each patient = 24 minutes
* Total time spent with all patients per day = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes
* Doctor's fee per patient = $150 (hourly rate) x 24 minutes = $3,600
* Hospital's fee per patient = $200 (hourly rate) x 24 minutes = $4,800
* Profit made by hospital per patient = $3,600 - $4,800 = $900
* Total profit made by hospital per day = 12,000 minutes / 60 = 200 patients x $900 = $180,000

So, the hospital makes $180,000 in profit per day by charging $200 per hour while the doctors charge $150 per hour."

We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs. So, if we substitute this value into the equation above, we get:

4(12) + 22 =?

Solving for the unknown quantity (the number of pink gumballs), we get:

48 + 22 = 70

Therefore, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine."

Lucas's calculation for profit can be shown as follows:
Total Income = Number of Clients x Price per Client x Number of Items needed
= 3 clients x $92 per client x 2 bottles + 1 pack of cloths
= $286
Total Expenses = Cost of Bleach x Number of Bottles + Cost of Cloths x Number of Packs
= $2 x 3 bottles + $5 x 1 pack
= $12 + $5
Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
= $286 - $17
= $40 per week"

Let's use the information given in the problem to find out when Tim will catch up with Steve. We know that Steve lives 3 miles away from the school, which means it takes him 3 x 5 = 15 minutes to walk there. Since Steve is biking, we can assume that he can cover a distance of 3 miles in half an hour (since he can bike at 440 feet per minute). Therefore, it will take Steve 15/2 = 7.5 minutes to reach his house after leaving the school. Now let's calculate how long Tim will take to reach Steve's house. Since Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, it will take him 2 x 5 = 10 minutes to walk there. Since Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, he can cover a distance of 2 miles in half an hour (which is 10 minutes). Therefore, Tim will reach Steve's house in 10 + 7.5 = 17.5 minutes after leaving the school. So the winner will be waiting at their house for 17.5 minutes before the loser finishes the race."

Blake ran 15 times along the entire length of the football field (100 yards). Therefore, he ran a total distance of 100 x 15 = 1500 yards.
Kelly ran from one end zone to the other (40 yards) and back, for a total distance of 40 + 40 = 80 yards. Since Kelly did not run the full length of the field like Blake did, her distance traveled was less than Blake's. Therefore, the winner (Blake) ran 1500 - 80 = 1420 yards more than the loser (Kelly)."

Jessica has three debts with different minimums that she needs to pay each month. The first debt is her student loan, which has a minimum payment of $300 per month. The second debt is her credit card, whose minimum payment is $200 per month. And the third debt is her mortgage, which requires a minimum payment of $500 per month. To determine how much Jessica pays in total each month, we need to calculate the amount she pays for each debt and then add them up.

For the student loan, Jessica pays $300 per month. For the credit card, she pays $200 per month. And for the mortgage, she pays $500 per month. So, in total, Jessica pays $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 per month towards her debts.

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt, she will pay $1000 x 1.5 = $1500 per month. In a year, this means she will pay $1500 x 12 = $18,750 towards her debts."

* Number of potatoes to peel = 60
* Total time to peel all potatoes = 60 x 1.5 = 90 minutes
* Time to cut 1 potato = 5 seconds (as per question)
* Number of potatoes to cut = 60
* Total time to cut all potatoes = 60 x 5 = 300 seconds or 5 minutes
* Total time to prep all potatoes = 90 + 5 = 95 minutes
Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping all 60 potatoes for his family reunion barbecue."

Juan and Carlos sold 20 glasses of lemonade per gallon, which means they sold a total of 400 glasses (20 x 20). Since each glass cost $0.50 to make, the total amount they spent on ingredients is:

$0.50 x 400 = $200

Since they made a profit of $25, the amount they spent on lemons is:

$25 - $200 = -$175

Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $175 on lemons."

* Team A's first runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so they finish their leg in 2:55 (since there are 4 legs in total).
* Team B's first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, so they finish their leg in 3:00.
* Team B's second runner runs 400 meters in 57 seconds, so they finish their leg in 2:49 (since Team B's second runner ran 3 seconds faster than Team A's second runner).
* Team B's third runner runs 400 meters in 54 seconds, so they finish their leg in 2:45 (since Team B's third runner ran 3 seconds faster than Team A's third runner).
* Team B's fourth runner runs 400 meters in 52 seconds, so they finish their leg in 2:43 (since Team B's fourth runner ran 3 seconds faster than Team A's fourth runner).

To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of not rolling an even number in a row. Since there are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) on the die, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of not rolling an even number in a row is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So, the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 is 1/2 x 5/6 = 5/12 = 40%."

"Response: 375 dollarsです。

Mandy and Benedict are friends who lent money to each other. Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed on a monthly interest rate of 2%. After three months, Mandy wants to know how much she needs to pay to Benedict.

To find out the amount that Mandy needs to pay to Benedict, we need to calculate the total amount that Mandy owes including the interest. The formula for calculating the total amount is:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest x Time

In this case, the principal is $100, and the time is 3 months (or 0.5 years). So, the interest is:
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $100 x 2% x 0.5 years
= $30

Now, let's add the interest to the principal to get the total amount that Mandy owes:
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
= $100 + $30
= $130

Therefore, Mandy needs to pay $130 to Benedict after three months."

To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that the trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. So, if he sold x bags, his total profit would be $x \times $30 = $30x. Since the trader's total profit is equal to the cost of transporting the bags ($2 \times x), we can set up the equation: $30x = $2x. Solving for x, we get x = 100. Therefore, the trader sold 100 bags of wheat."

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:
Tickets = $20.25 x 3 = $60.75
Food = $4.50 - $20.25 = $19.75
Total Cost = Tickets + Food = $60.75 + $19.75 = $80.50
2. Now, let's find out how much each friend paid for the rides:
Ride 1 = $33 x 2 = $66
Ride 2 = $33 x 1 = $33
Total Ride Cost = $66 + $33 = $99
3. Since they agreed to split the costs evenly, each friend will pay half of the total cost:
Cost per Friend = Total Cost / Number of Friends = $80.50 / 3 = $26.83
So, each friend paid $26.83 for the day at the fair."

Jerry has 10 red chickens.

根據題中的資料，我們可以知道：

* Jerry has a total of 15 chickens (red + white)
* Red chickens produce 3 eggs/day, so they lay 3 x 15 = 45 eggs/day
* White chickens produce 5 eggs/day, so they lay 5 x 15 = 75 eggs/day
* Jerry collects 42 eggs/day, which is less than the total number of eggs laid by both types of chickens
* Therefore, there are more white chickens than red chickens

Using these facts, we can calculate the number of red chickens as follows:

Number of red chickens = Total number of chickens - Number of white chickens
= 15 - (75 / 2)
= 15 - 37.5
= 10

So, Jerry has 10 red chickens."

If he walks at 3 miles per hour, then it will take him x hours to walk around the entire park. To find x, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time, where distance is the length of the path (in this case, the circumference of the park), rate is the speed at which Gary is walking (in this case, 3 miles per hour), and time is the number of hours he spends walking. So, in this case, distance = 1.5 miles x 6 miles = 9 miles, rate = 3 miles/hour, and time = 9 miles / 3 miles/hour = 3 hours. Therefore, Gary will spend 3 hours walking around the entire park."

"Response: 8 gallon です。

Explanation:
Let's call the amount of water in the small pool x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the amount of water in the big pool is 2x = 16 gallons.
Now, we are told that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so the amount of water in the big pool is now 4x = 32 gallons.
Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool initially, the amount of water in the small pool was x/2 = 4 gallons.
Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is 4 + (32 - 16) = 8 gallons."

Lori wants to buy a $320.00 pair of shoes and a matching belt that is $32.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 an hour. To find out how many hours Lori has to work before she can afford the shoes and belt, we need to divide the cost of the items by her hourly wage.
Cost of shoes + Cost of belt = Total cost
Total cost / Hourly wage = Number of hours worked
In this case, the total cost of the shoes and belt is $352.00 ($320.00 + $32.00). If Lori's hourly wage is $8.00, then the number of hours she needs to work to afford the shoes and belt is:
$352.00 / $8.00 = 160 hours
Therefore, Lori has to work for 160 hours (or approximately 6 weeks at 40 hours per week) to save up enough money to buy the shoes and belt."
"Response:  $1375 です。
Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. If she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, her remaining balance after 12 months can be calculated as follows:

Remaining Balance = Initial Amount + Interest Payments - Total Payments
= $2000 + ($2000 x 10%) - $165 x 12
= $2000 + $200 - $2048
= $1375

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $1375."

Let A = Adrian's age, H = Harriet's age, and Z = Zack's age. We are given that:

A = 3H (Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age)
H = 0.5Z (Harriet is half the age of Zack)

Now, we want to find out what their ages will be in three years. Let's assume that Harriet's current age is 21 years old. Then, her age in three years will be:

H + 3 = 24 (since she will be 24 years old in three years)

We can also calculate Adrian's age in three years using the first equation:

A = 3H
A = 3(24)
A = 72

So, Adrian's age in three years will be 72 years old. Finally, we can calculate Zack's age in three years by dividing his current age by two:

Z = Z / 2
Z = 36

Therefore, the average age of the three people in three years will be:

(72 + 24 + 36) / 3 = 54 years old"

Celine took 90 liters of water from the tank and used it to water her small garden. This means that there were 120 - 90 = 30 liters of water left in the tank after she finished watering her garden. Since the collected rainwater is twice as much as what was left in the tank, the amount of water in the tank now is 30 + (2 x 30) = 360 liters. Therefore, there are 360 liters of water in the tank now."

James currently has 30 Fire-type, 20 Grass-type, and 40 Water-type Pokémon cards. If he loses 8 of the Water-type cards and buys 14 additional Grass-type cards, what is the probability that a randomly selected card from his collection will be a Water-type card?
To calculate this probability, we need to first find out how many Water-type cards James has after losing 8 cards. This means dividing the original number of Water-type cards by the total number of cards he had before the loss. In this case, James had 40 Water-type cards initially, so after losing 8 cards, he has 40 - 8 = 32 Water-type cards left.
Next, we need to find out how many additional Grass-type cards James bought. Since he bought 14 additional cards, this means he now has 40 + 14 = 54 Grass-type cards in total.
Now, let's calculate the probability of selecting a Water-type card at random from James's updated collection:
Probability = Number of Water-type cards / Total number of cards in the collection
= 32 / 94
= 0.34 (or 34%)
So, the probability of selecting a Water-type card at random from James's updated collection is approximately 34%."

Kalinda's rate of adding pieces is 4 pieces/minute, so she can complete 4 x 60 = 240 pieces in one hour. Since her mom can only place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom can complete 240 / 2 = 120 pieces in one hour. Therefore, they will need 120 x 60 = 7200 pieces to complete the 360-piece puzzle. Since they are working together, their combined rate is twice Kalinda's rate, or 8 pieces per minute (4 x 2). So, it will take them 7200 / 8 = 900 minutes, or 15 hours, to complete the puzzle."

Here's how we can calculate it:

Initially, there were 120 baby watermelons on the farm. After two months, Ashlyn visited the farm and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, which is 36 watermelons (30% x 120 = 36). So, the number of watermelons left on the farm was 84 (120 - 36 = 84).

Two weeks later, when Ashlyn returned, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest, which is 61 watermelons (3/4 x 84 = 61). So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 23 (84 - 61 = 23). Therefore, the answer is 56."

Ram used 25 pens to mix the ink and made 40 new pens with the mixed ink. Since each new pen has 5 ml of ink (which is half the amount of an ordinary pen), Ram gets 40 x 5 = 200 ml of ink from the 25 pens he bought. Therefore, he has 200 / 5 = 40 pens left after making the new ones. So, he ends up with 100 + 40 = 140 pens in total."

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so the number of candies that James has is equal to Robert's plus 6. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, John has twice (or 2 x) the number of candies that Robert has. Therefore, if John has 54 candies, he has 2 x 54 = 108 candies in total. So, John has 32 more candies than James (108 - 76 = 32)."

Mike has been a penpal with 5 people for the past year. Each person sends 2 letters per week, and Mike replies to each letter in kind. To calculate how much time Mike spends writing each week, we need to know how long each letter is. Let's assume that each letter is 5 pages long, as mentioned in the problem statement.

Since Mike receives 2 letters from each of his 5 penpals per week, he spends 10 hours per week (5 penpals x 2 letters per penpal x 1 hour per letter) writing responses to his penpals.

Now, let's calculate how many hours Mike spends writing original letters each week. Since he can write a page every 6 minutes, and he spends 10 hours per week writing responses, he spends an additional 38 hours per week (10 hours/week x 3.8 pages/hour) writing new letters.

Therefore, Mike spends a total of 104 hours (10 hours + 38 hours) per week writing letters to his penpals."

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

Question: How many fish are there in each aquarium?

Information given:
There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.
If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, then the number of fish in each aquarium is equal.

From the information provided, we can deduce that the number of fish in each aquarium is either 8 or 16.

So, the answer to the question ""How many fish are there in each aquarium?"" is either 8 or 16."
"Response: 3780 dollars です。

Jean pays $3780 dollars for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot. This calculation is based on the following assumptions:

* The makeup artist charges $250 per hour
* It takes 6 hours per day to apply the makeup (4 days x 6 hours = 24 hours)
* The makeup artist works 4 days a week (5 weeks x 4 days/week = 20 days)
* The total number of hours worked by the makeup artist is 20 days x 24 hours/day = 480 hours
* A 10% discount is given after the movie is finished, so the final price paid by Jean is ($480 x 90%) / 100 = $3780

Therefore, Jean pays $3780 dollars for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot."
