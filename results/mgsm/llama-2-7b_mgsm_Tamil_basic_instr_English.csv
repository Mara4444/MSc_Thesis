Explanation: According to the passage, Jothi's father has 16 watches and he gives one watch every month to his son as an allowance. Therefore, in 1 year, Jothi will receive 16 x 12 = 192 watches from his father. However, the passage also states that Jothi's mother buys him 2 dollar worth of toys every month, which means she spends $24 per year on him (2 x 12 = 24). So, the total amount of money spent by Jothi's parents on him is $192 + $24 = $216 per year."

Explanation:
The cost of the house is 80,000 dollars and the down payment is 20,000 dollars. Therefore, the amount financed is 60,000 dollars (80,000 - 20,000). The interest rate is 10%, which means that the monthly mortgage payment will be 3379.67 dollars (60,000 x 0.10 / 12). Since the borrower has to pay 50,000 dollars as down payment, the total amount paid by him is 240,000 dollars (3379.67 x 12 x 5 = 240,000)."

The first step is to find out how many days are there in total between the two given dates. There are 12 months in a year and each month has 30 days, so the total number of days between the two given dates is:

12 x 30 = 360 days

Now, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since Marichi's birthday. Based on the information provided, it took 4 months for Marichi to grow from 1 foot to 2 feet, which means he grew at a rate of 1/4th of an inch per day. Therefore, the number of days that have passed since his birthday can be calculated as follows:

Days passed = Total number of days - Number of days taken to grow 1 foot
= 360 - 4 x 30
= 360 - 120
= 240 days

So, 240 days have passed since Marichi's birthday."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of balls that Maik has thrown in the first 20 minutes as follows:
Total number of balls = Number of balls thrown per minute x Time duration (in minutes)
= 40 / 20 = 2
So, Maik has thrown 2 balls in the first 20 minutes.
Now, let's find out how many balls Maik threw in the remaining 20 minutes:
Number of balls thrown in remaining time = Total number of balls - Number of balls thrown in first 20 minutes
= 40 - 2 = 38
Since Maik threw 38 balls in the remaining 20 minutes, he threw a total of 40 balls for the entire period of 40 minutes."

Explanation:
The number of years that Jesus lived is given as 300 in the Bible (Luke 3:23). However, this does not take into account his infancy or childhood, which would add several years to his total lifespan. Therefore, we can estimate Jesus' age at death by subtracting his infancy and childhood from his total lifespan.
According to tradition, Jesus was born around 4 BC and died around AD 30. This means he spent approximately 37 years preaching and teaching before his crucifixion. If we subtract these 37 years from his estimated lifespan of 300 years, we get an approximate age of 263 years old when he died."

Explanation:
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of pencils that Kiran sold in one month as follows:
Number of days in a month = 30
Number of pencils sold by Kiran per day = 75
Total number of pencils sold by Kiran in a month = Number of days in a month x Number of pencils sold per day = 30 x 75 = 2250
Since 1/4 of the salespersons did not sell any pencils, the number of salespersons who sold pencils is 3/4 of 2250 = 1587.5 (round off to 1590).
The cost price of each pencil is $2, so the total revenue generated by Kiran from selling pencils in a month is: Total revenue = Number of pencils sold x Cost price of each pencil = 1590 x $2 = $3180."

The person has mentioned that he has invested Rs. 200 in his wife's business and earned Rs. 700 as profit. He also mentions that he has invested Rs. 6000 in jewelry for his wife. To calculate the total amount of money spent by him, we need to add the initial investment of Rs. 200 with the profit earned of Rs. 700, which gives us a total of Rs. 900. Additionally, we need to add the amount spent on jewelry, which is Rs. 6000, giving us a total of Rs. 6900. Therefore, the total amount of money spent by the person is Rs. 8500000 (Eighty-five crore fifty lakh)."

Explanation:
The first variance is calculated as follows:
Variance = (Sum of squared deviations) / (Number of observations - 1)
= ($10 x 5^2 + $10 x 3^2 + $10 x 7^2) / (5 + 3 + 1)
= $60 / 9
= 6.67

Similarly, for the second variance, we have:
Variance = ($10 x 8^2 + $10 x 5^2 + $10 x 4^2) / (8 + 5 + 4)
= $80 / 17
= 4.71

Therefore, the difference between the two variances is:
$6.67 - $4.71 = $2.96
So, the difference between the two values is $2.96."

Now, let's calculate the number of laps required to cover this distance. There are 55 vinadis (rounds) in one kilometer, and since we have already calculated the distance as 1600 meters, we can divide it by 55 to get the number of laps:
1600 / 55 = 29.6 Vinadis
So, it will take approximately 29.6 laps for all the runners to complete the race."

Explanation:
The number of days between the two dates is calculated as follows:
From திங்களன்று (January 1st) to சூ தனது சகோதரியை விட (February 14th) = 45 days
From February 14th to March 13th = 21 days
Therefore, the total number of days between the two dates is 45 + 21 = 66 days."
