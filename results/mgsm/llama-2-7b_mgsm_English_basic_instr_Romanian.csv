"Response: 5 feet  
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the problem: On Monday, the tank had a depth of 17 feet. On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the new depth was 17 + 7 = 24 feet. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the new depth would be (24 / 3) = 8 feet. Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 8 feet."
