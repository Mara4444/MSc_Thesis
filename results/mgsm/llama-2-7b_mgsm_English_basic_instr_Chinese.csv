Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, so it will take her 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download a 200 GB file. However, after 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. This means that Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, so it will now take her twice as long to finish the download. Therefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the file is 2 x 100 = 200 minutes or 3 hours and 20 minutes."

Explanation:  We are given that the program had 60 downloads in the first month and that the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. This means that the program had 60 x 3 = 180 downloads in the second month. Then, we are told that the number of downloads in the third month reduced by 30%. To find out how many downloads the program had in the third month, we can multiply the number of downloads in the second month by 70%, which is the percentage reduction: 180 x 70% = 126 downloads. Therefore, the program had a total of 60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads over the three months."

Carlos will not start earning money from the lemon tree until the third year after planting it. Here's how we can calculate this:
Year 1: No lemons are produced yet, so no income is generated.
Year 2: 7 lemons are produced, but since they were grown in Year 1, there is no income generated.
Year 3: 7 lemons are produced again, and Carlos can sell them for $1.5 each, generating $10.5 worth of income ($1.5 x 7).
Therefore, it takes 3 years for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree."

### Part B: Calculate the total amount of money Jill earns in one year.

Instructions: Use the information provided in the problem to calculate the total amount of money Jill earns in one year. Show your work and explain how you arrived at your answer.

Hint: You will need to use multiplication and addition to solve this problem.

問題:  Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what's her annual salary? 
根據問題, 編寫數字上的答案.  答案: $48,000

Explanation: To find Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply the number of hours she works each week by the number of weeks she works in a year. For teaching, Jill works 35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year. For coaching, Jill works 15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year. Then, we add up the total number of hours Jill works each year: 1750 + 750 = 2500 hours/year. Finally, we multipy the total number of hours worked by her hourly rate for each job to get her annual salary: $20/hour x 2500 hours/year (teaching) = $50,000; $30/hour x 2500 hours/year (coaching) = $75,000. Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $50,000 from teaching and $75,000 from coaching, for a total of $125,000."

Justification: The problem states that Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50 with a 25% discount from the original price. To find the original price, we need to use the formula: Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage). In this case, the discount percentage is 25%, and the discounted price is $19.50. Therefore, the original price of the book can be calculated as follows: Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) = $24.80. So, the original price of the book was $24.80."

Given that there are three friends who gave different answers, we can calculate the average of their guesses as follows:

Friend 1 said 80 jelly beans.
Friend 2 said 20 more than half of Friend 1's answer, which means Friend 2 said 160 (half of 80 + 20).
Friend 3 said 25% more than Friend 1's answer, which means Friend 3 said 100 (25% of 80).

Now, let's add up all these answers and divide by 3 to get the average:

80 + 160 + 100 = 440

So, the average number of jelly beans that the three friends estimated was 440."

Since there is no information about Raymond's jewels, we cannot determine the number of jewels Siobhan has."
"Response: 

Explanation:  The problem states that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. If we assume that this is a constant rate of scoring (i.e., he scores at a steady rate throughout the entire 40 minutes), then we can calculate his total score as follows:

Total score = Rate x Time = 4 x 20 = 80 points

However, the problem also states that in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. This means that if he scored 80 points in the first 20 minutes, he would have scored 100 points in the second 20 minutes (since 25% more is equal to 1.25 times the original value). Therefore, Mike's total score is:

Total score = 80 + (1.25 x 80) = 80 + 100 = 180 points

So, Mike scored a total of 180 points in the 40 minutes."

Explanation:  We are given that John runs 60 miles per week, which means he runs a total of 60 x 7 = 420 miles in a week. Since he runs 3 days a week, we can calculate his daily running distance as follows:

Day 1: 3 hours x 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles/day
Days 2 and 3: Half of Day 1's distance = 20 miles / 2 = 10 miles/day

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 20 + 10 = 30 miles per hour."

"Response: 

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 tapered candles. One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies. If he sells each candle for $2.00 each, then his total revenue from selling 20 candles would be:

20 x $2.00 = $40.00

However, he has already spent $10.00 on supplies (beeswax and wicks), so his net profit would be:

$40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00

Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $30.00."

Day 2 (Tuesday): 2/5 x 4 hours per article = 8 hours
Day 3 (Wednesday): 2 x 8 hours = 16 hours
In total, Meredith spent 20 + 8 + 16 = 44 hours writing articles for those three days."

Explanation:
The information given in the problem is:

* Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before heading to work.
* She stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes.
* At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
* If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, then she must have used up all the notes she brought with her plus some from the package she purchased.

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is equal to the total number of notes she used minus the number she brought with her, which is:

23 - 80 = -57

Since it can't be negative, there are no Post-it notes in the package she purchased."
"Response: 

誤解:  This is a classic problem of proportional reasoning! Let's break it down step by step:

1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So if he bought x blue ties, he also bought 2x red ties.
2. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So if the blue ties cost $40 each, the red ties cost $40 + (50% of $40) = $60 each.
3. John spent $200 on blue ties. So he spent $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.
4. Since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he spent 2 \* 5 = 10 red ties.

So, in total, John spent $200 + ($60 x 10) = $260 on ties."

Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to use the formula:
time = distance / speed

First, let's find the distance he traveled during the trip:
distance = speed x time
= 10 miles/hour x (4 PM - 1 PM)
= 40 miles

Now, let's find the time it took him to get back:
time = distance / speed
= 40 miles / 6 miles/hour
= 6.67 hours

So, it will take Tom approximately 6.67 hours to get back."

根據問題，我們知道：
* 每一個輪車胎被修理時，機師會收取$60。
* 每一個小車胎被修理時，機師會收取$40。
* 星期三，機師repair six truck tires and four car tires。
* 星期四，機師repair twelve car tires but didn't repair any truck tires。

From these information, we can calculate the total amount of money earned by the mechanic on both days as follows:

Day 1 (Thursday):
Total amount earned = Number of truck tires repaired x Repair cost per tire + Number of car tires repaired x Repair cost per tire
= 6 x $60 + 4 x $40
= $360 + $160
= $520

Day 2 (Friday):
Total amount earned = Number of car tires repaired x Repair cost per tire
= 12 x $40
= $480

Now, let's compare the total amount of money earned on both days:

$520 > $480
So, the mechanic earned more money on Day 1 than on Day 2. The difference in revenue between the two days is $40 ($520 - $480)."

Explanation: The problem states that a raspberry bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruit each and 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush. To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add these numbers together.

Clusters of fruit: 6 x 20 = 120 fruit
Individual fruit: 67 fruit
Total number of raspberries: 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries

Therefore, there are 187 raspberries in total on the raspberry bush."
"Response: 

Explanation:  From the problem statement, we know that there are 25 oranges in total, and 1 of them is bad (which means it cannot be considered as ""good""). Additionally, 20% of the oranges are unripe, which means they are not yet ready to eat. The remaining 75% of the oranges are either good or sour. However, since the problem does not specify how many oranges are sour, we cannot determine the number of good oranges. Therefore, the answer is zero."

Janet didn't pay anything for the material or construction of the brooch because the problem states that she bought the material and had it constructed by a jeweler. Therefore, she only paid $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

"Response: 

解釋:  This is a classic problem of annuities, where we need to calculate the present value of future payments. In this case, Marcy's pension is an annuity that pays $50,000/year starting from age 60 (or whenever she retires). The problem asks us to find out how much money Marcy would have to invest today at a certain interest rate to generate $50,000/year in income starting from age 60.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for present value of an annuity:

PV = A / (1 + r)^n

Where:
PV = present value of the annuity
A = amount of each payment ($50,000/year)
r = interest rate per year (which is not given in the problem but should be around 4-5%)
n = number of years until the first payment is made (starting from age 60 - 20 years)

So, if we assume an interest rate of 5%, and Marcy starts receiving her pension payments when she turns 60, then the present value of her pension would be:

PV = $50,000 / (1 + 0.05)^(20) = approximately $879,000

This means that Marcy would need to invest around $879,000 today at an interest rate of 5% to generate $50,000/year in income starting from age 60. However, since the problem does not provide any information about Marcy's current age or the exact start date of her pension, we cannot determine her actual annual pension amount without additional assumptions."

根據問題，Sophia已經traveled 100 miles Since last filling her tank，meaning she had used 4 gallons of gas (since each gallon of gas burns at a rate of 33.7 miles per gallon). To find out how many miles she can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total capacity of her tank. In this case, the total capacity of her tank is 12 gallons, so:
distance = total capacity - amount of gas used
= 12 - 4
= 8 miles
Therefore, Sophia can drive 8 miles on a single tank of gas."

Since each team has 5 players, there are 10 players from each school (5 x 2 = 10). Additionally, each school has sent one coach for each team, so there is 1 coach from each school (4 schools x 1 coach = 4 coaches). Therefore, in total, all 4 schools have sent 10 players and 4 coaches, for a total of 14 people (10 players + 4 coaches)."

根據問題，Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days, and then 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life. Since there are 110 cups in each bag of dog food, we can calculate the number of bags Cecilia will need in the first year as follows:

First 180 days:
Cup of dog food per day = 1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups
Number of bags needed = 180 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1.63 bags (round up to 1 bag)

Rest of the puppy's life:
Cup of dog food per day = 2 cups/day
Number of bags needed = 2 cups/day x 365 days/year = 730 cups
Number of bags needed = 730 cups / 110 cups/bag = 6.6 bags (round up to 7 bags)

Therefore, Cecilia will need 7 bags of dog food in the first year to properly feed her puppy."

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so he does $ \frac{1}{2} $ times as much laundry as Sarah.
Sarah does $ 4 $ times as much laundry as David, so she does $ 4 \times $ times as much laundry as David.
The total amount of laundry done by Sarah is given as $ 400 $ pounds.

So, the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is:
$$ \text {Difference} = \text {Amount of laundry done by Raymond} - \text {Amount of laundry done by David} $$
= $\frac{1}{2}$ $\times$ $400$ - $ \times $ $4 \times $ $400$
= $ \frac{800}{2} $ - $ \frac{3200}{4} $
= $- \frac{2400}{4} $

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is $ - \frac{2400}{4} $."

Grace's weight is 125 pounds, and Alex's weight is 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, if we let G be Grace's weight in pounds, then Alex's weight can be calculated as follows:

Alex's weight = 4G - 2

Now, the combined weight of both Grace and Alex is equal to the sum of their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight

Explanation: According to the problem statement, Sylvie has been working at the company for 5 years as of last December. Therefore, she received a 10% increase in her salary that year, which is $60 (10% of $600). So, her new annual salary would be $660 ($600 + $60). After another 3 years of service, her annual salary would be $729 ($660 x 1.10), not including any additional raises or bonuses."
"Response: 

Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. This means that if Harald sold x copies of his record, Marilyn sold 10x copies of her record.

So, the total number of records sold by both artists is:

88,000 = x + 10x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20x = 88,000

Dividing both sides by 20, we get:

x = 4,400

Therefore, Harald sold 4,400 copies of his record."

誤解:  The problem states that Christina invited 16 friends to her birthday party and needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, which means she needs a total of 12 gift bags (16 x 0.75 = 12). However, the problem also states that 1/4 of attendees don't show up, so only 9 guests actually attend the party (16 / 4 = 9). Therefore, Christina spends $2 x 9 = $18 on gift bags."
"Response: 
Ted doesn't need to bring any potato salad to the picnic because there are not enough dinosaurs attending the picnic to consume all the potato salad he could bring. Even with 20 adult dinosaurs eating 10 lbs each, and 5 children eating half as much as an adult, the total amount of potato salad consumed would still be less than the 30 lbs that Ted brought. Therefore, Ted can bring as much or as little potato salad as he wants to the picnic without worrying about running out."

"Response: 

Justification: According to the problem statement, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. This means that Amy's age is 5 + 2 = 7 years greater than Jackson's age. Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, James's age is 1 year less than Corey's age. Therefore, Jackson's age can be calculated as follows:
Jackson's age = Corey's age - (Amy's age - James's age)
= 10 - (7 - 1)
= 8 years old

Therefore, the answer is 8 years old."

根據提到的信息，我們可以知道：
* 每個 canned tomatoes 容量是 16 ounce (fl oz)。
* each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes。
* the final batch of tomato sauce produced 32 ounce (fl oz) of sauce。

Using this information, we can calculate how many tomatoes Freda used as follows:

Number of tomatoes = Total volume of tomato sauce / Volume of one can of tomatoes
= 32 fl oz / 16 fl oz
= 2

Therefore, Freda used 2 tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce."

Explanation:  Based on the problem statement, we know that some cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes and 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. However, 5 cars took an exit before driving through the traffic jam. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the original number of cars on the motorway minus the number of cars that took an exit. In this case, there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, and 5 cars took an exit, so the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25 cars."

"Response: 

Explanation: The problem states that Henry made twice as many cookies as he did last year, which means he made 2 times 10 = 20 cookies last year. Since he baked 15 more cookies this year than he did last year, the total number of cookies he baked this year is 20 + 15 = 35 cookies. However, the problem also states that he dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, so the final number of cookies he has is 35 - 5 = 30 cookies. Therefore, the answer is 30 cookies."
"Response: 

Explanation:  The cashback reward is given as $$.20 per gallon, not per liter or any other unit. Since the gas station sells gas by the gallon, we need to convert the amount of gas purchased from gallons to liters before calculating the cost with the cashback reward.

So, if someone buys 10 gallons of gas, they will receive a cashback reward of $$.20 x 10 = $2.00. Therefore, their total cost for 10 gallons of gas will be $3.00 - $2.00 = $1.00."

誤解:  This question appears to be nonsensical because it contains multiple contradictory statements. Firstly, it states that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, which implies that Jamal's phone has a larger storage capacity. However, later on, it states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This means that Brittany's phone has a much smaller storage capacity than Jamal's phone. Additionally, the question asks how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, but there is no information provided about the size or resolution of the photograph. Without further context or clarification, it is impossible to provide an accurate answer to this question."

"Response: 

解釋:  This is a classic brain teaser that requires you to think creatively rather than relying on mathematical calculations. The problem states that Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. To find out how many fruits they have in total, we need to consider what ""twice"" means and what ""half"" means.

Twice means that for every apple Morisette brought, Kael brought two apples. So, if Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought 10 apples (2 x 5 = 10).

Half means that for every orange Morisette brought, Kael brought half the number of oranges. So, if Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought 4 oranges (half of 8 = 4).

Now, let's add up the number of fruits each person brought:
Morisette brought 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael brought 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits
In total, they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits!"

Wednesday: 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours
Total sleep time for the week: 8 + 7 + 7 = 22 hours
Therefore, the answer is 22 hours."

根據問題，每天 Hospital sees 500 people, each person spends on average 24 minutes in the hospital. So the total time spent by all patients per day is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes.
Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital:
Hospital charges patients $200/hour, so the total revenue generated per day is 12,000 minutes / 60 (minutes in an hour) = $200,000 per day.
Next, we need to subtract the cost of providing medical services. Let's assume that the doctors charge the hospital $150/hour and the hospital pays them this amount. Therefore, the total cost of providing medical services per day is 12,000 minutes x $150/hour = $180,000 per day.
So, the profit made by the hospital per day is $200,000 - $180,000 = $20,000 per day."

Then it says ""Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female"" which means that 6 out of 9 (or 66%) of the unicorns in Scotland are female. Therefore, there are 6 female unicorns in Scotland. However, since the problem does not mention anything about the remaining unicorns outside of Scotland, we cannot determine how many male or female unicorns there are outside of Scotland. So, the answer is simply ""None""."

60秒 + (3秒 x 3) = 60秒 + 9秒 = 69秒

由於第一支隊伍的每名選手都能夠完成400公分distance 的距離，所以他們的總時間為：
55秒 x 4 = 220秒

相比之下，第二支隊伍的總時間為：
69秒 x 4 = 276秒

因此，第一支隊伍將勝出本場比賽約276秒（或2分46秒）。"

Explanation: The probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on the six-sided die is 1/6 or approximately 17%. To calculate the probability of him rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first die and then rolling another even number on the second die. Since there are three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes for the first die, the probability of rolling an even number on the first die is 3/6 or approximately 50%. Similarly, since there are also three even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outings for the second die, the probability of rolling an even number on the second die is also 3/6 or approximately 50%. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/6) × (3/6) = 9/36 or approximately 25%."

"Response: 

Explanation:  Since the time period is 3 hours and John can collect 2 peaches per minute, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so:

3 hours = 3 x 60 = 180 minutes

Now, we can calculate the total number of peaches collected by multiplying the number of minutes by the rate at which John can collect peaches per minute:

Total peaches collected = Number of minutes x Rate per minute
= 180 x 2
= 360 peaches

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches during the 3-hour period."

Tom plants 10 trees per year, so after 10 years, he has planted a total of 10 x 10 = 100 trees.
However, every year he chooses to cut down 2 trees, which means that after 10 years, he will have cut down a total of 2 x 10 = 20 trees.
So, at the end of 10 years, Tom will have 100 - 20 = 80 trees remaining."

"Response: 8 pens 可以cost $1.50。

解釋: According to the problem statement, a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. So, if a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, then a pen must cost at least $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. Therefore, it is not possible for 8 pens to cost $1.50."

解釋:  According to the problem statement, Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards. Then, in the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 60 cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month, which is 40 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first two months, which is 80 cards. Therefore, the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now is 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 cards."

具體解說:  To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we need to multiply the number of pails he gets in the morning by 5 liters per pail, and then add that amount to the number of pails he gets in the afternoon multiplied by 6 liters per pail.

Morning: 5 pails x 5 liters = 25 liters
Afternoon: 6 pails x 6 liters = 36 liters
Total daily water consumption: 25 + 36 = 61 liters

Therefore, Baldur gets 61 liters of water every day."

Explanation:  The problem states that Michael rode his bike 5 times a week and covered 25 kilometers each time for 4 weeks, which means he covered a total distance of 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers during those 4 weeks. Then, the problem states that after that, he reduced the number of times he rode his bike per week to 2 times, but increased the distance he covered each time to 60 kilometers. This means he covered a total distance of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers during the next 3 weeks. Therefore, the total distance Michael covered is 125 + 120 = 245 kilometers."

"Response: 

誤解:  This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle that requires you to think creatively rather than relying on straightforward calculations. The key to solving this puzzle is to understand the relationship between the number of red chickens and the total number of eggs produced by both types of chickens.

The puzzle states that every day Jerry collects 42 eggs, which means that the total number of eggs collected per week is 42 x 7 = 294 eggs. Since there are twice as many white chickens as red chickens, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is twice the number of eggs produced by the red chickens. Therefore, if the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, then the white chickens produce 6 eggs per day (2 x 3 = 6).

Now, we need to find out how many red chickens Jerry has based on the information provided in the puzzle. Let's assume that the total number of chickens Jerry has is R, where R is an integer. We know that the number of white chickens is 2R, since there are twice as many white chickens as red chickens.

We also know that the total number of eggs produced by all the chickens is equal to the number of eggs collected by Jerry per day multiplied by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Therefore, the total number of eggs produced by all the chickens is 7R + 14 (since the red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and the white chickens produce 6 eggs per day).

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the following equation:

7R + 14 = 42

Solving for R, we get:

R = 10

Therefore, Jerry has 10 red chickens."

"Response: 

Explanation:  The problem states that Jerry has two pools, and both of them are losing water through leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. It also says that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, which means the big pool had 2 x 4 = 8 gallons of water. Then it says that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, which means the big pool has 4 x 4 = 16 gallons of water. However, there is no information given about how much water the small pool originally had or how much water it currently has, so we cannot determine how much water the small pool has now."

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. This means that she will have to pay back $2200 ($2000 + (10% x $2000)).
If she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, her total payment will be:
$165 x 12 = $2040
So, after making these payments, Janeth's remaining balance will be:
$2200 - $2040 = $160
Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $160."

Explanation:  The problem states that Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. This means that there are 30 liters of water left in the tank after she used some of it (120 - 90 = 30). However, the problem also states that she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. Therefore, if she collected 60 liters of rainwater (twice 30), there would be 90 liters of water left in the tank after she collected the rainwater (30 + 60 = 90)."

"Response: 

James is counting his Pokémon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?

Let's first calculate the total number of cards James has after losing 8 water types:

Total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 - 8 = 72

Now let's calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card:

Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) x 100
= (40 / 72) x 100
= 56%

So, there is a 56% chance of picking a water type card if James randomly picks one from his collection."

Mark doesn't pay anything for the cars themselves because he is buying them for his company. The $20,000 per car is the cost of the cars to him. However, as the owner of the company, he will have to pay taxes on the profit made from selling the cars. Let's assume that the company makes a profit of $10,000 ($20,000 x 50%) after selling all 12 cars. So Mark pays $1000 in taxes on the profit. Therefore, the total amount Mark pays is:

$20,000 (cost of cars) + $10,000 (tax on profit) = $30,000"

"Response: 

Explanation:  We are given that Mary is two years younger than Joan and Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, we can write an equation based on this information as follows:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5

Now, we know that Jessa is 20 years old, so we can substitute this value into one of the equations to find Mary's age. However, since Mary is two years younger than Joan, Joan's age must be greater than or equal to Mary's age by at least two years. Therefore, we have:

Jessa's age = 20
Joan's age >= Mary's age + 2

We cannot determine the exact age of any of the girls without additional information."

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so the number of candies James has is equal to Robert's plus 6.
John has twice as many candies as Robert, so the number of candies John has is equal to 2 times Robert's plus 0 (since John already has twice as many candies as Robert).
If John has 54 candies, then he has 54 + 0 = 54 more candies than Robert.
So, John has 32 more candies than James (54 - 6 = 48)."

Mike is a penpal with 5 people and he stops being penpals with 2 of them. Let's assume the number of weeks they were penpals is w.

The total number of letters sent by all 7 penpals (including Mike) per week is 10 pages \* 7 people = 70 pages. Since Mike stopped being penpals with 2 people, the number of pages he sends decreases to 70 / 5 = 14 pages per week.

Since Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, he spends 14 pages / 6 minutes = 230 minutes per week on writing letters. Therefore, he spends 230 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3.83 hours per week on writing letters."

Griffin had 24 French fries to start with.
Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with 19.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 10 more fries (2 x 10 = 20).
So now there are 19 + 20 = 39 fries left.
Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is an unknown amount. Let's say it's x fries.
Then Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - x = 3 fries.
Now there are 39 - 3 = 36 fries left.
But the problem says that Griffin had 27 fries at the end, so Ginger must have given him x + 7 = 27 fries."
"Response: 

Explanation:  Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up the following equation:

Number of snails in Aquarium A = 2 x Number of fish in Aquarium A + Number of snails in Aquarium B

Similarly, we can write an equation for Aquarium B:

Number of snails in Aquarium B = 2 x Number of fish in Aquarium B + Number of snails in Aquarium A

Now, we know that there are 4 snails in Aquarium A and 32 snails in Aquarium B. Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:

4 = 2(x) + 32

Solving for x, we find that there are 8 fish in Aquarium A. Similarly, substituting the value of 4 into the second equation, we find that there are 16 fish in Aquarium B. Therefore, the answer to the question is that there are no fish in either aquarium."
