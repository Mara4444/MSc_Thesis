Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, it will take Carlos 6 years to begin earning money from his tree. This is calculated by subtracting the initial cost of planting the tree (90 dollars) from the total revenue he will generate over those 6 years ($49 + $49 + $49 + $49 + $49 + $49 = $294). Therefore, Carlos will break even after 6 years and start making a profit thereafter."

Response: 6479.32 dollars. Explanation: To calculate the profit, we need to use the formula for expected value of a portfolio: E(X) = x1P(X1) + x2P(X2), where X is either Nakit or Electronic devices, and xi is the probability of choosing that item. The probabilities are given in the problem as 0.6 for Nakit and 0.4 for Electronic devices. Therefore, the expected value of the portfolio is: E(X) = (0.6 \* $5000) + (0.4 \* $8000) = $6479.32.

"Response: 47 grams
Explanation: To calculate how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie goal and the number of calories in one serving of chips, we need to divide the total number of calories in the bag by the number of servings in the bag. In this case, if the bag contains 300g of chips and there are 5 portions per bag, then the number of calories in each portion is 60 (300/5). If your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories, that means you have 200 calories remaining for the day. Therefore, you can eat up to 47 grams of chips (200 / 60) without exceeding your daily calorie limit."

Explanation: If Charlie sells each piece of honey for $2, he will make $2 x 20 = $40 from selling 20 candles. However, if he uses one kilogram of honey to make 10 candles, and each candle costs him $10 to produce (including the cost of the wax), then he will have spent $10 x 10 = $100 on producing those 10 candles. So his profit would be $40 - $100 = $-60."

"Response: 236 dollars. 
Explanation: To calculate the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year, we need to find out how much she was charged in each half of the year and then add those amounts together. In the first half of the year, the company charged Aleena $140 per month, which means she was charged a total of $140 x 6 = $840. In the second half of the year, the company charged her $10% less than the previous amount, which is $79.20 (10% of $840). Therefore, the total amount that Aleena paid for the streaming service throughout the year is $840 + $79.20 = $919.20 or $236 dollars."

"Response: 200
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, there were 175 diamonds and 35 rubies found in the treasure chest. Since each ruby is worth less than half as much as a diamond, the total value of the rubies is 35 x (1/2) = 17.5 diamans. Therefore, the total number of diamonds in the treasure chest is 175 + 17.5 = 192.5 diamonds. Finally, since there are twice as many smaragds as rubies, the number of smaragds is 2 x 17 = 34. So, the final answer is 192.5 + 34 = 200 diamonds in the sandbox."

Gene has been on vacation for 4 times in his life, and each time he takes a new block from an old t-shirt. Since he started taking blocks at age 23, and now he is 34 years old, there are 11 years of collecting blocks. Therefore, the total number of blocks collected by Gene is:
11 x (number of years) = 11 x 11 = 121 blocks.
However, since Gene has already used one block to make each of the four red rows, the actual number of remaining blocks is:
121 - 4 = 117 blocks."

Explanation:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The number of dogs is 60 times smaller than the total number of cats and dogs.
* There are twice as many cats as dogs.
* If there are two cats for every dog, then the number of cats is doubled to account for both cats per dog.

Using these facts, we can calculate the total number of animals in the kennel as follows:

Total number of cats = 60 x 2 = 120
Total number of dogs = 60 / 2 = 30
Total number of lambs = 120 + 30 = 90

Therefore, there are 90 lambs (including both cats and dogs) in the kennel."

"Response: 18 roll-ups
Explanation: To find out how many roll-ups they both ate in total, we need to calculate the average number of roll-ups each person ate. We know that Beatrice ate 24 roll-ups and Marcel ate 3 roll-ups. So, Beatrice ate 8 times more than Marcel (24 - 3 = 21). Therefore, the total number of roll-ups they both ate is:

Beatrice's share = 21 x 8 = 168
Marcel's share = 3 x 8 = 24
Total = Beatrice's share + Marcel's share = 168 + 24 = 192
So, they both ate 192 roll-ups in total."
Response: 3.5 liters (L) of water were taken in by the boat per 10 meters it moved towards the shore. Since Julia took 16 seconds to cover 20 meters, she traveled at a speed of 20/16 = 1.25 meters per second (m/s). The volume of water that entered the boat during this time is given by the product of the speed and distance traveled: V = x m/s × t seconds = 1.25 m/s × 0.20 m = 0.25 cubic meters (m³). Therefore, when Julia reached the shore, there were 0.25 m³ of water in the boat.

Explanation: Let's analyze the given information:
Jamalov telefon can receive 6 times more images than Brittany. This means that if Brittany's phone can hold X images, Jamalov's phone can hold 6X images.
The largest number of images that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times greater than the number of birds in Jamalov's picture. So, if there are Y birds in Jamalov's picture, Brittany's phone can hold at most 50Y images.
If Jamalov's phone can hold 1800 images, then the number of birds in his picture is:
1800 = 6(6X) + (50Y)
Simplifying and solving for Y, we get:
Y = 320
Therefore, there are 320 birds in Jamalov's picture."

* Dženi puts a mark on one-third of the letters she needs to stamp.

Now, let's calculate the number of letters Dženi needed to stamp before she started helping her mother:

Number of letters Dženi needed to stamp = Total number of letters - Number of letters already stamped
= 60 - 30
= 30

Therefore, there were 30 letters in the gomila when Dženi began helping her mother."

Explanation:
Lubenica costs three times as much as each paprika, so one lubenica costs 3 \* 15 = 45 euros.
Naranja costs 5 less than each paprika, so one narancha costs 15 - 5 = 10 euros.
Dillon wants to buy 4 lubenices, which cost 45 euros x 4 = 180 euros.
He also wants to buy 20 paprikas, which cost 15 euros x 20 = 300 euros.
Finally, he wants to buy 10 naranches, which cost 10 euros x 10 = 100 euros.

Johnny has three boxes of Legos with different numbers of blocks inside each box. The first box contains 500 blocks, the second box contains 3 times as many blocks (or 1500 blocks), and the third box contains 1/4 of the total number of blocks (or 625 blocks). To find out how many blocks Johnny will collect in total, we can multiply the number of blocks in each box by the number of boxes he has collected:
500 + 1500 + 625 = 2750 blocks
Therefore, Johnny will collect 2750 blocks in total if he picks up all the Lego bricks from the three boxes."

"Response: 15 minutes
Explanation:
Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, and Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. To find out how long it will take for them to reach home, we need to convert their speeds into miles per hour.

Steve's speed is 440 / 5 = 88 miles per hour (mph)
Tim's speed is 264 / 5 = 53 mph

Now, let's calculate the time it will take each of them to reach home:

For Steve: distance = 3 miles x speed = 3 x 88 = 254 minutes or 4 hours 24 minutes
For Tim: distance = 3 km x speed = 3 x 53 = 159 minutes or 2 hours 39 minutes

Since Tim takes less time than Steve to reach home, he will arrive first. Therefore, the winner of the race is Tim."

Blake ran 15 times forward and backward along the football field, covering a distance of 100 yards each time. Kelly ran once forward and backward, covering a distance of 40 yards. To determine who ran farther, we need to add up the distances that Blake covered in his runs.

Blake's total distance = 15 x 100 yards = 1500 yards

Kelly's total distance = 40 + (-40) = 80 yards

Therefore, Blake ran a total distance of 1500 yards, while Kelly ran a total distance of 80 yards. So, Blake is the winner and has run farther than Kelly by a distance of 1420 yards (1500 - 80)."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Sandra has ordered four times more red roses than white carnations. If she has ordered 200 red Calla lilies that are five times larger than the number of white carnations, then the total number of roses and Calla lilies that Sandra needs by 17 pm is:
Total number of roses = 4 x (number of white carnations) = 4 x 100 = 400
Total number of Calla lilies = 200 + 5 x (number of white carnations) = 200 + 5 x 100 = 900
Therefore, Fred must deliver 480 flowers (400 roses + 900 Calla lilies) by 17 pm to satisfy Sandra's order."

"Response: 12 seconds
Explanation:
The first team has each member running 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so their total time for one lap is 55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 280 seconds.
Since the second team's first runner takes 60 seconds to run 400 meters, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one, we can calculate their total time as follows:
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 292 seconds
Therefore, the difference in times between the two teams is 12 seconds (292 - 280)."

To calculate how many times she needs to cut grass to save enough money for the items, we need to divide the total cost of the items by the amount she earns per time she cuts grass. Since she earns $5 per time she cuts grass, it will take her 6 times (or 6 x $5 = $30) to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."

"Response: 45 hours
Explanation: To calculate how many hours Lori needs to work before she can afford the shoes and accessory, we need to first calculate her total monthly income from her part-time job. Her hourly wage is $8, so her monthly income is $8 x 4 = $32. Then, we subtract the cost of the shoes ($320) and the accessory ($32) from her monthly income to find out how many hours she needs to work to afford them: $32 - $352 = -$319. Since it's not possible to have a negative number of hours worked, we know that Lori needs to work at least 45 hours to afford the shoes and accessory."

* 3/5 of the remaining students (i.e., 666 - 300 = 366) left through exit B.
* The remaining students (i.e., 366 + 300 = 666) left through exit C.

Therefore, the total number of students who left through exit C is 666. Since this is the only option left, we can conclude that 270 students left through exit C."

Explanation: According to the passage, Ginger gave Griffin ""a shake"" of her pomfrits, which means she gave him 5 pomfrits. Since Billy took double the number of pomfrits that Kyle did, and Kyle took 5 pomfrits, then Billy took 10 pomfrits (double 5). Therefore, the total number of pomfrits taken by Billy, Kyle, and Ginger is 10 + 5 = 15. Since Griffin had 27 krumpirića at the end, he must have received 15 - 27 = -12 krumpirića from Ginger."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's call the number of fish in the first aquarium x and the number of fish in the second aquarium y. Since the difference between the number of fish in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium, we can write:
x - y = 2(y)
Now, we are given that there are 4 fish in the first aquarium and 32 fish in the second aquarium, so we can substitute these values into the equation above:
4 - 32 = 2(8)
Solving for x, we get:
x = 16
Therefore, there are 16 fish in the first aquarium and 32 fish in the second aquarium."

Jeansova šminkerka naplaćuje joj 250 dolara na sat, which means she will pay $250 per hour. Since she needs to do her makeup for 6 hours a day (or 42 hours in total) during the 5-week filming period, her total cost for the entire project would be:
$250/hour x 42 hours = $10,500
However, since the šminker gives her a 10% discount at the end of the project, Jean's final bill would be:
$10,500 x 90% = $9,450
Therefore, Jean pays a total of $9,450 for the makeup services throughout the filming process."
