Response:  To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day for a flock of 20 chickens, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that every day, Wendi feeds her chickens 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per bird, so for a flock of 20 chickens, she will need to feed them 60 cups of feed (3 x 20 = 60). Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 60 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

Response:  John's total distance traveled = (speed x time) + (time spent in standstill traffic) / 2. In this case, John's total distance traveled would be: Total distance = (60 mph x 3 hours) + (2 hours x 0 mph) / 2 = 180 miles + 1 hour = 181 miles. So John is 181 miles away from his destination after 4 hours of driving.
Response:  Eliza's total earnings for the week can be calculated as follows: Regular hourly rate x number of regular hours worked = $10 x 40 = $400 Overtime pay = $400 x 1.2 = $480 Total earnings = $400 + $480 = $880
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
* In the second month, the program had 3 x 60 = 180 downloads (three times as many as in the first month).
* In the third month, the program had 180 - 30% = 126 downloads (reduced by 30%).

So, the total number of downloads for the program over the three months is:
60 + 180 + 126 = 466 downloads."
"Response:  The total cost of all the pastries is equal to the sum of their prices. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this fact:
T = D + M + C
Where T is the total cost, D is the cost of donuts (in dollars per dozen), M is the cost of mini cupcakes (in dollars per dozen), and C is the cost of mini cheesecakes (in dollars per dozen).
Now let's substitute the values given in the problem into the equation:
T = 3D + 2M + 6C
Substituting the values given in the problem:
T = 3(68) + 2(80) + 6(55)
= 194 + 160 + 330
= 684
Therefore, the total cost of all the pastries is $684."

Response:  Marissa needs to walk at an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the remaining distance of 8 miles. To find out how long it will take her to cover this distance, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, time = 8 miles / 4 miles/hour = 2 hours. So, Marissa will take 2 hours to cover the remaining distance.
"Response:  The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the spilled orange drink from the total volume of both drinks. So, if we assume that the spilled orange drink is 1 liter, then the remaining 23 liters would be:

Remaining orange drink = Total orange drink - Spilled orange drink = 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters

And the remaining pineapple drink would be:

Remaining pineapple drink = Total pineapple drink - Spilled pineapple drink = 15 liters - 0 liters (since no pineapple drink was spilled) = 15 liters

So, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters would be:

Total water = Remaining orange drink + Remaining pineapple drink = 9 liters + 15 liters = 24 liters"

"Response:  The sum of the number of points scored in each half is equal to the total number of points scored by Mike. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:

Points scored in first 20 minutes = 40 / 2 = 20
Points scored in second 20 minutes = (20 x 1.25) + 20 = 37.5 + 20 = 57.5
Total points scored by Mike = 20 + 57.5 = 77.5
Therefore, Mike scored a total of 77.5 points during his 40-minute game of ping pong."

Response:  John's average speed for his 3-day running schedule is 20 minutes per mile.
"Response:  Let's assume that Dana runs for x hours out of the total of 6 hours. Since she can run 4 times faster than she can walk, her rate of travel while running is 4x miles/hour. Therefore, during the x hours she spent running, she traveled a distance of 4x miles.

Since she walked for (6 - x) hours, her rate of travel while walking is 1/2 x miles/hour. Therefore, during these hours she traveled a distance of (1/2 x) miles.

The total distance traveled by Dana is equal to the sum of the distances she traveled while running and walking:

Distance = Distance ran + Distance walked
= 4x + (1/2 x)
= 5x miles

Therefore, if Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she will travel 5x miles in 6 hours."
Response:  Brandon's iPhone is eight years old.
"Response:  To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand to hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to use the information given in the problem.

First, let's calculate the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the gold javelin without the gemstone. Since the javelin can be thrown for a distance of 400 feet when Polly is not holding the gemstone, and the dragon's flames are within a distance of 1000 feet, we know that the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone is equal to 1000 - 400 = 600 feet.

Now, let's find out how much farther Polly can throw the javelin when she holds the gemstone. According to the problem, the javelin can be thrown three times farther when Polly holds the gemstone. So, if Polly throws the javelin from a distance of x feet without the gemstone, then when she holds the gemstone, she can throw it from a distance of 3x feet.

Since the dragon's flames are within a distance of 1000 feet, we want to find the maximum distance from which Polly can throw the javelin and still hit the dragon. Let's call this distance y feet. Then, we can set up the following equation:

y + 600 = 3x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 900

So, when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin from a distance of 900 feet and still hit the dragon. Therefore, the answer to the question is 900 feet."
Response:  The number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is equal to the total number of pieces of pie minus the number of pieces left on the buffet table at the end of the evening. In this case, there were 5 pies originally, and since 8 pieces were cut from each pie, that means a total of 40 pieces (5 x 8 = 40) were available for the guests to take. Since there were 14 pieces left at the end of the evening, we can deduce that 26 pieces (40 - 14 = 26) were taken by the guests.
Response:  If you want to stay within your daily calorie budget of 2000 calories after consuming 1800 calories, then you could have up to 400 calories from the bag of chips (250 x 2 = 500). Therefore, you would be able to eat approximately 500 grams of chips based on their nutritional information.

Response:  The number of Post-it notes in the package is equal to the total number of Post-it notes minus the number of Post-it notes used by Candice. In this case, the total number of Post-it notes is 80 (the number Candice put in her purse) plus 23 (the number remaining after using them all). Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package is 80 + 23 = 103.

Response:  Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour when he is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  After that, he travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour.  To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate.  In this case, the distance is 5 miles (since he starts and ends at the same point), and the rate is 6 miles per hour for the return trip.  So, the time it takes him to get back is: Time = 5 miles / 6 miles/hour = 0.83 hours or 50 minutes.
Response: Uriah has 15 pounds of items in his backpack that he wants to remove. Comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, so if he removes 30 comic books, they will take up 7.5 pounds (30 x 1/4 = 7.5). Toys weigh 1/2 pound each, so if he removes 30 toys, they will take up 15 pounds (30 x 1/2 = 15). Therefore, he needs to remove 7.5 - 15 = -7.5 pounds of toys from his backpack.

"Response: 240.

Answer: 240 boxes.

Explanation:
The total weight of the truck (driver + empty truck) is 3755 pounds, which is less than the weight limit of the bridge (5000 pounds). Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:

Maximum load = Weight limit - Total weight of truck
= 5000 - 3755
= 1245 pounds

Since each box weighs 15 pounds, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is:

Maximum load / Box weight
= 1245 / 15
= 83 boxes

However, since you cannot have a fraction of a box, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 240 boxes."

Response:  The answer is 134 raspberries in total.
"Response:  The number of good oranges in the basket is equal to the total number of oranges minus the number of bad oranges plus the number of unripe oranges minus the number of sour oranges. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Number of bad oranges + Number of unripe oranges - Number of sour oranges
Now let's substitute the values given in the problem:
Total number of oranges = 25 (since there are 25 oranges in the basket)
Number of bad oranges = 1 (since there is one bad orange in the basket)
Number of unripe oranges = 4 (since 20% of the oranges are unripe, and there are 25 oranges in the basket)
Number of sour oranges = 2 (since there are two sour oranges in the basket)
Therefore, we can plug these values into the equation:
Number of good oranges = 25 - 1 + 4 - 2 = 18
So, there are 18 good oranges in the basket."
Response:  Janet paid a total of $1300 for the brooch.
"Response:  Marcy's annual pension can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the present value of Marcy's pension at the end of Year 20:
Present Value = $50,000 / (1 + 5%)^20 = $786,972
2. Calculate the annual pension amount starting from Year 21:
Annual Pension = Present Value / 5% = $786,972 / 5% = $157,394
3. Repeat step 2 for each subsequent year until Marcy retires after 30 years:
Year 22: Annual Pension = $157,394 / 5% = $31,478
Year 23: Annual Pension = $31,478 / 5% = $6,295
Year 24: Annual Pension = $6,295 / 5% = $1,258
Year 25: Annual Pension = $1,258 / 5% = $251
Year 26: Annual Pension = $251 / 5% = $50.20
Year 27: Annual Pension = $50.20 / 5% = $10.04
Year 28: Annual Pension = $10.04 / 5% = $2.00
Year 29: Annual Pension = $2.00 / 5% = $0.40
Year 30: Annual Pension = $0.40 / 5% = $0.08
Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of working for the same company is $0.08."
Response:  The total amount Aleena pays for the streaming service is equal to the initial amount plus the discounted amount from the second half of the year. To find out how much Aleena has paid in total, we need to add these two amounts together. So, the answer is $140 + ($140 x 90%) = $256. Therefore, by the end of the year, Aleena has paid a total of $256 for the streaming service.
Response:  Sophia can drive 80 miles on a single tank of gas. To find this answer, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank, so she has used 1/3 of her total fuel capacity (12 gallons / 3 = 4 gallons). Therefore, she still has 9 gallons of fuel left in her tank. Since she needs 4 gallons to fill her tank again, she must have driven an additional 5 gallons (9 - 4 = 5) after running out of gas. So, Sophia drove 5 + 100 = 105 miles on a single tank of gas.
Response:  Jim watches TV for 10 hours per week and reads for 5 hours per week.  Therefore, over the course of 4 weeks, Jim will have spent a total of 40 hours watching TV (10 x 4) and 20 hours reading (5 x 4).
"Response:  To find out how many people have been sent by each school, we need to add up the number of players on each team from each school. Let's do that:
Girls' teams: School A - 5 players + School B - 5 players = 10 players Girls' teams: School C - 5 players + School D - 5 players = 10 players
Boys' teams: School A - 5 players + School B - 5 players = 10 players Boys' teams: School C - 5 players + School D - 5 players = 10 players
Coaches: 1 coach from School A + 1 coach from School B + 1 coach from School C + 1 coach from School D = 4 coaches
In total, there are 10 players + 4 coaches = 14 people who have been sent by all of the schools."
Response:  The treasure hunter found a total of 205 gems in the chest.
Response:  Let x be the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is 2x. The total number of students is 60 + (5x - 5), where 5x represents the number of male students and -5 represents the number of female students. We can simplify this expression by combining like terms: 60 + 5x - 5 = 2x + 10. Solving for x gives us x = 8. Therefore, there are 8 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

Answer: 42 seconds"
"Response:  Let's start by using the information that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, if we let D be the number of dogs and C be the number of cats, we can write:

D + C = 12 (less than)

Now, we know that there are twice as many cats as dogs, so we can write:

C = 2D

Substituting this equation into the first one, we get:

D + 2D = 12
3D = 12
D = 4

So, there are 4 dogs in the neighborhood. Now, we know that the number of cats is twice the number of dogs, so there are 8 cats in the neighborhood. And finally, since there are 12 fewer rabbits than the combined number of dogs and cats, there are 4 rabbits in the neighborhood. Therefore, the answer is 4 + 8 + 4 = 16 pets in total in the neighborhood."
Response: 1) Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 40 (2/5) are boys. 2) Out of the remaining 160 students, 80 (2/3) are girls who are in the Girl Scouts. Therefore, there are 80 - 20 = 60 girls who are not in the Girl Scouts.

So, 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.
Response:  Mary will remain with 36 potted plants after giving away 18 to friends and family.
Response:  The total number of doorbell rings is equal to the sum of the number of doorbell rings made by each of Jerome's four friends. Since we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times and the second friend pressed it 1/4 times more than the first friend (i.e., 20 + (1/4) \* 20 = 35), the third friend pressed it 10 times more than the second friend (i.e., 35 + (10) \* 20 = 70). Finally, since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the total number of doorbell rings is equal to 60 + 70 + 35 + 20 = 195. Therefore, there were 195 doorbell rings in total.
Response:  To find out how many pages Solo needs to read each day, we can divide the total number of pages he needs to read by the number of days he has left to finish his reading. In this case, Solo needs to read 69 pages (4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 69). Since he already read 15 pages on Monday, he has 54 pages left to read (69 - 15 = 54). So, on average, Solo needs to read 54/5 = 10.8 pages per day.

If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later? 

Answer:
Let Adrien's original salary be A, then Lylah's is (1/3)A = $20000.
Four years later, Adrien's salary is A + 40% of A = $56000.
Lylah's salary after 4 years is ($20000 \times 1.4) = $28000.
So, the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah after 4 years is $56000 + $28000 = $84000."
Response:  Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and there are 30 sheets of paper on each pad. So, he uses 2 x 2 = 4 pads of paper per week. And since there are 7 days in a week, he uses 4 x 7 = 28 pads of paper per month. Therefore, Miguel uses 28 sheets of paper per month.

Response:  The total amount of money Dillon will spend for all the fruits is $3 × 4 = $12 for watermelons. For peppers, it's $15 × 20 = $300. And for oranges, it's $10 - $5 = $5. So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $12 + $300 + $5 = $307.
"Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes from each visit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost for each visit. Then, we can subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit.
Total Revenue = Number of Visits x Charge per Visit
= 500 visitors/day x $200/hour
= $100,000/day
Total Cost = Number of Visits x Doctor's Charge per Visit + Hospital Charge per Visit
= 500 visitors/day x $150/hour + $200/hour
= $75,000/day
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
= $100,000 - $75,000
= $25,000/day
So, the hospital makes a daily profit of $25,000 from seeing 500 people a day."
Response: 30 elves remain at the end of the day.

Response:  We are given two pieces of information: the number of questions on each test (75 and 100) and the time it took Mark to complete each test (5 questions per hour). To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to divide the total number of questions on both tests by the time it took him to complete them. So, if Mark took 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one, then he left 100 - 75 = 25 questions incomplete.

"Response:  If Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day and works for 5 days a week at $10 per hour, then he will earn:

$10/hour x 2 hours/day = $20/day
$20/day x 5 days/week = $100/week

Therefore, if Jordan spends his video game time working instead of playing games, he will earn $100 more per week than he currently does."
Response:  The total cost of the items bought by John was $15 + $9 + $9 + $9 + $12 = $64.  After applying the 10% tax, the total cost becomes $64 x 1.1 = $70. So, everything cost John $70 in total.

Response:  John can harvest 1000 pineapples within a year.
Response:  Johnny picked up 1500 blocks in total (500 + 3 x 500 = 1500).
Response:  The number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is equal to twice the number of bees that left the hive during the first 6 hours plus half the number of bees that left the hive during the second 6 hours. So, if we let x be the number of bees that left the hive during the first 6 hours, then the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is 2x + (1/2)x = 3x. Therefore, there were 3x bees that returned to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
Response:  Brittany's mom gave the cashier $10.
Response:  James has 48 Facebook friends.
Response:  Steve bikes faster than Tim on a skateboard, so it will take longer for him to reach his house after the race. Therefore, the winner (Steve) will not arrive at his house until Tim has finished the race. Since Tim can go 264 feet per minute on his skateboard, it will take him 1/264 of an hour or approximately 5 minutes to complete the race. So, the winner (Steve) will wait approximately 5 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.
"Response:  $10.50.

Explanation:
Shawnda made $10.50 from inflating bicycle tires on the first day. This calculation is based on the information provided in the problem:

* Number of bicycles with two tires each = 5 x 2 = 10 tires
* Cost per tire = $0.25
* Total cost of inflating 10 tires = $10 (10 x $0.25)
* Number of tricycles with three tires each = 3 x 3 = 9 tires
* Cost per tire = $0.25
* Total cost of inflating 9 tires = $8.75 (9 x $0.25)
* Number of unicyclists = 1
* Cost per tire = $0.25
* Total cost of inflating 1 tire = $0.25

Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $10.50 from inflating bicycle tires on the first day."

Response:  The total length of all the baked goods put end to end would be 300 + 120 + 60 = 580 feet.
Response:  To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we must first calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over that period. We can do this by multiplying the number of bananas each species needs per month by the number of months they will be receiving them. For example, if the gorillas need 400 bananas per month, then they will need 800 bananas (400 x 2) over the course of 2 months. Similarly, the baboons will need 50 bananas (100 / 2 = 50) times 2 = 100 bananas over 2 months. Therefore, the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo is: 800 + 100 = 900 bananas. So, the zookeeper needs to order 900 bananas to last for 2 months.
Response:  The distance between the start and finish lines of the football field is 100 yards. Since Kelly ran to the 40-yard line and back, her total distance was 80 yards (40 yards + 40 yards). Therefore, the winner, Blake, ran a total distance of 100 yards - 80 yards = 20 yards more than the loser, Kelly.

Response:  After 36 months, the price of a bag of marbles will be $48.
Response:  The total value of the toys is equal to the sum of their prices. Since each red car costs $4, then the total price of 5 red cars is $20 ($4 x 5). Similarly, since there are 3 action figures, their total price is $15 ($5 x 3). And finally, the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car, so its price is also $15 ($5 + $4 + $4). Therefore, the total value of all toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $60.
Response:  Jackie will have more money by hiring the accountant. To calculate this, we need to subtract the cost of the accountant from the value of the time saved by doing the taxes herself. In this case, the cost of the accountant is $90 and the value of the time saved is $35/hour x 3 hours = $105. So, by hiring the accountant, Jackie will save $105 - $90 = $15 more than she would if she did her own taxes.

Response:  Billy will need to peel 60 potatoes, which will take him approximately 1 minute and 10 seconds (60 x 1.5 = 90). To cut them up, he will need to spend an additional 3 minutes and 20 seconds (60 x 5 = 300), for a total of 4 minutes and 10 seconds (90 + 300 = 490). So, it will take Billy approximately 4 minutes and 10 seconds to prep all 60 potatoes.
Response:  To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that they sold 20 glasses of lemonade per gallon and that each glass cost $0.50. So, if they sold a total of 100 glasses (which is equal to 5 gallons), then they sold 5 x 20 = 100 glasses. Now, we can multiply the number of glasses by the cost of each glass to find out how much they spent on lemons: $3 x 100 = $300. Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $300 on lemons.
Response:  The number of girls on the Chinese team is equal to the total number of girls in all teams minus the number of girls on the Japanese team. Therefore, the answer is 180 - 80 = 100.

Response:  Total number of crabs = (Rani's crabs + Monic's crabs) - Bo's crabs. In this case, Rani has 15 crabs, Monic has 9 crabs, and Bo has 40 crabs. Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is: Total number of crabs = (15 + 9) - 40 = 26 crabs.
Response:  Lloyd earned $40 for the first two weeks (10$/hour x 5 hours + 10$/hour x 8 hours).
"Response:  The candidate who received 3/4 of the votes is X. Let A be the number of votes that X received. Since X received 3/4 of the votes, we can write:
A = (3/4) \* 80 = 60
So, the number of votes that the other candidate (let's call him Y) received is:
Y = 80 - 60 = 20
Therefore, the number of votes that Y received is 20."
Response: 4 x 4 = 16 red roses must be delivered by 5 pm to meet Sandra's demands.
Response:  Jean is 32 years old.
"Response:  Let's analyze the situation for both teams:

Team A: Each member runs 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds, so their total time for the relay is:

4 x 55 = 220 seconds

Team B: The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, which means they have a disadvantage of 10 seconds compared to Team A. Then, each subsequent runner runs 400 meters in 3 seconds less than the previous runner, so the times for each runner are:

Runner 2: 60 + (3 - 3) = 63 seconds
Runner 3: 63 + (3 - 3) = 66 seconds
Runner 4: 66 + (3 - 3) = 70 seconds

The total time for Team B is therefore:

4 x 70 = 280 seconds

Now we can see who wins: Team A finishes with a time of 220 seconds, while Team B finishes with a time of 280 seconds, which means Team A wins by 60 seconds."
"Response:  Jerry's probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 4/6 = 2/3. His probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 1/6. Therefore, the difference between these probabilities is:
(2/3 - 1/6) × 100% = 66.67%. So, Jerry is 66.67% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than he is to roll two even numbers in a row."
Response:  Jenna и ея мама выбрали капусту из их фермы. Jenna выбрала half as many капуст as her mom. Если ее мама выбрала 20 капуст, то как много капуст они оба выбрали?
Response:  We can let x be the number of rats in each cage. Since there are 3 cages with rats, we know that the total number of rats in all three cages is 3x. Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total amount of straw given to the rats is 3x \* 6 = 18. Similarly, since there are 10 cages of hamsters, the total number of hamsters is 10x, and they get 5 pieces of straw each, so the total amount of straw given to the hamsters is 10x \* 5 = 50. Finally, since there are 20 rabbits in the pen, the total number of rabbits is 20, and they get 20 pieces of straw each, so the total amount of straw given to the rabbits is 20 \* 20 = 400. Therefore, we have the following system of equations: 3x + 10x + 20 = 160. Solving for x, we find that x = 20. So there are 20 rats in each cage.

"Response:  The trader sold 13 bags of wheat. To find out why, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The trader paid $20 per bag for the wheat, so he spent a total of $20 x 5 = $100 on the wheat itself.
2. It cost $2 per bag to transport the wheat from the farm to the warehouse, so the total cost per bag is now $20 + $2 = $22 per bag.
3. The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each. This means that he sold a total of $400 / $30 = 13 bags of wheat.

Therefore, the trader sold 13 bags of wheat."
Response:  The total cost of the trip was $69.75 ($20.25 x 3 = $61 + $4.50 - $33 x 2 = $69.75). So each friend paid $23.00 ($69.75 / 3 = $23.00).
Response:  John collects 60 peaches in 3 hours (2 peaches/minute x 3 hours = 60 peaches).
Response:  To calculate the amount of insects that the ducks need per day, we can use the formula: Total weight of insects needed = Number of ducks x Weight of one duck x Time period (in days) For example, if there are ten ducks and each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week, then the total weight of insects needed in one week is: 10 ducks x 3.5 pounds/duck x 7 days/week = 245 pounds of insects In order to determine how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we can divide the total weight of insects needed by the number of days in the time period: 245 pounds / 7 days = 34.9 pounds of insects per day So, the ducks need approximately 34.9 pounds of insects per day to survive.

Response:  Sara has $10 saved before she starts babysitting, so she has a total of $10 + ($5 x 4) = $10 + $20 = $30. To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she earns per time: $30 / $4 = 7.5 times. So Sara must mow the lawn 7.5 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes.

Response:  The number of minutes it takes for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle can be found by multiplying their individual rates together. Since Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, she will need 960 minutes (or 16 hours) to complete the entire puzzle alone. However, since her mom can only add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her contribution will take twice as long. Therefore, her mom will need 1920 minutes (or 32 hours) to complete her portion of the puzzle. To find out how many total hours it will take them to complete the puzzle, we simply add up these two times: 16 + 32 = 48 hours. So, it will take Kalinda and her mom approximately 48 hours to complete the 360-piece puzzle.
Response:  After two weeks, 70% of the original number of watermelons were left on the farm, which means that 30% of the original number of watermelons were already harvested. So, if there were initially 120 watermelons, then after two weeks, there would be 84 watermelons left on the farm (120 x 0.7 = 84). Therefore, the answer is 36 watermelons (84 - 44 = 36).
Response:  The total cost of the cars is $240,000 ($20,000 x 12).  The tax on the cars is $24,000 (10% of $240,000).  The registration fee for each car is $1,200 ($1,000 + $200), so the total registration fee is $14,400 ($1,200 x 12).  Therefore, the total amount that Mark pays for everything is $258,400 ($240,000 + $24,000 + $14,400).
Response:  Kylie collects 10 shells on Tuesday.
Response:  The ratio of bugs to ants is 1:2. Therefore, if there are twice as many ants as bugs, then the total number of insects in the garden is equal to twice the number of ants. So, if there are 50 ants, then the total number of insects in the garden is 50 x 2 = 100 insects.

"Response:  We are given that there were 1000 students in the school hall. Let's call the number of students who left through each entrance as x, y, and z respectively (x + y + z = 1000).
We know that 30% of the students left through exit A, so the number of students who left through exit A is 30% of 1000, or 300 students.
We also know that 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, so the number of students who left through exit B is 3/5 of (1000 - 300), or 600 students.
Finally, we know that the rest of the students left through exit C, so the number of students who left through exit C is (1000 - 300 - 600) = 100 students.
Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is 100."
Response:  John has 32 more candies than James.
Response:  The total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read at the end is equal to the sum of the number of books owned by each of them initially plus twice the number of books they have in common.

Response:  If Mike spends 1 hour per day writing to his pen pals, then he will spend 7 days \* 24 hours = 168 hours per week on writing. Since he writes 2 letters per day, he will have written a total of 336 letters per week (2 letters/day \* 7 days/week). Therefore, the answer is 168 hours per week.
Response:  If Jason has 1000 minutes per month and uses 15 minutes per day for calls with his boss, then he has used 450 minutes (15 x 30) in the first 30 days of the month. So, he has 600 minutes remaining (1000 - 450 = 600).
Response:  Ginger gave Griffin 9 fries.
Response:  Let's call the number of fish in Aquarium A x. Then, we know that the number of snails in Aquarium A is 4 times x, so the number of snails in Aquarium A is 4x. Similarly, the number of fish in Aquarium B is also x, since they have the same number of fish. Therefore, the number of snails in Aquarium B is also 4x. Now, we are given that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. So, we can write an equation based on this information: 4x - 2x = 32 - 4x. Solving for x, we get x = 16. Therefore, there are 16 fish in each aquarium.

"Response:  Let's start by using the information that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday. So if her sister ate x cookies on Monday, Sue ate 4x cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2(4x) = 8x cookies.
Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, so her total cookie consumption was 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.
Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 18 x 200 = 3600 calories more than her sister."
