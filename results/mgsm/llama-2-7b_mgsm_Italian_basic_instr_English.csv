Explanation:
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 sheep (2 x 40 = 80). Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 80 + 32 = 112 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 80 + 112 = 192. Since Seattle has 20 sheep, the remaining 172 sheep are shared among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle."

Explanation:
The program had 60 downloads in its first month, which means it averaged 20 downloads per day (60 / 30 days). In the second month, the number of downloads was three times higher than the average from the first month, so it had 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. Finally, in the third month, there were 60 - 30 = 30 fewer downloads, for a total of 150 downloads (180 - 30). Therefore, the program had 180 downloads in total over the three months."

Explanation:
The total cost of planting the lemon tree is $90. Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons that can be sold for $1.5 each. The total revenue from selling lemons per year is therefore $10.5 (7 lemons x $1.5 each).
To calculate how long it will take to break even, we need to divide the total cost of planting the tree by the annual revenue:
$90 / $10.5 = 8.6 years
Therefore, it will take approximately 4 years before the lemon tree starts generating enough income to cover its costs and begin making a profit."

Response:  The correct answer is 16 points. Explanation: In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points, which means he averaged 0.2 points per minute (4/20). In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the previous period, which is equal to 0.2 x 1.25 = 0.25 points per minute. Therefore, his total score after 40 minutes of playing table tennis is: 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4 points per minute x 40 minutes = 16 points.

Then, he used this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, which cost him a total of $160 ($8 x $20). This leaves him with $35 ($195 - $160), which is greater than the amount he spent on the video games. Therefore, John still has 9 sets of Lego left."
Response: 35 kilometers per week.
"Response: 30 miles
Explanation:
Dana can run four times faster than he can walk, so his running speed is 4x = 16 km/h (since he can walk at 2 km/h). Since he can jump to half of his running speed, his jumping speed is 2x = 8 km/h. Therefore, he can cover 5 km in 1 hour if he spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking. To find out how many miles he can cover in 6 hours, we need to convert the distance from kilometers to miles using the conversion factor of 1.60934 kilometers per mile. So, in 6 hours, he will have covered:
Time spent running = 1/3 \* 6 = 2 hours
Distance covered while running = Speed x Time = 16 km/h x 2 hours = 32 km
Distance covered while walking = Total time - Time spent running = 6 hours - 2 hours = 4 hours
Total distance covered = Distance covered while running + Distance covered while walking = 32 km + 4 km = 36 km
Therefore, Dana can cover 36 miles in 6 hours."

* On Monday, she wrote 5 articles and spent 4 hours each = 20 hours
* On Tuesday, she wrote 3 times more articles than on Monday (since it's 2/5 times more) = 15 articles x 4 hours each = 60 hours
* On Wednesday, she doubled the number of articles written on Tuesday = 2 x 60 hours = 120 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in those three days is: 20 + 60 + 120 = 180 hours."

Since each comic book weighs 1.5 chili and each toy weighs 1.5 chili, if he removes 30 comics, he will need to remove 4.5 toys (30 / 1.5 = 4.5) from his bag to bring it down to 10 chili."
Response: 380 dollars. Explanation: On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires for trucks and charged $60 each, resulting in total revenue of $360 ($60 x 6 = $360). For the 4 car tires repaired on Thursday, the mechanic charged $40 each, resulting in additional revenue of $160 ($40 x 4 = $160). Therefore, the total revenue for Thursday was $520 ($360 + $160). On Friday, the mechanic did not repair any truck tires, but he repaired 12 car tires at $40 each, resulting in additional revenue of $480 ($40 x 12 = $480). So, the total revenue for the two days was $900 ($520 + $480).

The number of good oranges is equal to the total number of oranges minus the number of bad oranges and the number of immature oranges. Therefore, we can calculate it as follows:
Total number of oranges = 25
Bad oranges = 1 (as stated in the question)
Immature oranges = 20% of 25 = 5

Cecilia must give her puppy one tazza of food every day for the first 180 days, which is equal to 6 months. Since there are 110 tazze in each bag of dog food, she will need 4 bags of food during this period (110 / 27 = 4).
After the first year, Cecilia must give her puppy 2 tazze of food every day, which means she will need 2 x 110 = 220 bags of food over the rest of its life. Therefore, Cecilia will consume 4 + 220 = 224 bags of dog food in total."

The passage states that ""Alle auto si sono allineate sull'autostrada."" This means that initially, there were 30 cars lined up on the highway. Then, within the first 15 minutes of congestion, some cars passed through, leaving 20 cars remaining in the line. Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the bottleneck during this time is 20 - 15 = 5 cars. Since five cars took an exit to avoid passing through the traffic, the total number of cars that passed through the bottleneck is 5 + 20 = 25 cars. So, the answer is 25."

"Response:  $68,000

Explanation:
Let's assume that Adrien and Lylah's initial salaries were $A$ and $L$, respectively. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write:

$$A = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{30}{100}}L = 1.3L$$

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary is:

$$A' = A \times \frac{1 + \frac{40}{100}}{1 + \frac{30}{100}} = 1.3L \times \frac{1 + \frac{40}{100}}{1 + \frac{30}{100}} = 1.72L$$

Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So her new salary is:

$$L' = L \times \frac{1 + \frac{40}{100}}{1 + \frac{30}{100}} = 1.3L \times \frac{1 + \frac{40}{100}}{1 + \frac{30}{100}} = 1.72L$$

Now, we are given that Adrien's current salary is $40,000. Therefore, we can calculate Lylah's current salary as follows:

$$L = \frac{L' - A'}{1 - \frac{A'}{L'}} = \frac{(1.72L) - (1.3L)}{1 - \frac{1.3L}{1.72L}} = \boxed{68,000}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is $68,000."

Explanation:
The number of patients seen by the hospital each day is given as 500. Since each patient spends an average of 24 minutes with the doctor, the total time spent by all patients at the hospital in a day is:

Time = Number of patients x Average time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes

Since the doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour and the hospital charges the patients $200 per hour, the revenue generated by the hospital from these visits can be calculated as follows:

Revenue = Time x Rate = 12,000 x ($150/hour) + 12,000 x ($200/hour) = $375,000/day"

Response: 68 dollars. Explanation: To calculate the total cost of all items, we need to multiply each item by its price and then add up all these amounts. For food items (latte, eggs), the tax rate is 10%, so we multiply the price by 1.10. For non-food items (lamp, cups, traps), the tax rate is also 10%. Therefore, the total cost is: Latte x $2 = $2 + Eggs x $3 = $9 + Lamp x $3 = $15 + Cups x $3 = $15 + Traps x $4 = $28 = $68.

Explanation:
The first clue is that one of the boxes has three times as many pieces as the other box, which means it has 3 x 500 = 1500 pieces. The third box has a quarter of the number of pieces, so it has 1500 / 4 = 375 pieces. Therefore, in total, Johnny has collected 500 + 1500 + 375 = 1875 pieces of Legos."

Explanation:
Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, which means there were 15 bees left in the hive (30 - 15 = 15). Then, half of those bees returned to the hive within the next 6 hours, which is 7 bees (15 / 2 = 7). So, the total number of bees that returned to the hive within the last 6 hours was 7 + 15 = 22 bees."

Explanation:  When Dave first received the bag of French fries, he had eaten 14 of them before the seagull stole the rest. So, when the seagull landed and ate half of the remaining fries, there were 7 (half of 14) fries left. Then, three pigeons came and ate 3 more fries each, leaving 2 (3 x 3 = 6). Finally, a rat took two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is equal to 4 (two-thirds of 2), leaving only 1 fry. Therefore, when Dave bought the bag of French fries, there were 14 fries in total."

"Response:  $127
Explanation:  To calculate the amount of money that Jackie will have if she assumes the accountant, we need to subtract the cost of doing her taxes herself from the cost of hiring an accountant. The cost of doing her taxes herself is $35 per hour x 3 hours = $105. The cost of hiring an accountant is $90. Therefore, the difference between these two amounts is $105 - $90 = $15. So, Jackie will have $15 more if she assumes the accountant."

"Response: 30 minutes
Explanation:
To determine how long it will take Billy to prepare all 60 patates for the family barbecue, we need to calculate the time it takes him to prepare one patate and then multiply that by 60.
According to the question, Billy spends approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds (or 1.5 minutes) to buccle and cut one patate. Therefore, to prepare 60 patates, he will need:
Time = Number of patates x Time per patate
= 60 x 1.5
= 90 minutes
So, it will take Billy approximately 90 minutes to prepare all 60 patates for the family barbecue."

"Response: 20 seconds
Explanation:  To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the race. For the faster team, the first runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so their total time is 55 + (next three runners x 3 seconds each) = 178 seconds. For the slower team, the first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, so their total time is 60 + (next three runners x 3 seconds each) = 208 seconds. Therefore, the faster team will win by 30 seconds (208 - 178)."

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that Jerry is rolling a fair six-sided die. The probability of getting an odd number on the first roll is $ \frac{1}{2} $. Since Jerry has to roll two dice in a row, the probability of getting an odd number on both rolls is $\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} $. Therefore, the probability of landing on a number greater than 3 on at least one of the two rolls is $ 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{0.67} $."

Response: 16 fettes of cheese. Explanation: According to the question, Carl used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich he made, and he made 5 sandwiches this week. Therefore, he used a total of 10 slices of cheese (2 x 5 = 10). Additionally, he used 3 more slices of cheese for his omelets (3 x 1 = 3), bringing the total number of slices of cheese used to 13 (10 + 3 = 13). Finally, he used 4 more slices of cheese for his pasta dish (4 x 1 = 4), resulting in a total of 17 slices of cheese used throughout the week (13 + 4 = 17).

"Response:  B = 86 + (89 + 71 + 92 + 100) / 5 - 89 = 93

Solution:
Let Brinley's score in the sixth test be x. Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the calculation of his overall average, we need to find out what score he needs to achieve in the sixth test to get an overall average of 93.

We know that Brinley has already taken five tests and obtained the following scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To calculate his overall average, we divide the total score by the number of tests he has taken:

Total score = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 459
Number of tests = 5

So, Brinley's overall average is:

Overall average = Total score / Number of tests = 459 / 5 = 93

Now, let's find out what score Brinley needs to achieve in the sixth test to have an overall average of 93:

If Brinley gets x points in the sixth test, his overall average will be:

Overall average = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) / 6 - 89

Substituting x = 93, we get:

93 = (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 93) / 6 - 89

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

x = 86 + (89 + 71 + 92 + 100) / 5 - 89 = 93

Therefore, Brinley needs to obtain at least 86 points in the sixth test to have an overall average of 93."

"Response: 6 times
Explanation: To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate her total earnings from doing chores and babysitting. Based on the information provided, she will earn $5 x 4 = $20 from babysitting and $4 x 4 = $16 from mowing the lawn. Therefore, her total earnings are $20 + $16 = $36. Since the cost of the jacket is $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, Sara needs to save up enough money to cover these costs plus some extra for other expenses. So, she must mow the lawn 36 / 20 = 6 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Response: 6
Explanation: Let's assume that there are x polli rossi. Since the polli rossi produce 3 uova per day and Jerry collects 42 uova per day, we can write the following equation:

3x = 42
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 14
So, there are 14 polli rossi."

Explanation: According to the passage, there were 100 customers when Sloane was at the store for $1. The next day, there were 50 more customers than the previous day, so there were 150 customers.

"Response: 20 gallons
Explanation:
Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Jerry has two pools, one large and one small.
* Both pools are losing water at the rate of 4 gallons per minute.
* 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
* Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

From these statements, we can deduce that the amount of water in the small pool has decreased by 8 gallons (since it had twice as much water as the large pool, and now the large pool has four times as much water). Therefore, the current volume of water in the small pool is 20 gallons (8 gallons x 2 = 16 gallons + 4 gallons initial volume = 20 gallons)."
"Response: 16 hours
Explanation: To calculate the number of hours that Lori needs to work before she can afford the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost of the items by her hourly wage.

Explanation:
Mike has been writing letters with five friends at a rate of two pages per week. Since he stopped being friends with two of them, he now writes two pages to each of the remaining three friends.
Since Mike can write one page in 6 minutes, and there are 4 weeks in a month, he spends 4 x 6 = 24 minutes per day writing letters.
Therefore, Mike spends 24 minutes/day x 7 days/week = 168 minutes/week writing letters.
Converting this to hours, we get:
168 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 10.83 hours/week
So, Mike spends approximately 10 hours per week writing letters."

"Response:  $37,500.

Explanation:
To calculate how much Jean has paid to the makeup artist, we need to multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly rate and then subtract the discount given by the makeup artist.

Number of hours worked = 6 hours/day x 4 days/week x 5 weeks = 120 hours
Hourly rate = $250/hour
Discount = $250/hour x 10% = $25/hour
Total amount paid = $120 x $250/hour - $25/hour = $37,500
Therefore, Jean has paid $37,500 to the makeup artist for the five-week project."
