解釋:
Jill each teaches 30 minutes per session and charges $20 per session. If she teaches for 50 weeks in a year (including weekends), she will have taught a total of 1,500 sessions (50 x 30). Therefore, her total income from teaching is:

$20 x 1,500 = $30,000

As a coach, Jill also earns money by training students who are preparing to become teachers. Each student pays $15 per session, and there are 15 sessions per week. If Jill trains 30 students per week (which is the maximum number allowed by law), then she will have trained a total of 450 students per year (30 x 15 x 50). Therefore, her total income from coaching is:

$15 x 450 = $67,500

Adding both sources of income, Jill's total annual income is:

$30,000 + $67,500 = $97,500

Therefore, Jill's annual salary as a bilingual teacher and coach is approximately $97,500."

"Response: 37.5

解釋:

根據問題，我們知道裏面有三個果。第一個果有80隻，第二個果有20多個（不是完全相同），第三個果比第一個多出25%。

因此，我們可以使用等分法來計算每個果的數量。設置一個常数k，表示每個果的數量。

$$ \text{Number of fruits in the first basket} = k \times 80 $$
$$ \text{Number of fruits in the second basket} = k \times (20 + 25\% \times 80) $$
$$ \text{Number of fruits in the third basket} = k \times (1 - 25\% \times 80) $$

其中，$k$ 是一個常数，代表每個果的數量。

現在，我們需要Solve for $k$.

$$ \frac{\text{Total number of fruits}}{\text{Number of fruits in the first basket}} = \frac{k \times 80}{k \times 80} = 1 $$

$$ \frac{\text{Total number of fruits}}{\text{Number of fruits in the second basket}} = \frac{k \times (20 + 25\% \times 80)}{k \times 80} = 1 + \frac{25\%}{100} = 1.25 $$

$$ \frac{\text{Total number of fruits}}{\text{Number of fruits in the third basket}} = \frac{k \times (1 - 25\% \times 80)}{k \times 80} = 1 - \frac{25\%}{100} = 0.75 $$

現在，我們可以 Solve for $k$.

"Response: 25分鐘。

解釋：
John runs every weekday for 3 days, and he ran a total of 100 kilometers in one week. Let's assume that each day he runs for x hours.

On the first day, he ran for 3 hours, so his distance run on the first day is 3x km.
On the second day, he ran for (1/2)x hours, so his distance run on the second day is (1/2)x km.
Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the average distance run per day as follows:
Average distance = Total distance / Number of days = 100 km / 7 days = 14 km/day
Now, let's find out how fast John runs by dividing the distance he ran on each day by the time he spent running:
Fastest speed = Distance / Time = 14 km/day / 3 hours/day = 4.67 km/hour or 25 minutes/km
Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 25 minutes per kilometer."

"Response:  $37.50

解釋:  Sheila bought five smartphones at $150 each, and she wants to know how much she will have to pay every month for the next three months. The interest rate is 2% per month. To calculate the total amount Sheila has to pay in a given time period, we can use the formula: Total Amount = Principal x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal is $150 (the cost of one smartphone), the rate is 2%/month (which means the interest rate is 24%/year), and the time is 3 months. So, the total amount Sheila has to pay is: Total Amount = $150 x 24%/year x 3 months = $37.50/month."

"Response: 27
Explanation:

Let's assume that the initial 15 minutes have passed and there are now 27 cars on the highway. Since each car travels at a constant speed of $v$ km/h, we can use the formula for average velocity to find the total distance traveled by all cars during this time:

Total distance = Average velocity x Time
= $v \times 15$ min
= $\frac{v}{2} \times 30$ cars

Since there were initially 30 cars, and 27 cars have passed through the intersection in the last 15 minutes, we can calculate the number of cars that have stopped or slowed down using the following equation:

Number of cars stopping or slowing down = Total number of cars - Number of cars passing through intersection
= $30 - 27$
= $3$

Therefore, out of the original 30 cars, 3 cars have stopped or slowed down."

Next, the third friend called the door six times more than the second friend, which is equivalent to $6 \times 80 = 480$ times.

Finally, if the fourth friend knocked the door sixty times, that would be equivalent to $60$ times.

Therefore, the total number of times the friends knocked the door is:

$20 + 80 + 480 + 60 = 1020$

On the other hand, Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, which is a distance of 7,840 feet (2 x 5,280 = 7,840). Since he can skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, it will take him 29 minutes to reach the school (7,840 / 264 = 29).

Sally Thirtytwo year old 的年齡 = 32

"Response:  A) 27 秒鐘。
Explanation:
Let's analyze the given information:

1. The first team has 8 members and each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
2. The second team has 4 members and the first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
3. Each subsequent runner of the second team must run faster than the previous one by 3 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the time taken by each team to complete 400 meters:

Team 1: 8 members x 55 seconds/person = 440 seconds (or 7 minutes 20 seconds)
Team 2: 4 members x 60 seconds/person + (7 - 3) seconds/person = 440 seconds (or 7 minutes 20 seconds)

Since both teams take the same time to complete 400 meters, we can conclude that neither team is faster than the other. Therefore, the answer is (A) 27 seconds."

在本問題中，我哋需要計算每隻老鼠的平均得到的草。首先，我哋知道每組老鼠共有 six 塊 grass，而且每隻子只能接收 five 塊 grass。因此，每組老鼠可以得到的最大 grass 是 six / 5 = 12 塊。

現在，我哋知道了全部 Old Mouse 共有 160 塊 grass，但是商店不會使用任何草。因此，Old Mouse 可以分享畀各自的 child 20 塊 grass。每個 Child Mouse 可以得到的最大 grass 是 20 / 5 = 4 塊。

最後，我哋需要計算每隻 Old Mouse 的平均得到的草。由於 each Old Mouse 可以得到的最大 grass 是 12 塊，因此每隻 Old Mouse 的平均得到的草是 12 / 3 = 4 塊。

"Response: 400 

解釋:  First, we need to calculate the total weight of all the pumpkins needed for the plan. There are 100 pounds of pumpkin required, so each pumpkin needs to be approximately 0.4 pounds (or 168 grams).

Next, we need to determine how many pumpkins can fit in a single delivery truck. Let's assume that each truck can hold about 20 boxes of pumpkins, and each box holds about 50 pounds of pumpkins. Therefore, one truck can carry approximately 1000 pounds of pumpkins (or 453 kilograms).

Now, let's divide the total weight of pumpkins required by the capacity of each truck to get an estimate of the number of truckloads needed:

400 pounds / 1000 pounds per truck = 0.4 truckloads

So, it would take approximately 0.4 truckloads of pumpkins to deliver 400 pounds of pumpkins to 40 restaurants in a city with 40 restaurants."

4. 第三個月，Elaine收集了兩個月之間的明信片，這些明信片都是以前兩個月的卡牌組合而成的，因此它們的數量等於以前兩個月的卡牌數量的 twice ，即 2 x 20 = 40 張。

Explanation:
Let's assume that the number of red chickens is x. Since each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs laid by the white chickens is 5y, where y is the number of white chickens.
We know that the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42, so we can set up the equation:
3x + 5y = 42
Now, we are given that there are more than twice as many white chickens as red chickens, so we can write:
y > 2x
Substituting this inequality into the previous equation gives us:
3x + 5(2x) = 42
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
x = 10
Therefore, there are 10 red chickens."

2. Each pomegranate tree can produce 3 pomegranates per week.
