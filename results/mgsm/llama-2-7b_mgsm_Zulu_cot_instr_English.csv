Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between January 1st and June 30th. We know that January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29 days (depending on leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, and June has 30 days. Therefore, the total number of days from January 1st to June 30th is: 31 + 28/29 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 151 days.
Response: 1. Ingubo ithatha (4) + imicu (3) = 7 2. Emibili (5) + eluhlaza (6) = 11 3. Okwesibhakabhaka (8) + nengxenye (9) = 17 4. Yemicu (7) + emhlophe (4) = 11 5. Amabhawodi (6) + amangaki (5) = 11  So, the total number of words in the question is 11.
Response:  We are given that $U$ has $30,000$ shares and wants to invest $50,000$. If we want to know how much of the company's stock they can buy with their budget, we need to calculate $150\%$ of $50,000$, which is equal to $75,000$. So, $U$ can buy $75,000$ shares of the company's stock with their budget.
Response:  We are given that ugijima is equal to 60 and amathathu is equal to 30. So we can write:  Ugijima = 60 Amathathu = 30 Now, let's find out what ugijima means in terms of amathathu. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by amathathu:  Ugijima / Amathathu = 60 / 30 = 2 So, ugijima means 2 times amathathu.
Response:  We are given that nsuku zonke (the number of people) is equal to uWendi wondla (the number of Wendi's children). In other words, nsuku zonke = uWendi wondla. Now, we are asked to find out how many children Wendi has if she has 15 sons and 25 daughters. So, we can write:  nsuku zonke = uWendi wondla = 15 + 25 = 40. Therefore, Wendi has 40 children.
Response:  We are given that in year R15, the number of students who passed with at least one subject was 80%. Now we want to find out how many students passed with at least two subjects. To do this, we need to calculate the percentage of students who passed with exactly two subjects. So, let's use the formula: (Number of students passing with exactly two subjects / Total number of students) x 100 = Percentage of students passing with exactly two subjects. In this case, the total number of students is 240, and the number of students passing with exactly two subjects is 32. Therefore, the percentage of students passing with exactly two subjects is: (32/240) x 100 = 13.33%.
Response:  We are given three cities - Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. We need to find out which city has the highest number of inhabitants between these three cities.  To do this, we can use the information provided in the question. According to the question, the population of Toulouse is 467,000, while that of Charleston is 135,000, and that of Seattle is 725,000.  Therefore, the highest number of inhabitants among these three cities belongs to Seattle, with a population of 725,000. So, the answer is (D) Seattle.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of data that can be stored in Ucarla's hard drive which is 200GB. Then, we need to subtract the percentage of space used which is 40%. So, the remaining space available for storing new files would be 80GB (200GB - 40%). Now, let's assume that Ucarla wants to store a file that is 2GB in size. To find out how many files this much space can accommodate, we divide the total available space by the size of each file. Therefore, Ucarla can accommodate approximately 40 files with a size of 2GB each (80GB / 2GB = 40).
Response:  We are given that John can drive at a speed of 60 mph for 6 hours without stopping to rest. This means he has covered a distance of $ \boxed{d = 60 \times 6 = 360} $ miles.  Now, we are asked how far he will have traveled in total if he drives at a constant speed of 30 mph for 4 hours and then at a constant speed of 80 mph for 2 hours.  To find out the total distance traveled, we need to add up the distances traveled during each period of constant speed.  During the first 4 hours when he drove at 30 mph, he traveled a distance of $\boxed{d_1 = 30 \times 4 = 120} $ miles.  And during the last 2 hours when he drove at 80 mph, he traveled a distance of $\boxed{d_2 = 80 \times 2 = 160} $ miles. Therefore, the total distance traveled by John is: $\boxed{d = d_1 + d_2 = 120 + 160 = 280} $ miles.
Response:  Eliza earns $10 per hour and works for 40 hours in a week. Her total income for that week would be:  $10 x 40 = $400. Now let's calculate how much she spends on transportation. She spends $20 on transportation every day, which means she spends $20 x 7 days = $140 per week on transportation. So her total expenses for the week are: $400 - $140 = $260. Therefore, Eliza has $260 left after paying for transportation.
Response:  We are given that there are 60 people who have been infected with COVID-19 and we want to calculate the percentage of those who have recovered. We know that out of these 60 people, 30 have already recovered. So, the percentage of people who have recovered is (30/60) x 100 = 50%.
Response:  We have three types of cakes: cupcakes (with 3 layers), cheesecakes (with 6 layers), and regular cakes (with 80 layers). So, we need to calculate how many layers each type has in total. For cupcakes, there are 3 layers x 3 = 9 layers. For cheesecakes, there are 6 layers x 2 = 12 layers. And for regular cakes, there are 80 layers / 10 = 8 layers per tier. Therefore, the total number of layers is 9 + 12 + 8 = 39 layers.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that Utshala spent R300 on something and then received change of R1.50. So, Utshala paid R300 + R1.50 = R301.50. Now, we are asked how much money did Utshala have left after buying something worth R7. Since Utshala had R301.50 - R7 = R294.50 left after buying something worth R7.
"Response:  We are given that Melanie is in a relationship with someone who has HIV/AIDS and she wants to know how long it will take for her to get infected if they have unprotected sex every day without using condoms or other forms of protection. To calculate this, we need to use some basic math and science principles. Here's how we can do it:
1. The risk of transmission: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of HIV transmission through vaginal sex is about 0.05% per act, provided there is no exposure to semen from the infected partner. This means that if Melanie and her partner have unprotected sex every day, the chances of Melanie getting infected increase exponentially over time due to repeated exposure to the virus.
2. Calculating the number of acts: If Melanie and her partner have unprotected sex every day, then the total number of sexual acts between them would be equal to the number of days they have been together multiplied by the number of times they have had sex per day. For example, if they have been together for 3 months and have sex every day, then the total number of sexual acts would be 90 (3 months x 30 days = 90 acts).
3. Calculating the probability of infection: Using the CDC's estimate of the risk of transmission during vaginal sex, we can calculate the probability of Melanie getting infected after each sexual act. Since we want to find out how many acts it will take for Melanie to get infected, we will divide the probability of infection by the total number of acts. In our case, the probability of infection after one sexual act is 0.05%, so after 90 acts (the total number of sexual acts in 3 months), the probability of infection becomes: 0.05% x 90 = 0.45%.
4. Finding the time taken to reach the desired probability: Finally, we want to find out approximately how many months it will take for Melanie to reach a 50% chance of getting infected (which is equivalent to a 1 in 2 chance) based on their current frequency of having unprotected sex. To do this, we can use a simple formula"
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there are two types of music genres - jazz and hip hop.  We need to find out how much percentage of people prefer each genre.  For jazz, 80% of people prefer it (lomdanso elalinezifundo ezingu-20).  For hip hop, 70% of people prefer it (bangaki amaphesenti abo bonke abafundi ababhalisele ukudansa i-hip-hop). So, the difference between the percentages is 10%. Therefore, the answer is 10%.
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the total amount of money that needs to be transferred from R1 000 to R1 000 x 2.5% = R25 and from R1 000 to R1 000 x 1.2% = R12. So, the total amount of money that needs to be transferred is R37 (R25 + R12).
Response:  If there are 80 people in San Rafael who can speak Spanish and 150 people in San Rafael who can speak English, then we have to divide the total number of people who can speak both languages (80 + 150 = 230) by two to find out how many people can speak each language fluently. So, the number of people who can speak Spanish fluently is 230 / 2 = 115, and the number of people who can speak English fluently is 230 / 2 = 115.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that $20 is subtracted from $30, leaving us with $10. Then, $10 is divided by 50 to get $0.20 per person. However, since some people did not receive any money (35 out of 50), we need to subtract those who didn't receive anything ($0.20 x 35 = $7). So, the remaining amount that each person received is $0.20 x 15 = $3.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of eggs required for one omelette per person. Assuming an average size of 1 egg = 50g, and considering that each person needs approximately 200g of protein per day (from various sources), we can estimate that about 4-5 eggs are needed per person per day. Therefore, if there are 3 people in total, then the total number of eggs required would be 3 x 4-5 = 12-15 eggs. Now, let's consider the weight of the ingredients used in making the omelettes. Assuming an average weight of 1 large egg = 60g, and assuming that half of the eggs are used for making the omelettes, then the total weight of eggs used would be 12-15 eggs x 60g/egg = 720-900g. Finally, we need to convert this weight from grams to kilograms. There are 1000g in 1 kg, so: 720-900g / 1000g = 0.72-0.9kg. Therefore, the approximate amount of eggs used in making omelettes for 3 people is around 0.72-0.9kg or 720-900g.
"Response:  We are given that there are 12 children in a class and we have to find out how many of them can sit in a row facing each other.  The problem states that ""umarissa uhamba ngezinyawo"" which means ""the teacher asked the students to line up"". So, let's assume that all 12 children will be able to fit in a single row. Now, we need to calculate how many children can fit in a row facing each other. To do this, we need to divide the number of children who can fit in a row by 2 since they will be facing each other. Therefore, the answer is 6 children can fit in a row facing each other."
"Response:  We are given that ""Nginamalitha ayishumi"" means ""I don't know"". So we start with 0. Then we consider the next part of the sentence which is ""esihumi esiphuzo"". This can be translated to ""ask me something"", so we add 1 to our total. Next comes ""sewolintshi esiyiningxenye"". This can be translated to ""I will tell you something"", so we add another 1. Finally, we have ""ezimbili kwezintathu"". This can be translated to ""I will count up to 24"", so we add 24 to our total. Therefore, the answer is 35."
Response:  We are given that URaymond and Samantha have been dating for 6 months. In month 7, URaymond proposed to Samantha and she said yes. So in month 8, they got married. Now we are asked how long URaymond and Samantha were dating before they got married. From the information provided, we can see that it took them 6 months to get from the proposal to the wedding, so they must have started dating 6 + 1 = 7 months ago. Therefore, the correct answer is 7 months.
Response: 1. The question asks about the number of DVDs that can be stored in a uBilly box. 2. A uBilly box has a capacity of 8 slots for DVDs. 3. Therefore, the maximum number of DVDs that can be stored in a uBilly box is 8. So, the answer is 8.
"Response:  We are given that ""I handlela liyancila bilika ngamasentimitha"" which means ""I will take care of the money for the funeral"".  So we have to calculate how much money is needed for the funeral expenses.  The question states that ""Amakhandlela ayoba mfushane ngamasentimitha amangaki ngemva kokushiswa kusukela ngo-1:00 ntambama kuya ku-5:00 ntambama."" This can be translated to ""How much money does one need to spend from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm for the funeral?""  To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hours there are between 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm. There are 4 hours between these two times. Therefore, the amount of money needed for the funeral expenses is $4."
Response:  We are given that $19.50 is the cost of one item and we want to find out how much it will be after a discount of 25%. So, firstly, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. The formula for calculating the discount is: Discount = Cost x Percentage (in decimal form). In this case, the percentage is 25%, so: Discount = $19.50 x 0.25 = $4.875. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to get the new price: New Price = Original Price - Discount = $19.50 - $4.875 = $14.625. Therefore, the new price of each item after the 25% discount is $14.625.
"Response:  We are given that U Marie spends R13 per serving of rice and R14 per serving of beans. She also spends R15 per serving of pizza. To calculate how much she spends in total for all three meals, we can multiply each price by the number of servings she has (in this case, 50). So, the total cost of her meals would be:

Rice: 50 servings x R13/serving = R650
Beans: 50 servings x R14/serving = R700
Pizza: 50 servings x R15/serving = R750
Total cost: R650 + R700 + R750 = R2100
Therefore, U Marie spends a total of R2100 for all three meals."
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""Umishka"" wants to buy shorts for her children and she has budgeted R16,50 for this purpose. We are also told that each pair of shorts costs either R32 or R32,50 depending on their size. To determine how many pairs of shorts Umishka can buy with her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the shorts she wants to purchase. The calculation is as follows: Total Cost = Number of Pairs x Price per Pair So, if Umishka wants to buy two pairs of shorts (one small and one medium), the total cost would be: Total Cost = 2 x R32 = R64 If Umishka wants to buy three pairs of shorts (one small, one medium, and one large), the total cost would be: Total Cost = 3 x R32 = R96 If Umishka wants to buy four pairs of shorts (two small, two medium), the total cost would be: Total Cost = 4 x R32 = R128 And so on... Based on the information provided in the question, it seems that Umishka wants to buy at least five pairs of shorts, since she has budgeted R16,50 for this purpose. Therefore, the maximum number of pairs of shorts Umishka can buy with her budget is: Maximum Number of Pairs = Budget / Price per Pair = R16,50 / R32 = 5 pairs Of course, this assumes that Umishka only wants to buy shorts from the cheaper option (R32) and does not want to spend more than her budget allows. If she wanted to buy shorts from both options (R32 and R32,50), then the calculations would be slightly different."
Response:  We are given that $U$ is a unitary matrix of size $n \times n$, and we want to find the eigenvalues of $A = UDU^{-1}$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix with entries on the main diagonal.  First, note that $A - \lambda I$ is similar to $U(A_0 - \lambda I)U^{-1}$, where $A_0 = D$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $A$ are the same as those of $A_0$.  Moreover, since $U$ is unitary, we have $\det(A) = \det(A_0)$, so the multiplicity of each eigenvalue is equal to the multiplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue of $A_0$.  Now, let's compute the eigenvalues of $A_0$. Since $D$ is a diagonal matrix with entries on the main diagonal, its eigenvalues are simply the nonzero entries on the diagonal. In particular, if $d_i$ is the $i$th entry on the diagonal of $D$, then $A_0 - d_iI$ has eigenvalue $d_i$.  Finally, observe that $A - \lambda I$ has the same eigenvalues as $A_0 - \lambda I$, but with different multiplicities. Specifically, if $d_i$ is an eigenvalue of $A_0$ with multiplicity $m$, then $A - \lambda I$ has eigenvalue $d_i$ with multiplicity $m$.  So, in summary, the eigenvalues of $A$ are the same as those of $A_0$, but with different multiplicities. The multiplicity of each eigenvalue of $A$ is equal to the multiplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue of $A_0$.
Response:  We are given that Henry has $60 and wants to share it equally among his 30 friends. Each friend will get $2 (60/30). Now, we have $4 left over ($60 - $2 x 30 = $4). So each of the remaining 15 friends will get $0.27 (4 / 30).
"Response:  We are given that ""Umngeni"" (water) flows through ""izicathulo"" (valley). The word ""izicathulo"" has 10 letters. Therefore, we can deduce that ""umngeni"" contains 10 syllables. Now, let's count how many times the letter ""e"" appears in ""umngeni"". Using the provided text as reference, we see that the letter ""e"" appears 5 times in ""umngeni"". So, the answer to the question is 5."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days Darrel has been in jail for each of his offenses. For example, if he was sentenced to 3 years and 5 months for one offense, then he spent 3 years + 5 months = 40 months in jail for that particular offense. Similarly, if he was sentenced to 2 years and 8 months for another offense, then he spent 2 years + 8 months = 20 months in jail for that offense. Therefore, the total number of months Darrel spent in jail for all his offenses can be calculated as follows: Total months in jail = 40 months (offense 1) + 20 months (offense 2) +... + x months (offense n) Where 'x' represents the remaining offenses. Now, let's calculate the total number of months Darrel spent in jail for all his offenses based on the information provided in the question: Offense 1: 3 years + 5 months = 40 months Offense 2: 2 years + 8 months = 20 months Offense 3: 7 years + 9 months = 86 months Total months in jail = 40 months + 20 months + 86 months = 146 months Therefore, the answer to the question is 146 months.
Response:  We are given that there are 80 jelly beans in total and we want to know how many will be left after 20 of them have been eaten. So, the number of jelly beans left after 20 have been eaten is: 80 - 20 = 60. Now, we are asked what percentage of the remaining jelly beans are covered in chocolate. The percentage of chocolate covering the remaining jelly beans is: (25/100) x 60 = 15.
Response:  We are given that John has $10 and he wants to share it equally among his 4 friends. So, each friend will get $2.5 ( $10 / 4 = $2.5). Now, we are asked how much money John will have left after sharing it with his friends. To find this out, we subtract the amount he gave to his friends from the original $10. Therefore, John will have $7.5 left ($10 - $2.5 = $7.5).
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days Gretchen has been in Zululand. According to the question, she arrived on day 1 and spent 3 months there, which is equal to 90 days. Therefore, Gretchen has been in Zululand for 90 days. Now, let's calculate the number of days she spent at each place:  Day 1 - 90 = 0 days at Durban  Day 2 - 90 = 0 days at Pinetown  Day 3 - 90 = 0 days at KwaMashu  Day 4 - 90 = 0 days at Umlazi  Day 5 - 90 = 0 days at Isipingo Beach  Day 6 - 90 = 0 days at uMhlanga Rocks  Day 7 - 90 = 0 days at Ballito  Day 8 - 90 = 0 days at Empangeni  Day 9 - 90 = 0 days at Richards Bay  Day 10 - 90 = 0 days at Mtunzini  Total number of days spent at each place = 0 days So, Gretchen did not visit any places in Zululand.
Response:  We are given that Aaron is 35 years old and Shiobhan is 28 years old. So, if they have been married for 4 years, then their marriage started when Aaron was 31 years old (4 - 35) and Shiobhan was 24 years old (4 - 28).
Response:  We are given that Mike has played ping pong for 40 minutes and has scored 20 points. He missed 10 shots out of 30 attempts. To find out how many points he would have scored if he had not missed any shots, we can multiply his total score by a percentage representing the number of successful shots. If he had not missed any shots, he would have scored 20 x (100/100) = 20 points. Therefore, the difference between the actual score and the expected score is 20 - 20 = 0 points. So, Mike did not miss any shots during the game.
Response:  We are given that uTherry has $100 to spend at the store. He wants to buy yogurt and milk. The total cost of these items is $4 + $3 = $7. So, he will have $100 - $7 = $93 left after buying these items. Now, we are asked how much money uTherry will have after buying other things worth $30. Therefore, the final amount of money that uTherry will have is $93 + $30 = $123.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that the video is 13 minutes long and costs $15 to produce. We are also told that it can be edited into shorter clips of 8 minutes or less for R20 each. To calculate the number of videos that can be produced from one hour of footage, we need to divide the length of the original video (13 minutes) by the length of each clip (8 minutes). This gives us a total of 167 clips (13/8 = 167). Therefore, the number of videos that can be produced from one hour of footage is 167.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days John has been in school since he started studying at age 60. We can calculate this as follows:  Age at start of education = 60 years Older than current age = 0 years Total time in school = Current age - Age at start of education = 72 years (Since John is currently 72 years old) Now, let's find out how many months John has spent in school:  Months in school = Total time in school / 12 months per year = 72 years x 12 months/year = 840 months (Since there are 12 months in a year) Finally, let's convert the number of months into years: Years in school = Months in school / 12 months/year = 840 months / 12 months/year = 70 years (So John has spent 70 years in school.)

"Response:  We are given that ""Umhlanga"" has 100 branches and each branch has 400 leaves. Therefore, the total number of leaves in all branches is: 100 x 400 = 40,000 leaves. Now, we are asked how many leaves would be left if 30% of the leaves were removed. To find out, we need to calculate 30% of 40,000 leaves, which gives us: 30% x 40,000 = 12,000 leaves. So, after removing 30% of the leaves, there would be 40,000 - 12,000 = 28,000 leaves remaining."
Response:  We are given that there are 5 units of water in a container and we need to find out how many liters it contains. A unit of water is equal to 0.02 liters, so we can start by multiplying the number of units by the conversion factor: 5 x 0.02 = 0.1 liters. Since there are 1000 milliliters in a liter, we can convert this value to milliliters by dividing by 1000: 0.1 / 1000 = 0.001 milliliters. Therefore, there are approximately 0.001 milliliters of water in the container.
Response:  We are given that Ngokwe mining company produces 250 kg of chips per day and each chip contains 70 calories. To calculate how many kilojoules (kJ) of energy are produced daily by Ngokwe Mining Company, we need to multiply the weight of chips produced by their calorific value per unit mass. The formula for this calculation is: Energy content (kJ) = Mass of food x Calorific value per unit mass. In this case, the calorific value per unit mass of chips is 70 kJ/kg. So, the total amount of energy produced daily by Ngokwe Mining Company can be calculated as follows: Energy produced daily (kJ) = Mass of chips produced x Calorific value per unit mass  Therefore, if they produce 250 kg of chips per day, the total amount of energy produced daily would be: Energy produced daily (kJ) = 250 kg x 70 kJ/kg = 17,500 kJ. Now, we are also given that the average person consumes 300 g of chips per day and each gram of chips contains 70 calories. To calculate the number of kilojoules (kJ) of energy consumed daily by an average person from Ngokwe Mining Company's chips, we can use the same formula as before: Energy consumed daily (kJ) = Mass of chips consumed x Calorific value per unit mass. In this case, the calorific value per unit mass of chips is still 70 kJ/g. So, the total amount of energy consumed daily by an average person from Ngokwe Mining Company's chips can be calculated as follows: Energy consumed daily (kJ) = 300 g x 70 kJ/g = 21,000 kJ. Finally, we are asked to find out how much energy is produced daily by Ngokwe Mining Company in excess of what an average person consumes. To do this, we subtract the energy consumed daily from the energy produced daily: Excess energy produced daily (kJ) = Energy produced daily - Energy consumed daily  Substituting the values we have obtained so far into this equation
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much wax is needed for each candle. We are given that there are 20 candles and each candle requires 5 grams of wax. Therefore, the total amount of wax required is: 20 x 5 = R100.00 (this is the cost per gram of wax). Next, we need to convert this amount from Rand to US dollars. The exchange rate is given as $1.00 = R30.00. So, the cost in US dollars is: R100.00 x $1.00/R30.00 = $3.33. Finally, we need to subtract the cost of the wax from the total price paid for the beeswax. This gives us the profit made per candle: $3.33 - R100.00 = R96.67 ($3.33 is the profit per candle).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of words that are spelled correctly out of the total number of words written in the passage. We can do this by counting the number of correct words and dividing it by the total number of words written in the passage. In this case, there are 10 words that are spelled correctly out of a total of 25 words written in the passage, which means that the percentage of correct spellings is 40% (10/25 x 100%). Therefore, the answer is 40%.
Response:  We are given that there are 80 Post-its and we want to know how many different ways we can arrange them so that each row has exactly 4 Post-its.  Since each Post-it can be placed anywhere along the row, we have 80! = 6,755,910 possible arrangements. However, some of these arrangements will not satisfy our condition (e.g., if all four Post-its in one row are next to each other). So let's subtract out those arrangements where this is the case, leaving us with 5,755,910 possible arrangements. Now, we want to know what fraction of these arrangements contain at least two Post-its from each of the first 22 rows. To do this, we divide the number of arrangements containing at least two Post-its from each of the first 22 rows by the total number of arrangements, which gives us 5,755,910 / 8,000,000 = 0.71875 or approximately 71.88%.
Response:  We are given that there are 50 people who have been infected with COVID-19 and we need to calculate the percentage of those who will recover in 3 days. To do this, we can use the formula: (Number of recovered/Total number infected) x 100%. In this case, the total number of people infected is 200, so we multiply it by 100% to get the percentage of people who will recover:  (50/200) x 100% = 25%. Therefore, 25% of the people infected with COVID-19 will recover in 3 days.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there in a year. A year has 365 days (or 366 days in leap years). So, if someone is born on January 1st and lives for 70 years, they will have lived for approximately 25,500 days (365 x 70 = 25,500). Now, let's calculate the number of weeks that person has lived. There are 7 days in a week, so 25,500 days / 7 days/week = approximately 3,642 weeks. Therefore, the answer to the question is 3,642 weeks.
Response:  We are given that there are 15 people in a group and we need to find out how many of them can sit at a round table with a diameter of 8 feet (2.4 meters). To do this, we will use the formula for calculating the area of a circle, which is: Area = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle is twice the radius, we can use half of the diameter to calculate the area. So, the area of the circle is: Area = (π(2.4)}^2 = 30.72 square feet. Now, since there are 15 people in the group, we want to know how much space each person needs. Therefore, we divide the total area by 15: Space per person = Total area / Number of people = 30.72 square feet / 15 = 2.046 square feet. Therefore, 15 people can sit around a round table with a diameter of 8 feet comfortably without overcrowding or leaving any empty spaces.
Response:  We are given that ULoyd has $252 in his account and he wants to withdraw $100. So, we subtract $100 from $252 to get the remaining amount in ULoyd's account after the withdrawal. Therefore, the answer is $152 ( $252 - $100).
Response:  We are given that umkhumbi ka tom uhamba ngesivinini esingamamayela ayishumi ngehora. This means that Tom will start working at 9 am and finish work at 4 pm. Now we need to calculate how many hours he worked during this time period. To do this, we subtract the starting time from the finishing time: 4 pm - 9 am = 5 hours. So, Tom worked for 5 hours.
Response:  We are given that Isikhwama has 15 children and each child has 2 siblings. Therefore, the total number of children in Isikhwama's family is: 15 x 2 = 30.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""umakhenikha uyokhokhisa amanani ahlukahlukene ukuze alungise amathayi"" which means ""the amount of money spent on transportation for the trip from Durban to Johannesburg"". We are also told that this amount is R360. Then, we are asked how much would be left if R300 was subtracted from the amount spent on transportation. So, the answer is R60 (R360 - R300). Now, let's move on to the next part of the question where we are asked about the number of people who went on the trip and their ages. According to the question, there were 12 people in total, including children aged between 5 and 12 years old. Therefore, the answer is 12. Finally, we are asked what percentage of the amount spent on transportation was used for fuel. Based on the information provided earlier, the answer is 40% (R360 / R800 = 0.4 or 40%)."

This means that there are 5000 people who have been affected by the floods and need to be relocated.  Next, we are told that ""Iloli elihambisa izinto eligcwele amabhokisi afanayo"", which means that there are 15 families who have been displaced due to the floods.  Finally, we are given that ""Yisiphi isibalo esiphezulu samabhokisi angathwalwa elolini ngaphandle kokweqa umkhawulo wesisindo sebhuloho"", which means that 3755 people have been rescued from the floods. So, in total, 5000 + 15 = 5015 people have been affected by the floods, of whom 3755 have been rescued."
Response:  Firstly, Stephen has $40 to spend on internet costs. If he spends $3 on each of the next 25 weeks, that will use up all his money. So in total, he can afford to spend $3 x 25 = $75 on internet costs. Since he still has $4 left after paying for those costs, he can afford to spend an additional $4 / 25 = $0.16 per week on internet costs. Therefore, the amount Stephen can spend on internet costs per week is $0.16.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of raspberries in 20 grams. We know that one gram of raspberries contains 1/4 teaspoon (tsp) of sugar. Therefore, 20 grams of raspberries contain 5 tsp of sugar (20 g x 1/4 tsp/g = 5 tsp). Now, let's convert 5 tsp of sugar into milliliters (mL). There are approximately 5 mL of water in 1 tsp of sugar solution. So, 5 tsp of sugar = 5 x 5 mL = 25 mL of sugar solution. Finally, we divide the total amount of sugar solution (25 mL) by the number of raspberries (67) to get the average amount of sugar per raspberry. Therefore, the answer is 38.4 mg of sugar per raspberry (25 mL / 67 raspberries = 38.4 mg/rspbry).
Response:  We are given that ubhasikidi (the number of people who have not paid their bills) is 25 and out of them, 20% have been paying their bills regularly. So, we need to find out how many people have not paid their bills at all. To do this, we can multiply the total number of people by the percentage of those who have been paying their bills regularly. Therefore, the number of people who have not paid their bills is: 25 x 80 = 200.
Response:  If we take R1 000 and subtract 10%, we get R900. So the amount left after paying 10% tax is R900.
Response:  We are given that Uma has $100,000 to invest and she wants to split it equally among four options with expected returns of 8%, 10%, 12%, and 15%. The probability of each option is also provided as follows: Option A - 40%, Option B - 30%, Option C - 20%, and Option D - 5%. To calculate the expected value of each option, we can use the formula for expected value: Expected Value = (Probability x Return) / 100 So, for Option A, the expected return is ($100,000 x 40%) / 100 = $40,000. Similarly, for Options B, C, and D, the expected returns are ($100,000 x 30%), ($100,000 x 20%), and ($100,000 x 5%), respectively. Now, let's find out how much Uma will get if she invests $50,000 in each of these options: For Option A: Expected Return = $40,000 x 50,000 = $20,000,000 For Option B: Expected Return = $30,000 x 50,000 = $1,500,000 For Option C: Expected Return = $20,000 x 50,000 = $1,000,000 For Option D: Expected Return = $5,000 x 50,000 = $250,000 Therefore, if Uma invests $50,000 in each of these options, her total expected return would be $20,000 + $1,500 + $1,000 + $250 = $24,750,000.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that $U = A \times B$, where $A$ and $B$ are two numbers. We also know that $A = 130$ and $B = x$. Therefore, we can write:  $$U = 130 \times x$$ Now, we are asked to find out what percentage of $U$ is equal to $95$. To do this, we need to divide $95$ by $U$, which gives us:  $$\frac{95}{U} = \frac{95}{130x}$$ Simplifying this fraction, we get:  $$\boxed{\frac{95}{U} = \frac{95}{130x}}$$ Finally, we are told that $U$ is less than or equal to $10\%$ of $R$, where $R$ is a large number. This means that $U$ is less than or equal to $R \times 0.10$, which simplifies to:  $$U \leq R \times 0.10$$ Substituting the value of $U$ from the equation above, we get:  $$130x \leq R \times 0.10$$ Simplifying this inequality, we get:  $$130x \leq 13$$ So, the value of $x$ that satisfies all the conditions is $x = 10$. Therefore, the answer is:  $$U = 130 \times 10 = 1300$$
Response:  We are given that there are 160 students in the class and they will be divided into groups of 4 or 5. So, we need to find out how many groups can be formed with 4 or 5 students each. To do this, we use the formula: n! / (k! \* (n-k)!) where n is the total number of students (160), k is the number of students per group (4 or 5).  For 4 students per group, we have n! = 160! = 10^38, and (4! \* (160-4))! = 10^34.  Therefore, the number of groups that can be formed with 4 students each is 10^34.  Similarly, for 5 students per group, we have n! = 160! = 10^38, and (5! \* (160-5))! = 10^37. Therefore, the number of groups that can be formed with 5 students each is 10^37.  Now, let's calculate the number of groups that can be formed with both 4 and 5 students per group: 10^38 + 10^37 = 20^37.  Therefore, the answer to the question is 20^37.

"Response:  We are given that $U$ spent R5 on something and got back $8$. So, we can write:
$$\boxed{\text{Cost = }}\quad U \cdot R5 = 8$$
Now, we are also given that $U$ spent $\$100$ on something else. So, we can write:
$$\boxed{\text{Total Cost = }}\quad U \cdot \$100 =?$$
We want to find out how much $U$ spent in total. To do this, we need to divide the total cost by $U$:
$$\boxed{\text{Total Cost per Unit = }}\quad \frac{\$100}{U} =?$$
So, if $U$ spent $\$100$ on something else, then for each unit of that thing, they spent $\$100/U$."
Response:  We are given that Judy has $8 to spend and she wants to buy something from Migqibelo's store. The cheapest item in the store is $15. So, if Judy buys this item, she will have $7 left ($8 - $15 = $7). Now, let's assume that Judy also spends $3 more on other items in the store, so her total spending becomes $10 ($7 + $3 = $10). Therefore, the amount of money Judy has left after shopping at Migqibelo's store is $10 - $8 = $2.

Response:  We are given that $uluka$ has $uchitha$ which means it can be divided into two parts. The first part is $isikhathi$ and the second part is $sakhe$. So we have $uluka = isikhathi + sakhe$. Now we are asked to find out how many times $iskhathi$ can be divided into $ebhishi$ parts. To do this, we need to divide $iskhathi$ by $akha$, which gives us $\frac{iskhathi}{akha} = \boxed{3}$. Therefore, $iskhathi$ can be divided into $3$ parts. Similarly, $sakhe$ can also be divided into $akha$ parts, so $sakhe = \boxed{9}$. Finally, we add up all the parts to get the total number of parts, i.e., $total = isikhathi + sakhe = 3 + 9 = 12$.

Response:  We are given that Uma and Sarah have 5 children each, and David has 3 children. So, in total, there are 5 + 5 = 10 children. Now, we are asked how many of these children are boys. Well, among Uma's 5 children, 2 are boys (Uma Jr. and Rohan), so there are 2 boys out of 5 children. Similarly, among Sarah's 5 children, 2 are boys (Aiden and Ethan), so there are 2 boys out of 5 children as well. Finally, among David's 3 children, none are boys, so there are 0 boys. Therefore, the total number of boys among all the children is 2 + 0 = 2.
Response:  We are given that uvince has answered 2 questions correctly out of 5. So, the probability of Vincent answering a question correctly is $ \frac{2}{5} = \boxed{0.4} $. Now we are asked to find the probability that Vincent answers the remaining $ 3 $ questions incorrectly. Since the probability of Vincent answering a question correctly is $ \boxed{0.4} $, the probability of him answering a question incorrectly is $ 1 - \boxed{0.4} = \boxed{0.6} $. Therefore, the probability of Vincent answering all $ 3 $ remaining questions incorrectly is $ \boxed{0.6}^3 = \boxed{0.72} $. Thus, the final answer is $ \boxed{0.72} $.

Response:  Firstly, we need to identify the pattern in which the blocks are arranged. From the given question, it is clear that each row consists of 6 blocks and there are 7 rows in total. Therefore, the number of blocks in one row can be calculated as follows: Number of blocks per row = Total number of blocks / Number of rows = 50 (total number of blocks) / 7 (number of rows) = 7. So, there are 7 blocks in each row. Now, let's calculate the number of blocks in each column: Number of blocks per column = Total number of blocks / Number of columns = 50 (total number of blocks) / 7 (number of rows) x 6 (number of blocks per row) = 14. So, there are 14 blocks in each column. Finally, to find out how many blocks are in the entire quilt, we multiply the number of blocks in each row with the number of rows and then add the result to the number of blocks in each column: Entire quilt size = Number of blocks in each row x Number of rows + Number of blocks in each column x Number of columns = 7 x 7 + 14 x 6 = 98 + 84 = 182. Therefore, the size of the entire quilt is 182 blocks wide and 144 blocks long.

The word ""ukuba"" means ""and so on"", and ""khathathu"" means ""the rest"". Therefore, the phrase ""ukuba ikhale kathathu"" means ""and so on, the rest"". Finally, we come to the adverbial phrase ""ngosuku ngesikhumbuzo"". This phrase means ""very quickly"". So, the complete translation of the question would be ""How quickly does he go?"""
Response:  We are given that $ \text{Inkampani} = 600 \text{ ngenyanga} $.  Then, we are asked to find out how much of this amount will be left after $ \text{Uma} $ has taken $ \text{10\%} $ of it. So, we need to calculate $ \frac{\text{10\%}}{\text{Inkampani}} \times \text{Inkampani} = 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \text{ ngenyanga} $. Now, we are also told that $ \text{Uma} $ took $ \text{90\%} $ of the remaining amount, so we can calculate $ \frac{\text{90\%}}{\text{Inkampani}} \times \text{Inkampani} = 0.90 \times 60 = 54 \text{ ngenyanga} $. Therefore, the final amount left with $ \text{Uma} $ is $ 60 + 54 = 114 \text{ ngenyanga} $.

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many teeth Ted has lost due to his age and dietary habits. Based on our calculations, Ted has lost approximately 17 teeth since he was born. Then, we need to determine how many pounds of meat Ted can eat in one sitting based on his size and appetite. According to our research, Ted can consume around 30 pounds of meat in one meal. Finally, we need to divide the number of teeth lost by the amount of meat consumed to get the average rate at which Ted loses teeth per pound of meat eaten. Using this calculation, we find that Ted loses approximately 0.56 teeth per pound of meat eaten. Therefore, if Ted consumes 30 pounds of meat in one meal, he will lose approximately 18 teeth (0.56 x 30 = 18). So, the answer to the question is 18.

Response:  We are given that Gerald's salary increased by 10% from R38,000 to R42,000. So, if we want to find out how much more money Lee made after his increase of 400 enezihi, we need to subtract Gerald's new salary (R42,000) from Lee's original salary (R36,000). Therefore, the difference in their salaries is:  R42,000 - R36,000 = R6,000.
"Response:  We are given that ""Emphakathini"" has 12 children and we need to find out how many of them have passed grade 6. So, let's start with the first child and assume that all of them have passed grade 6. Therefore, the number of children who have passed grade 6 is 12. Now, let's move on to the second child and assume that they also have passed grade 6, so the total number of children who have passed grade 6 becomes 24 (12 + 12). Similarly, for the third child, we assume that they too have passed grade 6, which means the total number of children who have passed grade 6 becomes 36 (24 + 12). And so on... As you can see, each time we add 12 to the previous total, until we reach the last child, who would be assumed to have passed grade 6 as well, making the final total number of children who have passed grade 6 equal to 720 (60 x 12)."
"Response:  We are given that ""Kulabafundi"" has 200 beBanga and Lesi has 5 beBanga.  Now we need to find out how many beBanga Lesi can buy with his 5 beBanga. So, we divide 5 beBanga of Lesi by 200 beBanga of Kulabafundi.  Therefore, the number of beBanga that Lesi can buy with his 5 beBanga is:

$$ \frac{5}{200} = \frac{1/4}{10} $$

So, Lesi can buy $\frac{1}{4}$ of Kulabafundi's beBanga, which is $ \boxed{\frac{25}{4}} $ beBanga."
Response:  We are given that Harry has 9 apples and James has 8 oranges. To find out how many more apples Harry has than oranges James has, we need to subtract the number of oranges James has from the number of apples Harry has: 9 - 8 = 1 So, Harry has one more apple than James has orange.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that Fred has 16 ounces of beans in his pantry and he wants to make 8 servings of soup with each serving containing 32 ounces. To calculate how many servings Fred can make from the 16 ounces of beans, we divide the amount of beans by the size of each serving: 16 ounces / 32 ounces per serving = 0.5 or  half a serving. Therefore, Fred can make 0.5 x 8 servings = 4 servings of soup using the 16 ounces of beans he has.
Response:  We are given that there are 15 people in group A and 20 people in group B. Group A has been working for 15 days, while group B has been working for 20 days. If we calculate the total number of workdays for both groups combined, it would be:  Workdays for group A = 15 days x 15 people = 225 workdays  Workdays for group B = 20 days x 20 people = 400 workdays  Total workdays for both groups combined = 225 + 400 = 625 workdays Now, let's find out how many workdays each person in group A had if they worked for an average of 7 days per month (which is what the question states):  Number of workdays for group A = 15 people x 7 days/person = 105 workdays Similarly, let's find out how many workdays each person in group B had if they worked for an average of 8 days per month:  Number of workdays for group B = 20 people x 8 days/person = 160 workdays Finally, to determine how many workdays each person in group A had if they worked for an average of 7 days per month over a period of 30 months, we need to multiply the number of workdays from group A by 30:  Number of workdays for group A over 30 months = 105 workdays x 30 months = 3150 workdays In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, each person in group A had approximately 3150 / 15 = 207 workdays over a period of 30 months, assuming they worked for an average of 7 days per month.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""Umario"" has ungumlimi (unguhumulwa) and othanda (othando). This means that Umario has no teeth or gums. Now, let's consider the second part of the question which asks about his age. We are told that he is 18 years old. Therefore, if we calculate the number of days since birth until now, we get: 18 years x 365 days/year = 6,270 days Since Umario does not have any teeth or gums, it means that he cannot eat solid foods like other people who have teeth to chew their food. So, he only relies on soft foods such as milk, porridge, and soup for sustenance. As for how many times he eats per day, we can assume that he eats at least twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening - because humans need regular meals to maintain good health. However, due to his condition without teeth or gums, Umario may find it challenging to consume enough nutrients from these soft foods alone; therefore, he might require additional supplements or medical assistance to ensure proper nourishment."
Response:  We are given that Jerome has $20 and he wants to share it equally among his 5 friends. So, each friend will get $4 (20 / 5 = $4). Now, we are asked how many times can Jerome divide this amount among his other 3 friends if he wants to give them an equal share too. To do this, we need to divide $4 by 60 (the number of shares he wants to give out), which gives us $\frac{4}{60} = \boxed{0.07}$. Therefore, Jerome can divide the initial amount of $20 among his remaining 3 friends 60 times, or $0.07$ times.
Response:  We are given that there are 36 students in total and they are divided into groups of 4 or 5.  We also know that each group has to have at least one student who speaks isiXhosa as their home language.  Therefore, we can calculate the number of groups that can be formed as follows:  Number of groups = Total number of students / Minimum number of students per group = 36 / 4 = 9 groups  So, there can be up to 9 groups of students.
Response:  We are given that John has 10 apples and he wants to share them equally among his 4 friends. So, we need to divide 10 by 4 = 2.5. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, each friend will get 2 apples from John. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of birth from the date of death. So, if the person was born on March 15, 1980 and died on April 3, 2017, then the difference between these two dates is 37 years (April 3 - March 15). Now, let's convert this number into months by dividing it by 12. So, 37 years = 37 x 12 = 448 months. Therefore, the person lived for approximately 448 months or 37 years.
"Response: 1. The word ""uxazulula"" means ""to make someone happy"". 2. The word ""iphazili"" means ""to do something for someone"". 3. The word ""enezicucu"" means ""to help someone"". 4. The word ""eziyinkulungwane"" means ""to be of use to someone"". 5. The word ""uzakalala"" means ""to give happiness"". So, the correct answer is 6."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between two dates given in the question. The first date is ""udla amakhekhe aphindwe"" which means ""the day when he was born"". We don't know exactly when he was born but let's assume it was on January 1st, 2000. So, the age of Amir at present will be 23 years old (as of March 2023). Now, we have to find out how many days have passed since his birthdate until today. There are 23 years x 365 days per year = 8415 days. Therefore, the total number of days that have passed since Amir's birthdate till now is 8415 days."
Response:  We are given that there are 5 umbhoksis (angles) in total and each angle has 2 sides (ubudes). So, we have 5 x 2 = 10 ubuedes in total. Now, we need to find out how many of them are equal to 3 degrees. To do this, we can simply count the number of ubuedes that are equal to 3 degrees and divide it by the total number of ubuedes. Therefore, the answer is 3/10 or 0.3.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there are 15 questions in total and each question has 4 options to choose from. Therefore, the total number of options available for all 15 questions is 15 x 4 = 60. Now, let's focus on question 3 which asks how many hours a person spends watching TV per day. We are told that the correct answer is option (D) which is 30 hours. So, the value of this question is 30 hours. Moving on to the next question, we have to find out how many people watch TV for more than 30 hours per day. From the question, we know that 20% of the population watches TV for more than 30 hours per day. This means that 20/100 = 0.2 or 20% of the population watches TV for more than 30 hours per day. Therefore, the value of this question is 0.2 x 60 = 12 hours. Finally, we come to question 18 which asks how many minutes a person spends watching TV per day on average. We are told that the correct answer is option (C) which is 180 minutes. So, the value of this question is 180 minutes. In conclusion, the total value of these three questions is 30 + 12 + 180 = 322 hours.
Response:  We are given that Henry has 15 cows and he wants to sell them at $2 each. So, we can calculate the total amount of money he will make from selling all his cows as follows: Total number of cows = 15 Cow price per head = $2 x 15 = $30 Therefore, if Henry sells all his 15 cows at $2 each, he will make a total of $30 in profit.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that isiteshi (the number of people) = $150.  Then, we are asked to find out how many people will get cash back worth $20 each. To do this, we need to divide the total amount of cash back ($20 x 150 people) by the cost price per person ($20). So, the number of people who will get cash back is:  $20 x 150 = $3000 / $20 = 150 people. Now, let's calculate the percentage of people who will get cash back. We can do this by dividing the number of people who got cash back by the total number of people participating in the event. So, the percentage of people who got cash back is: 150/450 x 100% = 33.3%. Therefore, approximately 33.3% of the participants will receive cash back worth $20 each.
Response:  Beatrice has 5 rolls of tobacco and Marcel has 3 rolls of tobacco. If we want to know how many rolls of tobacco they have in total, we can simply add their numbers together. So, Beatrice has 5 + 3 = 8 rolls of tobacco in total, and Marcel has 3 rolls of tobacco in total.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days Julia has been in the hospital. From the information given, Julia has been in the hospital for 64 days. Therefore, the answer is 64.
Response:  We are given that there are 10 people in each house and we have to find out how many houses they can build with $5000.  So, let's calculate the number of houses per person as follows:  Number of houses = Total amount / Number of people = $5000 / 10 = 50 houses per person.  Since there are 10 people in each house, the total number of houses that can be built is: Total number of houses = Number of houses per person x Number of people = 50 x 10 = 500 houses.
Response:  We are given that uryan has 20 marbles in total and he wants to share them equally among his 3 friends. Since each friend gets an equal amount of marbles, we can write the equation: 20/3 = x where x is the number of marbles each friend will get. Now, we solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3: x = 6 So each friend will get 6 marbles from uryan.
Response:  We are given that Jamal has 50 cigarettes and he smokes 2 per day. So in one week, he will smoke 140 cigarettes (2 x 7 = 14). Now we are asked how many cigarettes Brittany will have consumed after 3 months if she smokes at the same rate as Jamal. Since 3 months is equal to 9 weeks, Brittany will have consumed 9 x 14 = 126 cigarettes during this period. Therefore, the answer is 126.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""USasha"" has 50% of the money and wants to share it equally among 10 people. So, if USasha has $10, then each person will get $1 (since 10/50 = 0.2). Now let's calculate how much each person will get when there are 4 people in total:  If there are 4 people in total, then the total amount of money is divided into 4 parts, so each part represents $16 ($10 / 4 = $16). Therefore, each person will get $16 / 4 = $4 per person."
"Response:  We are given that ""UKaty wenza"" means ""I went to the bank"". So we have ""I went to the bank"" = ""UKaty wenza"". Now we need to find out how many times ""I went to the bank"" occurs in the text. To do this, we count the number of times ""I went to the bank"" appears in the text. Based on the provided text, ""I went to the bank"" appears 7 times in the text. Therefore, the answer is 7."
Response:  We are given that John is 35 years old and has been in the job market for 10 years. Therefore, his current age is 45 years (35 + 10). Now we need to calculate how many working years he will have left if he continues working until he reaches the age of 60. To do this, we subtract his current age from his target age (60) which gives us 15 years (60 - 45). So, John will have 15 years of work life remaining before he retires at the age of 60.
"Response:  Firstly, we are asked to calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year (January 1st). We know that it is currently September 20th, so the total number of days from January 1st to September 20th is:

30 + 6 = 36

Therefore, the answer to the question is 36 days."
Response:  Adrien has 30% of Lyla's wealth, and we are asked to find out how much wealth Adrien would have if he had 40% of Lyla's wealth. So, if Adrien has $30,000 of Lyla's wealth, then Adrien would have $40,000 of Lyla's wealth if he had 40% of her wealth. Now, let's calculate the amount of wealth that Adrien would have if he had 40% of Lyla's wealth. We know that Adrien has $30,000 of Lyla's wealth, so if he had 40% of her wealth, his share would be: $30,000 x 40% = $12,000 So, Adrien would have $12,000 of Lyla's wealth if he had 40% of her wealth.
"Response:  We are given that ""umiguel"" is using a computer and wants to know how many hours he has spent browsing the internet. To find out, we need to check his browser history. If he has been browsing for 30 days nonstop, then he must have spent at least 24 hours per day (since there are 8 hours in a day) browsing the internet. Therefore, the total number of hours Miguel has spent browsing the internet is: 24 x 30 = 720 hours."
Response:  We are given that Morisette has 8 children and each child has 4 siblings. Therefore, we have: 8 x 4 = 32 siblings for Morisette's children.
Response:  We are given that there are 8 people in a group and they want to share money equally among themselves. So, each person will get $16 (8 x $2). Now, we are asked how much each person will get if there are 2 more people added to the group. In this case, each additional person will get $4 ($2 x 2), so the total amount of money shared among all 10 people is $16 + $4 = $20. Therefore, the answer is $20.
Response:  We are given that Rosie has 10 apples and she gives 2 to her friend. So now Rosie has 8 apples left. Then, she gives another apple to her friend. Now Rosie has 7 apples left. Therefore, the answer is 7.
Response:  We are given that Jennie has 60 eggs to sell and she wants to divide them equally among 30 customers. So each customer will get 2 eggs per person. Now we need to find out how many eggs Jennie will have left after giving them away. To do this, we subtract the number of eggs she gave away (30 x 2 = 60) from the total number of eggs she had (60). Therefore, Jennie will have 60 - 60 = 0 eggs left after giving them away.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that Julia has 9 friends and she wants to invite them over for dinner.  We are also told that each friend can bring along one or two additional guests.  Therefore, the total number of people who will be attending the dinner party is: 9 + (2 x 3) = 24.
Response:  We are given that there are 38 people who can speak Sesotho and 6 of them cannot speak any other language. So, the number of people who can speak only Sesotho is: 38 - 6 = 32.
Response:  We are given that Lily has 20 apples and she gives 5 to Amy. So, now Lily has 15 apples left. Then we are told that Amy has 40 apples in total (including the 5 from Lily). Therefore, the difference between the number of apples Lily had and the number of apples Amy had is:  15 - 40 = -$25.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how many watermelons are in total. We know that there are 5 watermelons and each one is worth $3. So, the total value of all watermelons is: 5 x $3 = $15. Now, we need to convert this amount from dollars to South African rand (ZAR). To do this, we divide the dollar amount by the exchange rate between US dollars and ZAR. As of today, the exchange rate is approximately 1 USD = 14 ZAR. So, $15 divided by 14 ZAR/USD gives us the equivalent amount in ZAR: $15 / 14 = R210. Therefore, the price of 1 watermelon in South Africa is roughly R210.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there are 500 people who have been infected with COVID-19 and 24 of them have died so far. We also know that each person has infected an average of 3 others before they showed symptoms (ngasinye). Therefore, the total number of people infected in the community can be calculated as follows:  Number of people infected = Total number of infected x Average number of people infected per person = 500 x 3 = 1500  Now, let's consider the second part of the question where we are asked to calculate the amount of money spent on buying masks for each person in the community. We are told that each mask costs R150 and that 20% of the population (isiguli) bought masks. So, the total amount of money spent on buying masks for the entire community can be calculated as follows:  Amount of money spent on buying masks = Total number of people in the community x Percentage of people who bought masks x Cost of one mask = 1500 x 20% x R150 = R3000  Finally, we are asked to find out how much money was spent on buying masks per person in the community. To do this, we divide the total amount of money spent on buying masks by the total number of people in the community:  Money spent on buying masks per person = Total amount of money spent on buying masks / Total number of people in the community = R3000 / 1500 = R200  Therefore, the answer to the question is R200.
"Response:  We are given that there are 60 people in total and we need to find out how many of them can fit in a room with an area of 12 square meters. To do this, we will use the formula for calculating the maximum number of people who can fit in a space based on its area. The formula is as follows: Maximum number of people = Area of space / Area per person Where ""Area per person"" represents the amount of space required by one person to move around comfortably. This value varies depending on factors such as culture, lifestyle, and personal preferences, but generally ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 square meters (m2) per person. For simplicity, let's assume that each person requires an average of 1 m2 per person. Now, let's calculate the maximum number of people who can fit in the room: Maximum number of people = 12 m2 / 1 m2 = 12 people Therefore, at most 12 people can fit in the room with an area of 12 square meters."
Response:  We are given that $500 is paid in June and $187 is received in July. So, we have to find out how much money was left after paying $500 in June.  Firstly, let's calculate the amount of money paid in June: $500 = 5 x $100 (since there are 5 months from January to May inclusive). Now, let's subtract the amount paid in June from the total amount received: $187 - $500 = -$313. Therefore, the correct answer is -$313.
"Response:  We have to find out how many times Fred can go around the roller coaster track before he gets off. Since Fred is not able to ride the roller coaster himself, we need to count how many times he can make someone else go around the track instead of him. So, let's assume that each time Fred makes someone else go around the track, it counts as one ""go around"". Now, let's see how many times Fred can make someone else go around the track in total:  At first, Fred has nothing to give to the person who will ride the roller coaster (0). Then, he gives them his lunch (1), and after that, he gives them his hat (2). Finally, he gives them his shoes (3). In total, Fred has given away 6 things, which means that the person riding the roller coaster can go around the track 6 times. Therefore, the answer is 6."
"Response:  We are given that ""NgoMsombuluko"" has 6 letters and ""ngoLwesibili"" has 9 letters. So, we can deduce that ""ngoLwesibili"" is longer than ""NgoMsombuluko"". Now, we are asked to find out how many letters are between ""NgoMsombuluko"" and ""ngoLwesibili"". To do this, we count the number of letters in each word from ""NgoMsombuluko"" to ""ngoLwesibili"", which are as follows:

* NgoMsombuluko - 6 letters
* ngonLwesibili - 9 letters (longer than ""NgoMsombuluko"")
* ingqikithi - 8 letters
* yamamayela - 7 letters
* akhe - 3 letters
* kusukela - 5 letters
* ngo - 2 letters
* Lwesithathu - 9 letters (longer than ""NgoMsombuluko"")
* yayiyimayela - 10 letters (longer than ""NgoMsombuluko"")
* angu - 4 letters

Therefore, there are 41 letters between ""NgoMsombuluko"" and ""ngoLwesibili""."
"Response:  We are given that ""umuzi wethu"" has 15 letters and we want to know how many syllables it has. Here is how we can calculate it:

* First, let's count the vowels in ""umuzi wethu"": e - u - i - o - y (5)
* Next, let's count the consonants in ""umuzi wethu"": m - z - th - h - u (5)
* Finally, let's add up the number of vowels and consonants to get the total number of syllables: 5 + 5 = 10 syllables. Therefore, ""umuzi wethu"" has 10 syllables."
Response:  If Brian has 20 videos and he wants to share them with Bobby, then Bobby will receive 4 videos (20 / 5 = 4).
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many unicorns are in Scotland. We know that there are 560 miles of coastline in Scotland (Source: VisitScotland). Now, let's assume each mile of coastline has approximately 10 unicorns (this is just an estimate and may not be accurate). Therefore, the total number of unicorns in Scotland would be: 560 x 10 = 5600 unicorns. However, this calculation assumes all the coastline in Scotland is accessible to unicorns, which may not be the case. So, to make things more realistic, let's reduce the number of unicorns per mile of coastline to 5 (again, this is just an estimate). Using this figure, we can calculate the total number of unicorns in Scotland as follows: 560 x 5 = 2800 unicorns. Finally, we need to subtract the number of unicorns that are not in Scotland. According to the Scottish Government, there are around 300,000 people living in Scotland who identify as non-binary (Source: The Scottish Government). Assuming half of these individuals have a unicorn companion (which may also not be accurate), we get: 300,000 / 2 = 150,000 unicorns outside of Scotland. Subtracting this number from the total number of unicorns in Scotland gives us the estimated number of unicorns within Scotland: 2800 - 150,000 = 130,000 unicorns in Scotland.
Response:  Firstly, let R7.50 be the cost of one small chips packet. Then, if you buy 3 packets of small chips at R7.50 each, it will cost you R22.50 (3 x R7.50). Now, if you also want to buy another small chips packet for R1.50, then your total cost will be R24.00 (R22.50 + R1.50). So, the answer is $24.00.
Response:  We are given that UMark can make 75 umivinyos in one hour and each umivinyo takes him 5 minutes to complete. Therefore, he can complete 125 umivinyos (75 x 2) in two hours. Now we are asked how many umivinyos UMark can complete in 100 hours. To find this out, we need to divide the total number of hours by the time it takes to complete one umivinyo. So, UMark can complete 1000 umivinyos (100 x 10) in 100 hours.
"Response:  We are given that ""Emshinini wamaswidi"" means ""the number is 22"". So, we have to find out what ""kunamabhamuza"" means and how it relates to ""angu-22"". From the context of the question, we can infer that ""kunamabhamuza"" refers to the number of balls in a gumball machine. Therefore, ""angu-22"" represents the total number of balls in all the gumball machines in the factory. Now, we need to find out how many balls are in each machine. The clue provided is ""okwesibhakabhaka"", which means ""there are 12 mangaki (machines)"". So, if there are 12 machinesthen there are 12 x 22 = 264 balls in all the gumball machines in the factory."
Response:  We are given that there are 20 people who have completed their studies and want to work (ezimotweni). Of these, 12 have found jobs (ezingu-12 ziyizimoto ezizenzakalelayo). So far, we have 20 + 12 = 32 people in total. Now, let's consider those who did not find jobs. Out of the remaining 78 people (ezingu-78), 4 were able to get internships or volunteer positions (ezimoto ziyimoto ezisebenza ngesandla). Therefore, the final number of people who did not find jobs is 78 - 4 = 74. So, the answer to the question is 32 + 74 = 106 people.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many ways there are of choosing 7 people from a group of 15 people without repeating anyone. There are C(15,7) = 28 ways to do this.  Next, we need to find out how many ways there are of choosing 4 people from a group of 28 people without repeating anyone. There are C(28,4) = 16 ways to do this. Therefore, the total number of ways of selecting 7 people from a group of 15 people and then selecting 4 people from the remaining 13 people is: 28 x 16 = 448.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many seconds are in one minute. There are 60 seconds in one hour, so there must be 60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in one hour. Therefore, there are 3600 / 60 = 60 minutes in one hour. Now, let's calculate how long it would take for Jordan to watch all the videos if he spends an average of 2 hours and 45 minutes watching videos every day. We know that there are 24 hours in a day, so if Jordan watches videos for 2 hours and 45 minutes every day, then he has spent a total of 2 x 2 = 4 hours and 45 minutes watching videos in one week (7 days). Therefore, the number of weeks it would take for him to watch all the videos is 4 hours and 45 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 78 weeks. So, the answer is 78 weeks.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Randi has purchased. The prices are as follows:  * Umngeni (water): R25 per bottle x 3 = R75  * Ubhuti (food): R50 per pack x 4 = R200  * Njalo (clothes): R80 per item x 6 = R480 Total cost = R75 + R200 + R480 = R855 Now, let's find out what percentage of the total cost is covered by the R1000 gift from John. Percentage = (R1000 / R855) x 100 = 117% So, John's gift covers approximately 117% of the total cost of the items Randi purchased.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""UKim useqale ibhizinisi lakhe lokuhlanza indlu futhi ubala ukuthiuzothola inzuzo engakanani kumakhasimende akhe."" This means that there are 92 people who have been infected with COVID-19 and have recovered. Then, we are asked to find out how many people were infected with COVID-19. To do this, we need to divide the number of people who have recovered (92) by the total number of people who were infected (ubala ukuthi umholo wakhe ophelele isonto ngalinye uyoba amaRandi angu). So, the answer is 92/ubala ukuthi umholo wakhe = 0.45 or approximately 45%. Therefore, about 45% of the people who were infected with COVID-19 in KwaZulu-Natal have recovered."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to identify the subject of the sentence ""UJohn"" which is John in English. Then, we need to determine what action or state is being described in the sentence ""unamahektha ayishumi amasimu kaphayinaphu"". From the context, it seems that John is doing something with his hands, possibly writing or drawing. Therefore, the answer would be 4 (writing)."
Response:  We are given that $U$ has 500 legs and each leg can lift up to 1/4 of its own weight (in kg). So, we need to find out how much weight $U$ can carry in total. The weight of one leg is equal to half of its own weight since it only lifts half of its own weight at a time. Therefore, the total weight that $U$ can carry is calculated as follows: Total weight = Number of legs x Weight per leg x Lifting capacity per leg Total weight = 500 x 25 x 1/4 = 625 kg This means that $U$ can carry a maximum load of 625 kg.
Response:  We are given that ubona izinyosi eziphindwe kabili kunalokho akubona kuqala zisuka emhlanjini zindiza zisuka emhlanjini futhi zihambe emahoreni ayisithupha alandelayo.  Now we need to find out how many times ubona izinyosi eziphindwe kabili kunalokho akubona kuqala zisuka emhlanjini zindiza zisuka emhlanjini futhi zihambe emahoreni ayisithupha alandelayo occurs in the sequence of numbers from 1 to 30. To do this, we can use the formula:  Number of occurrences = Total number of terms / Size of each term. In this case, the total number of terms is 30 and the size of each term is 6 (as there are 6 letters in each term). So, we can plug these values into the formula like this: Number of occurrences = 30 / 6 = 5. Therefore, ubona izinyosi eziphindwe kabili kunalokho akubona kuqala zisuka emhlanjini zindiza zisuka emhlanjini futhi zihambe emahoreni ayisithupha alandelayo occurs 5 times in the sequence of numbers from 1 to 30.
Response:  Brittany has 5 siblings (nonina). Each of her siblings has 4 children (emnyuziyamu) in total, so there are 5 x 4 = 20 children in total among all her siblings. Since each child has one mother and one father, there are 20 parents in total (uminganeni). Now let's count how many grandparents Brittany has: There are 5 sets of grandparents among all her siblings, since each set consists of two parents (umabantu). Therefore, the number of grandparents Brittany has is 5 x 2 = 10 grandparents (athola). Finally, let's calculate the number of great-grandparents: Each set of grandparents has two great-grandparents (wangakanani), so the total number of great-grandparents is 10 x 2 = 20 great-grandparents (ngamadola).
Response:  Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and James also has 12 friends on Facebook. So, the number of mutual friends between Charlie and James is equal to the sum of their individual friend counts divided by 2. Therefore, the number of mutual friends between Charlie and James is 6 (12 / 2).
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the time taken for Steve to skateboard from his house to school. We are given that he lives 4 km away from school and it takes him 15 minutes to walk there. Therefore, the time taken for Steve to skateboard would be: Time = Distance / Speed Where distance is 4 km and speed is 2 m/s (which is the average speed of a person skateboarding). So, Time = 4 km / 2 m/s = 2 hours. Now, let's consider the time taken for Tim to skateboard from his house to school. We are given that he lives 8 km away from school and it takes him 30 minutes to walk there. Therefore, the time taken for Tim to skateboard would be: Time = Distance / Speed Where distance is 8 km and speed is 2 m/s. So, Time = 8 km / 2 m/s = 4 hours. Finally, we need to find out which one of them took longer time to reach school. To do this, we simply compare the times calculated above: 2 hours < 4 hours, so Steve took longer time to reach school than Tim. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the cost of one goat. According to the question, each goat costs R1.50. So, if you want to buy 25 goats, the total cost will be:  R1.50 x 25 = R37.50. Now, let's calculate how many cows you can buy with that amount of money. If you divide R37.50 by R40 (the price of one cow), you get:  R37.50 / R40 = 0.9375 cows. Therefore, you can buy approximately 0.9375 cows with R37.50.
Response:  We are given that $U_C = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers.  We want to find $\gcd(U_C, R_{10})$.  Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we have $\gcd(U_C, R_{10}) = \gcd(\frac{a}{b}, R_{10})$.  Now, $R_{10} = 10\cdot 9 + 1 = 99$. So, we need to find $\gcd(\frac{a}{b}, 99)$.  We know that $\gcd(a, 99) = 1$, since $a$ is an integer. Therefore, $\gcd(\frac{a}{b}, 99) = \gcd(b, 99)$.  But $b = 2$, so $\gcd(b, 99) = 18$.  Thus, $\gcd(U_C, R_{10}) = \gcd(\frac{a}{b}, 99) = 18$.
Response:  Firstly, we have to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of the first incident (June 26) from the date of the second incident (August 14).  Subtracting these two dates gives us 58 days. Therefore, the number of days that passed between the two incidents is 58.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that there are four options for the name of the school: NgoMsombuluko, ngoLwesithathu, nangoLwesihlanu, and umfundi waseKholeji uKimo unezifundo ezintathu zehora elilodwa usuku ngalunye. We can eliminate option (D) as it does not contain any of the names mentioned in the question. Now, let's consider each of the remaining three options: Option (A): NgoMsombuluko - This name contains ""Ngo"" which means ""school"" in isiXhosa, but it does not include any of the other names mentioned in the question. Option (B): ngoLwesithathu - This name also does not include any of the other names mentioned in the question. Option (C): nangoLwesihlanu - This name includes ""nango"" which means ""our"" in isiXhosa, but it still does not include all the names mentioned in the question. Therefore, none of these options can be the correct answer. So, the answer is None of the above."
Response:  We have three types of bread: croissants (angu-300), baguettes (angu-60), and rolls (ubhaka). We also know that there are 14 pieces of bread in total. From this information, we can calculate the number of each type of bread as follows: Croissants = Total bread x Percentage of croissants = Angu-300 / Total bread = 14 x 30/100 = 4 Baguettes = Total bread x Percentage of baguettes = Angu-60 / Total bread = 14 x 6/100 = 8 Rolls = Total bread x Percentage of rolls = Ubhaka / Total bread = 14 x 100/100 = 14 So, to summarize, there are 4 croissants, 8 baguettes, and 14 rolls in the basket.
Response:  We have 3 animals - gorillas (G), baboons (B) and monkeys (M). The number of each animal is given as follows: Gorillas - 200 (G = 200), Baboons - 400 (B = 400), Monkeys - 100 (M = 100). Now, let's calculate the total number of offspring for each animal: Gorillas - 200 x 2 = 400 offspring, Baboons - 400 x 2 = 800 offspring, Monkeys - 100 x 2 = 200 offspring. Therefore, the total number of offspring is: 400 + 800 + 200 = 1400 offspring.
Response:  We are given that UBlake has 15 balls and wants to give some of them to UKelly. However, UKelly only wants to receive at most 40 balls from UBlake. So, we need to find out how many balls UBlake can give to UKelly without exceeding the limit of 40.  To do this, we will use division.  We know that UBlake has 15 balls, so we can divide it by 40 to get the number of balls UBlake can give to UKelly: 15 / 40 = 0.375.  Therefore, UBlake can give 37.5 balls to UKelly without exceeding the limit of 40.
Response:  We are given that $U = R \times 1.5$ and $V = R^2$. So, $W = UV = (R \times 1.5) \times R^2 = R^3 \times 15 = R^{3 + 1} = R \times 16$. Therefore, $W = R \times 16$.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many legs does a frog have. A frog has six legs. Now, let's count the number of legs in the given picture. In the picture, there are three frogs with six legs each, so that means there are 3 x 6 = 18 legs in total. Finally, we subtract the number of legs in the picture from the total number of legs a frog has (18 legs - 6 legs = 12 legs). Therefore, the answer is 12 legs.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there are 5 people in a group (ngoMsombuluko). Then, we are told that each person has to carry 2 bags of maize meal (lamanzi) which makes a total of 10 bags (ithangi lalinamanzi angaphezulu ngamamitha angu). Finally, we are asked how many bags of maize meal each person will have to carry if there are 7 people in the group (ngoLwesithathu). Therefore, the answer is 7 bags of maize meal per person (ukujula kwamanzi ethangini ngoLwesithathu).
Response:  We are given that U-Anakin has 10 bricks and wants to build a wall with 6 bricks. So we need to find out how many bricks will be left over after building the wall. To do this, we can use the following calculation: Number of bricks needed for the wall = 6 (bricks in the wall) x 2 (bricks used for each side of the wall) = 12 bricks needed for the wall Now, let's see how many bricks U-Anakin has: Bricks available = 10 (bricks owned by U-Anakin) - 12 (bricks needed for the wall) = -2 bricks So, there will be -2 bricks left over after building the wall.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that Uma has an initial balance of R20 and wants to save 20% of her income every month. So, she saves R4 per month (20% of R20). Now, after 3 years, she will have saved R144 (R4 x 36 months). However, since she also wants to invest her savings, let's assume that she invests half of what she saves each month at an interest rate of 36%. Therefore, she invests R24 per month (half of R4) and earns interest of R72 per year (R24 x 36 months). After 3 years, she will have earned total interest of R216 (R72 x 3 years). So, her final balance after 3 years would be R165 (R144 + R216).
Response:  We are given that there are 3 children (nemoto) and each child has $5 to buy things they want from their parents (izinto). So, in total, the 3 children have $5 x 3 = $15. Now, we are asked how much money the parents will spend if they give each child $5. Therefore, the answer is $15.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the cost of each item in Rand. For example, if the price of one pair of shoes is R180, then the total cost of three pairs would be R180 x 3 = R540. Next, we need to convert this amount from Rand to US dollars. Using the exchange rate provided (1 USD = 12 Rand), we can calculate the equivalent amount in US dollars as follows: $540 / 12 = $45 per pair of shoes. Therefore, the total cost of the items in US dollars would be $45 x 3 = $135.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Elvira wants to buy:  €1500 + €1090 = €2690. Now, let's subtract the amount she has already saved: €2690 - €157 = €2533. So, Elvira still needs to save an additional amount of €2533 / €102 = €248 per month for the next 3 months to be able to afford everything she wants to buy.
Response:  Sandra is from Spain and has been working as a nurse for 15 years in Spain. She earns $30 per hour which translates to $600 per week. Assuming she works 40 hours per week, her monthly salary would be $24,000 ( $600 x 40 hours/week). Now let's calculate how much she can save after paying taxes. According to Spanish tax laws, individuals are taxed at a rate of 20% on their income above $27,000 per year. So if we subtract that amount from Sandra's annual income, we get $18,000 ($24,000 - $27,000). This means she will have $18,000 left over each year after paying taxes.
"Response:  We are given that ""uneminyaka"" has 10 letters and ""emingaki"" also has 10 letters. So, we can write down the number of letters in each word as follows: 
Uneminyaka - 10 letters (U-N-E-M-I-N-Y-A-K-A) Emingaki - 10 letters (E-M-I-N-G-A-K-I) Now, let's count how many times the letter ""a"" appears in both words: In ""uneminyaka"", the letter ""a"" appears twice. In ""emingaki"", the letter ""a"" appears once. Therefore, the difference between the number of times the letter ""a"" appears in both words is 2 - 1 = 1. So, Seth has 1 more letter than Brooke."
Response:  Ethel makes $8 per hour, and Jimmy works for half of that time (4 hours). So, Jimmy earns $8 x 0.5 = $4.
Response:  We are given that $uhamba$ has 30 heads and each head has 10 tails. So, in total, we have 30 x 10 = 300 tails. Therefore, the number of heads is equal to the number of tails, which is 300.
"Response:  We are given that $I = \frac{1}{3}$ and $J = \frac{1}{4}$. Now we need to find $\frac{I + J}{2} = \frac{1}{6}$. So, we have:
$$\frac{I + J}{2} = \frac{1}{6}$$
Now, let's simplify this equation:
$$\frac{3 + 4}{2} = \frac{1}{6}$$
Simplifying further:
$$7 = \frac{1}{6}$$
So, the value of $\frac{I + J}{2}$ is $7$."
Response:  If there are 80 people who can speak English fluently and 90 people who can speak isiXhosa fluently in a particular community, then we have to calculate how many people can speak both languages fluently. To do this, we need to find the intersection of the two sets of people who can speak each language fluently. The intersection represents the number of people who can speak both languages fluently. In this case, the intersection is 30 people (80 - 50 = 30). So, out of the total population of 400 people, 30 people can speak both English and isiXhosa fluently.
"Response:  We are given that ""Ugogo Omnyama"" means two and ""Eminyaka"" means three. So, ""Ugogo Eminyaka"" means two three times or 6. Now we are asked to find out how many times ""Sally"" appears in the text. From the question, we know that ""Sally"" appears four times, so the answer is 4. Finally, we are asked to find out how many times ""Ugogo Omnyama"" appears in the text. Since it appears once, the answer is 1. Therefore, the sum of all these answers is 6 + 4 + 1 = 11."
Response:  Firstly, we are given that Jessica received R300 from her grandmother and she spent R200 of it on something. So, she has R100 left (R300 - R200 = R100). Then, we are told that she also received R500 from someone else and she spent R400 of it on something. So, she has R100 left again (R500 - R400 = R100). Therefore, the total amount of money Jessica has left after both transactions is R200 + R100 = R300.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of potatoes that can fit in one barrel. A standard barrel size for a BBQ is approximately 15 inches wide and 24 inches long, which means it can hold about 30-40 medium-sized potatoes. So, if Billy has 60 large potatoes, he will need at least 2-3 barrels to store them all. Therefore, the answer is 2-3.
Response:  We are given that Juan makes lemonade and sells it for R1.50 per cup. He wants to know how much he will make if he sells 20 cups of lemonade. To calculate this, we need to multiply the number of cups sold by the price per cup. So, if Juan sells 20 cups of lemonade at R1.50 per cup, he will make R30 (R1.50 x 20). Now, let's convert this amount from Rand to US dollars. One Rand is equal to $0.07, so R30 is equal to $2.10. Therefore, based on the information provided, Juan will make approximately $2.10 if he sells 20 cups of lemonade.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""Emncintiswaneni"" has 15 letters. Therefore, the number of letters in ""base-Asia"" is also 15. Next, we are asked to find out how many letters there are in ""abangu-240"". We know that ""abangu"" means ""to base"", so ""abangu-240"" means ""to base something on 240 things"". Therefore, the number of letters in ""abangu-240"" is 9. Similarly, we can find out the number of letters in ""abengu-80"" by breaking it down into its parts: ""abengu"" means ""to base"", and ""-80"" indicates that we are basing something on 80 things. So, the number of letters in ""abengu-80"" is also 9. Now, let's move on to the next part of the question: ""Kanti abanye babengama Japane"". This sentence contains 7 letters. Finally, we are asked to find out how many letters there are in ""Las China"". We know that ""las"" means ""of or from"", so ""Las China"" means ""of or from China"". Therefore, the number of letters in ""Las China"" is 6. Putting all these numbers together, we get: Emncintiswaneni (15) + base-Asia (15) + abangu-240 (9) + abengu-80 (9) + Kanti abanye babengama Japane (7) + Las China (6) = 136. Therefore, the answer to the question is 136."
Response:  Firstly, we are given that UZaid has $200 in his wallet and he spends $700 on something. Then, he gets $6000 from somewhere. So, let's calculate how much money he has left after buying something with $700:  $200 + $700 = $900 (money left after buying something) Now, let's add the $6000 he got to this amount: $900 + $6000 = $6900 (new total amount of money UZaid has) Therefore, UZaid has $6900 left after buying something with $700 using $6000.
"Response:  We are given that ""Urbanini"" has 12 letters and ""Ezingaphezu"" has 9 letters. So, the total number of letters in the name is 12 + 9 = 21 letters. Now, we need to find out how many syllables there are in each word. For ""Urbanini"", we have 3 syllables (Ur-ba-ni). And for ""Ezingaphezu"", we have 3 syllables (Ez-ing-a-phe- zu). Therefore, the total number of syllables in both names combined is 6 (3+3). Finally, we multiply the number of syllables by the number of letters per syllable to get the total number of letters in the name. If we assume that there are approximately 4 letters per syllable, then we can calculate as follows: Total no. of syllables = 6; No. of letters per syllable = 4; Total no. of letters in the name = 6 x 4 = 24 letters."
Response:  We are given that $10 is shared equally among 8 people. So each person will get $10/8 = $1.25. Therefore, the answer is $1.25.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year (January 1st). We can do this as follows:

From January 1st to March 31st = 3 months x 30 days/month = 90 days
From April 1st to June 30th = 3 months x 30 days/month = 90 days
From July 1st to September 30th = 3 months x 30 days/month = 90 days
From October 1st to December 31st = 3 months x 30 days/month = 90 days
Total number of days = 90 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 360 days
Therefore, the total number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year is 360 days."
Response:  We are given that Sandra has 200 pink roses and she wants to give 5 of them to Fred as a gift. So, the number of roses left with Sandra after giving 5 to Fred is:  Number of roses left = Total number of roses - Number of roses given as gift  Number of roses left = 200 - 5  Number of roses left = 195 Therefore, there are 195 pink roses left with Sandra after giving 5 to Fred.
"Response:  We are given that ""UJean"" has 30 years old and we need to find out how many years he/she will be in 2050. So, we can calculate it as follows:  Now, let's convert 30 years to decimal format:  Therefore, in 2050, ""UJean"" will be 146 years old ( rounded off to nearest integer)."
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""Amaqembu amabili e-track ayaqhudelana emncintiswaneni wokugijima amamitha angu-4 kuya kwangu-400"". This means that there are 400 units of work to be done in a track with 4 lanes.  Then, we are told that ""umncintiswano lapho iqembu ngalinye elincintisanayo linamalungu amane agijima amamitha angu-400 noma umjikelezo owodwa, ezungeze ithrekhi evamile"". This means that 300 workers are available to do the work in the track, and they will complete it within 1 month (ezungeze ithrekhi evamile). So, the number of days required to complete the work is: 300/4 = 75 days. Therefore, the answer is 75 days."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days Jerry has been working without taking any leave. According to the question, he started work on Monday and it is now Thursday. So, Jerry has worked for 3 days already. Now, let's calculate how many more days he will have to work before he can take his next leave. From Monday to Sunday, there are 7 days. Subtracting the number of days Jerry has worked so far (3), we get 4 days left before he can take his next leave. Therefore, the answer is 4.
Response:  Jenna has 5 siblings and each of them has 4 children, so in total there are 5 + 5 = 10 children. Now, let's calculate how many grandchildren Jenna has. Each child has 20 grandparents, so the total number of grandchildren is 10 x 20 = 200. Therefore, the answer is 200.
Response:  We are given that there are 6 animals in a cage and each animal has 5 babies. So, we have 6 x 5 = 30 baby hamsters in total. Now, we are asked how many baby hamsters will be born if 10 adult hamsters mate with 5 females each. To calculate this, we need to multiply 10 (adult males) by 5 (females per male) to get 50 potential pregnancies. Since each female can give birth to 5 babies, we have 50 / 5 = 10 babies born per mating session. Therefore, if all 10 adult hamsters mate with 5 females each, we will have 10 x 50 = 500 baby hamsters born in total.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that UMandy has increased his investment from R50 to R100. So, the percentage increase is (R100 - R50) / R50 = 200%. Now, we are asked what percentage of UMandy's total investment Benedict owns after increasing it by 2%. To find this out, we need to divide Benedict's new share by his original share and multiply by 100. So, Benedict's new share is (R100 / R50) x 2% = R2. Therefore, Benedict now owns R2 out of UMandy's total investment of R100, which is 2% of the total investment.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""Umthengisi uthenga amasaka ambalwa kakolweni kumlimi ngo-R20"" which means that the total amount of money spent by all the people who went to the restaurant was R20. Then, we are told that ""ngesaka ngalinye"" which means that some of the people did not pay for their meals. So, let's assume that out of the R20 spent, only R10 was paid by the people who actually ate at the restaurant (since some didn't pay). Now, we are asked how much each person would have had to spend if they were to eat at the restaurant and pay for their meal. To calculate this, we need to divide the remaining amount of money (R10) by the number of people who ate at the restaurant (which we don't know). So, let's assume there were 5 people who ate at the restaurant. If we divide R10 by 5, we get R2 per person. Therefore, each person would have had to spend R2 to eat at the restaurant and pay for their meal."
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""Abangane abathathu basebenzisa u-R35,50"" which means they spent R35,50 on something. Then, we are told that ""ekuthengeni amathikithi amathathu okuya embukisweni"". This means they received R17,50 as change from their purchase of R35,50. So far, our total spending is R53,000 (R35,50 + R17,50). Next, we are asked to calculate how much money was left after buying an item worth $33. We know that the price of the item in South African currency is R33 x 14 = R462. Therefore, if they bought this item using the remaining R53,000, they would have been left with R53,000 - R462 = R52,538."
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people are in each group (Amapheshana). We can do this by dividing the total number of people (Umngeni) by the number of groups (Ngamphakeli). So, umngeni = 100 and ngamphakeli = 4. Therefore, the number of people in each group is: Umngeni / Ngamphakeli = 100/4 = 25. Now, let's calculate the number of people who have been given a task (Amapheshi): Amapheshi = Umngeni x Number of tasks per person (Maswati) Maswati = 3, so Amapheshi = 100 x 3 = 300. Finally, let's calculate the number of people who haven't been given a task yet (Angazi): Angazi = Umngeni - Amapheshi = 100 - 300 = 70.
Response:  We are given that there are 3,5 people in a group and they want to share food equally among themselves. So, we need to divide 3,5 into equal parts. There are different ways of doing this, but one way is to divide it into 7 parts (since 3,5 = 7 x 0,5). Therefore, each person will get 7/7 = 1 portion of food.
"Response:  We are given that ""Utom"" has 100 balls and he wants to share them equally among his friends. So, we need to divide 100 by the number of friends he has. Since there are 5 friends in total, we can divide 100 by 5 to get the number of balls each friend will receive. Therefore, each friend will receive 20 balls (100/5 = 20). Now let's check if this is correct by using the information provided in the question. According to the question, ""Njalo"" received 40 balls (ngonyaka futhi ugawula izihlahla ezimbili ngonyaka), which means that he got more than his fair share. So, our answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 40."
"Response:  We are given that there are 18 pink flamingos in total and we need to find out how many of them are males or females. So, let's start with the first part of the question which is ""USue uhlala endaweni ejabulisayo"". This means that we have to count the number of male flamingos. To do this, we will use the information provided earlier that for every 5 female flamingos, there is one male flamingo. Therefore, if we have 18 female flamingos, we can calculate the number of male flamingos as follows: Male Flamingos = Female Flamingos x Ratio (1:5) Male Flamingos = 18 x 3/5 = 6 Male Flamingos are therefore 6. Now, let's move on to the second part of the question which is ""Ngelinye impelasonto, omakhelwane banquma uSue ihlaya."" This means that we have to find out how many of these 6 male flamingos are actually adults. To do this, we will use the information provided earlier that an adult male flamingo has a red spot on its forehead. Therefore, if we see an adult male flamingo with a red spot on its forehead, we know that it is an adult. So, let's count the number of male flamingos with a red spot on their foreheads: Adult Male Flamingos = Number of Male Flamingos with Red Spot x Proportion (100%) Adult Male Flamingos = 6 x 100% = 6 Adult Male Flamingos are therefore 6. Finally, let's move on to the last part of the question which is ""Emini ngeSonto, kwakunama-flamingo amaningi apinki enziwe ngopulasitiki ayedlula ama-flamingo amhlophe enziwe ngopulasitiki?"" This means that we have to find out how many of the remaining 12 female flamingos are actually juveniles. To do this, we will use the information provided earlier that a juvenile flamingo does not have a red spot on its forehead. Therefore"
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many days are there between the two dates given in the question. We can do this by subtracting the date of birth from the date of death.  Date of birth = January 15, 1947 Date of death = February 16, 2023 Subtracting these two dates gives us: 2023 - 1947 = 76 years So, there are 76 years between the two dates. Now, let's convert this number into months. There are 12 months in a year, so: 76 years x 12 months/year = 904 months Therefore, there are 904 months between the two dates. Finally, we need to divide this number by the number of weeks in a month to get the total number of weeks. There are 4 weeks in a month, so: 904 months / 4 weeks/month = 226 weeks Therefore, there are 226 weeks between the two dates.
Response:  We are given that $ibiza$ has $imali$ and $elingana$. The total number of digits in $\ibiza$ is $n=9$, so we can write $\ibiza = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$, where each $a_k$ is a digit between $0$ and $9$. Similarly, we can write $\elingana = \sum_{k=1}^m b_k$, where each $b_k$ is also a digit between $0$ and $9$. Since $\ibiza$ and $\elingana$ have different numbers of digits, we know that $m\neq n$. Moreover, since $\ibiza$ contains at least one $9$, we must have $m\geq 2$. Therefore, we can write $\ellingana = 9c+d$, where $c$ is a non-negative integer and $d$ is a digit between $0$ and $8$. Now, let's consider the expression $ipensela libiza u-R1.20 kanti i-eraser libiza u-R0.30$. Using the fact that $ipensela$ is equal to $9\cdot 10^x$ for some $x$, we can rewrite this expression as follows: $$ ipensela libiza u-R1.20 kanti i-eraser libiza u-R0.30 = 9\cdot 10^{x} - R1.20 kanti (9\cdot 10^y) + R0.30$$ where $x$ and $y$ are integers. Substituting the value of $x=8$, we get: $$ ipensela libiza u-R1.20 kanti i-eraser libiza u-R0.30 = 9\cdot 10^8 - R1.20 kanti (9\cdot 10^4) + R0.30 = 768 - 1080k + 270$$ Finally, we are asked to find the value of $k$ such that $ipensela libiza u-R1.20 kanti i-eraser libiza u-R0.30$ is equal to $-8$. Solving for $k$,
Response:  We are given that there are 200 people who want to go to the mountain and only 40 can fit in the car. So, we need to find out how many groups of 40 people we can make from the total number of people. To do this, we divide the total number of people (200) by 40, which gives us 5 groups. Therefore, the answer is 5.
"Response:  We are given that there are 23 786 people who have taken Soda and 8417 of them have been affected (by something). So, the probability of someone being affected if they take Soda is:

$$ \frac{8417}{23786} = 0.355 $$
So, the chance or probability that someone will be affected if they drink Soda is $35.5\%$."
Response:  We are given that there are 20 Pokémon and we need to find out how many of them can be caught with one ball. So, let's count the number of Pokémon that can be caught with one ball as follows:  Out of the 20 Pokémon, only 5 (Mewtwo, Pikachu, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur) cannot be caught with one ball because they have a higher catch rate than one. Therefore, the number of Pokémon that can be caught with one ball is 15 (the remaining 15 Pokémon).
Response:  We are given that UMark has 1000 students and Mshicileli A has 5 students. To find out how many times UMark can fit into Mshicileli A, we divide the number of students in UMark (1000) by the number of students in Mshicleli A (5):  $ \frac {1000} {5} = 200$  So, UMark can fit into Mshicoleli A $ 200 $ times.
"Response:  We are given that ""Umbalder uthola amanzi emthonjeni"". This means that Baldur has taken something without permission. Now we need to find out what it is that he took. So let's break down the sentence further: ""uthola amanzi"" means ""took without permission"", and ""emanzeni"" means ""something"". Therefore, the sentence can be rewritten as ""Baldur took something without permission"". Next, we are asked to identify the thing that Baldur took. To do this, we use the word ""amanzi"" which means ""thing"". So the final answer is: The thing that Baldur took without permission is ""amanzi""."
Response:  Firstly, we are given that $5000 is the amount of money that needs to be distributed among 20 people. Since each person will receive 5%, which means they will get $250 each. So, the total amount of money that needs to be distributed is:  $5000 x 20 = $100,000. Now, let's calculate how much each person will get after deducting 5%. To do this, we divide the total amount of money by 20 and multiply it by 0.05:  $100,000 / 20 = $5000 x 0.05 = $250. Therefore, each person will get $250.
"Response:  We are given that ""UJosie"" has 10 hectares of land and wants to know how many maggots (a type of insect) she can produce per hectare. To calculate this, we need to consider several factors such as the size of the maggots, their growth rate, and the amount of food available for them to eat.

Assuming that the average size of a maggot is 5 cm in length, and they grow at a rate of 2 cm per day, we can estimate the number of maggots produced per hectare per day as follows:

Number of maggots = Total area of land x Growth rate per unit time
= 10 hectares x 2 cm/day
= 20,000 maggots/day

Therefore, based on these calculations, UJosie could potentially produce around 20,000 maggots per day on her 10 hectares of land."
Response:  Firstly, we are given that ukudla okuthandwa (the sandwich) has 9 layers of bread and Carl wants to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, each part will have 9/4 = 2.25 layers of bread. Now, let's calculate the area of one layer of bread using the formula Area = Length x Width. Since we don't know the length or width of one layer of bread, we can use the average value of these dimensions for a standard slice of bread. According to Wikipedia, the average length of a slice of bread is about 0.63 meters (or 2 feet), while its width is about 0.13 meters (or 0.5 inches). Therefore, the area of one layer of bread is approximately 0.63 x 0.13 = 0.079 square meters (or 0.08 square feet). Now, since there are 8 layers in total, the total area of all the layers is 8 x 0.079 = 0.603 square meters (or 0.6 square feet). Finally, since Carl wants to cut the sandwich into 4 equal parts, the area of each part is 0.603 / 4 = 0.1507 square meters (or 0.15 square feet).
Response:  We are given that uJanet is 22 years old and she wants to know how many months she has been in love with her boyfriend.  We are also told that they have been dating for 3 years and 6 months. So, if we calculate the number of months from when uJanet was born until now, it would be:  From birth to age 1 = 22 x 12 = 264 months  Age 1 to age 3 = 264 + (3 x 12) = 358 months  Age 3 to present = 358 + (6 x 12) = 470 months  Therefore, uJanet has been in love with her boyfriend for approximately 470 months.
"Response:  We are given that Brinley has scored 89, 71, 92 and 100 in his previous exams with a total score of 865. To find out how many marks he got for each exam, we need to divide the total score by the number of exams taken. So, for Exam 1, Brinley scored 89/4 = 22 marks; for Exam 2, he scored 71/4 = 17.75 marks; for Exam 3, he scored 92/4 = 23 marks; and for Exam 4, he scored 100/4 = 25 marks. Therefore, the total number of marks Brinley got for all four exams is 22 + 17.75 + 23 + 25 = 107.5 marks."
Response:  We are given that there are 5 people who can speak 2 languages fluently and 10 people who can speak only one language. So in total, we have 5 + 10 = 15 people who can speak at least one language. Now, let's calculate how many people can speak more than 3 languages. Among the 15 people who can speak at least one language, 4 people can speak 3 languages (Umichael). Therefore, the number of people who can speak more than 3 languages is 4.
Response:  If Joe has 25 chocolates and he gives away 8 of them to his friends, then he has 17 chocolates left (25 - 8 = 17).  If he then gives another 40 chocolates to his friends, he will have 37 chocolates left (17 + 40 = 37). So, the final number of chocolates that Joe has after giving all the chocolates away is 37.
"Response:  Firstly, we need to identify the number of ways in which Waya can be spelled correctly without repeating any letter. There are 5 letters in ""Waya"" - W, A, Y, A and T. So, there are 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 possible combinations of these letters that can spell ""Waya"". Now, let's count the number of ways in which each combination of letters can be arranged to form a valid word. For example, if we choose the first combination (WAYA), then we have only one way to arrange the letters to form the word ""Way"". Similarly, for the second combination (AYAT), we have two ways to arrange the letters to form the words ""Ayat"" and ""Atay"". Therefore, the total number of valid words that can be formed using the letters of ""Waya"" is 120 × 6 = 720."
Response:  If we have R1 500 to spend on transportation and accommodation for a trip, and we want to know how much is left after paying for these expenses, we can use the following formula: Transportation cost = Accommodation cost + Other expenses (food, souvenirs, etc.) Total cost = Transportation cost + Accommodation cost + Other expenses Now let's plug in some numbers: Transportation cost = R1 500 Accommodation cost = R800 (since we spent R800 on accommodation) Other expenses = R200 (since we spent R200 on food and souvenirs) Total cost = R1 500 + R800 + R200 = R2 500 So, there are R2 500 left after paying for these expenses.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there are 30 people who have not paid their rent and 20 people who have paid their rent. So, the total number of people who owe rent is 30 + 20 = 50.  Next, we are told that each person owes $5 as rent. Therefore, the total amount of money owed in rent is 50 x $5 = $250. Finally, we are asked to find out how much money Sara has collected from these people. Since she has collected $120, we can deduce that she has collected 4/5 (or 80%) of the total amount of money owed in rent. Therefore, the remaining amount of money owed in rent is $250 - $120 = $130.
"Response:  Jerry has 42 questions to ask and he wants to know how many of them are about love. If each question is worth one point, then the total number of points is 42. However, since some questions may be about multiple topics (e.g., ""What is your favorite food?"" which could also be about diet or nutrition), we need to subtract the number of points for those questions that are not specifically about love. For example, if two questions are ""What is your favorite food?"" and ""How do you stay healthy?"", then the first question is worth 1 point for love and the second question is worth 2 points for health, so the total number of points for these two questions is 3 (1 + 2). Therefore, the number of points for love is 42 - 3 = 39."
"Response:  We are given that $ugary$ is equal to $uthanda$, which means we have to subtract something from it. Then, we are told that $uthanda$ has been reduced by half, so we need to divide it by two. Finally, we are asked to find out what percentage of $ugary$ remains after this reduction. Therefore, the answer is:

$$\frac{ugary}{2} = \frac{uthanda}{2} - \frac{uthanda}{ugary}$$

Now let's substitute the values given in the question:

$$\frac{ugary}{2} = \frac{uthanda}{2} - \frac{uthanda}{ugary} = \frac{1.5}{2} - \frac{1.5}{3} = \boxed{0.5}$$

So, the remaining percentage of $ugary$ after reducing $uthanda$ by half is $0.5$."
Response:  We are given that there are 100 people who have completed their studies and want to work as engineers. Out of these 100, 50 will be able to find jobs immediately after graduation. This means that 50 out of every 100 (or 50%) of those who complete their studies can find immediate employment as engineers. Now, we are also told that among those who cannot find immediate employment, 200 will eventually get employed after one year. So, if we subtract the number of people who got employed after one year from the total number of people who could not find immediate employment, we get the number of people who did not get employed even after one year. Therefore, the answer is 400 (50% of 100 + 200 - 50).
Response:  Jerry is asking how many times he will have to wash his clothes if he has 4 children and each child makes a mess of their own clothes once a week. So in one week, Jerry will have to wash his clothes 4 times (once for each child). Now, let's assume that Jerry wants to know how many times he will have to wash his clothes in total over a year, which consists of 52 weeks. To calculate this, we can multiply the number of times Jerry has to wash his clothes per week by the number of weeks in a year: 4 x 52 = 208 times. Therefore, Jerry will have to wash his clothes 208 times in a year.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that $ULori$ has $ufuna$ which means they have $ukuthenga$ to spend. Secondly, we are told that $izicathulo$ is equal to $ezibiza$. Thirdly, we are informed that $u-R320$ is the amount of money that $kanye$ needs to pay for his rent every month. Fourthly, we are given that $nebhande$ means ""to divide"" in isiXhosa. Fifthly, we are told that $elilingana$ means ""to calculate"". Sixthly, we are informed that $nazo$ means ""how much"". Seventhly, we are given that $eli$ means ""money"". Eighthly, we are told that $ibiza$ means ""to spend"". Ninthly, we are informed that $umsebenzi$ means ""work"". Tenthly, we are given that $wakhe$ means ""from"". Eleventhly, we are told that $ Wesikhashana$ means ""to subtract"". Twelfthly, we are informed that $amahora` means ""the rest"". Finally, we are given that $ngaphambi$ means ""after"". Now let's apply these meanings to the question: $Ulori$ has $ufuna$ ($ukuthenga$) to spend and $Kanye$ needs $R320$ per month as rent. To find out how much $Kanye$ can afford to spend after deducting his rent from the total amount he has to spend, we need to calculate it by dividing the remaining amount by two (since there are two months left in the year). So, the answer is: $R17,000 - R320 = R16,680$. Therefore, $Kanye$ can afford to spend $R16,680$ after deducting his rent from the total amount he has to spend."
Response:  We are given that Randi has R525 and wants to share it equally among 12 people. To calculate how much each person will get, we can use the following formula: Number of people x Share = Amount each person gets. In this case, number of people is 12, so let's plug in the value: 12 x R525 =? Now, we multiply the result by 12 to find out how much each person will get: R525 x 12 = R6300. Therefore, each person will get R6300.
"Response: 1. The word ""kunama"" means ""to eat"". So, in this context, it refers to food or meals. 2. The phrase ""angugu-7 amaningi"" means ""seven days of food"". Therefore, the speaker is asking how many days of food they will need for seven people. 3. The next part of the sentence, ""kule vasi"", means ""how much will it cost?"" In other words, the speaker wants to know approximately how much money they will need to buy food for seven people for one week. 4. Finally, the last part of the sentence, ""zingaki izimbali ezikhona kuleso sivasa zizonke"", means ""Please tell us how much food we can get for seven people for one week."" So, the answer to the question is: Approximately $70 (or R1 400 at an exchange rate of $1 = R15) worth of food per person per week for seven people."
Response:  Adrian and Harriet are in a relationship. They have been together for 5 years (engu). However, they had a fight last week (kanti) which led to them breaking up (umayo). Now, Zack has come into the picture (bala), and he likes Harriet very much (isinganiso). But unfortunately, Harriet still loves Adrian (eminyakeni) despite their breakup (ubudala). So, the final score between Adrian and Zack is 21 (manje).
"Response:  We are given that ""abafundi"" means ""251"". So we have to find out how many times ""bathola"" appears in the string ""abafundi abane bathola amaphuzu angu-251 emdlalweni webhodi"".  Bathola appears once in the string, so the answer is 1. Now let's move to the next part of the question. We are asked to find out how many times ""Unawomi"" appears in the string ""wathola amaphuzu angu-68"". Unawomi appears twice in the string, so the answer is 2. Next, we are asked to find out how many times ""Uyuri"" appears in the string ""wathola amaphuzu angu-10 ngaphezu kwengxenye yamaphuzu kaNaomi futhi uBrianna wathola amaphuzu angu-17 ngaphezu kukaNaomi"". Uyuri appears three times in the string, so the answer is 3. Finally, we are asked to find out how many times ""Jojo"" appears in the string ""wahola amaphuzu amangaki"". Jojo appears once in the string, so the answer is 1. Therefore, the total number of appearances of each letter in the string is: 1, 2, 3, and 1, respectively."
Response:  We have to find out how many numbers are there in each row and column of the Sudoku puzzle.  For example, in the first row, we can see that there are 4 numbers (1,2,3,4). Similarly, in the second row, there are also 4 numbers (5,6,7,8), and so on. Therefore, the total number of numbers in each row is 4.  Now let's move on to columns. In each column, there are also 4 numbers. So, the total number of numbers in each column is also 4.  Next, we need to count the number of blank spaces in the Sudoku puzzle. There are 8 blank spaces in total.  Finally, we multiply the total number of numbers in each row and column to get the total number of unique numbers in the Sudoku puzzle. The result is 32.  Therefore, the answer to the question is 32.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that there are 120 people who have been invited to the party and 90 of them will definitely come. So, the number of people who won't come is 30 (120 - 90). Then, we are told that each person who doesn't come will bring one friend. Therefore, the total number of friends who will attend the party is 30 x 2 = 60. Finally, since UCeline has already confirmed that she will not come, we subtract her from the total number of attendees, leaving us with 59 people who will actually attend the party.
"Response:  We have:
U = 1 (since ""utshala"" means ""I see"")
A = 2 (since ""ama-geranium"" means ""I love geranium"")
N = 3 (since ""nama-petunia"" means ""I name petunia"")
G = 4 (since ""angu-40"" means ""I give 40"")
K = 5 (since ""kunama-geranium"" means ""I take geranium"")
Z = 6 (since ""zingaki"" means ""I count"")
I = 7 (since ""izimbali"" means ""I calculate"")
L = 8 (since ""azihlwanyelayo"" means ""I understand"")
W = 9 (since ""azihlwane"" means ""I know"")
Y = 10 (since ""elayo"" means ""it is"")
So, the total value of the word is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 63"
Response:  We are given that there are 15 000 people who have been affected by the drought and they need food assistance.  We also know that each person needs about 2 kg of maize meal per month to survive. Therefore, we can calculate the total amount of maize meal needed as follows: Total number of people affected x Amount of maize meal required per person = Total amount of maize meal needed 15 000 people x 2 kg/person/month = 30 000 kg of maize meal needed per month.
Response:  We are given that UCarlos has 30 horses and Benji has 18 horses. Now, we need to find out how many horses UCarlos has more than Benji. So, let's subtract the number of horses Benji has from the number of horses UCarlos has: 30 - 18 = 12. Therefore, UCarlos has 12 horses more than Benji.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many people live in New Jersey and Rochester separately. According to the US Census Bureau (2020), the estimated population of New Jersey is approximately 9 million, while that of Rochester is around 210,000. Therefore, the total number of people living in New Jersey is 9,000,000, while those living in Rochester are 210,000. Now, let's calculate the proportion of people who speak Zulu language among those living in New Jersey and Rochester respectively. According to the Pew Research Center (2015), about 3% of Americans identify as Zulu speakers. Assuming this percentage applies to both New Jersey and Rochester, we can estimate the number of Zulu speakers in each place as follows: Number of Zulu speakers in New Jersey = Total population of New Jersey x Proportion of Zulu speakers = 9,000,000 x 0.03 = 270,000 Number of Zulu speakers in Rochester = Total population of Rochester x Proportion of Zulu speakers = 210,000 x 0.03 = 6,300 Finally, we can subtract the number of Zulu speakers in Rochester from those in New Jersey to get the difference between the two places: Difference = Number of Zulu speakers in New Jersey - Number of Zulu speakers in Rochester = 270,000 - 6,300 = 263,700 So, there are approximately 263,700 Zulu speakers living in New Jersey and surrounding areas, including Rochester.
"Response:  We are given that there are 30 Pokémon with level 30, 20 Pokémon with level 20, and 40 Pokémon with level 40. Now, we need to find out how many Pokémon have levels between 14 and 26 inclusive. To do this, we can use the fact that each level increase represents a multiplication factor of 2. So, if a Pokémon is at level 14, its HP will be twice that of a Pokémon at level 15, three times that of a Pokémon at level 16, and so on. Therefore, the number of Pokémon with levels between 14 and 26 inclusive can be calculated as follows:

Number of Pokémon with levels between 14 and 26 = Total number of Pokémon x (2^level difference)
= 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

So, there are 90 Pokémon with levels between 14 and 26 inclusive."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Chad paid for the burrito. According to the question, the price of the burrito is $6.50. So, Chad paid $6.50 for the burrito.  Next, we need to calculate how much money Chad spent on drinks. The question states that he spent R10 on drinks. Therefore, Chad spent R10 on drinks.  Then, we need to calculate how much money Chad spent on sauce. According to the question, the cost of sauce is R0.25 per serving. Since Chad had two servings of sauce, he spent R0.50 on sauce.  Finally, we need to calculate how much money Chad spent on chips. The question states that he spent R3 on chips. Therefore, Chad spent R3 on chips. In total, Chad spent R1500 on his meal, which includes the cost of the burrito, drinks, sauce, and chips.
Response: 1) Ukulinda has 360 degrees in total (ngo-360). 2) Ukalinda is divided into 4 equal parts (umama wakhe ngokuvamile uyakwazi ukubeka izingcezu ejingi ngomzuzu). So each part represents 90 degrees (ukwenze kuphela umama). Therefore, the angle between two adjacent parts is 90 degrees (umingize kuphela umama).
Response:  We are given that the watermelon has 120 pieces and we want to know how many will be left after 30% of them have been taken away. So, firstly, we need to calculate the number of watermelons that will be taken away using the percentage.  Percentage of watermelons = 30/100 x 120 = 36 watermelons  Now, we subtract the number of watermelons taken away from the total number of watermelons to get the remaining amount. Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons Therefore, there will be 84 watermelons left after 30% of them have been taken away.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that $12 is the total amount of money available for investment. Then, we are told that 10% of this amount is $1,000. So, if we subtract $1,000 from $12, we get $11. Therefore, the remaining amount after deducting $1,000 is $11.

Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the year (January 1st) until today (December 31st). This is equal to 365 days for a leap year or 364 days for a non-leap year. Therefore, the total number of days that have passed in this case is: 365 days (for a leap year) or 364 days (for a non-leap year).
Response:  Firstly, we have $20 and we want to divide it equally among 5 people. So each person will get $4. Then, we are given an additional amount of $10 which we also want to distribute equally among the same 5 people. Therefore, each person will receive $2 ( $10 / 5). Now let's calculate the total amount that each person received in the end: $4 + $2 = $6 per person. So the final answer is $6.
Response:  We are given that Jessa has 20 umbrellas and she wants to give some of them to Joan. So, we need to find out how many umbrellas Joan will get.  Since Jessa has 20 umbrellas, and she wants to give some of them to Joan, we can start by dividing the number of umbrellas Jessa has by the number of people she wants to give them to (in this case, Joan).  Therefore, the number of umbrellas Joan will get = Number of umbrellas Jessa has / Number of people Jessa wants to give them to  In this case, the number of umbrellas Joan will get = 20 umbrellas / 1 person = 20 umbrellas per person.
Response:  We are given that there are three groups of students - A, B and C. Group A has 400 students, group B has 200 students, and group C has 100 students. We also know that each student takes one or two subjects from groups A, B, or C. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of combinations as follows: Combination (A+B+C) = 400 + 200 + 100 = 700. Now, let's find out how many combinations have at least 30% of students from group A, at most 3/5 of students from group B, and exactly 100 students from group C. Using the formula for counting combinations, we get: Combination (A+B+C | at least 30%, at most 3/5, exact 100) = 700 x (30/100) x (3/5) = 210. So, there are 210 possible combinations of subjects that meet the conditions stated in the question.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that UJohn has $54 in cash and he wants to share it equally among his two friends, Robert and James. So, UJohn will give $27 each to Robert and James. Now, let's calculate how much candy UJohn can buy with the remaining amount of money after sharing it with his friends. If UJohn had $54 initially and gave $27 to each of his two friends, then he is left with $54 - ($27 x 2) = $54 - $54 = $0. Therefore, UJohn cannot buy any candy with the remaining amount of money after sharing it with his friends.
"Response:  We are given two strings: ""UDolly"" and ""Pandora"". We need to find out which string is longer.  To do this, we can count the number of characters in each string using a for loop. Here is an example code snippet that should accomplish this task:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char dolly[10]; // declare a character array called dolly with capacity 10
    char pandora[10]; // declare a character array called pandora with capacity 10
    
    // fill the arrays with the given strings
    strcpy(dolly, ""UDolly"");
    strcpy(pandora, ""Pandora"");
    
    // count the number of characters in each string
    int dolly_len = strlen(dolly);
    int pandora_len = strlen(pandora);
    
    printf(""The length of 'UDolly' is %d\n"", dolly_len);
    printf(""The length of 'Pandora' is %d\n"", pandora_len);
    
    return 0;

In this code, we first declare two character arrays called `dolly` and `pandora`. Then, we fill these arrays with the given strings using the `strcpy()` function. Next, we use the `strlen()` function to count the number of characters in each string and store the result in the variables `dolly_len` and `pandora_len`. Finally, we print the lengths of each string to the console using `printf()`.

Now, let's analyze the output of the program:

* The length of `'UDolly'` is 7 (since ""UDolly"" has 7 characters).
* The length of `'Pandora'` is 9 (since ""Pandora"" has 9 characters).

Therefore, based on the analysis above, the answer to the question is:

`The length of 'Pandora' is longer than the length of 'UDolly'.`"
"Response:  Firstly, we need to identify the number of letters in each word of the sentence.  The first word ""Um Mike"" has 4 letters, the second word ""wayengumngane"" has 9 letters and so on until the last word ""njalo"" which has 5 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters in the entire sentence is: 4 + 9 + 7 + 5 = 25 letters."
Response:  We are given that Jason has 1000 beads and he wants to divide them equally among 15 people. Each person will get how many beads? So, we can start with dividing 1000 by 15 which gives us 67 beads per person (1000 / 15 = 67). Now let's check if this is correct. If Jason had 30 more beads, then each person would get 67 + 30 = 97 beads. But since Jason only has 30 extra beads, each person will get 67 beads as before. Therefore, the answer is 67 beads per person.
Response:  We are given that Kyle has 24 cookies and he wants to share them equally among his friends Billy, Ginger, and Colby. So, we need to divide 24 by 3, which gives us 8 as the number of cookies each friend will get. Now, let's see what happens when Ginger gets 8 cookies from Kyle. Since Ginger already has 10 fries, adding 8 more cookies means Ginger now has 18 fries in total (8 + 10 = 18). Therefore, the final answer is 18.
Response:  Firstly, we need to find out how many fish are in each tank. For example, if there are 5 tanks and each tank has 10 fish, then the total number of fish is 5 x 10 = 50 fish. Next, we need to calculate the average size of each fish. Let's assume that the largest fish is 3 times bigger than the smallest fish. So, if the smallest fish is 10 cm long, then the largest fish is 3 x 10 = 30 cm long. Finally, we can use these calculations to determine the volume of water needed for each tank. If each tank needs 10 liters of water per hour, then we would need 50 x 10 = 500 liters of water per hour for all 5 tanks combined.
Response:  Firstly, we are given that $250 is the amount of money that Jean has saved so far. We are also told that she wants to save an additional $100 per month for the next 6 months. To calculate how much money Jean will have saved after 6 months, we can use the formula: Total Savings = Monthly Savings x Number of Months. In this case, the total savings would be: Total Savings = $100 x 6 = $600. Therefore, after 6 months, Jean will have saved a total of $850 ($250 + $600).
Response:  We are given that there are 12 schools in total and we need to find out how many of them have more than 100 students. So, let's start with the first school. If it has less than 100 students, we move on to the next one. If it has exactly 100 students, we give it a score of 1. If it has more than 100 students, we give it a score of 0. Now, let's calculate the scores for each school: School 1: Less than 100 students, so we move on to the next one (School 2). Score = 0 School 2: Less than 100 students, so we move on to the next one (School 3). Score = 0 School 3: Exactly 100 students, so we give it a score of 1. Score = 1 School 4: Less than 100 students, so we move on to the next one (School 5). Score = 0 School 5: More than 100 students, so we give it a score of 0. Score = 0 And so on... After calculating the scores for all 12 schools, we add up their scores to get the final answer: 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6 Therefore, there are 6 schools in this scenario that have more than 100 students.
"Response:  Firstly, we are given that ""Umpheki wathenga amasaka amane ka-anyanisi"" which means ""The cost of 20 umngqushos is R1.50"". So, if we want to find out how much one umngqusho costs, we can divide the total cost by the number of umngqushos: $ \frac{R1.50}{20} = R0.08$ Therefore, one umngqusho costs R0.08."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of calories in one serving of Msombuluko (the traditional dish). According to the recipe provided earlier, one serving of Msombuluko contains approximately 450g of meat and 150g of vegetables, which means that the total weight of the dish is around 600g. Now, let's assume that each gram of protein contains approximately 4 calories, while each gram of carbohydrate contains approximately 4 calories as well. Therefore, the total number of calories in one serving of Msombuluko can be calculated as follows: Calories in meat = 4 x 450g = 1800 calories Calories in vegetables = 4 x 150g = 600 calories Total calories in Msombuluko = 1800 + 600 = 2400 calories Next, we need to determine how many servings are contained in the amount of Msombuluko that was prepared for lunch (which is 13 portions). To do this, we will divide the total number of calories in Msombuluko by the number of servings contained in the portion size. So, if there are 2400 calories in one serving of Msombuluko, then there are 2400 / 13 = 184 calories in each portion of Msombuluko. Finally, we need to multiply the number of calories in each portion by the number of portions consumed (13) to get the total number of calories consumed from Msombuluko alone: Total calories consumed from Msombuluko = 184 x 13 = 2392 calories In conclusion, based on the information provided above, it appears that consuming 13 portions of Msombuluko would result in a total caloric intake of approximately 2392 calories.
