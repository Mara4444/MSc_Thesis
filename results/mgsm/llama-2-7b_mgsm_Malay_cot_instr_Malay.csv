  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Firstly, we know that Janet sells 16 eggs per day. Then she eats 3 for breakfast every morning and makes muffins for her friends with the remaining eggs, which is 4 eggs per day. Now let's calculate how much money she can earn from selling the excess eggs at the farmer's market. The price of each egg is $2, so if she sells 8 eggs (excess eggs - 4 eggs used to make muffins), then she will earn $2 x 8 = $16 per day. Therefore, Janet can earn $16 per day by selling the excess eggs at the farmer's market.

Therefore, the number of boys in the Girl Scout is 2/5 x 200 = 40. Lastly, we need to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scout. Since 2/3 of the students in class 5 are in the Girl Scout, the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout is (3/5) x 200 = 60. Therefore, the answer is 40 + 60 = 100 girls who are not in the Girl Scout.

To find out how many hours Harry slept, we can divide the total number of hours he slept by the fraction of time that James slept. In this case, Harry slept for 9 hours and James slept for 2/3 of 9 hours = 6 hours. Therefore, Harry slept for 9 - 6 = 3 hours more than James.
  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Firstly, we know that when Freda cooked the tomatoes in the tin, she lost half of them. This means that if she had 16 auns of tomatoes to start with, she would have only 8 auns left after cooking.  Secondly, we know that each batch of sos Tomato contains three tomatoes. Therefore, if Freda made 32 auns of sos Tomato, she must have used 10 auns of tomatoes (3 x 10 = 30).  Finally, we can calculate the number of tomatoes Freda originally had by dividing the total amount of sos Tomato she made by the number of tomatoes per batch. In this case, 32 auns / 3 auns per batch = 10 auns of tomatoes. So, Freda originally had 10 auns of tomatoes.

Next, we are told that after the initial delay, another 20 trains passed through the intersection without any delays. Therefore, the total time taken for all 30 trains to pass through the intersection is 150 + 20 x (no delay) = 270 minutes.

According to the problem, the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. Therefore, the number of times the first friend pressed the doorbell is 20.  Next, let's find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. According to the problem, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend. Since the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed the doorbell 5 times (since 1/4 of 20 is 5). Therefore, the total number of times the first two friends pressed the doorbell is 20 + 5 = 25 times.  Now, let's find out how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell. According to the problem, the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend. Since the second friend pressed the doorbell 5 times, the third friend pressed the doorbell 5 x 2 = 10 times. Therefore, the total number of times the first three friends pressed the doorbell is 25 + 10 = 35 times.  Finally, let's find out how many times the fourth friend pressed the doorbell. According to the problem, the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times if Jerome did not open it. However, since Jerome did open it, we know that the fourth friend did not press the doorbell 60 times. Therefore, the answer is 0.

 13, or 1.46. Since Kael brought more than twice as many apples as Morisette, we can say that for every apple brought by Morisette, Kael brought approximately 1.46 apples. Similarly, for every orange brought by Morisette, Kael brought approximately 0.77 oranges (since he brought half as many oranges as Morisette). Therefore, the total number of fruit brought by both Morisette and Kael is 13 + 0.77 x 13 = 24.

  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Firstly, we know that Julia bought a new pack of straws (su du) because she had run out of them. The pack contained 5 straws.  Then, her husband also bought a new pack of straws and gave it to Julia. This means that Julia now has a total of 6 straws (the 5 from the original pack + the 1 from the new pack).  Next, Julia used 3 straws to taste the rice porridge. So, she now has 6 - 3 = 3 straws left. Finally, when Julia was setting the table, she had 12 straws in total. Therefore, the answer is 12 - 3 = 9 straws were in the pack that Julia's husband bought for her.

  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Firstly, we need to find out how many patients visited the hospital per day. From the question, we know that the hospital saw 500 people per day.  Next, we need to calculate the time each patient spent at the hospital. According to the question, each patient was seen for an average of 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time each patient spent at the hospital is 24 minutes x 500 patients = 12,000 minutes per day.  Now, let's calculate the revenue generated by the hospital from these visits. The doctor paid $150 per visit and the hospital charged $200 per visit. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the hospital per day is $150 x 500 patients = $75,000 + $200 x 500 patients = $100,000 = $175,000 per day.  Finally, we can calculate the profit made by the hospital. Profit equals revenue minus costs. In this case, the cost of treating each patient is $150 (the amount the doctor pays) plus $200 (the amount the hospital charges). Therefore, the profit per day is $175,000 - ($150 x 500 patients) - ($200 x 500 patients) = $175,000 - $350,000 - $100,000 = $50,000 per day.

  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  First, we need to find out how much money the mother paid for each ticket. From the problem statement, we know that the price of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $10. Therefore, if the mother bought one adult ticket and one child ticket, she would have paid a total of $12 + $10 = $22.  Next, we need to subtract the amount that the mother gave to the museum staff from the total amount she paid. According to the problem statement, the mother gave the staff $8 as change. Therefore, the amount she paid minus the change is $22 - $8 = $14. So, the mother gave the staff $14 in cash.

This means that if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, Charlie has 3x friends.  Next, we are told that James has four times more friends on Facebook than Dorothy. This means that if Dorothy has x friends on Facebook, James has 4x friends.  Now, we are given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. To find out how many friends James has on Facebook, we can use the information that he has four times as many friends as Dorothy and that Dorothy has x friends. Therefore, James has 4x = 4x = 4(x) friends on Facebook.  So, the answer is 4x = 4(x) friends.

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra has to take care of a baby girl in order to collect enough eggs to make all the flans she needs. From the problem, we know that Sandra takes care of a baby girl once every 3 days. Therefore, if Sandra needs to make 15 flans and each flan requires 9 eggs, she will have to take care of a baby girl 15 / 3 = 5 times.  So, Sandra has to take care of a baby girl 5 times in total.

  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Firstly, Billy takes approximately 1 minute and a half to peel each potato (since he takes roughly the same amount of time for each one). Therefore, if he has 60 potatoes to peel, it will take him approximately 90 minutes (or 1 hour and 30 minutes) to complete this task.  Next, we need to calculate how long it will take Billy to cut each potato into small pieces after they have been peeled. Since he takes roughly 5 seconds to cut each piece, and he needs to cut all 60 potatoes, it will take him approximately 300 seconds (or 5 minutes) to finish cutting them all.  Therefore, in total, Billy will require approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes (90 + 30 = 120 minutes) to prepare the potato salad for his family's big gathering.

  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Firstly, we know that there are 10 cages of hamsters and each cage contains 5 pieces of food. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food for the hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50.  Next, we know that there are 3 cages of mice and each cage contains 6 pieces of food. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food for the mice is 3 x 6 = 18.  Finally, we know that no food was used anywhere else in the store. Therefore, the total number of pieces of food distributed among all the animals in the store is 50 + 18 = 68. Since there are 160 pieces of food in total, the number of animals in each cage must be divisible by 68. Therefore, if there were 160 pieces of food in total, then there would be 2.4 animals (rounded to the nearest whole number) in each cage of mice.

According to the problem, a duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Now, let's convert this amount into grams. There are 100 grams in 1 pound, so 3.5 pounds is equal to 350 grams. Therefore, a duck needs to eat 350 grams of insects per week.   Next, we need to determine how much insects each duckling needs to eat daily. Since there are ten ducklings in total, we can divide the total amount of insects needed by the number of ducklings. In this case, each duckling needs to eat 35 grams of insects per day.

He also eats an egg for breakfast three days a week, so the number of slices used for breakfast is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. And he makes macaroni and cheese dinner several times a week, so the number of slices used for dinner is 8 x 3 = 24. Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl uses is 14 + 3 + 24 = 41 slices of cheese!

Now, if the number of customers on the third day is 500, then the difference between the number of customers on the third day and the number of customers on the second day is 350 (500 - 150 = 350). Therefore, the number of customers on the second day was 150.

 marigolds, daisies, roses, and carnations. We also know that there are more than seven daisies than marigolds in the vase. Therefore, if we assume that the number of daisies is x, then the number of marigolds must be less than x - 7.  Next, we can use the information that there are 14 roses in the vase to find out how many carnations there are. Since each rose has five petals, the total number of petals from all the roses is 14 x 5 = 70. Now, since there are no other types of flowers besides these three, we can conclude that the remaining 36 petals come from the carnations. Therefore, the number of carnations in the vase is 36 / 5 = 7. So, there are 7 carnations in the vase.

We know that Jojo got less than 251, and the sum of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna's scores is equal to 251. Therefore, Jojo's score must be 251 - (68 + 78 + 95) = 251 - 231 = 20 mata. Hence, Jojo got 20 mata in the game.

  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  First year, the company spent $15000 for advertising. Since they spent one-third of that amount in the second year, we can assume that the total amount spent on advertising over two years is equal to $15000 x 3 = $45000. Therefore, the answer is $45000.
  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Carlos membeli kano untuk $ 30 sejam, maka total biaya pemakaian kano adalah $ 30 + $ 30 = $ 60.  Benji membeli bot pisang rakit untuk $ 18 sejam, maka total biaya pemakaian bot adalah $ 18 + $ 18 = $ 36.  Karena Carlos menggunakan bot selama 3 jam, maka biaya pemakaian bot adalah $ 36 / 3 = $ 12 per jam.  Benji menggunakan rakit selama 5 jam, maka biaya pemakaian rakit adalah $ 36 / 5 = $ 7 per jam.  Total biaya pemakaian oleh Carlos dan Benji adalah $ 12 + $ 7 = $ 19.
  7 + 1 = 8 days.

  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Firstly, we need to find the total number of students who left the building through any of the three exits (A, B or C). We can do this by multiplying the total number of students with the proportion that left through each exit. For example, if 30% of the students left through exit A, then the number of students who left through exit A is 30% x 1000 = 300. Similarly, the number of students who left through exits B and C are 3/5 x 1000 = 600 and 700 respectively. Therefore, the total number of students who left the building through any of the three exits is 300 + 600 + 700 = 1600. Now, let's find out how many students left through exit C. Since 700 students left through exit C, and there were initially 1000 students in the building, then the percentage of students who left through exit C is (700 / 1000) x 100% = 70%.
 8x = 54. Solving for x, we get x = 7. So, John has 14 candies (2 x 7).

 6 minutes/letter x 17 letters = 98 minutes.
  Mari kita fikirkan langkah demi langkah.  Firstly, we know that Jason has a phone plan with 1000 minutes per month. This means he has 30 days x 1000 minutes = 30,000 minutes in total for the month.  Next, we know that he makes 15 minutes calls to his boss every day, which is equal to 15 x 30 = 450 minutes per month. Additionally, he has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month, which is equal to 300 / 30 = 10 minutes per day, or 300 - 10 = 290 minutes per month. Therefore, the total number of minutes used by Jason this month is 30,000 - 450 - 290 = 26,050 minutes. Since there are 30 days in the month, the average number of minutes used per day is 26,050 / 30 = 867 minutes per day.
