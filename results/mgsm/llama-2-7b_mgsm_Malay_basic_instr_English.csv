Explanation:
Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute, which means she can download 120 GB in 60 minutes (2 GB x 60 minutes). However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forced her to restart the download from the beginning, which took 20 minutes. Therefore, the total amount of data downloaded is:
120 GB - 40% of 120 GB = 72 GB
So, the amount of data that needs to be downloaded is 72 GB."

"Response: 120
Explanation:
The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60. In the second month, there are three times as many downloads as in the first month, so the number of downloads is 60 x 3 = 180. However, in the third month, there is a decrease of 30%, which means that the number of downloads is 180 - (30/100) = 120. Therefore, the total number of downloads over the period of three months is 60 + 180 - 120 = 120."

Explanation: To calculate the total cost of all the items bought by Toula, we need to multiply the number of each item she purchased with its price. Here are the calculations for each item:

* Donuts: 3 dozen x $68/dozen = $204
* Cupcakes (mini): 2 dozen x $80/dozen = $160
* Cheesecakes (mini): 6 dozen x $55/dozen = $330

Adding up these amounts gives us a total cost of $694."
"Response: 60 years
Explanation: To calculate the number of years until Carlos can earn enough money from his lemons to cover the cost of cultivating them, we need to subtract the total cost of cultivation (including maintenance) from the revenue generated by selling the lemons each year.

Total cost = $3 per year + ($90 x 7) per year = $3 + $630 = $633 per year
Revenue = $1.5 per lemon x 7 lemons per year = $10.5 per year

Since Carlos needs to break even within 60 years, we can calculate the number of years as follows:
Years to break even = Total cost / Revenue = $633 / $10.5 = 60 years
Therefore, Carlos will be able to break even in 60 years after starting to grow lemons."

Similarly, since each comic book weighs 1/2 pound (or 0.45 kg), and he has 30 comics, he will need to get rid of 30 x 0.45 = 13.5 pounds (or 5.97 kg) of comics. Therefore, in total, he will need to get rid of 60 + 13.5 = 73.5 pounds (or 33.2 kg) of items from his backpack."
"Response: 
The mechanic earned more money on Thursday (Juma't) than on Wednesday (Khamis).
To calculate this, we need to compare the number of tires repaired and the amount charged for each type of repair on both days.
On Wednesday (Khamis), the mechanic repaired 6 tire tracks and charged $60 per repair, resulting in total revenue of $360 ($6 x $60).
On Thursday (Juma't), the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and did not repair any tire tracks, so the total revenue from car tire repairs was $480 ($12 x $40).
Therefore, the total revenue for both days is $840 ($360 + $480).
So, the mechanic earned more money on Thursday (Juma't) than on Wednesday (Khamis)."

Explanation:
Marcy worked for the same company for 40 years, receiving an annual bonus of $50,000 per year. Starting from year 20, she is entitled to 5% of the value of the bonus each year. If she stops working after 30 years, how much is the total amount of bonuses she received?
To calculate this, we need to find out the total value of the bonuses she received over the 30 years. Since the bonus amount is $50,000 per year, and she receives it for 30 years, the total value of the bonuses is:
$50,000 x 30 = $1,500,000
Now, since she is entitled to 5% of the value of the bonus each year, her total bonus amount over the 30 years is:
$1,500,000 x 5% = $75,000
Therefore, the total amount of bonuses Marcy received over the 30 years is $1,500,000 + $75,000 = $1,575,000."

* Each level has half the area of the previous level, so the area of each level is 8 square feet (tapak persegi).
* There are 4 levels in total.
Therefore, the average area of one level is:
Average Area = Total Area / Number of Levels
= 16 / 4
= 6.4 square feet (or 0.064 acres)
So, the rata-rata tapak persegi satu tahap is approximately 6.4 square feet or 0.064 acres."

Explanation:
From the given information, we know that there are initially 30 trains passing through the intersection in 15 minutes. Since 5 trains take an alternate route to avoid congestion, there are actually 25 trains passing through the intersection in 15 minutes.
The question asks how many trains pass through the intersection during the first 15 minutes of congestion. To find this, we divide the total number of trains by the time taken for each train to pass through the intersection during the first 15 minutes:
Number of trains passing through intersection during first 15 minutes = Total number of trains / Time taken for each train to pass through intersection during first 15 minutes
= 25 trains / (15 minutes x 5 trains)
= 25 trains / 75 minutes
= 1/3
Therefore, approximately 1/3 or 33% of the initial 30 trains pass through the intersection during the first 15 minutes of congestion."

Explanation: Let's analyze each friend's action and their relationship to the number of times they pressed the doorbell:
Friend 1 pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, Friend 1 pressed the doorbell 20/4 = 5 times more than Jerome.
Friend 2 pressed the doorbell 1/4 as many times as Friend 1, so Friend 2 pressed the doorbell 1/4 \* 5 = 1.25 times more than Jerome.
Friend 3 pressed the doorbell 10 times more than Friend 2, so Friend 3 pressed the doorbell 10 \* 1.25 = 12.5 times more than Jerome.
Friend 4 pressed the doorbell 60 - 20 = 40 times more than Jerome. Therefore, Friend 4 pressed the doorbell 40 \* 12.5 = 500 times more than Jerome.
So, in total, Friends 1-4 pressed the doorbell 5 + 1.25 + 12.5 + 500 = 578 times."

"Response: 
The total revenue earned by the hospital from the 500 patients per day is given by:
Revenue = Number of patients x Price per patient
= 500 x $150
= $75,000 per day

Since the doctor also charges $150 per visit, the total amount paid to the doctor per day is:
Total amount paid to doctor = Number of visits x Doctor's fee
= 500 x $150
= $75,000 per day

Therefore, the net profit earned by the hospital after deducting the cost of the doctor's fees is:
Net profit = Revenue - Cost
= $75,000 - $75,000
= $0 per day

So, there is no profit earned by the hospital from this scenario."

* The cost of each bottle of cleaning solution is $2.
* The cost of each roll of cloth is $5.
* Kim expects to make a profit of $92 per week from her business.

Using these pieces of information, we can calculate the total revenue for Kim's business as follows:

= 5 x ($2 x 2) + $92
= $40 + $92
= $132

Therefore, the numerical answer to the question is $132."

Explanation: If Jackie decides to do her own taxes and saves 3 hours of work per year (3 x 60 = 180 minutes), she will lose $35 per hour or $120 per year ($35 x 4 weeks). Since an accountant charges $90 per session, Jackie will save $30 per year by doing her own taxes ($120 - $90). Therefore, the amount of money that Jackie will have left after paying for the accountant is $128 ($120 + $8)."
"Response:  € 689
Explanation:
Total amount spent by Elvira = Cost of computer + Accessories = € 1090 + € 157 + € 74 + € 102 = € 1423
Subtract the amount spent on accessories from the total cost = € 1423 - € 157 = € 1266
Deduct the amount spent on pencetak and CD from the remaining amount = € 1266 - € 102 = € 1164
Therefore, Elvira will have € 1164 left for clothes."

"Response:  $175$
Explanation:
Let's break down the cost of each item in the uniform:
Topi: $25$
Jaket: $3 \times 25 = 75$
Seluar: $\frac{25}{4} = 62.5$
Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is: $25 + 75 + 62.5 = 177.5$. Since there are multiple uniforms being purchased, we can simply multiply this amount by the number of uniforms being bought: $177.5 \times 5 = 887.5$. Therefore, the total cost of all five uniforms is $887.5$."

"Response: 18750
Explanation: To calculate how much Jessica needs to pay each month, we need to find the total amount of her debts and then divide it by the number of months in a year (12). The total amount of her debts is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 per month. Since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, she will pay $1500 per month ($1000 x 1.5) for the next year. Therefore, Jessica needs to pay $18750 in one year."

From the given information, we know that Billy has to cut 60 potatoes for the family barbecue. He takes approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds (or 1.5 minutes) to cut each potato. Therefore, he will need approximately 90 minutes (or 1.5 x 60) to cut all 60 potatoes.

Explanation:
Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Zaid spends on rent and car fuel. According to the question, he spends 1/4 of his salary for rent ($6000 / 4 = $1500) and 1/3 of his salary for car fuel ($6000 / 3 = $2000). Therefore, the total amount of money that Zaid spends on rent and car fuel is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.
Next, we need to subtract the amount that Zaid gives to his children and wife from the total amount of money that he earns. According to the question, he gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for running costs and other household items. Therefore, the total amount of money that Zaid has left after giving these amounts is $6000 - $200 - $700 = $5800."

"Response: 1/6 or approximately 0.17
Explanation: According to the problem statement, Jerry is throwing darts six times at a target with equal probability of hitting each number from 1 to 6. Since he hits two numbers that are odd (3 and 5), the probability of him hitting an odd number in his next throw is 2/6 = 0.33. Therefore, the probability of him hitting a number greater than 3 in his next throw is 1 - 0.33 = 0.67 or approximately 0.17."

Explanation:
John won an award at work worth $5000 and a 5% salary increase. If he works 2000 hours per month and receives the award on the first day of the year, he will earn $18750 that year.
Here's how we can calculate this:
Yearly income = Award amount + Salary increase x Number of months worked
= $5000 + ($5000 x 5%) x 12
= $5000 + $25000
= $30000
Since John works 2000 hours per month, his total annual income is:
Total income = Yearly income / Number of hours worked per year
= $30000 / 2000
= $18750"

"Response: 6 times
Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Sara has $10 saved before she starts taking care of her siblings. She earns $5 per time she takes care of them, and each time she cuts grass, her mother pays her $4. To calculate how many times Sara needs to cut grass before she can buy the jacket and socks, we need to divide the cost of the items by the amount she earns per time she takes care of her siblings. The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of each pair of socks is $20. Therefore, if Sara wants to save enough money to buy these items, she will need to take care of her siblings 6 times (i.e., $30 / $5 = 6)."
"Response: 16
Explanation:
Let's assume that Jerry has x number of red chickens and y number of white chickens. Since each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, Jerry gets 3x eggs from the red chickens. Similarly, since each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, Jerry gets 5y eggs from the white chickens. Therefore, the total number of eggs Jerry collects every day is 3x + 5y.
Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the equation:
3x + 5y = 42
Now, we are given that Jerry has more than two white chickens for every red chicken he has. So, if x is the number of red chickens, then y > 2x. Substituting this value in the previous equation, we get:
3x + 5(2x) = 42
Simplifying the equation, we get:
9x + 10y = 42
Subtracting 10y from both sides gives us:
9x = 32
Dividing both sides by 9 gives us:
x = 4
So, there are 4 red chickens in Jerry's farm.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 16 (since there are 4 red chickens and each lays 3 eggs per day)."

Explanation:
If 30% of the melons were ready to be harvested after two months and Ashlyn collected them, then there are 70% of the melons that were not yet ready (30% x 70%). So, if she returned two weeks later and found that 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, then there are 25% of the original number of melons that were still not ready (3/4 x 70%). Therefore, the number of melons that were not yet ready after two weeks is 25%. To find the exact number, we can multiply this percentage by the initial number of melons, which is 120: 25% x 120 = 30. So, there were 30 melons that were not yet ready for harvest after two weeks."

Explanation: Let X be the number of students who left through door C. Since 30% of the students left through door A, the number of students who left through door A is 300 (1000 x 0.3). Then, since 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, the number of students who left through door B is 600 (1000 x 0.6). Therefore, the total number of students who left through doors A and B is 900 (300 + 600). Finally, since the remaining students must have left through door C, we can conclude that X = 900 - 900 = 0. So, the number of students who left through door C is 0."
