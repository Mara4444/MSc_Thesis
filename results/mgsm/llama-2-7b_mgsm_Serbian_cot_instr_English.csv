Response:  Janet produces 16 eggs per day and sells them at $2 each. So she makes $32 in revenue from egg sales every day. Now, let's calculate how much she spends on maffin production. She eats three maffins for lunch and gives four to her friends daily, so she consumes 7 maffins ($4 x 3 = $12) and gives away 4 x 4 = $16 worth of maffins daily. Therefore, her total cost for maffin production is $12 + $16 = $28 per day. Since she earns $32 from egg sales and spends $28 on maffin production, her profit from both activities is $32 - $28 = $4 per day.
"Response:  We need to make a total of 3 yards (2 blue + half white) of fabric for the dress. So we will need:

* 2 yards of blue fabric (since each yard is equal to 3 feet)
* Half a yard of white fabric (since each yard is equal to 3 feet)

Therefore, the total amount of fabric needed is:

2 yards x 3 feet/yard = 6 feet of blue fabric
+ Half a yard x 3 feet/yard = 1.5 feet of white fabric
= Total of 7.5 feet of fabric needed for the dress."
Response:  The original price of the house was $80,000 and after renovation it increased to $120,000 (150% increase). So Josh invested $50,000 in renovations and made a profit of $30,000 ($120,000 - $90,000 = $30,000). Therefore, he profited $30,000 from the renovation project.
Response:  James runs three races per week, and each race is 60 meters long. So, he runs a total of 60 x 3 = 180 meters per week.
Response:  We know that Wendy feeds her chicks three bowls of mixed birdseed per day, which contains seeds, grains, and vegetables to help them stay healthy. She gives them food in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chicks 15 bowls of food. In the afternoon, she gives them another 25 bowls of food. If Wendy has a total of 20 chicks in her flock, how many bowls of food should she give them in the last meal of the day? Solution: To find out how many bowls of food Wendy should give her chicks in the last meal of the day, we need to divide the total number of chicks (20) by the number of meals they eat per day (3). So, Wendy should give her chicks 6 bowls of food in the last meal of the day (20 / 3 = 6).
Response:  If one cup costs $5, then each subsequent cup will cost $\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$ dollars. So, if Kiolar wants to buy 16 cups, he will have to pay $\boxed{\text{16 x }2.5 = 40}$ dollars.
Response:  We know that Tulsa has twice as many sheep as Charleston and four times as many sheep as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20 sheep, then Tulsa has 2 x 2 = 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, or 80 sheep. Similarly, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so it has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Therefore, the total number of sheep in Tulsa, Charleston, and Seattle together is 80 + 80 + 20 = 180 sheep.
"Response: 

1. Karla can usually download 2 GB per minute, but 40% of the time Windows forces her to restart and install updates, which takes 20 minutes.
2. So, in total, it would take Karla 20 + (40% \* 20) = 36 minutes to download a 200 GB file.

Therefore, the answer is 36 minutes."
"Response:  John started driving at 100 km/h for 3 hours, which means he traveled a distance of:
Distance = Speed x Time = 100 km/h x 3 h = 300 km
Then, he turned around and headed back home. For the first 2 hours, he was in traffic, so he didn't move:
Time = Distance / Speed = 2 h / 30 km/h = 67 km
After that, he drove at a speed of 30 mi/h (which is approximately 48 km/h) for the next hour:
Time = Distance / Speed = 1 h / 48 km/h = 22 km
So, after 4 hours, John had traveled a total distance of:
Total distance = Distance + Distance from traffic jam = 300 km + 67 km = 367 km
Now, we need to find out how far away from home he is at this point. We know that it takes him 80 miles per hour to cover the remaining distance:
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered = 367 km - 22 km = 345 km
Therefore, John is 345 kilometers away from his home at the end of the 4 hours."
Response:  Eliza works for $10 per hour during her first 40 hours of work each week. For any additional hours worked beyond that, she receives overtime pay that is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked 45 hours this week, her total earnings would be: Regular hours (first 40 hours) x $10/hour = $400 Overtime hours (additional 5 hours) x ($10/hour x 1.2) = $60 Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460
"Response:  In the first month, there were 60 downloads. If in the second month, the number of downloads was three times greater than in the first month (i.e., 60 x 3 = 180), and then decreased by 30% to 120 in the third month, we can calculate the total number of downloads as follows:
Total downloads = First month + Second month - Third month
= 60 + 180 - 120
= 260
Therefore, the program had been downloaded 260 times during the three months."
Response:  Tulа bought 3 bundles of croissants that cost $68 per bundle, 2 bundles of mini cakes that cost $80 per bundle, and 6 bundles of mini sausages that cost $55 per bundle. Therefore, the total cost is: $68 x 3 + $80 x 2 + $55 x 6 = $497.
"Response: 
Year 1: Carlos spends $90 to plant the lemon tree and does not harvest any lemons yet. So he has spent $90 - $3 = $87 in total.
Year 2: The lemon tree produces 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 per lemon. So he earns $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 from the lemons. He also pays $3 for the maintenance of the tree, so his total cost is $10.5 + $3 = $13.5.
Year 3: The lemon tree continues to produce 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 per lemon. So he earns $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 from the lemons. He also pays $3 for the maintenance of the tree, so his total cost is $10.5 + $3 = $13.5.
Year 4: The lemon tree produces 7 lemons again, which he can sell for $1.5 per lemon. So he earns $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 from the lemons. He also pays $3 for the maintenance of the tree, so his total cost is $10.5 + $3 = $13.5.
Year 5: The lemon tree finally starts to make a profit! It produces 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 per lemon. So he earns $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 from the lemons. He also pays $3 for the maintenance of the tree, so his total cost is $10.5 + $3 = $13.5.
Therefore, it will take 5 years for the lemon tree to start making a profit."
Response:  Melani started selling her fans from door to door and sold 1/3 of them in the green house, 2/3 of them in the red house, and half of what was left in Portokalova's house. If Melani has 5 fans remaining, she must have started with 9 fans (3 x 3 = 9).
"Response:  We know that out of 20 students, 4 are in modern dance (20%), 5 are in jazz dance (25%), and the remaining 11 are in hip-hop dance. So, the number of students in each group is as follows: Modern Dance - 4; Jazz Dance - 5; Hip-Hop Dance - 11. Now, we need to find out what percentage of all students are in hip-hop dance. To do this, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students, which is 20 + 5 + 11 = 46. Therefore, the percentage of students in hip-hop dance is 46/46 x 100 = 100%."
"Response:  The value of the necklace is $5,000 and the value of the electronic devices is $8,000. If the market price of necklaces increases by 2.5% in one month, then its new value will be:

$5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125

Similarly, if the market price of electronic devices increases by 1.2% in one month, then its new value will be:

$8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,160

Now, let's compare these two options:

Option A: Buy Necklace ($5,125)
Option B: Buy Electronic Devices ($8,160)

Since Option B has a higher value than Option A, it means that buying electronic devices would result in a higher profit at the end of the month. Therefore, the trader should choose to buy the electronic devices.

So, the maximum profit that the trader can make is:

Profit = $8,160 - $5,000 = $3,160"
"Response: 
Day 1:
* Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel west for 80 miles.
* The distance traveled by each train in one day is 80/2 = 40 miles.

Day 2:
* One train turns north and travels 240 kilometers (km).
* The other train continues to travel west for another 40 miles (since they started together).
* So, the total distance traveled by both trains in two days is: 40 + 40 = 80 miles.
Therefore, the answer is 80 miles per day."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of hours worked as an educator and coach per year. As there are 50 weeks in a year, and each week has 7 days (Monday through Sunday), then the total number of working days is:

50 weeks x 7 days/week = 350 working days/year
Now, let's calculate the total number of hours worked as an educator and coach per year:

As an educator, she works for 35 hours/week x 350 working days/year = 12,250 hours/year
And as a coach, she works for 15 hours/week x 350 working days/year = 5,250 hours/year
So, her total annual work hours as both an educator and coach is:
12,250 + 5,250 = 17,500 hours/year
Next, we can calculate her hourly wage based on the given information:
Yearly salary = Total annual work hours x Hourly wage
= 17,500 hours/year x $20/hour = $350,000/year
Finally, if she works for 50 weeks out of the year, then her weekly income would be:
Weekly income = Yearly salary / Number of weeks worked
= $350,000/year / 50 weeks = $7,000/week"
Response:  If Клер makes an omelette of three eggs every morning for breakfast and she eats it all, then in one week she will eat 3 x 7 = 21 omelettes. So, if she continues this habit for 4 weeks, she will eat 21 x 4 = 84 omelettes.
Response:  Marisa has already walked for 4 miles in one hour, so she is walking at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take her to walk the remaining distance of 8 miles, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. Plugging in the values given in the problem, we get: Time = 8 miles / 4 miles/hour = 2 hours. Therefore, if Marisa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk for an additional 2 hours to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles.
"Response:  We have 10 liters of water from the portulaca and we want to add 15 liters of water from the pineapple, which has 3/5th water. So, the total amount of water is:

10 L + (15 L x 3/5) = 10 L + 4.5 L = 14.5 L

Now, when we are pouring, one liter of water is spilled, so the remaining amount of water in the container is:

14.5 L - 1 L = 13.5 L
Therefore, there are 13.5 liters of water left in the container after adding the pineapple juice and before pouring any more water."
"Response:  According to the information provided in the question:
Raymond is older than Samantha (brother and sister).
Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.
Samantha is currently 31 years old.
Now, let's calculate the age of Raymond at the time his son was born:
Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymonnd was born 6 + 23 = 30 years ago.
Therefore, Raymond's son was born 30 years ago.
So, if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond's son must be 31 - 30 = 1 year old."
"Response: 

Step 1: First three customers buy one DVDS each, so Biłi sells 3 DVDS in total.

Step 2: Next two customers buy two DVDS each, so Biłi sells an additional 4 DVDS (2 x 2 = 4).

Step 3: Last three customers do not buy any DVDS, so Biłi does not sell any DVDS in this group.

Total number of DVDS sold by Biłi = 3 + 4 - 0 = 7 DVDS.
Therefore, Biłi sold 7 DVDS in the Tuesday."
Response:  The candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour. So if it burns for 4 hours (from 13:00 to 17:00), it will melt 8 centimeters (2 x 4). Therefore, after burning from 13:00 to 17:00, the candle will be shorter by 8 centimeters.
Response:  We know that Kyle bought the best-selling book last year for $19.50 with a 25% discount from its original price. So we can write an equation as follows: Original price = Discounted price / (1 - Discount percentage) Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25) Original price = $78.00 Therefore, the original price of the book was $78.00 before it went on sale.
Response:  We know that Marija bought one chicken dish for $12.50 and five packages of milk at $3 each, so she spent a total of $17.50 on those items. Additionally, she bought four apples at $1.50 per apple, so she spent $6 on apples. Finally, we are told that Marija paid a total of $50, which means that the cost of all the other items (the chicken dish, milk, and apples) must be $42.50 ($50 - $17.50 - $6). Therefore, Marija bought 5 cups of pizza, since each cup costs $8.50.
"Response: 
Misha bought three pairs of shorts, which cost $16.50 each. Therefore, he spent $16.50 x 3 = $49.50 on shorts.
He also bought three pairs of pants, which cost $22.50 each. So, he spent $22.50 x 3 = $67.50 on pants.
Finally, he bought three pairs of shoes, which cost $42 each. Thus, he spent $42 x 3 = $126 on shoes.
In total, Misha spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $233 on odear."
"Response:  Synthia eats one portion of candy each night, and she buys boxes of candy with 15 portions per box at $4 per box. After 60 days, how much will she have spent on candy?

Step 1: Calculate the number of portions of candy that Synthia consumes in one day.

Portion size = 1 portion/night = 1/30 (portions/day)

So, Synthia consumes 1/30 of the total amount of candy every day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of portions of candy that Synthia consumes over 60 days.

Total portions consumed = Number of days x Portion size/day
= 60 days x 1/30 (portions/day)
= 20 portions

Therefore, after 60 days, Synthia will have consumed 20 portions of candy."
"Response: 
Henry stopped for the first time after traveling 20 miles. So, he traveled another 40 miles (60 - 20) without stopping. Then he stopped again for the second time. The distance between the two stops is 15 miles. Therefore, the total distance Henry traveled from his starting point to his second stop is:
Distance = Total distance traveled + Distance between stops
= 40 + 15
= 55 miles
So, Henrik traveled 55 miles from his starting point to his second stop."
Response:  Gloria has to choose between two pairs of shoes that cost $5 less than the shoes she wants. The first pair costs $33, and the second pair costs twice as much as the first pair. So, if the first pair costs $33, then the second pair costs $66 ($2 \* $33). Therefore, the total cost of both pairs is $101 ($33 + $66). Since Gloria wants to spend no more than $50 on shoes, we can conclude that the cost of the shoes she wants is $50 - $101 = $-51.
"Response:  We know that Darelov is currently 7 times older than Alenov, so their current ages are in the ratio of 7:11. Therefore, we can write:
Alenov's age = 11Darelov's age
We also know that their combined age is 162 years, so we can write:
11Darelov's age + Alenov's age = 162
Now, let's solve for Alenov's age:
Subtracting 11 from both sides gives us:
Alenov's age = 151
Therefore, if Darelov is currently 7 times older than Alenov, and they have been alive for 10 years, then Alenov's age would be 151 + 10 = 161 years old."
Response:  Gunter says there are 80 jelly beans in the bowl. His friend says that is 20 more than half of Gunter's amount, so his friend has 160 jelly beans (half of 80 + 20 = 160). The third person says they have 25% more than the second person, which means they have 320 jelly beans (160 x 1.25 = 320). Therefore, their combined total is 460 jelly beans (320 + 160 + 80 = 460).
Response:  John spends 0.5 hours per day taking care of his dogs. Since there are 24 hours in a day, this means he spends 1/24 = 0.04 hours (or 4 minutes) per hour taking care of his dogs. So, he spends 4 minutes x 7 days = 28 minutes per week taking care of his dogs.
Response:  We know that Grechen has 110 kovnica and there are 30 more silver coins than gold coins. So, the number of gold coins is 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, Grechen has 80 golden coins.
Response:  We know that Aaron has more than twice as many diamonds as Raymond and five times as many dragons as Raymond. So if Raymon has x dragons, Aaron has at least 2x + 5 = 3x dragons. Now we are told that Shivon has fewer than two biyuts less than Aaron. So Shivon has 3x - 2 = 3(x - 2) dragons. Since Raymon has 40 necklaces, Shivon must have 40 - (3(x - 2)) = 40 - 3x + 6 = 18 dragons. Therefore, Shivon has 18 dragons.
Response:  Mike played for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Therefore, he scored an average of 0.2 points per minute during this period (4/20 = 0.2). In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than his previous score, which means he scored 0.3 points per minute (25% of 0.2 = 0.06). So, in total, Mike scored 0.5 points (0.2 + 0.06) during the entire game.
"Response:  If Teri eats two jars of yogurt per day and there are currently 4 jars for sale at $5 each, then...

Step 1: Calculate how many jars of yogurt Teri buys in one day.
Teri buys 2 jars of yogurt per day.
Number of jars = 2

Step 2: Calculate how many days Teri will buy yogurt in total.
Total number of days = 30 days

Step 3: Multiply the number of jars bought per day by the total number of days to find out how many jars Teri will buy overall.
Total number of jars = Number of jars per day x Total number of days
Total number of jars = 2 x 30 = 60 jars

Therefore, Teri will spend $60 on yogurt during 30 days."
Response:  John sold all his Lego sets and made $65 from them ($15 x 13 = $195). After buying 8 video games for $160, he had $35 left ($195 - $160 = $35). So, John still has $35 worth of Lego sets.
"Response:  John runs for 60 miles per week, which means he runs for 10 hours (60/6) each day. He runs for 3 hours on Monday and Tuesday, so he covers a distance of 90 miles in those two days (3 x 30). Therefore, his average speed is:
Speed = Distance / Time = 90 / (2 x 3) = 45 miles per hour."
"Response:  If Dana can run four times faster than she can walk and jump twice as fast as she can run, then we know that her running speed is $4 \times v$ and her walking speed is $v$. Since she can jump at a speed of $\frac{2}{3}v$, we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
Dana's~running~speed &= 4 \times v \\
Dana's~walking~speed &= v \\
Dana's~jumping~speed &= \frac{2}{3}v
\end{aligned}$$
Now, let's find out how many miles Dana can cover in one hour. We know that she can cover $3mi/min$ while jogging and $1mi/min$ while walking. So, if she spends $60\%$ of her time jogging and $40\%$ of her time walking, then she will cover:

$$\begin{aligned}
Distance~covered~per~hour &= \frac{3mi/min}{60\%} + \frac{1mi/min}{40\%} \\
&= \frac{3(60)}{100} + \frac{1(40)}{100} \\
&= 18mi/h + 4mi/h \\
&= 22mi/h
\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, if Dana runs for six hours, she will cover a total distance of:

$$\begin{aligned}
Total~distance~covered &= 6 \times 22mi/h \\
&= 132mi
\end{aligned}$$
So, the answer to the question is $132mi$."
"Response:  According to the problem statement:

* Brendon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone. So, if Ben's iPhone is x years old, then Brendon's iPhone is 4x years old.
* Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzie's iPhone. So, if Suzie's iPhone is y years old, then Ben's iPhone is 2y years old.
* The combined age of Ben and Suzie's iPhones is equal to the age of Brendon's iPhone plus twice the age of Ben's iPhone minus the age of Suzie's iPhone. Therefore, we can write:

4x + 2(2y) - y =?

Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:

4x + 2(2y) - y = 36

Simplifying the equation:

4x + 4y - y = 36

Combine like terms:

5x = 36

Dividing both sides by 5:

x = 7

So, Brendon's iPhone is 7 times older than Suzie's iPhone."
"Response:  We know that when Polly held the sapphire dragon stone, she could throw her spear three times farther than usual. So if we assume that the usual distance was 400 meters (which is what the problem states), then the maximum distance she could throw it with the dragon stone would be:

3 x 400 = 1200 meters

Now, let's consider how far the flames of the great dragon could reach. According to the problem, the flames could reach anything within 1000 meters of the dragon. So if Polly stood at a distance of 900 meters from the dragon (just for example), the flames would still be able to reach her because they are within 1000 meters of the dragon. Therefore, the maximum distance Polly could stand and catch the dragon with her golden spear would be:

900 meters + 1000 - 100 = 1000 meters

So Polly could stand and catch the dragon with her golden spear at a distance of 1000 meters from the dragon."
Response:  We know that Babajons prepared 5 pies for lunch and each pie contains 8 slices. So, she has prepared a total of 5 x 8 = 40 slices of pie. Then, we are told that she placed 5 slices on the table for guests to serve themselves. This means that there were initially 40 - 5 = 35 slices left after guests served themselves. Finally, at the end of the evening, there are 14 remaining slices, which is equal to 35 - 14 = 21 slices that guests consumed during the evening. Therefore, the answer is 21.
Response:  If the serving size of chips is 50 grams (which we will assume for now), then the total amount of chips in the bag is 300 grams / 50 grams per serving = 6 servings. So if you want to eat 5 portions of chips, which is 5 x 50 grams = 250 grams, and you have already eaten 1800 calories out of your daily goal of 2000 calories, that means you can still eat an additional 750 calories from the chips (250 calories per portion x 3 portions).
"Response: 
Charlie wants to sell candles made of beeswax. For each kilogram of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. One kilogram of beeswax costs $10, and one candle costs $2. If Charlie sells 20 candles, his net profit will be:
Net Profit = Revenue - Costs
= 20 x $2
= $40
So, Charlie's net profit is $40 if he sells 20 candles."
"Response: 
1. Meredith spends an average of 4 hours per day writing blog posts.
2. She writes 5 articles in Monday and 2/5 times more than that in Tuesday (since she wrote 3 articles in Tuesday). So, she spent around 8 hours writing articles in Monday and 6 hours in Tuesday.
3. In Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as in Tuesday, so she spent around 12 hours writing articles in Wednesday.
4. Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in three days is: 8 + 6 + 12 = 26 hours."
Response:  We know that Kandi had 80 whiteboards in her bag before she went to work at the cafe. She then stopped at a store and bought a Post-it pack with 100 whiteboards. At work, she put one whiteboard on each of the 220 coffee cups. So, the total number of whiteboards left is 23 (since there are 23 remaining cups). Therefore, the answer is 23.
Response:  John bought twice as many red ties as blue ones, so he bought 2x = 2 \* 10 = 20 red ties. Each red tie costs 50% more than each blue tie, so the cost of one red tie is $50 + (50% of $40) = $50 + $20 = $70. Therefore, John spent $70 x 20 = $1400 on all his ties.
"Response:  Treyce used a rope with a length of 4 steps to support the growth of radishes in the garden. The villa was cut into pieces that were 15 centimeters long. To find out how many pieces she got, we need to divide the length of the rope (4 steps) by the length of each piece (15 centimeters):

Number of pieces = Length of rope / Length of each piece
= 4 steps / 15 cm
= 0.267 pieces
Therefore, Treyce received approximately 0.267 pieces of the villa as a result of cutting it into pieces."
Response:  We know that Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors and each floor has 8 apartments. So, there are 120 apartments (15 x 8) in total. Now, we are told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means that 3/4 of 120 = 90 apartments are currently inhabited. Therefore, the number of unoccupied apartments is 120 - 90 = 30.
"Response:  If Loyd has a farm with chickens that lay 252 eggs per day and sells them for $2 per length, then he will earn:
$$ \text {Earnings} = \text{Number of eggs sold} \times \text{Selling price per egg} $$
$$ \begin{aligned} \text{Earnings} &= 252 \times 2 \\ &= 504 \text{ dollars per day} \end{aligned} $$
So, Loyd earns $504 dollars per day from his egg farming business."
Response:  Tom can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour, so he covers 10 x 4 = 40 miles in 4 hours (from 13 to 17). Then, he returns with a speed of 6 miles per hour, covering 6 x 2 = 12 miles in 2 hours (from 17 to 19). Therefore, Tom has traveled a total distance of 40 + 12 = 52 miles.
Response:  If Urjev's bag of books becomes too heavy for him to carry, he needs to remove 15 kilograms from it. Since his comics weigh 1 kilogram each and his toys weigh 0.5 kilograms each, if he removes 30 comics, he will need to remove 30 x 1 = 30 kilograms of weight from the bag. Therefore, he will need to remove 180 kilograms (15 - 30) from the bag in total.
Response:  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 tires for trucks and 4 tires for cars, so he earned $6 x 6 = $36 from truck tire repairs and $4 x 4 = $16 from car tire repairs, for a total of $52. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 cars but did not repair any truck tires, so he earned $4 x 12 = $48 from car tire repairs only, for a total of $90. Therefore, the mechanic earned more money on Friday than on Thursday ($52 + $90 = $142).
Response:  According to the information provided in the question, Sister Dubtfaier has 7 adopted cats at home when their mother calls them to inform them that their two household cats have just had kittens. So, initially, there are 9 cats (2 x 4 = 8 + 1). Then, according to Mother Dubtfaier's statement, Patty has triple the number of adopted cats as she already has, which is 3 x 7 = 21. Therefore, the total number of cats in the Dubtfaier family now is 9 + 21 = 30 cats!
Response:  We know that Џин has 30 lebdica and he eats two of them. So, now he has 30 - 2 = 28 left. He wants to put two more in a package, so we have 28 / 2 = 14 remaining lebdica. Therefore, Џин can fill up 14 bags with lebdica.
Response:  Peter spends $7 for tickets and $7 for popcorn each time he goes to the movies. If he has $42 for a week, that means he can go to the movies 6 times ($42 / $7 = 6).
Response:  The maximum weight that the wooden bridge can bear is 5000 pounds (фунти). If we have n cups of equal weight (15 kg each), then the total weight of the cargo will be n x 15 kg = 90 kg. So, if we want to know how many cups of cargo can fit in the truck without overloading it, we need to divide the weight of the truck (3755 lb) by the weight of one cup of cargo (90 kg): Number of cups = 3755 / 90 = 42 cups. Therefore, the maximum number of cups of cargo that can be loaded onto the truck and still cross the bridge safely is 42 cups.
Response:  Firstly, Steven paid $40 for his food online. Then, there was an additional 25% charge of $10 (since it was delivered), making the total cost to $50. Finally, he added $4 for tea, bringing the final cost to $54. So, the correct answer is $54.
"Response:  We know that in one bunch of grapes there are 6 zbirica (clusters) with 20 fruits each and 67 individual fruits scattered throughout the field. So, we have:

Zbirici с фрута = 6 x 20 = 120 fruit/bunch
Individual fruits = 67 fruit
Total number of grapes = Zbirici с фрута + Individual fruits = 120 + 67 = 187 grapes
Therefore, the total number of grapes is 187."
"Response:  We know that there are 25 portokales in total and we want to find out how many of them are good. From the information given, we can conclude that:

* 1 is bad (loša)
* 20% are not ripe (nezrelle)
* 2 are rotten (sukine)

So, if we subtract the number of bad and rotten portokales from the total number of portokales, we will get the number of good ones:

Number of good portokales = Total number of portokales - Bad portokales - Rotten portokales
= 25 - 1 - 2
= 22

Therefore, there are 22 good portokales in the basket."
Response:  Firstly, Janet pays $500 for materials (M). Then she pays $800 for construction (C), so her total cost is M + C = $500 + $800 = $1300. Finally, she pays 10% of that amount as insurance ($1300 x 10% = $130), so her final cost is $1300 + $130 = $1430. Therefore, Janet has paid a total of $1430.
"Response:  If Mars worked for the same company for 40 years and received an annual pension of $50,000 after retirement, then her total accumulated pension value would be:

$50,000/year x 40 years = $2,000,000

After 20 years of service, she becomes eligible to receive 5% of the pension value annually as a bonus. So, her annual pension amount increases to:

$2,000,000 x 5% = $100,000

Now, if she leaves the job after 30 years, her total pension amount would be:

$2,000,000 + $100,000 (bonus for last 10 years) = $2,100,000

Therefore, Mars' annual pension amount after leaving the job after 30 years would be:

$2,100,000 / 5 = $420,000 per year."
"Response:  Alina paid $140 per month for streaming services. If the company charged an initial fee for the first half of the year and then reduced it by 10% in the second half of the year, we can calculate the total amount she paid as follows:

Initial fee (first half of the year): $140 x 6 = $840
Reduced fee (second half of the year): $840 x 9/12 = $576
Total amount paid by Alina for streaming service: $840 + $576 = $1,416
Therefore, the answer is $1,416."
Response:  So far, Sofia has driven for 160 kilometers since her last fill-up, and she needs to drive another 4 gallons (or 15 liters) of gasoline to refill her tank. According to the instructions, her car's fuel tank can hold 12 gallons (or 45 liters) of gasoline. Therefore, we can calculate that Sofia can drive approximately 320 kilometers (or 200 miles) on one full tank of gasoline.
Response:  Jim spends two hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and read for half of that time. So he spends 2 + (1/2) = 3 hours reading in total each week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Jim spends 3 x 4 = 12 hours reading per month.
"Response: 
1. Each school has sent one women's and one men's team, so there are 4 teams in total (2 women's teams and 2 men's teams).
2. Each team has 5 players, so there are 20 players in total (10 women players + 10 men players).
3. Since each school also sent a coach for each team, there are 4 coaches in total (1 woman coach + 3 man coaches).
So, the total number of people who were sent from all schools is: 20 players + 4 coaches = 24 people."
"Response:  We know that there are 175 diamonds and 35 rubies less than diamonds in total. The number of emeralds is twice as many as rubies. So, we can write down an equation:
Diamonds + Rubies = Emeralds + Other Stones (including sapphires)
Let's assume that the total value of all stones is equal to $X. Since each diamond has a value of $Y, the value of rubies is $Z (since they are worth less than diamonds), and the value of emeralds is $A (twice as much as rubies). Then, we can write:
$$\begin{aligned} X &= Y \times 175 + Z \times 35 + A \times 2 \\ &= Y \times 175 + Z \times 35 + A \times 2 \end{aligned}$$
Now, let's solve for $Y$. Substituting $Z = 0$ since there are no other stones, we get:
$$\begin{aligned} Y &= \frac{X}{175} \\ &= \frac{(Y \times 175 + A \times 2)}{175} \\ &= Y \times \frac{175 + 2}{175} \\ &= Y \times 2 \end{aligned}$$
So, $Y = 2$. Now, substituting this value back into the first equation, we get:
$$\begin{aligned} X &= 2 \times 175 + 0 \times 35 + A \times 2 \\ &= 350 + A \times 2 \\ &= 350 + 2A \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the value of the dragon's treasure is $350 + 2A$, where $A$ is the value of one emerald."
Response:  We know that there are twice as many boys as girls in school. So, if there are 60 girls and 5 boys per teacher, then there must be 12 teachers (since 60 x 5 = 300). Therefore, there are 12 teachers in the school.
Response:  At first, Beily has $100 in cash. Then he receives weekly payments of $5 for 8 weeks, so he gets $40 ($5 x 8). Finally, if at the end of 8 weeks he still has $100, then he must have had $60 left after receiving the $40 in payments (since $100 - $40 = $60). Therefore, Beily started with $60.
Response:  Judy teaches for 5 hours per day from Monday to Friday and for 8 hours on Saturday. Therefore, she teaches a total of 30 hours (5 x 7) in one week. If each class has 15 students and she charges $15 per student per hour, then her total revenue for one week is: Total Revenue = Number of Students x Hourly Rate x Number of Hours taught = 15 x $15 x 30 = $4500 per week.
Response:  The first recipe has 20 instructions, and the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Therefore, if we multiply 20 by 2, we get 40 instructions for the second recipe. So, Kelian needs to read 40 instructions to prepare both dishes.
Response:  Tom sells 43 colačići and 23 pieces of cheese colacak. The price of each colačić is $ 3, and the price of each piece of cheese colacak is $ 4. Therefore, the total amount that Tom will collect from these sales can be calculated as follows: Number of colačići sold = 43 Price per colačić = $ 3 Total amount collected from colačići = 43 x $ 3 = $ 129 Total number of pieces of cheese colacak sold = 23 Price per piece of cheese colacak = $ 4 Total amount collected from pieces of cheese colacak = 23 x $ 4 = $ 92 In total, Tom will collect $ 221 ($ 129 + $ 92).
Response:  The cost of each mobile phone is $150, and there are 5 phones in total. So, the total cost of all 5 phones is $750 ($150 x 5). Now, we need to calculate the interest for each month. Since the payment period is 3 months, the interest rate is 2% per year, which means it's 0.02 per month. Therefore, the amount that Shiela will pay each month is $750 + (0.02 x $750) = $750 + $15 = $765. So, Shiela will pay $765 per month for 3 months.
Response:  If Arty sells one marigold for $2.74 per pot, then he will sell 12 pots of marigolds for $2.74 x 12 = $32.96. Similarly, if he sells one petunia for $1.87 per pot, then he will sell 9 pots of petunias for $1.87 x 9 = $16.53. And if he sells one begonia for $2.12 per pot, then he will sell 17 pots of begonias for $2.12 x 17 = $35.04. Therefore, in total, Arty will make $32.96 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $84.53.
"Response:  The sandcastle builder builds each level of the castle with a square base that is half the size of the previous level. So, if the first level has a base of $x$ meters squared, the second level will have a base of $2x$ meters squared, and so on. Since the highest level has a base of $16$ meters squared, we can set up the equation:
$$\frac{x}{2} = \frac{2x}{3} = \cdots = \frac{16x}{n}$$
where $n$ is the number of levels (or floors) in the castle. Solving for $x$, we get:
$$x = 8$$
So, the prosepective sandcastle builder needs to use $8$ cubic meters of sand to build each level of the castle. Therefore, the average area of each level is also $8$ square meters."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Cecilia must feed her puppy with 1 cup of food per day for the first 180 days (or 6 months). Then, she must continue to feed it 2 cups of food per day until the end of its life. So, in total, how many cups of food will Cecilia use during the puppy's lifetime?

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* For the first 180 days (or 6 months), Cecilia must feed her puppy 1 cup of food per day. Therefore, the number of cups of food used during this period is:

1 cup/day x 180 days = 180 cups

* After the initial 180-day period, Cecilia must continue to feed her puppy 2 cups of food per day until the end of its life. Therefore, the total number of cups of food used throughout the puppy's lifetime is:

180 cups + (2 cups/day x number of remaining days) =?

We are not given the exact number of remaining days, but we can estimate it based on the lifespan of a dog. Assuming that the average lifespan of a dog is around 10 years, and considering that Cecilia's puppy is only 6 months old at the start of the problem, we can estimate the number of remaining days as follows:

Number of remaining days = 10 years - 6 months = 4 years

Therefore, the total number of cups of food used throughout the puppy's lifetime is:

180 cups + (2 cups/day x 4 years) =?

Solving for the answer, we get:

Total number of cups of food used = 180 cups + (2 x 4 years) = 352 cups

So, according to the problem, Cecilia will use 352 cups of food to feed her puppy throughout its lifetime."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Reymond weighs more than half of Sarah's weight, and Sarah weighs 4 times as much as David. So, if Sarah weighs x pounds, then Reymond weighs x/2 pounds, and David weighs 4x pounds. Therefore, the difference in weight between Reymond and David is:

$$\text{Difference} = \text{Reymond's weight} - \text{David's weight}$$
= $\frac{x}{2}$ - $4x$
= $\frac{x}{4}$
So, the difference in weight between Reymond and David is $\frac{x}{4}$."
"Response:  If Vinсent buys 18 flowers at the better price of $2 per flower, he will pay:
$2 x 18 = $36
So, he saves $36 - $36 = $0."
Response:  John pays $100 for grooming services. Grummer offers a discount of 30%, which means that he will charge John only $70 ($100 x 30%) for the same service. So, the cost of grooming after the discount is $70.
Response:  We know that two girls received 1/6 of 24 liters of water each, so together they got 2 x 1/6 = 3 liters of water. Then, the boy received 6 liters of water, leaving 6 - 3 = 3 liters of water remaining. Therefore, there are 3 liters of water left.
Response:  Charlie had 10 stickers initially and bought 21 more from the store in the mall. So, he has a total of 31 stickers now (10 + 21). Then, he gave 9 stickers to his sister, leaving him with 22 stickers (31 - 9 = 22). Finally, he used 28 stickers to decorate the greeting card, so there are 4 stickers left for him (22 - 28 = 4). Therefore, Charlie has 4 stickers remaining.
Response:  We know that Alex weighs less than Gres by 125 - 2.5 = 122.5 kg. So, Gres' weight is 125 kg and Alex's weight is 2.5 kg. Therefore, their total weights are 125 + 2.5 = 127.5 kg.
Response:  Dan has planted three roses, and each rose has 25 rosebuds. Therefore, there are 3 x 25 = 75 rosebuds in total. Each rosebud has 8 thorns, so the total number of thorns is 75 x 8 = 600 thorns.
Response:  If they have played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost, then we can write this as follows: Won = Lost + X, where X is the number of wins minus losses. Substituting this into the equation above gives us: Won = Lost + X. Solving for X, we get: X = Won - Lost. In this case, the team has won 8 games more than they lost, so X = 8. Therefore, the team has won 10 games (8 + 2).
"Response: 
From the problem statement, we know that Jin has been going on vacation four times a year since he was 23 years old. Therefore, he has gone on vacation for a total of 16 x 4 = 64 times.
Since each vacation lasts for one week, and there are 7 days in a week, then the number of blocks in each row is equal to the number of days in a week divided by the number of weeks in an year, which is 7 x 52 = 365.
So, the total number of blocks in all rows is 64 x 365 = 23,040.
Therefore, the answer is 23,040."
Response:  The alarm sounded four times when Greg left today. On the second occasion, it sounded three times longer than the first time. Therefore, it sounded 7 times (4 x 3). Finally, on the third occasion, it sounded half as long again as the second time, so it sounded 10 times (7 x 1.5). In total, therefore, the alarm sounded 27 times (4 + 7 + 10).
"Response:  If Silvi has been working for five years in December of last year and the company pays $600 per month to each employee, then her monthly salary is:
$600 x 12 = $7,200 per year
Now, according to the policy, the company will increase the salary of each employee by 10% of their initial salary every year they stay with the company. So, if Silvi stays with the company for three more years, her annual salary will be:
$7,200 x 1.10 = $8,340 (after one year)
$8,340 x 1.10 = $9,412 (after two years)
$9,412 x 1.10 = $10,573 (after three years)
Therefore, Silvi's annual salary after three years will be $10,573."
Response:  We know that First Merlin Plate sold 88,000 copies together. If Harald sold 10 times more than First Merlin Plate, then he sold 880,000 copies. So, the answer is 880,000.
"Response:  We know that Christina invited 16 friends to her birthday party and she needs 75 packages for each guest, so in total she needs 1200 packages (75 x 16). Since each package costs $2, the total cost of the gifts will be:

$1200 x 2 = $2400

So, Christina will spend $2400 on gifts for her guests."
Response:  The adult dinosaur can eat 10 pounds of cucumber salad (which is equal to 4.5 kg). Since there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, we need to calculate how much food each person needs. For an adult, we know that they can eat half as much as the amount the adult dinosaur can eat, so 20 adults would need 2 x 4.5 = 9 kg of cucumber salad. As for the children, since they are only half as big as the adults, they need half as much food too, which means they need 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 kg of cucumber salad. Therefore, in total, Ted should bring 9 + 2.5 = 11.5 kg of cucumber salad to the picnic.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:
1. Jan has three times as many pets as Marta. So if Marta has x pets, then Jan has 3x pets.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Siouxsie. So if Siouxsie has y pets, then Marcia has y + 2 pets.
3. Syndi has four fewer pets than Jan. So if Jan has 3y pets, then Syndi has 3y - 4 pets.
Now we can use the information from each of these statements to find out how many pets there are altogether:
Total number of pets = Number of pets with Jan + Number of pets with Marcia + Number of pets with Syndi
= 3x + (y + 2) + (3y - 4)
Simplifying this equation gives us:
Total number of pets = 3x + 5y - 8
So, there are 3x + 5y - 8 pets in total."
"Response:  We know that Emily has four children named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, we can write:
Amy - 5 = Jackson + 2
Jackson = Amy - 5 + 2
We also know that James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey, so we can write:
James = Corey - 1
Now we have two equations:
Jackson = Amy - 5 + 2
James = Corey - 1
Can you solve these equations to find out how old Jackson is?"
"Response:  We know that Li could run 400 meters with obstacles in 38 seconds faster than Jerry did. So, if Li runs 400 meters with obstacles for x seconds, then Jerry can run it for (x + 10)% of those seconds. Therefore, we have:

Li ran 400 m with obstacles in 38 s = Jerry ran 400 m with obstacles in (38 x 1.10) s = Jerry ran 400 m with obstacles in 35.8 s
So, Jerry can run 400 meters with obstacles in approximately 35.8 seconds."
Response:  We know that the number of rabbits is 12 times smaller than the combined number of houses and cats. So if there are x houses and y cats, then the number of rabbits is 12x/y. Since there are 60 dogs, we can write: 12x/y = 60. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 48 and y = 3. Therefore, there are 48 houses, 3 cats, and 60 dogs in the village.
"Response:  From the given information we know that out of 200 students:
* 100 are boys (since 2/5 = 40)
* 100 are girls (since 3/5 = 60)
* 50 are in the Girl Scouts (since 2/3 = 33)
So there are 33 girls in the Girl Scouts."
"Response:  We know that Harry slept for 9 hours and his friend James slept for less than half of that (2/3). So, if we divide 9 by 2/3, we get...

Harry slept for 9 / 2/3 = 16 hours more than James."
"Response:  We know that when Freda cooked the conserves with paraffin wax, they lost half of their volume. So if each conserve of 40 grams contains three domestic, then the total amount of paraffin wax used by Freda is:

Total weight of paraffin wax = Number of consumes x Weight of one consume
= 32 uнци x 40 grams/уница
= 1280 grams

Therefore, Freda used 1280 grams of paraffin wax to make her last batch of preserved vegetables."
"Response: 
Let's say that in the first 15 minutes, x cars passed through the traffic jam. Since 5 cars took an exit without passing through the traffic jam, we can subtract those from the total number of cars that passed through the traffic jam. Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is equal to x - 5.
So, the answer is x = 25."
Response:  Mary has already collected 18 new bags of soil from her favorite nursery today. She currently has 2 bags per window out of 40 windows in her large house at the farm. If she decides to give one bag per window to friends and family tomorrow, that means she will have 36 bags left (2 x 32 = 64 - 18). So, there will be 36 bags of soil left with Mary after she gives some away tomorrow.
Response:  The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened it. So, the total number of presses before Jerome opened the door is 20 + (1/4 x 20) = 20 + 5 = 25. Similarly, the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the second friend, so they pressed it 30 times in total. Finally, the fourth friend pressed it 60 times. Therefore, the total number of presses before Jerome opened the door is 25 + 30 + 60 = 115.
Response:  Solomon has to read 4 pages from his science textbook, 20 pages from his social studies book, 7 pages from his history book, and 8 pages from his geography book in total. He has already read 15 pages in Monday. To find out how many pages he will read per day, we can divide the total number of pages he needs to read by the number of days he has left to read them: Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 49 Pages per day = 49 / 4 = 12.25 pages per day
Response:  John likes to drink a cup of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. At the end of the day, he also has one more cup before going to bed. So, in total, John drinks 3 cups of water per day (1 for each meal + 1 extra). Therefore, John drinks 21 cups of water per week (3 x 7 = 21).
"Response:  We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles of land with the tsunami wave. So, if we want to cover the entire city (which is 42 miles wide), how many minutes will it take?
We can calculate this as follows:
Time = Distance / Speed
Distance = Total distance of the city (in miles)
Speed = Time taken to cover one mile (in minutes)

So, in this case, the total distance of the city is 42 miles. If it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3 miles, then it will take:
Time = 42 miles / 3 miles/minute = 14 minutes
Therefore, it will take 14 minutes for the tsunami wave to completely cover the entire city."
Response:  The initial puzzle has 1000 pieces. Popa places 250 pieces on the table (half of the remaining 500). Then his mother places another 250 pieces (the rest of the remaining 250). So, there are now 750 pieces left to be placed.
Response:  If Коди eats three times more colačić than Aimir, that means Aimir eats x colačić. Since Аmir eats 5 colačić, Коди eats 3x colačić. Therefore, together they eat 3x + 5 = 8 colačić.
Response:  The volume of each box is given as $V = 5 \text{ in} \times 6 \text{ in} \times 4 \text{ in} = 120 \text{ cubic inches}$. Since there are three boxes, the total volume of all three boxes is $V = 3 \times 120 = 360 \text{ cubic inches}$. Finally, since the walls are $8 \text{ cm}$ thick, we subtract this amount from the total volume to get the internal volume of the boxes, which is $V = 360 - (8 \text{ cm}) = 352 \text{ cubic inches}$.
Response:  According to the passage, Frank watches TV after finishing his homework each night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour-long episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he finishes his homework earlier and watches an additional 30 minutes of the same show. On Thursday, he watches two hour-long episodes. Therefore, if Frank watched TV for a total of 7 hours, we can deduce that he watched 2 x 60 = 120 minutes of the show in Wednesday. So, he watched 30 minutes of the show in Wednesday.
Response:  Last year, Henry baked 60 colačiće (since he wanted to earn twice as much money). When he finished baking, he found that he had actually baked 15 more than he intended (so 75 in total). He threw away 5 of them while they were cooling down, so now he has 110 colačiće in total. Therefore, last year Henry baked 60 + 15 = 75 colačiće.
"Response:  If the local gas station sells benzine for $3 per gallon, and the company that produces applications offers $20.20 per gallon if you fill up at this station, then we can calculate how much gas someone will get after deducting money as follows:
Gas amount = Total amount paid - Discount amount
= $3 x Number of gallons purchased
- $20.20 x Number of gallons purchased
In this case, if someone buys 10 gallons of benzine, they will receive $3 x 10 = $30 in gas, minus the discount of $20.20 x 10 = $202, so they will have $30 - $202 = -$172 left over after deducting the discount. Therefore, the correct answer is -$172."
Response:  We know that Marcel and Beatriz are competing to see who can eat the most fruit. Unfortunately, someone made a mistake, and Beatriz was twice as wide as she should have been (2 ruolas) and 24 times longer than she should have been (ruolas), while Marcel was three times wider than he should have been (3 ruolas) and 14 times longer than he should have been (ruolas). If they both ate the entire amount of fruit, how much would they have eaten in average?  To find out, we need to divide the total length of Beatriz by her width, and then multiply it by the number of times she was longer than she should have been. Similarly, we need to do the same for Marcel. So, if we calculate this way, Beatriz would have eaten approximately 2 x 24 = 48 units of fruit, and Marcel would have eaten approximately 3 x 14 = 42 units of fruit. Therefore, their average consumption per unit of time is (48 + 42) / 2 = 46 units/ruola.
"Response:  The boat took in two liters of water every ten meters it traveled, so it took sixteen seconds to travel twenty feet (since there are five meters in a foot). Therefore, the volume of water taken in is:

2 L/10 m = 0.02 m^3 per meter

Since the boat moved at a rate of 20 ft / 16 sec = 1.25 m/sec, we can calculate the total volume of water taken in as follows:

Volume of water taken in = Total distance traveled x Speed
= 20 ft x 1.25 m/sec
= 0.25 m^3

So, there were 0.25 cubic meters of water in the boat when Julia reached the shore."
Response:  If there are 4 teachers and each teacher has 2 hours of class time per day, then there are 8 hours of class time in total per day (4 x 2 = 8). Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per hour, it will be cleaned 24 times per day (8 x 3 = 24). Therefore, the whiteboard will be cleaned once every 24 minutes (24 / 8 = 1/24).
Response:  If Rajan plants two flowers every day and it takes 15 days for them to bloom, then in total he will have planted 2 x 15 = 30 flowers during this period. Since 5 of these flowers do not grow, Rajan will have 30 - 5 = 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.
Response:  We know that Jamal's phone can take 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone can take 50 photos of birds at the zoo, then Jamal's phone can take 300 (6 x 50) photos of birds at the zoo. Now we are given that Jamal's phone can take 1800 photos in total. Therefore, the number of birds that can be seen on Jamal's photo of a single bird is 1800 / 300 = 6 birds. So there are 6 birds visible on Jamal's photo of a single bird at the zoo.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sasha has 15 pieces of wood (10 x 2 + 5). Each piece costs $10 or $16 depending on its size. If she sells all her wood, how much money will she make in total?
Let's calculate the cost of each piece first:
Cost = Number of pieces x Price per piece
= 10 x $10
+ 5 x $16
= $100 + $80
= $180
Now let's calculate the profit:
Profit = Total revenue - Cost
= Sold price per piece x Number of pieces sold
= $180 / 15 pieces
= $120 per piece
So, if Sasha sells all her wood, she will make a profit of $120 per piece."
"Response:  According to the problem statement, Kate used 7 times more sugar than water in her coffee. So if she used x cups of sugar, she would have used 7x cups of water. Since there are 120 total cups of liquid (7x + 53), we can set up the equation:

x + 53 = 120... (1)

Now we know that Kate used 7 times as much sugar as water, so for every cup of water she used, she used 7/7 = 1 cup of sugar. Therefore, the number of cups of sugar Kate used is:

x = 120 / 7 = 17 cups

So Kate used 17 cups of sugar in her coffee."
Response:  John bought two pairs of shoes for each of his three children. So he paid 2 x 3 = 6 times 60 dollars = 120 dollars. Therefore, John paid 120 dollars in total.
Response:  On day one, the dock worker counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles in each container, so there were 10 vehicles in total (2 x 5 = 10). If they brought more containers on the second day, and we assume that each container has 5 vehicles again, then the total number of vehicles would be: 30 - 10 = 20 new vehicles. Therefore, the number of containers that were unloaded on the second day is: 20 / 5 = 4 containers.
Response:  We know that Adriana's total salary was $30% higher than Lily's four years ago. So, if Lily made $40,000 four years ago, Adriana made $56,000 ($40,000 x 1.3). Now, we are told that both of their salaries increased by 20% over the past four years. Therefore, Lily's current salary is $53,600 ($40,000 x 1.2), and Adriana's current salary is $63,840 ($56,000 x 1.2).
Response:  Miguel uses 2 sheets of paper per week for his drawing. So he uses 8 sheets (2 x 4 weeks) in one month. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in total, each month he uses 30 / 8 = 4 sheets of paper. Therefore, Miguel uses 4 sheets of paper each month.
Response:  Moriseta brought 5 jabokas and 8 portocals, so she contributed (5 + 8) = 13 fruit to the total amount. Since Cael doubled Moriseta's contribution, he also brought 2 x 13 = 26 fruit. Therefore, in total, there are 13 + 26 = 39 fruits.
Response:  On Monday, she slept for 8 hours. In the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept for 2 hours less each day, so she slept for 6 hours on Tuesday and 4 hours on Wednesday. Therefore, if she slept more than 1 hour during the rest of the week, her total sleep time would be 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 hours.
Response:  Rosi can run 10 miles in 3 hours, so she runs at a rate of 10/3 = 3.33 miles per hour. Then, she runs for another 8 kilometers, which is equal to 8/60 = 0.13 miles. Therefore, Rosi has traveled a total distance of 3.33 + 0.13 = 3.46 miles in 7 hours.
Response:  When Jenny started helping her mother at the office, there were 60 letters that needed to be stamped and 30 already stamped letters. So, in total, there were 90 letters (60 + 30). Now, if she has been working for x hours, then the number of letters she has stamped is equal to x/4, since she stamps one-third of each letter. Therefore, the number of already stamped letters is 30 / 4 = 7.5.
"Response: 
Julia bought a new pack of plastic cups and her husband also bought one for her. She used three cups to taste the soup before serving it, so she had 9 remaining cups after that. Later, when she went to serve the soup, she found that she had 12 cups in total. Therefore, there were 3 more cups in the package than Julia initially had. So, the answer is 3."
Response:  We know that Dylan needed both poultry and fish cobblers to make cobblers at the party. He bought 38 chicken cobblers more than he bought fish cobblers. So, if he bought x fish cobblers, then he bought 38 + x chicken cobblers in total. Therefore, the answer is 44 (x).
Response:  After Amy transferred to a new school, she had 20 more friends than Lily. So, Lily had 50 - 20 = 30 friends. Therefore, together, Amy and Lily have 30 + 20 = 50 friends. 
"Response: 
We know that one beetroot costs 3 times as much as each pepper. So, if one pepper costs $x, then one beetroot costs $3x.
We also know that portulaca costs $5 less than each beetroot. So, if one beetroot costs $3x, then one portulaca costs $3x - $5 = $2x.
Now, Dylan wants to buy 4 lupees, 20 paprika, and 10 portulacas. The total cost of these items is:
4 x $3x + 20 x $x + 10 x $2x =?
Can you calculate the final price?"
"Response:  The number of patients seen per day is given as 500. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, the total time spent seeing patients in one day is:

Time = Number of patients x Time per patient = 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes

Now, we need to calculate how much money the hospital earns from these visits. We know that doctors are paid $150 per hour and that the hospital charges patients $200 per hour. So, the amount earned by the hospital from each visit can be calculated as follows:

Amount earned by hospital = Total time spent seeing patients x Price charged per hour = 12,000 minutes x $200 per hour = $240,000 per day

Therefore, the hospital earns $240,000 per day from these visits."
Response:  We know that 60 seasonal workers were hired to play elves in Nisa's slave trading center. Of these, one-third (20) left after children vomited on them, and another 10 left after being hit by children's feet. Therefore, there are now only 30 elves remaining at the center.
Response:  In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $440 less than in May, so he spent $500 - $440 = $80 more in June than in May. Therefore, his total spending for both months was $500 + $80 = $580.
Response:  Pem has been on the Ferris wheel twice and Fred four times. So far, they have spent $12 (2 x $6) between them. Now, each of them decides to ride the merry-go-round twice, which will cost an additional $12 ($6 per ride). Therefore, in total, they will spend $24 that day ($12 + $12).
Response:  On Monday, Waldo ran 4 miles. On Tuesday, he ran six times more kilometers than on Monday, which means he ran 6 x 4 = 24 kilometers. Therefore, his total distance traveled from Monday to Wednesday is 4 + 24 = 28 kilometers. So, he ran 28 kilometers in Wednesday.
Response:  Tom has 4 cars to wash per month, and each car costs $15 for washing. So, in one year (12 months), he will have to pay: Number of cars x Price per car = $480 ($4 x $15) Therefore, Tom pays $480 per year for washing his 4 cars.
Response:  We know that Brian has 20 video games and Bob has fewer than 3 times as many. So, if Bob has x video games, then Brian has 20 - 3x video games. Since Bob has 5 less than Brian, we can write an equation: 20 - 3x = 5. Solving for x, we get: x = 10. Therefore, Bob has 10 video games.
Response:  We know that there are 27 male and female reindeer in total. Two-thirds of them are females (i.e., 2/3 x 27 = 18). So, the number of female Scottish reindeer is 18.
"Response:  The total cost of the items is:

* 2 x $ 7.50 = $ 15.00 (subdivisions)
* 2 x $ 1.50 = $ 3.00 (chips)
* 2 x $ 1.00 = $ 2.00 (cookies)
Total cost of goods = $ 20.00
Adding the additional fee for delivery, which is 20% of the total cost of goods, we get:
Delivery fee = $ 20.00 x 20% = $ 4.00
So, the total cost of the order including delivery will be:
$ 20.00 + $ 4.00 = $ 24.00"
"Response:  If Mark completed 75 questions in 8 hours (or 5 questions per hour), then he completed each question in 8/5 = 1.6 hours. 
If he took 6 hours to complete the second test with 100 questions, that means he completed 100/6 = 16.7 questions per hour. 
So, there were 100 - 16.7 = 83.3 questions left unanswered."
"Response:  We know that there are 22 red rubber balls and four times as many blue ones, so we can write:

Number of red rubber balls = 22
Number of blue rubber balls = 4 × Number of blue rubber balls = 4 × 12 = 48

So, there are 22 red rubber balls and 48 blue rubber balls in total."
"Response:  There are 20 automobiles that can be rented out of which 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total number of cars - Number of automatic cars
= 20 - 12
= 8

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 8/20 x 100 = 40%."
Response:  We know that there are 700 bees in total and twice as many worker bees as queen bees. So, if there are x queen bees, then there are 2x worker bees. Therefore, we can write an equation: 700 = x + (2x) = 2(x). Solving for x, we get x = 350. So, there are 350 worker bees.
Response:  Jordan plays video games for two hours every day and works on a shortened work schedule where he earns $10 per hour. To calculate how much Jordan would make in a week if he spent that time playing video games, we need to multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week. So, if Jordan spends two hours playing video games each day, he will have earned $20 per day ($10/hour x 2 hours). Since there are seven days in a week, Jordan will have earned a total of $140 ($20 x 7 days) during the week.
"Response:  John bought milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, flour for $3, and sugar for $4. The total cost of these items is:

$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $16

If there is a 10% tax on all non-essential goods, the tax amount would be:

$16 x 0.10 = $1.60

So, the final cost to John is:

$16 + $1.60 = $17.60"
"Response: 
Kim has already got three clients and is expecting to get five more. For each client, he will need two bottles of bleach and one package of cleaning cloths. The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of each package of cleaning cloths is $5. Therefore, Kim's total weekly expenses for supplies are:
3 clients x 2 bottles/client = 6 bottles @ $2/bottle = $12
3 clients x 1 package/client = 3 packages @ $5/package = $15
Total weekly expenses = $12 + $15 = $27
Now let's calculate Kim's profit per week:
Profit = Total revenue - Total expenses
= $92 (weekly revenue) - $27 (weekly expenses)
= $65
So, Kim will make a profit of $65 per week."
Response:  John has 10 hectares of land for ananas. On each hectare, there are 100 ananas. John can harvest ananas every 3 months. So in one year, John can harvest ananas 4 times (3 months x 4 years = 12 harvests). Therefore, John can collect 400 ananas per year (10 hectares x 100 ananas/hectare x 4 harvests/year = 400 ananas/year).
"Response:  If Johnny buys Lego sets with the following number of pieces:

* 500 pieces (smallest set) = 500 blocks
* 1500 pieces (medium-sized set) = 1500 blocks
* 3 x 500 pieces (largest set) = 1500 blocks + 1500 blocks = 3000 blocks
Total number of blocks = 500 + 1500 + 3000 = 5000 blocks
Therefore, Johnny will stack 5000 blocks if he buys all three Lego sets."
"Response: 
At first (from 6 AM to 12 PM), 30 bees left the hive and then half of them returned in the next 6 hours. So, the number of bees that returned during this period is:
30 x 0.5 = 15 bees
Later (from 12 PM to 6 PM), Debra saw twice as many bees leaving the hive than she had seen earlier. If there were x bees leaving the hive during this period, then the total number of bees that left the hive during the day is:
x x 2 = 2x bees
Now, we need to find out how many bees returned during the last 6 hours of the day. Since half of the bees that left the hive during the earlier period returned, the number of bees that returned during the last 6 hours is:
15 x 0.5 = 7.5 bees
So, the final answer is:
Debra saw 7.5 bees returning to the hive between 12 PM and 6 PM."
Response:  Brittani and her mom go to the museum, and the cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Her mother gives the cashier $8 in cash. So, the amount of money her mother gave in cash is $8.
"Response:  According to the problem statement:
Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy.
So if Charlie has x friends on Facebook, then Dorothy has x/3 = y friends on Facebook (since Charlie has three times as many). Similarly, since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, James has 4y friends on Facebook.
Now we are given that Charlies has 12 friends on Facebook. So, we can set up the equation:
x = 12... (1)
Simplifying Equation (1), we get:
y = 3... (2)
Since James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, we can write:
James's number of friends = 4y
Substituting the value of y from Equation (2):
James's number of friends = 4(3) = 12
Therefore, James has 12 friends on Facebook."
Response:  STEVE can reach home in x minutes if he is 3 miles away and can bike at 440 feet per minute. TIM can reach home in y minutes if he is 3 kilometers away and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. Since Steve lives closer to school than Tim, Steve will finish the race before Tim does. So, x < y. Now we need to find the exact values of x and y. We know that x + y = 1 hour (since they both start at the same time), so we can write: x/440 = y/264. Solving for x and y, we get: x = 25 minutes and y = 37 minutes. Therefore, Steve will finish the race in 25 minutes, while Tim will take 37 minutes to reach home.
"Response: 
1. First day, 5 people came to inflate their bicycles. Each tire costs $0.25, so they paid a total of $1.25 for both tires.
2. Next, 3 people came to inflate their tricycle tires. Each tire costs $0.25, so they paid a total of $0.75.
3. Finally, one person came to inflate their unicycle tire. Each tire costs $0.25, so they paid $0.25.
Total amount earned that day = $1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25 = $2.25."
Response:  If Carl buys ten packages of cookies and each package contains six cookies, then he will buy a total of 60 cookies (10 x 6 = 60). Since each cookie costs $0.10, Carl will pay a total of $6 for all the cookies ($60 / 0.10 = 60). So, if he pays with $10 dollars, he will get $4 in change ($10 - $6 = $4).
"Response: 
1. Dave ate 14 potatoes before his hunger made him lose the bag in his hand.
2. When the cat fell, it ate half of the remaining fries that Dave had eaten.
3. Three pigeons took away the bag from Dave's hand. Each pigeon ate three sweet potato cakes.
4. A fox stole two-thirds of the remaining fried chicken from the mice who had taken them.
5. Mice took away the last five fried chickens.
So, when Dave bought the big package of potatoes, there were 5 left."
"Response: 
Kim has three hours of classes per day from Monday to Friday, so he has:
3 hours/day x 5 days/week = 15 hours/week
In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school:
16 weeks x 15 hours/week = 240 hours/semester
Therefore, Kim spends 240 hours in class each semester."
"Response:  The length of each roll is 16 cm, and there are 300 rolls in total. Therefore, the total length of all rolls is:

300 x 16 = 4800 cm

Similarly, the length of each chocolate croissant is 18 cm, and there are 120 croissants in total. So, the total length of all croissants is:

120 x 18 = 2160 cm

And finally, the length of each bagel is 60 cm, and there are 60 bags in total. Thus, the total length of all bagels is:

60 x 60 = 3600 cm

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the products to find out how long they would stretch if placed end to end:

4800 + 2160 + 3600 = 10560 cm

So, if Bill places all the baked goods end to end, they would stretch for approximately 10560 cm or 10.56 meters!"

Response:  Brayden ran 15 times along the football field of length 100 meters, so he covered a distance of 15 x 100 = 1500 meters. Kelly ran once from one end of the field to the other (a distance of 100 meters), and then she ran back and forth along the remaining 70 meters of the field for a total of 34 runs. Therefore, Kelly covered a distance of 34 x 70 = 2380 meters in total. Since Brayden covered more distance than Kelly, he is the winner. The difference between their distances is: 1500 - 2380 = -880 meters. So, Brayden is ahead of Kelly by 880 meters.
Response:  Rafael bought 4 pens that cost $1.5 each, so he spent $6 on pens. He also bought 2 notebooks that cost $4 each, so he spent $8 on notebooks. Finally, he bought an exercise book that cost $20. Therefore, in total, Rafael spent $6 + $8 + $20 = $34 on school supplies.
Response:  FIn saw 11 bubbles in the lake initially. Then, he noticed that 6 of them emerged from hiding under lilies, and then he saw that two of them were hiding under a rock. So, the total number of bubbles FIn can see now is: 11 - 6 = 5 (bubbles that are still visible) + 2 (bubbles hidden under the rock) = 7 bubbles. Therefore, FIn can see 7 bubbles in the lake now.
Response:  The depth of water in the reservoir was 17 feet on Monday (or x). On Tuesday, it increased by 2 meters or 6 feet (x + 6). On Wednesday, it decreased by two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, which is equal to 4 feet (x - 4). So, the depth of water in the reservoir on Wednesday was 9 feet (x = 9).
"Response: 
Anakin has caught 10 sea stars, which means he has caught 10/1 = 10 sea stars in total.
Loxin has caught 5 sea stars less than Ana kin, so L oxin has caught 5/1 = 5 sea stars in total.
Anakin has also caught more horseshoe crabs than Loxin, with 6 horseshoe crabs to Loxin's 3. So Ana kin has caught 6/1 = 6 horseshoe crabs in total.
Finally, Loxin has caught more kelpies than Ana kin, with 3 kelpies to Ana kin's 2. So Loxin has caught 3/1 = 3 kelpies in total.
Therefore, the number of fish that Ana kin and Loxin have caught together is:
10 + 5 + 6 + 3 = 24 fish."
"Response:  The initial price of the jar was $20, and it increased by 20% every two months. So after two months, the new price would be:

$20 x (1 + 0.20) = $24
After four months, the new price would be:

$24 x (1 + 0.20) = $28.80
And so on...
So, after 36 months, the price of the jar would be:

$28.80 x (1 + 0.20)^36 = $57.92
Therefore, the cost of the jar after 36 months is $57.92."
"Response:  We know that one dollar is equal to 100 cents. So, if one acción figure costs $5, then it costs 500 cents ($5 / $1 = 500 cents). Now, we have to find out how many cents each of the other items cost. The red cars cost $4 each, so they cost 400 cents ($4 x 100 = 400 cents) each. The lu... (view details) 

Question: У једној соби има разних играчака: 5 црвених аутомобила, 3 акционе фигуре и лутка. Кукла је коштала чак 3 акционе фигуре, а један црвени аутомобил коштао је 4 долара. Колико су све играчке вредне, ако једна акцијска фигура кошта 5 долара?

Based on the question, formulate a numeric answer.

Answer: Let's think step by step. We know that one dollar is equal to 100 cents. So, if one action figure costs $5, then it costs 500 cents ($5 / $1 = 500 cents). Now, we have to find out how many cents each of the other items cost. The red cars cost $4 each, so they cost 400 cents ($4 x 100 = 400 cents) each. The lucky has no price, since it was given away for free. Therefore, the total value of all the items in the room can be calculated as follows:

Value of red cars = 5 x 400 cents = $20
Value of action figures = 3 x 500 cents = $1500
Total value of all items = $20 + $1500 = $1520

Therefore, the value of all the items in the room is $1520."
"Response:  If Jackie pays taxes herself, she will save $35 per hour worked (since she would work three hours less). So her after-tax income would be:
After-tax income = Gross income - Tax savings
= $60 - ($35 x 3)
= $60 - $105
= $45
Now let's calculate how much more money Jackie would have if she hires an accountant:
If Jackie hires an accountant, she will save $90 per hour worked (since the accountant will handle all taxes and fees). So her after-tax income would be:
After-tax income = Gross income - Accounting fee savings
= $60 - $90
= -$30
So, if Jackie hires an accountant, she will have $30 less than if she paid taxes herself."
Response:  Elvira has a budget of €1500 and she spent €1090 on the computer with monitor, touchpad, mouse, scanner, CD player, and printer. That means she has €410 left for clothes.
Response:  Sandra needs to make 3 jars of Spanish flan for each time she watches her neighbor's child (9 times). So, in total, Sandra needs to make 27 jars of Spanish flan (3 x 9 = 27). Since there are 15 school groups, and each group requires 27 jars of Spanish flan, Sandra must watch the children 15 / 27 = 5 times. Therefore, Sander must repeat the task 5 times.
Response:  Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 2 x 2 = 4 years older than Brooke. So, if Brooke is currently 16 years old, then Seth is 16 + 4 = 20 years old. Therefore, Seth is 20 years old.
Response:  If Jimmy has more money than EtaL, then he must have at least $2 more than she does. So, if EtaL has $8, then Jimmy must have at least $10 (i.e., $2 more than $8). Therefore, Jimmy has $10 or more money than EtaL.
"Response:  Pancho walks for 30 kilometers per day, except for Saturday when he goes for a walk of 10 miles (which is approximately equal to 16 kilometers). To calculate how many kilometers he walks in a week, we need to multiply his daily distance by the number of days in a week. So, if there are 7 days in a week, then Pancho walks a total of:

30 km/day x 7 days/week = 210 km/week

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 210 kilometers in a week."
"Response:  The cost of each cap is $25, and since an orchestra ordered new uniforms, let's assume they bought caps in bulk, so the total cost of caps is:

$25 x number of caps = $X

Now, let's find out how much each jacket costs:

Since each jacket costs three times as much as a cap, we can calculate its price as follows:

Jacket cost = $X x 3 = $Y

Finally, let's find out how much each pair of pants costs:

Pant cost = ($X + $Y) / 2 = $Z

So, the total cost of each uniform is:

Ultimate cost = $X + $Y + $Z = $A

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

The orchestra paid a total of $A for their new uniforms."
Response:  We know that there are 80 pawns with 8 legs each, so we have 8 x 8 = 64 legs from the pawns. Then, there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, giving us 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. Finally, there are three rare mutant spiders with 10 legs each, which gives us an additional 3 x 10 = 30 legs. Therefore, in total, Jack sees 64 + 540 + 30 = 634 legs.
"Response:  We know that Sal Two is three years older than Grandma Red and two times older than Baby Blue. So, if Sal Four is the same age as Sal Twenty-two, then we can write an equation based on this information:
Sal Four = (2 x Sal Twenty-two) + 3
Now, we are given that Sal Twenty-two has eight years, so we can substitute this value into our equation:
Sal Four = (2 x 8) + 3 = 19 + 3 = 22
Therefore, the total number of years for all four birds is 22 + 3 = 25 years."
"Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much Jessica will pay for each debt per month. For student loans, it is $300/month; for credit card bills, it is $200/month; and for mortgage payments, it is $500/month. Next, we add up all these amounts to get the total amount that Jessica pays every month. In this case, she pays $800/month ($300 + $200 + $500). Now, if Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, then her new monthly payment would be $1,200 (i.e., $800 x 1.5). Therefore, Jessica will pay $1,200/month for one year."
Response:  Bilij has to prepare 60 potatoes for the big family barbecue. Since he needs to dress and chop them equally, it will take him approximately the same time to do so. He can peel each potato in about 1 minute and 3 seconds (since he takes 5 seconds to chop each one), which means he will need around 60 minutes to prepare all 60 potatoes. Therefore, Bilij will need around 60 minutes to finish preparing the potatoes for the barbecue.
"Response:  Juan and Carlos sell each gallon of lemonade for $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They also sell each cup for $0.50. If they sold 20 cups per gallon, their total revenue from selling cups would be:

$0.50 x 20 = $10

Now, let's calculate how much they spent on lemons and sugar:

Lemons: $3 x 20 = $60
Sugar: $2 x 20 = $40
Total cost = Lemons + Sugar = $60 + $40 = $100

So, if they earned $25 in profit, they must have spent $100 on lemons and sugar."
Response:  We know that there are 240 people in total and 80 of them are Japanese. This means that the remaining 160 people must be Chinese. Now, we are told that the number of boys in the Chinese team is 60. So, if there are 60 boys in the Chinese team, then the number of girls in the Chinese team must be equal to 60 - 60 = 0. Therefore, there are no girls in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Заид pays 1/4 of his salary to the maid ( $600 / 4 = $150). Secondly, he spends 1/3 of his salary on gas for his car ($600 / 3 = $200). Thirdly, he donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity organization ($600 - $150 - $200 = $250). Fourthly, he gives $200 to his daughter for weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household items. So, after all these expenditures, Заид has $600 - $150 - $200 - $250 = $800 left. Therefore, Заид will have $800 + $200 = $1000 in addition to his original salary of $6000 per month.
"Response:  According to the problem statement:
Rani has ten crabs more than Monica. So Rani has x = 10 + 4 = 14 crabs.
Monica has four fewer crabs than Boa. So Monica has m = 4 - 4 = 0 crabs.
Bo has 40 crabs. Therefore, the total number of crabs that the three have together is:
3 (Rani) + 0 (Monica) + 40 (Bo) = 3x + 0 + 40 = 74 crabs."
"Response:  Lloyd earned $10 per hour and worked for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. So, his total earnings are:

First week: $10 x 5 = $50
Second week: $10 x 8 = $80
Therefore, Lloyd has earned a total of $50 + $80 = $130 in the first two weeks."
Response:  The number of students who voted is 80, and the winner got 3/4 of their votes, which means they got 60 votes (80 x 3/4 = 60). So, the loser got 20 votes (80 - 60 = 20).
Response:  Sandra ordered four times more red roses than white lilies, which means she ordered 4 x 20 = 80 red roses and 20 white lilies. Since she also ordered 200 rose-colored lilies, that is five times more than the number of white lilies, we can conclude that she ordered 200 / 5 = 40 white lilies. Therefore, FRED must deliver 80 + 40 = 120 flowers to Sandra within the next 5 hours to avoid losing her business.
"Response:  According to the information given in the question:

* Џин is two years older than Mark. So, if Mark is x years old, then Џин is x + 2 years old.
* Two years ago, Mark was five years younger than Jan. So, if Jan is y years old now, then Mark was y - 5 years old two years ago.
* Now, we are told that Mark is currently x years old. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

x = y - 5... (1)

Now, we know that Џин is two years older than Mark, so we can find Џин's age as follows:

Џин = Mark + 2... (2)

Substituting Equation (1) into Equation (2), we get:

Џин = Mark + 2 = x + 2 + 5 = x + 7... (3)

So, Џин is 7 years older than Mark. Therefore, Џин is 37 years old."
Response:  The first team has four runners who can complete 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds each. Therefore, their total time for completing one lap (4 x 55 = 220 seconds). Now, let's consider the second team. Their first runner takes 60 seconds to complete 400 meters, and then each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner takes 57 seconds to complete 400 meters, the third runner takes 54 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken by the second team to complete one lap is (4 x 57 + 4 x 54 + 4 x 51) = 239 seconds. Since the first team's total time was 220 seconds, we can see that they are faster than the second team by 19 seconds (220 - 239 = 19). Therefore, the better team will win by 19 seconds.
Response:  The probability of Jerry throwing a number greater than 3 is 1/2 because there are two numbers greater than 3 in the set {4, 5, 6}. On the other hand, the probability of him throwing two consecutive even numbers is also 1/2 since there are two pairs of consecutive even numbers in the set {4, 6}. Therefore, the probability of Jerry throwing a number greater than 3 is twice that of him throwing two consecutive even numbers, which gives us a final answer of 2/3.
Response:  Jenna and her mother collected apples from their farm. Jenna picked up half of them. If Jenna's mother received 20 apples, then how many did they pick together?  So, the answer is 30 (50 - 20).
Response:  We know that there are three cages with penguins in them and each cage has an equal number of penguins. So, if we have x penguins in total, then there must be 3x penguins in all three cages combined. Since each penguin gets 6 pieces of bread, the total amount of bread given to all penguins is 3x \* 6 = 18x. Now, since hedgehogs get 5 pieces of bread per person, the total amount of bread given to all hedgehogs is 10 \* 5 = 50. Finally, since there are 20 pieces of bread left over after giving bread to both penguins and hedgehogs, the remaining bread is equal to 18x - 50 = x. Therefore, there are x/3 penguins in each cage.
"Response:  If Mandy owes Benedicto $100 and they agreed to pay a monthly interest of 2%, then after 3 months, the amount that Mandy needs to pay Benedicto can be calculated as follows:

Interest for 3 months = $100 x 2% x 3/100 = $6
New total amount = $100 + $6 = $106
So, after 3 months, Mandy needs to pay Benedicto $106."
Response:  The trader buys several bags of wheat from farmers at a price of $20 per bag. If transporting each bag from the farm to the warehouse costs $2, then...
Response:  The three friends spent $20.25 on tickets. They also spent less than $4.50 on food, so let's say they spent $4.25 on food. Therefore, their total spending was $20.25 + $4.25 = $24.50. Since they went on two different rides that cost $33 each, they paid a total of $66 for the rides. So, if they split the costs equally among themselves, each friend would have paid $66 / 3 = $22 per ride.
Response:  John collects sand grains for three hours. If he can collect 2 sand grains in one minute, then he will have collected 3 x 60 = 180 sand grains during those three hours. So, John has collected 180 sand grains.
Response:  If one patica needs to eat 2.5 kg of insects per week, then ten patties would need to eat 25 kg of insects per week. So, daily amount of insects needed for ten patties is 25/7 = 3.6 kg per day.
"Response:

After 10 years, 30% of the original number of trees have died, which means that 30 / 50 = 0.6 or 60% of the original number of trees are still alive. Therefore, the number of remaining trees is:
Number of remaining trees = Original number of trees x Percentage of surviving trees
= 50 x 0.6
= 30
So, there are 30 trees left after 10 years."
Response:  On Friday morning (субота), suckers put back one-third of the plastic flamingos they took away from Siu's front yard. So, there were 6 plastic flamingos returned to Siu's front yard (1/3 x 18 = 6). Then, in the afternoon (subota), suckers added another 18 plastic flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the total number of plastic flamingos on Sunday morning (petak) was 6 + 18 = 24.
Response:  We need to buy 5 different colored pencils for Violeta, and each one costs $2. So, we will spend $10 in total ($2 x 5 = $10).
"Response:  If one olovka costs $1.20 and one gušac costs $0.30, then eight olovki will cost:

$1.20 x 8 = $9.60

So, eight olovki will cost $9.60."
"Response:  We need to divide 200 kilograms of sauerkraut into 40 restaurants. Each restaurant will receive 2 kilograms of sauerkraut. Therefore, we have:

Number of restaurants = 40
Amount of sauerkraut per restaurant = 2 kg
Total amount of sauerkraut = Number of restaurants x Amount of sauerkraut per restaurant
= 40 x 2
= 80 kg
So, 80 kilograms of sauerkraut will not be used (or wasted)."
"Response:  We know that there are exactly 23786 inhabitants in Soddo. Among them, there are 8417 males and 9092 females. Therefore, the number of children (i.e., the difference between the total population and the number of males plus the number of females) is:

Children = Total population - Males + Females = 23786 - 8417 + 9092 = 15377

So, there are 15377 children in Soddo."
"Response: 
In the first month, Eleyn had 20 Pokémon cards and collected three times more in the second month, so she had 60 Pokémon cards in total (20 x 3 = 60).
In the third month, she collected twice as many Pokémon cards as in the previous two months combined, so she had 40 Pokémon cards in the third month (60 - 20 = 40).
Therefore, the total number of Pokémon cards that Eleyn has is 100 (60 + 40 = 100)."
"Response: 
Marc is an editor and edits equal number of sentences for two different publishers each week. Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A. Marc edits a total of 1000 sentences per week, and Publisher A pays him $0.05 per sentence. So, Marc earns:

Marc's weekly income = Number of sentences edited x Price per sentence
= 1000 x $0.05
= $50
Therefore, Mark makes $50 per week."
"Response:  Balder gets 5 coffs of water in the morning and 6 coffs of water in the afternoon. So he gets a total of:

Morning: 5 x 5 = 25 liters (per day)
Afternoon: 6 x 5 = 30 liters (per day)
Total daily amount of water received by Balder is: 25 + 30 = 55 liters per day."
"Response:  John earns $2000 per week and receives a one-time cash prize of $5000 and a 5% raise in pay. If he gets the award at the beginning of the year, his annual income will be:
$2000 x 52 = $104,000 (weekly income) + $5000 = $109,000 (annual income)
So, if he gets the award on the first day of the year, his monthly income for that year would be:
$109,000 / 12 = $9,083 (monthly income)"
Response:  If Joe has 10 hectares of land and each hectare produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then he will have 50 tons (10 x 5) of grapes per year. Since each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine, Joe will produce 100 barrels of wine per year (50 tons x 2 barrels/ton). Therefore, his farm will produce 100 barrels of wine per year.
"Response: 
Carl loves cheese and eats it every day for lunch and dinner. For lunch, he has an omelette with cheese and eggs, using one more slice of cheese than bread. For dinner, he has a sandwich with two slices of cheese. Therefore, Carl uses 3 slices of cheese per day (2 for the sandwich + 1 for the omelette).
For the week, Carl needs 7 sandwiches (3 days x 2 slices/day), so he will use 14 slices of cheese in total (3 slices/day x 7 sandwiches).
Now, let's calculate how much cheese Carl used during the week:
3 slices/day x 7 sandwiches = 21 slices of cheese
Therefore, Carl used 21 slices of cheese during the week."
"Response:  We know that Janet had initially 22 green and 10 yellow pencils. Then she bought 6 blue pencil boxes containing 9 pencils each, and 2 red pencil boxes containing 6 pencils each. So, in total, Janet has:

Green pencils = 22 + (6 x 9) = 43
Yellow pencils = 10
Blue pencils = (6 x 9) = 54
Red pencils = 2
So, Janet has a total of 43 + 10 + 54 + 2 = 119 pencils."
"Response:  If Brenly got an average score of 93 after removing her lowest result from each semester, then we can calculate it as follows:

Year 1: Brenly scored 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458 / 5 = 89.6 (rounded to two decimal places)
Year 2: Brenly scored 89.6 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458 / 5 = 89.6 (unchanged)
Year 3: Brenly scored 89.6 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458 / 5 = 89.6 (unchanged)
Year 4: Brenly scored 89.6 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458 / 5 = 89.6 (unchanged)
Year 5: Brenly scored 89.6 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 458 / 5 = 89.6 (unchanged)
Therefore, if Brenly removed her lowest result from each year, she would have an average score of 89.6. To find out what her sixth test score needs to be for an overall average of 93, we can subtract her current average from 93 and divide by 5:
(93 - 89.6) / 5 = 3.4
So, Brenly needs to get at least a 3.4 on her sixth test to achieve an overall average of 93."
"Response: 
Michael has been riding his bike for at least 5 times per week and each time he rode 25 kilometers. So, in one week, he rode a total of 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers.
Then, he decided to ride only twice a week instead of five times a week, but each time he rode 60 kilometers. In three weeks, he rode a total of 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers.
So, in total, Michael rode 125 + 120 = 245 kilometers."
Response:  We know that there are 25 chocolate pieces and 80 jam pieces in Joov's bag. Each chocolate piece weighs twice as much as each jam piece, so...
Response:  Rose went to the store on Monday and bought 4 cookies. Then she went to another store on Tuesday and bought 3 times more cookies than she bought on Monday, which means she bought 12 cookies (since 3 x 4 = 12). On Wednesday, she went to yet another store and bought 5 times as many cookies as she bought on Tuesday, which means she bought 60 cookies (since 5 x 12 = 60). Therefore, in total, Rose bought 72 cookies after all three days (4 + 12 + 60 = 72).
"Response:  We have:

* 20 decans of water cost $ 1200 less than the total price of half a jar that costs $ 6000 each.
* The total price of half a jar is $ 6000 x 2 = $ 12000.
* So, the price of 20 decans of water is $ 1200 - $ 12000 = $ 9800."
"Response: 
Sara has $10 in savings before she starts babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits and her parents pay her $4 each time she cuts grass. So far, Sara has earned $5 + $5 = $10 from babysitting and cutting grass. To buy the new jacket and shoes, Sara needs to have at least $30 (cost of the jacket) + $60 (cost of two pairs of shoes). Since she already has $10 in savings, she still needs to save an additional $20 ($30 - $10) to be able to afford the new clothes. Therefore, Sara must cut the grass four times before she can afford the new jacket and shoes."
"Response:  Jerry collects 42 eggs per day. If there are more white butterflies than red ones, then the number of red butterflies is equal to half the total number of butterflies that produce eggs. So if W = number of white butterflies and R = number of red butterflies, we can write:
W + R = 42 (total eggs collected)
R = W x 2/3 (since white butterflies produce twice as many eggs as red ones)
Substituting this expression for R into the first equation gives:
W + W x 2/3 = 42
Simplifying and solving for W, we get:
W = 16
So there are 16 white butterflies and 16/2 = 8 red butterflies."
"Response:  The length of the local park is 1.5 miles wide and 6 miles long. If Gary walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour, it will take him how many hours to walk around the entire park?

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Convert the distance of the park from miles to hours: 1.5 miles x 3 miles/hour = 4.5 hours
2. Since the park is rectangular in shape, we can calculate the time it takes to walk along one side as follows: Time = Distance / Speed (in miles)
Time = 6 miles / 3 miles/hour = 2 hours
3. Therefore, it will take Gary 4.5 hours to walk around the entire park if he walks at a rate of 3 miles per hour."
Response:  On day one, Slone counted 100 customers entering the store. If she counted 50 more customers on the second day, then there were 150 customers in total (100 + 50 = 150). On the third day, if the total number of customers was 500, then Slone counted 350 customers (500 - 150 = 350) that day. Therefore, Slone counted 350 customers on the third day.
Response:  We know that initially there were twice as many gallons of water in the large pool than in the small one (i.e., 8 gal vs 4 gal). Then, after 4 minutes, the amount of water in both pools decreases at the same rate due to evaporation (since they are exposed to the same environment). Therefore, if the amount of water in the large pool was x gal before, it will be 4x gal now (since it has been 4 minutes since the initial state). Similarly, the amount of water in the small pool was y gal before, and now it is 2y gal. So, we can set up the following equation based on the given information: x + y = 8... (1) Now, let's solve for y: y = 8 - x... (2) Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get: x + (8 - x) = 8... (3) Simplifying equation (3), we get: 2x = 8... (4) Dividing both sides of equation (4) by 2, we get: x = 4... (5) Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool is 4 gal.
Response:  Lorri needs to earn at least $320 for the shoes and $32 for the belt. If she works 4 hours per day, she will need to work for at least 8 days (or 56 hours) to save enough money. So, she will have to work for 56/8 = 7 hours per day.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money Jeneta borrowed from her friend. According to the problem statement, she borrowed $2000. Now, let's find out how much interest she will pay for that amount over 12 months at an annual rate of 10%. To do this, we can use the formula: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal is $2000, the rate is 10%, and the time is 1 year (or 12 months). So, the interest paid by Jeneta would be: Interest = $2000 x 0.10 x 1 = $200. Therefore, after 12 months, Jeneta will owe her friend $2000 + $200 = $2200.
Response:  We know that there are 4 roses in the vase and 7 more daisies than roses. So, if there are x daisies, then there are 4 + x flowers in total. Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 4 + x = 7. Now, we need to solve for x. To do this, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: x = 3. So, there are 3 daisies in addition to the 4 roses, making a total of 7 flowers in the vase.
"Response: 
Adrian is three times older than Harry, so Adrian is 3 x 21 = 63 years old.
Harry is half as old as Adrian, so Harry is 63 / 2 = 31 years old.
Therefore, the average age of the three for three years will be (31 + 31 + 63) / 3 = 55 years old."
Response:  We know that Yui has scored 49 points and Naomi has scored 68 points. So, Yui's score is 49 - 68 = -19 points less than Naomi's score. Therefore, Yui's score is 230 points (49 + 19).
"Response:  Carmen took 10 minutes to finish the crossword and 5 minutes to finish Sudoku. During the weekend, she solved three crosswords and eight Sudokus. Therefore, the total time spent playing these games is:

Time = (3 x 10 min) + (8 x 5 min) = 45 min + 40 min = 85 min
So, Carmen spent 85 minutes playing these games."
Response:  We know that Selin used 90 liters of water from the reservoir to water her small garden. This means that there are now 30 liters less water in the reservoir than before (120 - 90 = 30). So, there are currently 90 liters of water left in the reservoir.
Response:  Andy planted 90 geraniums and 40 petunias less than them. So, if we subtract 40 from 90, we get 50. Therefore, there are 50 flowers in total that Andy planted.
Response:  The company spends $15,000 on advertising for one year and then spends a third of that amount ($5,000) on advertising for the second year. So, in total, the company has spent $20,000 on advertising over two years.
"Response:  If Carlos pays $30 per hour for using the canoe and Benji pays $18 per hour for using the paddleboard, then they will pay:
Carlos: $30 x 3 = $90
Benji: $18 x 5 = $90
So, in total, they will pay $180."
"Response: 
Andrew plans to travel from New Jersey to Rochester in 6 days by bus and half a day by car. So he will spend a total of 6 + (1/2) = 7 days on his trip. Therefore, Andrew will be traveling for 7 days."
"Response:  James has 30 fire-type cards, 20 grass-type cards, and 40 water-type cards in total. If he loses 8 water-type cards, he will have 32 water-type cards left (since 8/40 = 0.2). Now, if he buys 14 more grass-type cards, his new total number of each type will be:

Fire-types: 30 - 8 = 22
Grass-types: 20 + 14 = 34
Water-types: 32 - 8 = 24
So, the probability that a randomly chosen card will be a water-type is:
Probability = Number of water-type cards / Total number of cards = 24 / 74 = 0.33 (or 33%)"
"Response: 
Chad ordered a basic burrito for $6.50, then added meat ($2.00), cheese ($1.00), avocado ($1.00), and salsa ($0.25) for a total of $9.75. To upgrade to a higher level, he paid an additional $3.00, bringing the new total to $12.75. Since Chad used his gift card worth $5.00, he still owes $7.75. Therefore, the final amount Chad ducks is $7.75."
"Response: 
Kalinda can add 4 pieces in one minute, and her mother can add half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute.
To find out how many minutes it will take them to solve the puzzle, we need to divide the number of pieces in the puzzle (360) by their combined rate of adding pieces. So, we have:
Minutes = Number of pieces / Rate of adding pieces
= 360 / (4 + 2)
= 360 / 6
= 60 minutes
Therefore, Kalinda and her mother will need 60 minutes to solve the puzzle."
"Response: 
We know that one farmland produced 120 younger wheat stalks and Ashlin visited the farm after two months to find out that 30% of them were ready for harvesting. So, she took 30% of 120 = 36 stalks home.
Now, when Ashlin returned two weeks later, three-quarters (75%) of the remaining stalks were ready for harvesting, which is equal to 75% of 36 = 27 stalks.
Therefore, there were 27 + 36 = 63 stalks of wheat ready for harvesting after two weeks."
Response:  Mark buys 12 cars for his company and pays $20,000 each. Therefore, he spends a total of $240,000 ($20,000 x 12). Then, he pays 10% tax on that amount, which is $24,000 (($240,000 x 10%). Finally, he also pays $1,000 registration fee for each car, which comes to $12,000 in total ($1,000 x 12). So, Mark pays a total of $386,000 ($240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000) for all 12 cars.
Response:  On Monday (понедељак), Kaili collected 5 more shells than Robert, who collected 20. So, Kaili collected 25 shells (5 + 20 = 25). In Tuesday (уторак), Kaili collected twice as many shells as she collected on Monday. If she collected 25 shells on Monday, then she collected 50 shells on Tuesday (2 x 25 = 50). Therefore, Kaili collected a total of 75 shells (25 + 50 = 75) in two days.
"Response: 
Dax went to their farm to pick apples and found that there were twice as many bees as flies in the courtyard. If there were 50 flies, how many insects are there in total in the garden?
Step-by-step calculation:
1. Number of flies = 50
2. Number of bees = 2 × 50 = 100
3. Total number of insects = Number of flies + Number of bees = 50 + 100 = 150
Therefore, there are 150 insects in total in the garden."
Response:  If 36 penguins are sunbathing and 12 of them jump into the water to swim in the ocean, then there will be 36 - 12 = 24 penguins left to sunbathe.
Response:  Steve eats 6 days a week, which means he consumes 6 x 7 = 42 parades in one week. Since he has twice as much cherry parades as his girlfriend, he needs 2 x 42 = 84 lozes to produce all the parades he wants. So, 84 lozes are needed.
Response:  John wants to make sure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices of pizza, so he needs to buy enough pizzas for 20 x 4 = 80 slices in total. However, since each pizza is sold in 8 equal parts, John needs to buy 80 / 8 = 10 pizzas. Therefore, John should order 10 pizzas.
Response:  If Ram uses one full lead for each of five empty leads he has, then he will have used 5 full leads in total. Since he can make new leads by mixing the melted lead from 25 empty leads, and since he already has 5 full leads, that means he now has a total of 30 leads (5 + 25). Therefore, Ram will have 30 leads in the end.
Response:  Johnny initially had $20 and then added another $10, so he had a total of $30 to invest. After one year, if the amount tripled, then Johnny would have $90 ($30 x 3). Therefore, after one year, Johnny has $90.
"Response:  According to the problem, Meri is two years younger than Joann, who is five years older than Jessie. So, we can write an equation as follows:
Meri = Joann - 5 + 2
Jessie = Joann + 5
Now, let's substitute the values given in the problem:
Meri = 18 (Joann) - 5 + 2 = 20
Jessie = 23 (Joann) + 5 = 28
So, the sum of their ages is 20 + 28 = 48 years old."
Response:  We know that there were 1000 students in the school gym and that they left through one of three exits A, B, or C. After the meeting, 30% of the students left through exit A, which means that 300 students left through this exit. Since 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, we can calculate their number as follows: (4/5) \* 700 = 560 students. Therefore, 560 students left through exit B. Finally, the remaining 240 students left through exit C. So, the total number of students who left through exit C is 240.
Response:  We know that James has more bonbons than Robert and John has twice as many sweets as Robert. So, if John had 54 sweets, he must have had at least 108 sweets (twice 54). Therefore, Jovan has more than James. The correct answer is 108.
Response:  If DoLi and PandoRa have two books each, then together they will have 4 books to read (2 x 2 = 4). Since they are reading their own books as well as each other's, the total number of books they will read is equal to the sum of the number of books they initially had plus the number of times they exchange books. Therefore, the final number of books they will read is: 4 + (2 x 2) = 8 books.
Response:  Mike sends one letter per week to five people, and each person sends two letters of five pages each in response. Therefore, there are 10 letters (5 x 2) that need to be written every week. Since Mike can write one page in 6 minutes, he needs to spend 10/6 = 1.67 hours writing letters every week. So, Mike spends approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes (1.67 hours) writing letters every week.
Response:  Jason has 1000 minutes per month for calls. He spends 15 minutes talking to his boss each day, so he talks to him for a total of 45 minutes in a month (since there are 30 days in the month). Now, he spent an additional 300 minutes talking to other people this month, which means he has used up all of his remaining minutes (1000 - 45 = 955) plus the extra time he spent with other people (300), for a total of 1255 minutes used this month. Since there are 30 days in the month, that works out to an average of 41.875 minutes per day.
"Response: 
Griffin had 24 fries initially.
Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin, leaving Griffin with 19 fries (24 - 5 = 19).
Jinger gave Griffin two shakes of her cooked fries, adding 4 more fries to his total (2 x 4 = 8).
Colby took three fewer fries than Kyle took, so Colby took 3 - 5 = -2 fries from Griffin.
Therefore, at the end, Griffin had 27 fries (19 + 8 - 2 = 27).
So, Jinger gave Griffin 8 prank fries."
Response:  In one aquarium there are 4 snails and in another aquarium there are 32 snails. If we assume that both aquariums have the same number of fish, then the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. Therefore, if an aquarium has x fish, then the number of snails in it is 2x. So, the answer is 2x.
"Response: 
Maika is paid $250 per hour for her work in Jin's film. Since she works for 6 hours every day (which is 36 hours per week), and the film lasts for 5 weeks, Maika earns a total of:
$$\text{Total hours worked} = \text{Weekly hours} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 36 \times 5 = 180 \text{ hours}$$
Now, let's calculate how much Jin pays Maika for her work:
$$\text{Jin's payment to Maika} = \text{Total hours worked} \times \text{Pay rate per hour} = 180 \times $250 = $45,000$$
Next, we need to subtract the amount that Maika gives as a discount to Jin after the film is finished:
$$\text{Final payment to Jin} = \text{Jin's payment to Maika} - (\text{Discount percentage} \times \text{Total hours worked}) = $45,000 - ($10\% \times $180) = $45,000 - $18,000 = $27,000$$
Therefore, Jin pays Maika $27,000 for her work in the film."
Response:  Isabel spent $12 on ingredients for the cake, $43 on gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on phone calls, and $22 on party supplies. To divide these costs among three people, we can use the following formula: Total cost / Number of people = Cost per person. Plugging in the numbers, we get: Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $86. So each person paid $28.67 ($86 / 3).
Response:  The number of packages of salmon is given as 4, and each package weighs 50 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all packages is 4 x 50 = 200 kg. Since each kilogram of salmon costs $1.5, the total cost of all packages would be 200 kg x $1.5 per kg = $300. So, the buyer has spent $300 for the salmon.
Response:  On Monday, Suzy ate 4 times more cookies than her sister, so she ate 4 x 9 = 36 cookies. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate 2 x 9 = 18 cookies. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Therefore, Suzy consumed 36 + 18 = 54 cookies in total. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Suzy consumed 54 x 200 = 10,800 calories in total.
