Response: 360 dollars. Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Eliza's hourly rate is $10 and she works up to 40 hours per week. If she worked 45 hours this week, her total earnings would be: Total earnings = Number of hours worked x Hourly rate $Total earnings = 45 hours x $10/hour $Total earnings = $450  Since Eliza also receives an extra payment of $1.2 times her regular hourly rate for any hours worked over 40, her total earnings would be increased by that amount: Total earnings + Extra payment = $Total earnings + ($1.2 \times $10/hour) $Total earnings + Extra payment = $Total earnings + ($12/hour) $Total earnings + Extra payment = $462  Therefore, if Eliza worked 45 hours this week, she would have earned $462.

Explanation: To calculate the benefit of each option, we need to estimate their future prices using the expected growth rates provided in the question. For jewelry, the estimated price after one month is: $5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,125. For electronics, the estimated price after one month is: $8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,160. Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, they should choose the option with the higher estimated price. Therefore, the best choice is electronics, which has an estimated price of $8,160 after one month, resulting in a benefit of $4376.92."

"Response: 48,672$
Explanation: To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours she works in a year. As a professor, Jill works 35 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 1,750 hours/year. As an athletic director, Jill works 15 hours/week x 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year. Therefore, Jill's total annual work hours are 1,750 + 750 = 2,500 hours/year. Now, let's multiply her hourly rate by her total annual work hours: $20/hour x 2,500 hours/year = $48,672/year."

"Response: 3 miles/hour. Explanation: If it took Marissa one hour to cover the first four miles of her walk and then another hour to cover the remaining two miles, that means she walked at a rate of 4 miles per hour for the first four miles and then at a rate of 2 miles per hour for the remaining two miles. To find out what velocity she needs to maintain in order to have an average velocity of 4 miles per hour, we can set up the following equation:

Velocity = Distance / Time

In this case, the distance is 12 miles and the time is 2 hours, so we can plug these values into the equation to get:

Velocity = 12 miles / 2 hours = 6 miles per hour
Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a velocity of 6 miles per hour to maintain an average velocity of 4 miles per hour over the entire distance of her walk."
"Response: 9 liters
Explanation:
Let X be the amount of water in the orange juice before adding it to the pineapple juice. Since two-thirds of the orange juice is water, we can write:
X = 2/3 \* 10 L = 6.67 L
Now, let Y be the amount of water in the pineapple juice initially. Since three-quarters of the pineapple juice is water, we can write:
Y = 3/4 \* 15 L = 11.25 L
After adding the orange juice to the pineapple juice, there are 24 liters of mixture. Let Z be the amount of water in this mixture after vertically pouring one liter from the top. We know that the volume of the mixture did not change, so the amount of water in the mixture remains constant:
Z = Y + (X - Y) = 11.25 L + (6.67 L - 11.25 L) = 5.58 L
Therefore, there are 9 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture."

"Response: 74.83 dollars
Explanation: To find the original price of the book, we need to calculate 25% of the discount amount and subtract it from the purchase price. The formula for this is:
Discount = (Original Price x Discount Percentage) / 100
In this case, the discount percentage is 25%, so:
Discount = (Original Price x 25%) / 100
= ($19.50 x 25%) / 100
= $4.875
Now, we subtract the discount amount from the purchase price:
Original Price = Purchase Price - Discount
= $19.50 - $4.875
= $14.625
So, the original price of the book was $14.625."

Polly can throw the lances three times farther with the precious stone than without it. Therefore, when she has the precious stone, she can throw the lance at an distance of $4 \times 3 = 1200$ feet from the dragon's reach. Since the dragon's flame reaches up to $300$ meters, or $984$ feet, Polly will be able to hit the dragon with the lance if she is $520$ feet away from it ($1200 - 984 = 520$)."

"Response: 16 hours
Explanation: To calculate the number of hours spent writing articles in the three days, we need to multiply the number of articles written each day by the time it took to write each article.
For Monday, the number of articles written was 5 and the time it took to write each article was 4 hours, so the total time spent writing for Monday is 5 x 4 = 20 hours.
For Tuesday, the number of articles written was 3 (since 2/5 times 5 = 3) and the time it took to write each article was also 4 hours, so the total time spent writing for Tuesday is 3 x 4 = 12 hours.
For Wednesday, the number of articles written was 8 (since double the number of articles written on Tuesday is 16), and the time it took to write each article was again 4 hours, so the total time spent writing for Wednesday is 8 x 4 = 32 hours.
Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days is 20 + 12 + 32 = 64 hours."

Since each row represents one year of vacation and there are four rows, the total number of blocks of collareta is 4 x 11 = 44 blocks. However, we also know that each block represents a different vacation, so the total number of blocks of collareta is actually 44 x 5 = 220 blocks.

2. When the alarm sounds for the first time today, it sonars four times.
3. When the alarm sounds for the second time today, it sonars three times more than the first time.
4. When the alarm sounds for the third time today, it sonars half the time it took to sound the second time.
From these clues, we can deduce that the alarm has sounded a total of 5 times today:
* First time: 4 x = 4
* Second time: 3 x + 3 = 7
* Third time: x/2 = 3
So, the alarm has sounded a total of 5 times today: 4 + 7 + 3 = 14."

"Response: 48
Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:
The number of conill is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, if there are x dogs and y cats, we can write an equation:
x + y = 12 (less than the combined number of dogs and cats)
Now, we know that there are 60 dogs, so y = 60 - x
Substituting this value for y in the first equation, we get:
x + (60 - x) = 12
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 12
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 6
So, there are 60 dogs and 6 cats, which means there are 48 mascots (dogs + cats) in total in the barrio."

Explanation: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The first friend pressed the button 20 times before Jerome opened the door. So, the first friend pressed the button 20 x 5 = 100 times.
* The second friend pressed the button 1/4 more than the first friend, so he pressed it 100 x 1.25 = 125 times.
* The third friend pressed the button 10 times more than the second friend, so he pressed it 125 x 1.1 = 137.5 times.
* The fourth friend pressed the button 60 times. Since he pressed it fewer times than the third friend, the fourth friend pressed it (137.5 - 60) = 77.5 times.

Therefore, the total number of times the friends pressed the button is 100 + 125 + 137.5 + 77.5 = 380."

Therefore, if Jamal's phone can store 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can store 1800 x 6 = 10,800 photographs. Since the maximum number of birds that can be seen in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo is 50 times more than the number of photographs that can be stored on Brittany's phone, we can conclude that there are 10,800 x 50 = 540,000 birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo."

Explanation: To calculate how much money Sasha will make by selling all of her remaining wood pieces, we need to add up the value of each piece she has left and multiply it by the number of pieces she has. For the ten 2x4x10 tables, the calculation is:

Value = 10 x Price per table = 10 x 10 = 100
For the five 4x4x10 tables, the calculation is:

Value = 16 x Price per table = 16 x 5 = 80
Total Value = 100 + 80 = 180
Therefore, Sasha will make a total of 180 dollars by selling all of her remaining wood pieces."

On the second day, more containers arrived, but we are not told how many containers there were or what their capacity was. However, since all containers contain 5 vehicles each, and the total number of vehicles at the port is 30, we can deduce that 4 containers must have arrived on the second day (30 / 5 = 6 containers, which is less than the actual number of containers that arrived).

"Response: 36000 (dollars)
Explanation:
The number of patients seen in a day is given as 500. Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, so the total time spent by doctors with patients is 500 x 24 = 12,000 minutes. Since each doctor works for 8 hours, the total time worked by all doctors is 8 hours x 12,000 minutes = 96,000 minutes. The hourly earning of doctors is given as $150, so their daily earnings are $150 x 8 hours = $1200. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the hospital from these visits is $200 x 500 patients = $100,000. Subtracting the daily earnings of doctors ($1200), we get the profit made by the hospital, which is $100,000 - $1200 = $98,800."

Explanation: Let B be the number of video games that Bobby has and let B = 5B - 3. Since Brian has 20 video games initially, he loses 5 before making the comparison, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games left. Now, according to the question, Bobby has 5 times as many video games as Brian, which means Bobby has 15 x 5 = 75 video games. However, since Bobby has 3 more than Brian, Bobby has 75 + 3 = 78 video games in total. Therefore, Bobby has 78 video games."

Explanation: Let's assume that there are x boles of gum blue. Since there are 22 times more four-times as many balls of gum red than of gum blue, we can write:
x = 22 \* 4x
Now, we know that there are 12 balls of gum blue, so we can substitute this value in the equation above:
12 = 22 \* 4x
Dividing both sides by 22 gives us:
x = 48
Therefore, there are 48 balls of gum red."

In the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leave the bush and only half of them returned in the next 6 hours. This means that 15 bees did not return (30 - 15 = 15). Then, she saw twice as many bees leaving the bush than she initially saw, which is 2 x 15 = 30 bees. Since all the bees that left before had already returned by the end of the day, there are now 30 + 15 = 45 bees back at the nest in the last 6 hours."

Explanation: According to the information provided in the question, Steve can ride his bike at 440 feet per minute, and he lives 3 miles away from the school. Therefore, it will take him 3/4 \* 60 = 45 minutes to reach the school. Since Tim lives farther away than Steve, it will take him longer to reach the school. If Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, it will take him (3 km / 264 ft/min) = 11.7 minutes to reach the school. However, since we are looking for the time that the winner will wait at home before the loser finishes the race, we need to subtract the time it takes the loser to reach the school from the total time taken by both of them to reach the school. Therefore, the answer is 45 - 11.7 = 33.3 minutes or 15 minutes."

"Response: 800 plátanos.
Explanation: To determine how many plátanos are needed for two months, we need to calculate the total number of plátanos required by all the monkeys in the zoo. The micos require 200 plátanos each month, so their total requirement is 200 x 2 = 400 plátanos. Similarly, the gorillas require 400 plátanos each month, and the baboons require 100 plátanos each month. Therefore, the total number of plátanos required by all the monkeys in the zoo is 400 + 400 + 100 = 900 plátanos. Since the caretaker buys all the plátanos from the local farm every two months, he needs 900 / 2 = 450 plátanos each time he goes to buy them. So, the caretaker needs 450 plátanos to last him two months."

"Response: 1875
Explanation: To calculate how much Jessica will pay each month, we need to find the total amount of her debt and then divide it by the number of months in a year (12). Since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, we can multiply the total debt by 1.5 to get the total monthly payment. Finally, we subtract the minimum payment for each loan from the total monthly payment to get the excess payment.
Total debt = Student loans + Credit card debt + Mortgage debt
= 300 x 12 + 200 x 12 + 500 x 12
= 36000 + 2400 + 60000
= 96000
Monthly payment = Total debt / Number of months in a year
= 96000 / 12
= 8000
Excess payment = Monthly payment - Minimum payment
= 8000 - (300 x 12 + 200 x 12 + 500 x 12)
= 8000 - 36000
= 4400
Therefore, Jessica will pay $4400 more than the minimum payment each month for her debts over the course of a year."

Explanation:
Lloyd has worked for 10 hours in total during the first two weeks of tutoring math. He worked for 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week. To find out how much he earned in these two weeks, we can multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly rate of $10 per hour:

5 hours x $10/hour = $50 (first week)
8 hours x $10/hour = $80 (second week)
Total earnings = $50 + $80 = $130
Therefore, Lloyd has earned $130 in the first two weeks of tutoring math."

Explanation: From the given information, we know that there are six faces on the die and each face has one of the following numbers printed on it: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since two pairs of consecutive numbers are not considered as different numbers, we need to count the number of times a number greater than 3 is rolled minus the number of times two pairs of consecutive numbers are rolled.
Let's count the number of ways in which a number greater than 3 can be rolled:
There are 5 numbers greater than 3 on the die (4, 5, 6), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 5/6 = 83.33%.
Now, let's count the number of times two pairs of consecutive numbers are rolled:
Since there are only six faces on the die, the probability of rolling any pair of consecutive numbers is 1/6 = 16.67%.
So, the desired probability = 83.33% - 16.67% = 60%."

Since each hamster has 5 pieces of food, there are 5 x 10 = 50 pieces of food distributed to the hamsters. Finally, since there are 20 pieces of food distributed to the conchs, there are 20 - (50 + 54) = -34 pieces of food left over."

Now, let's solve for y:
y = (42 - (x\*3)) / (x+y)
Substituting the value of x from the problem statement:
y = (42 - (2\*3)) / (2 + y)
Simplifying:
y = 16
Therefore, Jerry has 16 red polls."

Explanation: To find the probability that a randomly drawn card is an Water type, we need to calculate the proportion of Water types among the remaining cards after James has lost 8 Aqueous-type cards and bought 14 Herb-type cards.
After losing 8 Aqueous-type cards, James has 30 - 8 = 22 Focus-type cards left.
After buying 14 Herb-type cards, James has 20 + 14 = 34 Herb-type cards.
So, the total number of cards left in his deck is 22 + 34 = 56 cards.
The percentage of Water types among these cards is:

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the question, we know that Kalinda can add 4 pieces to the puzzle per minute and her mother can place half of the total number of pieces per minute as well. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces that Kalinda can add per minute. In this case, there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, so if Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, it will take her 90 minutes (360 / 4 = 90) to complete her part of the puzzle. Since her mother can place half of the remaining pieces per minute, it will also take her 90 minutes to complete her part of the puzzle (360 / 2 = 90). Therefore, it will take a total of 180 minutes (90 + 90) for both Kalinda and her mother to complete the entire puzzle."

When Ashlyn returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, which is 37.5 melons (since there are still 84 unharvested melons). Therefore, there were 50 melons that were not yet prepared for harvest after the two weeks (i.e., the difference between the number of melons left and the number of melons already harvested)."
Response: 196,800 dollars. Explanation: To calculate how much Mark pays for all the cars, we need to multiply the number of cars by their price and then subtract the taxes and registration fees. The total cost of each car is 20,000 dollars, so the total cost of 12 cars is 240,000 dollars (12 x 20,000 = 240,000). Then, the taxes are 10% of 240,000 dollars, which is 24,000 dollars (240,000 x 0.10 = 24,000). Finally, the registration fee is 1,000 dollars per car, so the total amount paid for all the cars is 264,000 dollars (240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 264,000).

* ""a la Neu"" means that some of them (not all) go to the beach.
* ""Un terç d'ells salten i naden a l'oceà"" means that one-third of them jump into the ocean.
* ""Un altre terç va a la cova per sopar"" means that another third goes to the cave for dinner.
Now, let's calculate how many pingüins are left to take sunbaths:
Total number of pingüins = 36
Number of pingüins that went to the beach = 1/3 x 36 = 12
So, the number of pingüins left to take sunbaths is 36 - 12 = 24."

"Response: 267
Explanation: Let X be the total number of students who left the building through exit C. Since 30% of the students left through exit A, the number of students who left through exit A is 300 (1000 x 0.3). Also, since 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, the number of students who left through exit B is 600 (1000 x 3/5). Therefore, the number of students who left through exit C is:
X = 1000 - 300 - 600 = 267
Note: The calculation assumes that all students who left through one exit also left through the other exits. If this assumption does not hold true, then the actual number may differ from 267."
"Response: 12
Explanation: According to the question, James has 6 caramels more than Robert. So, if James has x caramels, then Robert has x - 6 caramels. Since John has twice as many caramels as Robert, John has 2(x-6) = 2x - 12 caramels. Therefore, John has 12 more caramels than James."
"Response: 3

"Response: 10 hours
Explanation:
Mike can write one page in 6 minutes, so he can write 5 pages (the number of letters he receives) in 30 minutes (since there are 5 letters and each letter has 5 pages). Therefore, he can write 10 pages per hour ( since there are 10 letters and each letter has 10 pages). So, Mike spends 10 hours writing responses to the letters he received from the 5 people with whom he was no longer corresponding."
"Response: 700 minutes (or 11.67 hours)

"Response: 8
Explanation: Let's break down the information given in the question:
Griffin had 24 French fries initially.
Kyle took 5 French fries.
Billy took twice as many French fries as Kyle (i.e., 2 x 5 = 10).
Ginger gave some of her French fries to Griffin.
Colby took 3 fewer French fries than Kyle (i.e., 3 - 5 = -2).
At the end, Griffin had 27 French fries.
Now, let's calculate how many French fries Ginger gave to Griffin:
If Griffin had 24 French fries initially and ended with 27, then Ginger gave him 3 more French fries (i.e., 27 - 24 = 3)."
"Response: 16
Explanation: Let's assume that the number of fish in each aquarium is x. Since there are twice as many crabs in one aquarium as in the other, the number of crabs in the first aquarium is 4x and the number of crabs in the second aquarium is 2x. Therefore, the total number of living organisms (fish + crabs) in the first aquarium is 4x + 32 = 50, and the total number of living organisms in the second aquarium is 2x + 32 = 48. So, there are 16 fish in each aquarium."
