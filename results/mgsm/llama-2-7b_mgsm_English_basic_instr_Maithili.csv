"Response:  To find out how much money Janet makes from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market each day, we need to subtract the number of eggs she eats or uses (3) from the total number of eggs she lays per day (16). So, the number of eggs available for sale is:

16 - 3 = 13

Now, let's assume that she sells all 13 eggs at $2 per egg. Therefore, her daily income from selling duck eggs at the farmers' market would be:

13 x $2 = $26

So, Janet makes $26 per day at the farmers' market by selling duck eggs.";

Response:  To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to subtract the cost of repairs from the original price of the house. So, if the value of the house after repairs is $240,000 (150% increase), and Josh paid $80,000 for the house, his profit would be: Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price = $240,000 - $80,000 = $160,000.;
Response:  To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint. So, if James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week and each sprint is 60 meters long, then he runs a total of 3 x 60 = 180 meters per week.;
Response:  To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Wendi feeds her chickens 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per bird every day, so for a flock of 20 chickens, she will need to give them 60 cups of feed (3 x 20 = 60). Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 60 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.;
"Response:  The cost of 16 glasses can be calculated as follows:

Cost of first glass = $5
Cost of each additional glass = (60% of $5) / 2 = $3

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $84 for 16 glasses.";
Response:  Let's first find out how many sheep Charleston has. According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep. Now, we know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 80 = 160 sheep. Finally, we can add the number of sheep in Seattle (20) to get the total number of sheep in all three cities: 160 + 80 + 20 = 360 sheep.;
"Response:  To find out how long it will take for Carla to download the file after a restart, we need to calculate the time taken in each segment and add them up.

1. Before the restart: Carla can download 2 GB/minute, so it will take her 200 GB / 2 GB/min = 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) to download 200 GB before the restart.
2. After the restart: Carla needs to restart the download from the beginning, which means she will spend another 100 minutes (or 1 hour and 40 minutes) downloading the remaining 160 GB (since 40% of the file was already downloaded).

Therefore, the total time it will take Carla to download the file after a restart is 100 + 100 = 200 minutes or 3 hours and 20 minutes.";
"Response:  To find out how far John is from home after 4 hours, we need to use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, John's speed varies throughout the journey, so we will calculate his distance traveled at each speed separately and then add them up.

1. For the first 2 hours, John was stuck in standstill traffic, so he did not move at all. Therefore, his distance traveled during this period is zero.
2. From the point where he turned around until he reached his maximum speed of 80 mph, he traveled for 2 hours (since it took him 2 hours to reach his maximum speed). So, his distance traveled at this speed is: Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 2 hours = 160 miles.
3. During the last 2 hours of the journey, John drove at an average speed of 50 mph (since he spent the first hour at 30 mph and the second hour at 80 mph). So, his distance traveled during these two hours is: Distance = Speed x Time = 50 mph x 2 hours = 100 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances traveled at each speed to find out how far John is from home: Total distance = Distance at 80 mph + Distance at 50 mph = 160 miles + 100 miles = 260 miles.

Therefore, John is 260 miles away from home after 4 hours of driving.";
Response:  Let's break down Eliza's earnings into two parts: regular hours and overtime hours. For regular hours, Eliza earned $10/hour x 40 hours = $400. For overtime hours, Eliza received 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is $10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour. So, Eliza worked 5 hours (45 - 40) of overtime, and she earned $12/hour x 5 hours = $60 for those hours. Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $400 + $60 = $460.;
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the question:

* In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
* In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as in the first month, so the downloads were 3 x 60 = 180.
* In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were (180 - 30%) = 126.

Therefore, the total number of downloads for the three months is: 60 + 180 + 126 = 466.";
"Response:  The total cost of the pastries is:

Donuts: 3 x $68 = $204
Mini cupcakes: 2 x $80 = $160

"Response:  To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree over time. Let's break down the costs as follows:

* Initial cost of planting the tree = $90
* Annual cost of watering and feeding the tree = $3
* Total cost per year = $90 + $3 = $93

Now, let's calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to recoup his initial investment and start earning money from his lemon tree:

Yearly income from lemons = 7 lemons x $1.5 per lemon = $10.50 per year
Total amount earned in first year = $93 (initial cost) - $10.50 (yearly income) = $82.50

To find out how many years it will take to reach this amount, we can divide the total amount earned by the annual income:

Number of years to reach break-even point = $82.50 / $10.50 per year = 7.9 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos approximately 7.9 years to start earning money from his lemon tree after planting it.";
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

* Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she had (3/4) x 5 = 3.75 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.
* She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had (3.75 - 2) = 1.75 vacuum cleaners left after selling to the red house.
* She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she had (1.75 / 2) = 0.875 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.
* Finally, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: 0.875 + 3.75 + 2 = 5.
Solving for x, we get: x = 6.
Therefore, Melanie started with 6 vacuum cleaners.";
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Out of 20 students, 4 students (20%) enrolled in contemporary dance.
* Out of the remaining 16 students, 4 students (25%) enrolled in jazz dance.
* So, out of the total 36 students, 8 students (22%) enrolled in jazz dance.
* Now, we are asked what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find this percentage, we need to subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary or jazz dance from the total number of students.

Total number of students = 36
Number of students enrolled in contemporary or jazz dance = 8
Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = Total number of students - Number of students enrolled in contemporary or jazz dance
= 36 - 8
= 28%

Therefore, 28% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.";
"Response:  The profit from purchasing jewelry over electronics can be calculated as follows:

Profit = ($5,000 x 2.5%) - ($8,000 x 1.2%)

Response:  Let's assume that the speed of one train is x mph and the other train's speed is y mph. We know that the total distance traveled by both trains in the first day = 80 miles. So, we can write an equation based on this information: Distance = Speed x Time. In the first day, the time taken to cover 80 miles will be equal to the time taken to cover 150 miles in the second day. Therefore, we can write another equation: Time = Distance / Speed. Now, let's substitute the values given in the question: Distance = 80 miles, Speed = x mph (for Train A) and Distance = 150 miles, Speed = y mph (for Train B). Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: x = 2/3 and y = 1/3. Therefore, Train A covers a distance of 60 miles in the first day and 100 miles in the second day, while Train B covers a distance of 40 miles in the first day and 90 miles in the second day.;
Response:  To find Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply the number of hours she works each week by the rate she is paid for each activity. For teaching, she works 35 hours/week x $20/hour = $700/week. For coaching, she works 15 hours/week x $30/hour = $450/week. So, her total weekly income is $700 + $450 = $1,150/week. Since she works 50 weeks/year, her annual salary is $1,150/week x 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year.;
Response:  To find out how many dozen eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to multiply the number of eggs she eats per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. So, if Claire makes a 3 egg omelette every morning, she will eat 3 x 21 = 63 eggs in 4 weeks. Therefore, Claire will eat 63 / 12 = 5.25 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.;
"Response:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

Marissa walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, so her pace for that section was 4 miles/hour.
She then walked the next 2 miles in 1 hour, so her pace for that section was also 4 miles/hour.
To find her average speed for the entire hike, we can add up all of her distances and divide by the total time it took her to complete them:

Distance = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
Time = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours
Average speed = Distance / Time = 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles/hour

Therefore, if Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to walk the remaining distance at a rate of 4 miles per hour.";
"Response:  The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters can be calculated as follows:

Let's first calculate the total volume of both drinks before the spill:

Orange drink = 10 liters (two-thirds water) x 3/4 = 7.5 liters (three-fourths water)
Pineapple drink = 15 liters (three-fifths water) x 4/5 = 18 liters (five-sixths water)
Total volume before spill = 7.5 + 18 = 25.5 liters

Now, let's subtract the liter of orange drink that was spilled:

Remaining volume = 25.5 - 1 = 24.5 liters

Therefore, there are 24.5 liters of water in the remaining mixture.";

"Response:  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book after a 25% discount. So, we can set up an equation based on that information:

$19.50 = x - (x/4)

Where ""x"" is the original price of the book before the discount.

Now, we need to isolate the variable ""x"". To do this, we can subtract (x/4) from both sides of the equation:

$19.50 - (x/4) = x

This gives us:

$19.50 = 4x

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for ""x"":

x = $19.50 / 4

So, the original price of the book before the discount was $48.75 ($19.50 / 4).";
Response:  Let's first calculate the total amount Marie spent on food: Chicken meal = $12 x 1 = $12 Milk = $3 x 5 = $15 Apples = $1.50 x 4 = $6 Pizza = $8.50 x? = $?

Response:  To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to add up the cost of each item that she bought. The total cost of the shorts is 3 x $16.50 = $49.50. The total cost of the pants is 3 x $22.50 = $67.50. The total cost of the shoes is 3 x $42 = $126. So, Mishka spent a total of $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $242.00 on all the clothing items.;
"Response:  To find out how much Cynthia spends on ice cream after 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of servings she consumes during that period and then multiply it by the cost per serving.

Total number of servings = Number of days x Number of servings per day
= 60 x 1
= 60 servings

Cost per serving = Cost per carton / Number of servings per carton
= $4.00 / 15
= $0.27 per serving

"Response:  Let's analyze the situation:

Gloria wants to buy either the boots or the heels. The total cost of the heels is $33 + $66 = $99. So, if she chooses the heels instead of the boots, she will save $5 (the difference between the cost of the boots and the cost of the heels).

Now, let's assume that the boots cost $x dollars. We know that the total cost of the boots and the heels is $100 ($x + $99), so we can set up the equation:

$x + $99 = $100

Solving for x, we get:

x = $10

So, the boots cost $10. Therefore, the answer is B) $10.";
Response:  To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we need to use the given information that the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. So, if Darrell's age is D, then Allen's age is A = 11D / 7. Ten years from now, Allen's age will be A + 10 = (11D/7) + 10. Substituting D = 44 (since Darrell's age is 44), we get A = 55. Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 55.;

y = 24

So, Siobhan has 26 jewels.";
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. So, his rate of scoring points per minute is:

Points scored/Time taken = 4/20 = 0.2 points/minute
2. In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. So, his rate of scoring points per minute in the second half is:

Points scored/Time taken = (0.2 + 25%) \* 0.2 = 0.27 points/minute
3. Total time taken to play ping-pong = 40 minutes
Total points scored by Mike = Points scored in first 20 minutes + Points scored in second 20 minutes
= 0.2 points/minute × 20 minutes + 0.27 points/minute × 20 minutes
= 4 points + 5.4 points
= 9.4 points
Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9.4 points playing ping-pong for 40 minutes.";

Response:  John sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each, so he got $195 ($13 x $15). Then he spent $80 on video games (8 x $20), so he has $195 - $80 = $115 left. Therefore, John still has 13 Lego sets.;
Response:  John's average speed for his three-day running schedule is 20 miles per hour.;
"Response:  Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. This means that for every mile she walks, she can run 4 miles in the same amount of time. So, if she walks at a rate of x miles per hour, she can run at a rate of 4x miles per hour.
2. She can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. This means that if she runs at a rate of x miles per hour, she can skip at a rate of (x/2) miles per hour.
3. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at a rate of 4x miles per hour (since running is four times faster than skipping).
4. In six hours, she will have traveled a total distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 4x miles/hour x 6 hours
= 24x miles

Now, let's find out how much time she spends running vs. walking:

Time spent running = Total time / Running speed
= 6 hours / 4x miles/hour
= 1.5 hours

Time spent walking = Total time - Time spent running
= 6 hours - 1.5 hours
= 4.5 hours

So, Dana spends 1.5 hours running and 4.5 hours walking over the course of six hours.

Now, we need to find out how far she travels while running and walking separately:

Running distance = Distance / Running speed
= 24x miles / 4x miles/hour
= 6x miles

Walking distance = Distance / Walking speed
= 24x miles / 1x miles/hour
= 24x miles

Therefore, Dana travels a total distance of 6x miles while running and 24x miles while walking over the course of six hours.";

Response:  To calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount of calories in a single serving of chips, we need to use the following formula: Calories available for snack = Daily calorie target - Total calories consumed so far. In this case, the total calories consumed so far are 1800, and the daily calorie target is 2000. So, the number of grams of chips you can eat is: Number of grams of chips = Calories available for snack / Number of calories per gram of chips. Since there are approximately 500 calories per 100 grams of potato chips (based on the information provided), we can estimate that each gram of chips contains around 4 calories. Therefore, the number of grams of chips you can eat is: Number of grams of chips = 2000 - 1800 = 200 / 4 = 50 grams. So, you can eat up to 50 grams of chips based on your current calorie consumption.;
"Response:  To find out how many candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax, we need to divide the weight of the beeswax by the weight of a single candle. Since each candle weighs 1/4 pound (or 8 ounces), we can calculate the number of candles as follows:

Number of candles = Weight of beeswax / Weight of a single candle
= 1 lb / 8 oz
= 12.5 candles

Since Charlie can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax, he can make 12.5 x 10 = 125 candles with one pound of beeswax.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of supplies for making these candles:

Cost of supplies = Cost of beeswax + Cost of wicks
= $10.00 + ($2.00 x 10)
= $30.00

Finally, let's calculate the net profit if Charlie sells each candle for $2.00:

Net profit = Selling price - Cost of supplies
= $2.00 - $30.00
= -$28.00

So, unfortunately, Charlie will not have any net profit if he makes and sells all 20 candles using one pound of beeswax.";
"Response:  To find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to use the information given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

Day 1 (Monday):
Meredith wrote 5 articles, which means she spent 5 x 4 = 20 hours researching and writing articles on Monday.

Day 2 (Tuesday):
Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than she did on Monday, so she wrote 2/5 x 5 = 7 articles on Tuesday. Since each article took 4 hours to write, she spent 7 x 4 = 28 hours researching and writing articles on Tuesday.

Day 3 (Wednesday):
Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote 2 x 7 = 14 articles on Wednesday. Since each article took 4 hours to write, she spent 14 x 4 = 56 hours researching and writing articles on Wednesday.

Total time spent writing articles in the three days = Total time spent on Monday + Total time spent on Tuesday + Total time spent on Wednesday
= 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days.";
"Response:  The information given in the passage is:

* Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before heading to work.
* She stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes.
* At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
* She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall.

From these statements, we can deduce that the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is equal to the total number of Post-it notes she used minus the number she already had in her purse. Therefore, the answer is:

Number of Post-it notes in the package = 23 - 80 = -57

So, there were 57 Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.";
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

1. John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. This means that if he bought x blue ties, he also bought 2x red ties.
2. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, if a blue tie costs $40, a red tie costs $40 + (50% of $40) = $60.
3. John spent $200 on ties. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he spent half of his money on red ties ($200 / 2 = $100).

Now, let's find out how much John spent on each type of tie:

Red ties: $100 / 2 = $50 per red tie
Blue ties: $200 - $50 = $150 per blue tie

So, John spent $50 on each red tie and $150 on each blue tie.";
Response:  To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of wire by the length of each piece. In this case, the total length of wire is 4 feet = 48 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot). If each piece is 6 inches long, then Tracy obtained 48 / 6 = 8 pieces. So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.;

Response:  To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs he sells per week. We can do this by multiplying the number of eggs he produces per day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). Then, we can multiply the total number of eggs sold per week by the price he charges per dozen to find his total weekly earnings. Here's the calculation: Total number of eggs sold per week = Number of eggs produced per day x 7 Total number of eggs sold per week = 252 eggs/day x 7 = 1804 eggs/week Total number of dollars earned per week = Total number of eggs sold per week x Price per dozen Total number of dollars earned per week = 1804 eggs/week x $2/dozen = $3608 per week So, Lloyd makes $3608 per week on eggs.;
Response:  To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Rate. We know that Tom traveled for 5 hours (from 1 to 4 PM), so his distance traveled is 5 x 10 = 50 miles. Now, let's find out his rate during the return journey: Tom traveled back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. So, his time taken to cover the distance of 50 miles will be: Time = Distance / Rate = 50 / 6 = 8.33 hours. Therefore, it will take Tom 8.33 hours to get back.;
Response:  To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that the total weight of all the items in his backpack is 15 pounds, and that the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each. So, if he removes 30 comic books, the new weight of the comic books will be 30 x 1/4 = 7.5 pounds. This means that the remaining weight in his backpack is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds. Since the toys weigh 1/2 pound each, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 / 1/2 = 15 toys to bring the weight of his backpack down to 0 pounds.;
Response:  To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to subtract the total amount earned from repairing truck tires on Thursday ($60 x 6 = $360) from the total amount earned from repairing car tires on Friday ($40 x 12 = $480). Therefore, the difference in revenue between the two days is $480 - $360 = $120. So, the mechanic earned $120 more revenue on Friday than he did on Thursday.;
"Response:  Let's break this down step by step:

The Doubtfire sisters have 7 adopted kittens already.
Mother informs them that Patchy has had thrice as many kittens as they do (i.e., 3 x 7 = 21).
Trixie has had 12 kittens.
So, in total, the Doubtfire family now has 21 + 12 = 33 kittens!";
Response:  To find out how many bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops, we need to divide the number of lollipops left (30) by the number of lollipops that will be packaged in each bag (2). So, Jean can fill 15 bags with the remaining lollipops.;
Response:  To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one movie ticket and popcorn. So, if he has $42 for the week, he can go to the movies $\frac{42}{7} = 6$ times.;
Response:  Let x be the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. We know that the total weight of the truck and its contents is less than or equal to 5000 pounds. Therefore, the sum of the weights of all the boxes must be less than or equal to 5000 - (3755 + driver's weight). Now, the weight of a single box is 15 pounds, so the total weight of x boxes is x \* 15 = 15x pounds. Since this is less than or equal to 5000 - (3755 + driver's weight), we have 15x <= 4245. Solving for x, we get x <= 286. So, at most 286 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.;

"Response:  To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total amount of gas left in her tank by the number of miles she has driven since last filling it. We can use the information given in the problem to do this calculation:

Total amount of gas left in tank = 12 gallons - 4 gallons = 8 gallons
Distance driven since last filling = 100 miles
So, the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas is:
8 gallons / 100 miles = 0.08 or 8/100 = 0.08 miles per gallon
Therefore, Sophia can drive approximately 8 miles on a single tank of gas.";
Response:  To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to first find out how much time he spends on each activity per day. Let's assume that he watches TV for 2 hours every night (Monday to Thursday) and reads for half as long. So, he watches TV for 2 x 7 = 14 hours/week and reads for 14 / 2 = 7 hours/week. Now, let's find out how many hours he spends on these activities in 4 weeks: 4 weeks x 14 hours/week = 56 hours on TV and 4 weeks x 7 hours/week = 28 hours on reading. Therefore, Jim spends 56 + 28 = 84 hours on TV and 28 + 28 = 56 hours on reading in 4 weeks.;
"Response:  To find out how many people have all of the schools sent, we need to add up the number of players on each team from each school. Let's do that:

Girls' teams:
School A: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
School B: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players
School C: 5 players x 2 teams = 10 players

"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The treasure hunter found a buried treasure chest filled with gems.
* There were 175 diamonds in the chest.
* There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140.
* Twice the number of emeralds than the rubies means that the number of emeralds = 2 x 140 = 280.

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = 695 gems.";
Response:  Let the number of boys be x. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of girls is half of the number of boys, i.e., x/2 = 30 (since there are 60 girls). Now, we have a proportion between the number of boys and girls, which can be written as: x/x = 30/60 = 1/2. Therefore, there are equal numbers of boys and girls, so the number of teachers is also equal to both the numbers of boys and girls, i.e., x + x = 60 + 60 = 120. Hence, there are 120 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.;
Response:  Let's assume that Bailey started with x dollars. Since she received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, she received a total of $40 (x + 40). Now, we are given that at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey had a total of $100. So, we can set up the equation: x + 40 = 100. Solving for x, we get: x = 60. Therefore, Bailey started with $60.;
Response:  To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to multiply the number of classes she teaches by the number of students in each class and then multiply that result by the amount she charges per student. So, if she teaches 5 classes on weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday, she will have a total of 5 x 15 + 8 x 15 = 90 classes in one week.

For marigolds, it would be: Marigold sales = 12 x $2.74 = $32.88 For petunias, it would be: Petunia sales = 9 x $1.87 = $16.53 For begonias, it would be: Begonia sales = 17 x $2.12 = $35.04 Total sales = $32.88 + $16.53 + $35.04 = $84.45 So Artie will make $84.45 in total.;
"Response:  To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we need to use the information given in the problem. The square footage of each level decreases by half from the previous level. So, if the top level has a square footage of 16, then the second level (which is half the size of the top level) would have a square footage of 8, and so on. Therefore, the average square footage of a level can be calculated as follows:

Average square footage = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 8

"Response:  To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total number of cups of dog food she needs and then divide it by the number of cups per bag. Let's do that:
Total cups of dog food needed = 1 cup/day x 180 days + 2 cups/day x remaining days = 180 + (365 - 180) = 485 cups
Since there are 110 cups per bag, Cecilia will use:
Number of bags = Total cups / Cups per bag = 485 / 110 = 4.4 bags
So, Cecilia will use approximately 4.4 bags of dog food in the first year.";
Response:  Let's assume that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, he does 200 pounds of laundry (half of 400). And since David does only one-fourth as much laundry as Sarah, he does 100 pounds of laundry (one-fourth of 400). So, the difference between the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 100 - 200 = -50 pounds.;
"Response:  To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of 18 flowers at each price.

"Response:  Let's assume that Harald sold x copies of his record. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn sold 10x copies of her record. Now, we know that the total number of copies sold by both of them is 88,000, so we can set up the equation:

Marilyn's sales = 10x
Harald's sales = x
Now, we can substitute the value of x (which we don't know yet) into either of these equations to find out what it is:

Marilyn's sales = 10x
Marilyn's sales = 88,000 - x

Solving for x, we get:

"Response:  To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we need to calculate the volume of each box and then add them up.
The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:
V = length x width x height
So, the volume of the first box is:
Volume of Box 1 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Similarly, the volume of the second box is:
Volume of Box 2 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
And the volume of the third box is:
Volume of Box 3 = 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
Now, let's add the volumes of all three boxes together to get the total inner volume:
Total Inner Volume = Volume of Box 1 + Volume of Box 2 + Volume of Box 3
= 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches + 120 cubic inches
= 360 cubic inches
Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is 360 cubic inches.";
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Every night, Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework.
* On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night.
* On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. (We don't know exactly how many episodes he watched, but we do know it was fewer than 1 hour.)
* On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
* On Friday, he stayed up late and watched two 1-hour episodes.

So, let's total up the amount of time Frankie spent watching TV each day:

Monday + Tuesday = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes
Wednesday (few episodes) =? minutes
Thursday = 1 x 60 minutes + 1 x 30 minutes = 90 minutes
Friday = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes

Total time spent watching TV = 120 +? + 90 + 120 = 450 minutes

Now, we can find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday by dividing the total time he spent watching TV by the length of a single 30-minute episode:

450 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 15 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 15 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.";

Response:  Let's start by using the information that the boat takes in two liters of water for every ten feet it rows back towards shore. So if Julia rows 20 feet, the boat will take in 20 x 2 = 40 liters of water. Since it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can also calculate how long it took her to row the remaining distance (i.e., from 0 to -20) as follows: Time = Distance / Speed = (-20) / 16 = 1.25 minutes. Therefore, the total time it took Julia to reach shore was 1.25 minutes. Now, let's find out how much water the boat took on during this time: Water taken on = Time x Rate at which water is taken in = 1.25 x 2 liters/10 feet = 2.5 liters. So, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 2.5 liters of water.;

"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:

* Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if Brittany's phone can hold x photographs, Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs.
* The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, if Jamal's photograph has y birds, then Brittany's phone can hold at most 50y photographs.
* If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then the total number of photographs that Jamal has taken is 1800.

Now, we need to find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. We know that the number of birds in his photograph is equal to the number of photographs he has taken multiplied by the number of birds per photograph. Therefore, we can write:

Number of ducks = Number of photographs × Number of birds/photograph
= 1800 × (y / 1800)

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is y/1800.";
"Response:  To find out how much profit Sasha makes from selling the leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she has and then subtract the amount she sold it for. Let's do this step by step:

Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 x 2 x 4 = $80
Total cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 16 x 4 = $64
Total cost of all lumber = $80 + $64 = $144

Sasha sold 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, so she made $10 x 10 = $100 from those boards. And she sold 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, so she made $16 x 5 = $80 from those boards. In total, Sasha made $100 + $80 = $180 from selling all the leftover lumber. Therefore, she makes a profit of $180 - $144 = $36.";
Response:  Let's assume that Katy uses x teaspoonfuls of sugar. Since the ratio is 7:13, for every 7 teaspoonfuls of sugar, there are 13 teaspoonfuls of water. So, the total amount of water used = 120/7 = 17 teaspoonfuls. Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used = x - 17.;

"Response:  Let's assume that the first container was labeled as Container-1 and it contained 5 vehicles. Now, let's count the number of containers that were imported on the second day:

Container-1: 5 vehicles
Total vehicles on Day 1 = 2 \* 5 = 10 vehicles

Now, let's consider the additional containers that arrived on the second day:

Container-2: 5 vehicles (since there are already 10 vehicles at the port, we can assume that Container-2 also contains 5 vehicles)
Total vehicles on Day 2 = 10 + 5 = 15 vehicles

Therefore, there were 2 containers imported on the second day, each containing 5 vehicles.";
"Response:  Let's assume that Adrien's initial salary was x. Since Adrien's salary is now 40% more than it was four years ago, his current salary is (1 + 0.4)x = 1.4x. Similarly, Lylah's initial salary was y, and her current salary is (1 + 0.4)y = 1.4y. We know that Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, so we can write:

Adrien's salary : Lylah's salary :: 1.4x : 1.2y

Now, we are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, so we can substitute this value in the above equation to get:

$40000 : x :: 1.4x : 1.2y

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = $50000
y = $37500

So, Adrien's salary four years ago was $50000, and Lylah's salary was $37500. Four years later, Adrien's salary is $68000 ($50000 x 1.4), and Lylah's salary is $45000 ($37500 x 1.2).";
Response:  To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to divide the number of sheets he uses in a week by the number of weeks in a month. There are 4 weeks in a month. So, if Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, he will use 8 pads of paper (2 x 4) in a month. Since each pad has 30 sheets of paper, Miguel will use 240 sheets of paper (8 x 30) in a month.;
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so he has a total of 13 fruits (5 + 8 = 13).
Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which means he brought 2 \* 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which means he brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, Kael has a total of 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.
Now, let's find the total number of fruits both Morisette and Kael have together:
Morisette has 13 fruits, and Kael has 14 fruits, so together they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.";

Response:  To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to calculate the total distance she can cover in 7 hours by multiplying her running speed with the time. So, if she can run at a rate of 10 miles/hour for 3 hours, then she has covered a distance of 3 x 10 = 30 miles. Now, if she reduces her speed and can run at a rate of 5 miles/hour for 4 hours, then she covers a distance of 4 x 5 = 20 miles. Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 30 + 20 = 50 miles.;
Response:  Let X be the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie began. Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she put stamps on 20 letters (since 1/3 × 60 = 20).

"Response:  To find out how much profit the hospital makes, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital during each day. We can do this by multiplying the number of patients seen per day (500) by the average time spent with each patient (24 minutes). This gives us a total of 12,000 minutes (or 20 hours) of patient care provided by the hospital per day.

Now, let's calculate the total revenue generated by the hospital based on the charging structure given in the problem. Since the doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital, the hospital earns $150 x 20 = $3000 per day from doctor consultations alone. Similarly, since the hospital charges patients $200 per hour, it earns $200 x 12,000 = $24,000 per day from patient care services. Therefore, the total daily revenue of the hospital is $3000 + $24,000 = $27,000.";

"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, so she used 2 x 6 = 12 tickets for the roller coaster.
* Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used 4 x 6 = 24 tickets for the roller coaster.
* Each of them decided to ride the luge 2 times. So, together they used 2 + 2 = 4 tickets for the luge.

Therefore, the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred that day is 12 + 24 + 4 = 30 tickets.";
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. So, his total distance walked on Monday = 4 miles.
* On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. So, his total distance walked on Tuesday = 6 x 4 = 24 miles.
* On Wednesday, he walked a certain number of miles, which we are trying to find out.

From the problem statement, we know that his total mileage from Monday to Wednesday = 41 miles. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Total distance walked on Wednesday = Total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday - Total distance walked on Monday
= 41 miles - 4 miles
= 37 miles

Therefore, Walt walked 37 miles on Wednesday.";
Response:  To find out how much Tom pays in a year for the 4 car washes per month, we need to multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash. So, Tom pays $60 ($15 x 4) per month and $720 ($60 x 12) per year.;
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. ""Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does."" - This means that if Brian has x video games, then Bobby has x - 5 video games.
2. ""If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made..."" - This means that after losing 5 video games, Brian now has 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
3. So, we can write an equation based on the above two statements:
Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does, so Bobby has 3x - 5 video games.
After Brian lost 5 video games, he had 15 video games, so the number of video games Bobby has is equal to 3(15) - 5 = 45 video games.
Therefore, Bobby has 45 video games.";
"Response:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in total. We know that there are 27 unicorns left in the world, so the total number of unicorns is 27.

Next, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. We know that one-third of the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, so the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is 1/3 x 27 = 9.

Now, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. We know that two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands is 2/3 x 9 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.";
Response:  To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to add up all the items she is ordering. The cost of two subs is $7.50 x 2 = $15.00, the cost of two bags of chips is $1.50 x 2 = $3.00, and the cost of two cookies is $1.00 x 2 = $2.00. So, the total cost of the items she is ordering is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00. Then, there is a 20% delivery fee which is $20.00 x 20% = $4.00, so the total delivery cost is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00. Finally, if she adds a $5.00 tip, that would be an additional $5.00. Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.;
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Time taken by Mark to complete the first test = 8 hours
* Number of questions in the first test = 75
* Rate at which Mark completed the test = 5 questions/hour
* Time taken by Mark to complete the second test = 6 hours
* Number of questions in the second test = 100

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Mark left incomplete:

For the first test:
Time taken to complete the test = 8 hours
Number of questions left incomplete = (75 - 5 \* 8) / 5 = 25

For the second test:
Time taken to complete the test = 6 hours
Number of questions left incomplete = (100 - 5 \* 6) / 5 = 30

Therefore, Mark left 25 questions incomplete in the first test and 30 questions incomplete in the second test.";
Response:  Let's assume that the total number of gumballs in the machine is x. Since there are 4 times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, then the number of pink gumballs is 4x. We know that there are 12 blue gumballs so the difference between the total number of gumballs and the number of blue gumballs is : x - 12 = 4x - 12. Solving for x we get x = 30. So there are 30 pink gumballs in the machine.;

"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* There are 700 bees in the hive.
* There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. So, if there are x baby bees, there are 2x worker bees.
* There are twice as many babies as queens. So, if there are y queen bees, there are 2y baby bees.

Now, we can use these equations to find the number of worker bees:

2x = 700 (baby bees)
2y = 1400 (queen bees)

Solving both equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 350 (worker bees)
y = 70 (queen bees)

Therefore, there are 350 worker bees and 70 queen bees in the hive.";
Response:  To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends on video games and then multiply it by his hourly wage from his part-time job. Let's assume that Jordan spends 2 hours per day playing video games. In a week, there are 7 days, so he spends a total of 14 hours (2 x 7) playing video games. If he works 8 hours per day at his part-time job, he will work a total of 56 hours (8 x 7) in a week. Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn $560 ($10/hour x 56 hours).;
"Response:  The total cost of the items John bought can be calculated as follows:

* Eggs: $3 x 1 = $3
* Light bulbs: $3 x 1 = $3
* Cups: $3 x 1 = $3
* Roach traps: $4 x 1 = $4

Total cost of non-food items = $3 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $16

So, the total cost of everything John bought including both food and non-food items is:
$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $15

Therefore, the answer is $15.";
Response:  To find out how much profit Lucas will make each week, we first need to calculate his total income for the week. Based on the information given, his total income per week is $92. Next, we need to subtract his total expenses from his total income to find his profit. His total expenses are $2 x 6 = $12 (for the 6 bottles of bleach) + $5 x 5 = $25 (for the 5 packs of cloths). So, his profit each week is $92 - $12 - $25 = $45. Therefore, Lucas will make $45 in profit each week.;
"Response:  To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to multiply the number of hectares he has by the number of pineapples per hectare and then divide it by the time interval between harvests (in this case, 3 months). So, the answer is:

"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how far Steve has traveled when Tim catches up to him. We know that Steve travels at a rate of 440 feet per minute, so in one minute, he covers an distance of:

Distance = Rate x Time
= 440 ft/minute x 1 min
= 440 feet

Now, since Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, it means that he has to cover a total distance of 2 miles to reach Steve's house. Since he can travel at a rate of 264 feet per minute, it will take him:

Time = Distance / Rate
= 2 miles / 264 ft/minute
= 7.5 minutes

So, after 7.5 minutes, Tim will catch up to Steve. Therefore, the winner will be waiting at their house for 7.5 minutes before the loser finishes the race.";
Response:  To find out how much Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the cost of inflating each tire and then multiply it by the number of tires inflated for each customer. For the bicyclists who came by, each tire cost $0.25, so the total cost for them was $1.25 (5 tires x $0.25). For the tricycle riders, each tire cost $0.75 ($3 tires x $0.25), and for the unicycler, each tire cost $0.25 as well. Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $6.25 that day ($1.25 + $0.75 + $0.25).;

"Response:  To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes in the zoo over a period of 2 months.

Total number of bananas needed = Number of bananas needed by each ape x Number of months
= 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, he needs to order half of the total number of bananas needed over a period of 2 months. Therefore, he needs to order:

Half of 700 bananas = 350 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 350 bananas to last for 2 months.";
Response:  To find out how far the winner ran compared to the loser, we need to measure the distance between the starting point of each runner and their finishing point. Let's call the distance from the start to the finish for both Blake and Kelly as x and y meters respectively. We know that Blake ran 15 times back and forth, which means he covered a total distance of 15x meters. Similarly, Kelly ran 34 times back and forth, covering a total distance of 34y meters. Since the football field is 100 yards long, we can convert the distances given in meters to yards by multiplying them by 100. So, the distance covered by Blake is 15x = 1500x yards, and the distance covered by Kelly is 34y = 3400y yards. Now, we can compare the two distances by dividing the distance covered by Kelly (3400y) by the distance covered by Blake (1500x). This gives us an ratio of approximately 2.26:1, or 226% more distance covered by Kelly than Blake. Therefore, the winner runs significantly farther than the loser.;

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught 3 + 3 = 6 clownfish.
So, the total number of fish that both Anakin and Locsin caught is:
10 (starfish) + 6 (sea horses) + 6 (clownfish) = 22 fish.";
"Response:  After 36 months, if the price of a bag of marbles increases by 20% of the original price every two months, then the new price of a bag of marbles can be calculated as follows:

Price after 1 month = Original price x (1 + 20%)
= $20 x (1 + 0.2)
= $24

Price after 2 months = Price after 1 month x (1 + 20%)
= $24 x (1 + 0.2)
= $28.80

Price after 3 months = Price after 2 months x (1 + 20%)
= $28.80 x (1 + 0.2)
= $33.79

Price after 4 months = Price after 3 months x (1 + 20%)
= $33.79 x (1 + 0.2)
= $40.59

Price after 5 months = Price after 4 months x (1 + 20%)
= $40.59 x (1 + 0.2)
= $48.79

Price after 6 months = Price after 5 months x (1 + 20%)
= $48.79 x (1 + 0.2)

"Response:  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, let's find out the total number of toys in the room:

Red cars = 5
Action figures = 3
Doll = 1
Total toys = Red cars + Action figures + Doll = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9

Now, we know that each action figure costs $5, so the total value of 3 action figures is:

Value of 3 action figures = 3 x $5 = $15

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car, so the total value of the doll is:

Value of doll = 3 x $15 + $4 = $45

Finally, we can add up the values of all the toys to find their total worth:

Total value of all toys = Value of red cars + Value of action figures + Value of doll = $4 + $15 + $45 = $64

So, all the toys in the room together are worth $64.";
"Response:  To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant, we need to calculate the value of the time she would spend doing her own taxes versus the cost of hiring an accountant. Let's use the information provided in the problem:

* Time spent on taxes = 3 hours (if she does them herself)
* Missed income from not working on freelance projects = $35/hour
* Cost of hiring an accountant = $90

Now let's compare these two values:

Value of time saved by hiring an accountant = $35/hour x 3 hours = $105
Cost of hiring an accountant = $90

Response:  To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the cost of all the accessories from her total budget. So, if her total budget is €1500 and she spends €1090 on the computer, then she will have €410 left (€1500 - €1090 = €410). If she spends another €157 on the scanner, €74 on the CD burner, and €102 on the printer, then she will have €283 left (€410 - €157 + €74 + €102 = €283) for her clothing.;

Response:  Let's assume that Seth's age is x. Then, Brooke's age can be found by subtracting twice Seth's age from 28. So, Brooke's age = 28 - 2x. Now, we are given that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be equal to 28. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + (2x) = 28...(1) Now, simplify the equation: 3x = 28...(2) Divide both sides by 3: x = 9...(3) So, Seth's age is 9 and Brooke's age is 27.;

Jimmy = 2x + 2 = 2(8) + 2 = 16
Therefore, Jimmy has 16 dollars.";
"Response:  To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the total number of miles he walks during the weekdays and then add that to the total number of miles he walks on weekends. Let's break it down step by step:

Weekdays (Monday to Friday):
Pancho walks 20 miles per day = 20 x 5 days = 100 miles

Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):
Pancho walks 10 miles per day = 10 x 2 days = 20 miles

Total miles walked in a week = 100 + 20 = 120 miles

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week.";
"Response:  Let's break down the cost of each component of the uniform:

* Hat: $25

Response:  To find out how many legs Jake sees, we need to add up the number of legs on all the creatures he saw. The spiders have 8 legs each, so that's 8 x 80 = 640 legs from the spiders alone. The insects have 6 legs each, so that's 90 x 6 = 540 legs from the insects. And there are 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 legs from those. Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1270 legs.;
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the problem:

1. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Granny Red is 3 years younger than Sally Two.
2. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red is 2 x (Sally Four - 8) = 2(40) = 80 years old.
3. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. So, Sally Four is 32 years old.

Now, let's find the total age of the four birds:

Granny Red + Sally Two + Sally Four + Sally Thirtytwo =?
= 80 + 3 + 32 + 32 = 157 years old.

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 157 years old.";
"Response:  To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the total amount she pays each month and then multiply it by 12. Let's do that step by step:

Total monthly payment = Minimum payment for student loan + Minimum payment for credit card + Minimum payment for mortgage + 50% of minimum payment for each (optional)
= $300 + $200 + $500 + ($300 x 1.5)
= $1500 + $300
= $1800 per month

Now, let's calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year:
Total annual payment = Total monthly payment x 12 months
= $1800 x 12
= $21,600 per year

So, Jessica pays $21,600 in a year towards her debts if she chooses to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt.";
"Response:  To find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to use the information given in the problem. We know that it takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato (1 min 15 sec) and about 5 seconds to cut it up. Since there are 60 potatoes to prepare, we can use these times to calculate the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping them all.

First, let's calculate the total time it will take to peel all 60 potatoes:
60 x 1 min 15 sec = 90 minutes
So, it will take Billy 90 minutes to peel all 60 potatoes.
Next, let's calculate the total time it will take to cut all 60 potatoes:
60 x 5 sec = 300 seconds
So, it will take Billy 300 seconds (or 5 minutes) to cut all 60 potatoes.
Therefore, it will take Billy a total of 90 + 5 = 95 minutes to finish prepping all 60 potatoes for his big family reunion barbecue.";
Response:  Let's first calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3/gallon, and the cost of sugar is $2/gallon. So, the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade = $3 + $2 = $5/gallon. Now, we know that Juan and Carlos sold 20 glasses per gallon, so they sold a total of 20 x $5 = $100 worth of lemonade. Since they made a profit of $25, their expenses (cost of lemons) must be equal to their profits minus their sales ($25 - $100 = -$75). Therefore, they spent $75 on lemons.;
Response:  Let's assume that there are x girls on the Chinese team. Since there are 80 Japanese runners in total, we can say that the number of boys on the Japanese team is 80 - 60 = 20.

"Response:  To find out how much money Zaid has left after all these expenses and donations, we need to calculate each of them separately and then subtract it from his total income. Let's do that step by step:

1. Rent: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which means he pays $1500 (1/4 x $6000) towards rent every month.
2. Car fuel: Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which means he pays $2000 (1/3 x $6000) towards car fuel every month.
3. Donation: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is $3000 ($6000 - $3000 = $3000).
4. Weekly expenses for his daughter: Zaid gives his daughter $200 to use for her weekly expenses.
5. Groceries and other household goods: Zaid gives his wife $700 to budget for groceries and other household goods.

Now let's add up all these expenses:
Rent + Car fuel + Donation + Weekly expenses for daughter + Groceries and other household goods = $6500 ($1500 + $2000 + $3000 + $200 + $700).

So, Zaid has $6000 - $6500 = $500 left after all these expenses and donations.";
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:
Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, which means Rani has x crabs and Monic has x - 10 crabs.
Bo has 4 fewer crabs than Monic, which means Bo has x - (4) crabs.

Response:  Let's first calculate the total number of flowers that Sandra needs for her orders: Red roses = 4 x (total number of flowers) White carnations = 200 / 5 = 40 Pink calla lilies = 5 x (total number of flowers) Total flowers needed = Red roses + White carnations + Pink calla lilies = 4 x (total number of flowers) + 40 + 5 x (total number of flowers) = 4x(total number of flowers) + 130 Now, we know that Fred only delivered half of the red roses, so he must deliver 4/2 = 2 red roses by 5 pm to meet Sandra's demand. Therefore, the answer is 2 red roses.;
"Response:  Let's analyze the given information:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's age = Mark's age + 2.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, Mark's age at that time = Half of Jan's age + 5.
3. Now, we know that Jan's current age is 30 years. So, Half of Jan's age = 15 years (since Jan is 30 years old and half of 30 is 15).
4. Therefore, Mark's age two years ago = 15 + 5 = 20 years old.
5. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's age = 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

So, Jean is 22 years old.";
"Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find the total time taken by both teams to complete the race. Let's assume that the slower team takes x seconds to complete their race. Since they start with a disadvantage of 3 seconds per runner, their total time will be (x + 3) seconds. On the other hand, the faster team takes exactly 55 seconds to complete their race. Therefore, the difference in their times is:

Time difference = 55 - (x + 3)

We want to find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, so we set up an equation based on this difference:

55 - (x + 3) =?

Solving for x, we get:

x = 42

So, the slower team takes 42 seconds to complete their race, while the faster team takes 55 seconds. Therefore, the faster team wins by 13 seconds (55 - 42).";
"Response:  Let's analyze the probability of each event separately:

Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 6 - 3 / 6
= 2/3

Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
= 0 / 6 (since there are no even numbers in a row)
= 0%

Now, to find the relative probability, we need to divide the probability of Event 1 by the probability of Event 2:
Relative probability = Probability of Event 1 / Probability of Event 2
= 2/3 / 0
= 6

So, the relative probability of rolling a number greater than 3 compared to not rolling two even numbers in a row is 6 times higher (or 50%).";

= 10 bags x $2 x (distance from farm to warehouse)
= $20
Now, let's find out the total profit earned by the trader:
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= 10 bags x $30 x Profit percentage
= $3000
Since the trader made a profit of $400, we can deduce that he sold half of his stock:
Number of bags sold = Total number of bags / 2
= 10 bags / 2
= 5 bags
Therefore, the trader sold 5 bags of wheat.";
"Response:  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The total cost of the tickets is $20.25.
2. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. Each friend paid an equal amount for the tickets and food, so each friend paid $15.75 / 3 = $5.25 for the tickets and $5.25 + $15.75 = $20.95 for the food.

So, each friend paid a total of $20.95.";

Response:  To find out how much food the duck needs in one day, we can multiply the amount of food needed per week by seven (since there are seven days in a week). So, if the duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, it will need 24.5 pounds of insects per day (3.5 x 7 = 24.5).;
"Response:  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

Year 1:
Tom plants 10 trees, so he has 50 trees (the initial number).

Year 2-10:
Tom continues to plant 10 trees each year, so he now has 50 + 10 x 9 = 450 trees.

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die, which is equal to 135 trees (since 30% of 450 is 135). So, Tom now has 450 - 135 = 315 trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has 315 trees left.";
"Response:  Let's first count the total number of flamingos:

"Response:  Let's first find out how much Publisher A pays Mark per sentence. Since Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, we can write:

Publisher A payment = 5 cents/sentence x Total number of sentences edited by Mark = $0.05/sentence x 1000 sentences edited by Mark = $50/week

Now, let's find out how much Publisher B pays Mark per sentence. Since Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, we can write:

Publisher B payment = 2 x $0.05/sentence = $0.10/sentence

So, the total amount of money that Mark makes from both publishers is:

Total payment = Publisher A payment + Publisher B payment = $50/week + ($0.10/sentence x Total number of sentences edited by Mark)
= $50/week + $0.10/sentence x 1000 sentences edited by Mark
= $50/week + $100/week

Day 1 (Monday): Rose went to the store and bought 4 cakes.

Total cakes = 4

Day 2 (Tuesday): Rose went to a different store and bought 3 times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.

Total cakes = 4 + 12 = 16

Day 3 (Wednesday): Rose went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought 5 x 16 = 80 cakes.

Total cakes = 16 + 80 = 96 cakes

Therefore, Rose bought a total of 96 cakes over the course of the three days.";
"Response:  Let's first calculate the total cost of buying all the plates. We know that half a dozen plates are being sold at $6000 each, so the total cost of buying all these plates is:

$$ \text{Total cost of plates} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6000 = 30000 $$

Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of buying each cup can be calculated as follows:

$$ \text{Cost of each cup} = \text{Total cost of plates} - (1200) = 30000 - 1200 = 28800 $$

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $28800.";
"Response:  To find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to save for the jacket and shoes. Let's do that first:

Jacket cost = $30
Each pair of shoes cost = $20
Total cost = Jacket cost + (2 x Shoe cost) = $30 + ($20 x 2) = $70

Now, let's see how much money Sara has already saved:
Money saved = $10
So, Sara still needs to save: Total cost - Money saved = $70 - $10 = $60

Since Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, she earns $5 x 4 = $20 from those jobs. And since her parents pay her $4 per time she mows the lawn, she earns $4 x number of times she mows = $4 x number of times she mows. So, if Sara mows the lawn X times, she will have earned: Earnings = $20 + ($4 x X) = $20 + ($4 x X)

Now, let's check if Sara has enough money to buy the jacket and shoes after mowing the lawn X times: Available money = Earnings - Total cost = ($20 + ($4 x X)) - $60 = ($4 x X) - $60

If the available money is greater than or equal to $60, then Sara can afford the jacket and shoes by mowing the lawn X times. Otherwise, she doesn't have enough money to buy them.

So, the answer is: Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times (i.e., $60 / $4 = 15) to afford the jacket and shoes.";
Response:  Let's assume that Jerry has x red chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3x. Similarly, since each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5(2) = 10 eggs per day. Therefore, the total number of eggs collected by Jerry is 42 + 10 = 52 eggs per day. Now, we are given that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This means that if he has x red chickens, then he has x + 2 white chickens. So, the number of red chickens Jerry has can be calculated as follows: x = 52 / (3x + 2). Solving for x, we get x = 17. Therefore, Jerry has 17 red chickens.;
"Response:  To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we need to divide the distance he needs to cover (the perimeter of the park) by his speed (3 miles/hour). So, if the perimeter of the park is 18 miles (since the park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles x 6 miles), then:

Time = Distance / Speed
= 18 miles / 3 miles/hour
= 6 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 6 hours walking around the edge of the local park.";

"Response:  To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we need to divide the total cost by her hourly wage. In this case, the total cost is $352 ($320 + $32), and her hourly wage is $8. So, Lori would need to work for:

$352 / $8 = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori needs to work for 44 hours to afford the shoes and belt.";
Response:  To find out Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we need to calculate her total payment first. The formula for calculating total payment is: Total Payment = Principal Amount x Rate x Time. In this case, the principal amount is $2000, rate is 10% (which means $200 in addition to the principal amount), and time is 12 months. So, Total Payment = $2000 x 10% x 12 months = $3200. Now, if Janeth pays $165 per month for 12 months, her remaining balance at the end of 12 months will be: Remaining Balance = Principal Amount - Total Payment = $2000 - $3200 = -$1200. Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be negative $1200.;

* Number of points scored by Brianna = 17 points more than Naomi
= 17 + 68 = 85 points
* Number of points scored by Jojo = Unknown

So, we have two equations:

Equation 1: 68 + 78 + x + y = 251... (1)
Equation 2: x + y = 4... (2)

Here";"x' represents the number of points scored by Jojo and 'y' represents the number of points scored by Yuri. Substituting the values from Equation (1) into Equation (2), we get:

x + y = 68 + 78 + 17 + 4 = 267

Now, solving for 'x', we get:

x = 267 - 78 - 17 - 4 = 116

Therefore, Jojo scored 116 points in the board game."
Response:  To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle. For the crossword puzzles, it took her 10 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 10 x 3 = 30 minutes solving those puzzles. For the sudoku puzzles, it took her 5 minutes per puzzle, so she spent 5 x 8 = 40 minutes solving those puzzles. Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 30 + 40 = 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.;
Response:  The amount of water in the tank before Celine took any water is 120 liters. After she took 90 liters of water, the remaining amount of water in the tank is 30 liters (120 - 90 = 30). Then, when she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, the new amount of water in the tank is 60 liters (30 x 2 = 60). So, there are 60 liters of water in the tank now.;

"Response:  To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost of each rental separately and then add them up.

For Carlos:
Cost = $30/hour x 3 hours = $90

For Benji:
Cost = $18/hour x 5 hours = $90

So, together they will pay $180 for their rentals.";
"Response:  If Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, then the total number of days he will travel is equal to the time taken to travel by bus plus the time taken to travel by car.

Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester, and half as many days to travel by car, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

6 + (6/2) = 10 days

Therefore, Andrew will travel for 10 days in total if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car.";
"Response:  The probability that a randomly picked card will be a water type after losing 8 of them and buying 14 more grass types can be calculated as follows:

Total number of cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90
Number of water type cards before loss = 40/90 = 0.44 or 44%
Number of water type cards after loss = 40 - 8 = 32
New total number of cards = 30 + 20 + 32 = 82
Probability of picking a water type card = Number of water type cards / New total number of cards = 32/82 = 0.40 or 40%
Therefore, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is approximately 40%.";

So, Chad owes $7.75.";
Response:  To solve this problem, we need to find out how long it takes Kalinda and her mom to add one piece each. Let's assume that Kalinda adds 4 pieces in 1 minute. Then, her mom adds half of those pieces in the same time frame, which means she adds 2 pieces in 1 minute. Now, let's find out how many minutes it takes them to complete the entire puzzle. The number of pieces in the puzzle is 360, so they will take (360 x 60) = 21600 minutes to complete the puzzle. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them (21600 / 60) = 360 hours to complete the puzzle. Therefore, the answer is 360 hours.;
Response:  After two weeks, there were 90 baby watermelons left on the farm (70% of the original number). So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 30 + 90 = 120 - 90 = 30.;
"Response:  To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars first. The total cost of 12 cars is:

12 x $20,000 = $240,000

Then, Mark pays 10% tax on the total cost of the cars, which is:

$240,000 x 10% = $24,000

Finally, Mark pays an additional $1000 for registration on each of the 12 cars, so the total amount he pays for registration is:

$240,000 x 12 = $28,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

$24,000 + $28,000 = $52,000";
"Response:  Let's analyze the information given in the question:

On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, which means Kylie collects 25 shells (Monday = 20 + 5).

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday, so Kylie collects 49 shells on Tuesday (Tuesday = 2 x 25).

Therefore, Kylie collects 49 shells on Tuesday.";
"Response:  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

So, we know that there are half as many bugs as ants in the garden. This means that if there are 50 ants, then there are 50/2 = 25 bugs in the garden.

Now, we need to find out how many apples Dax picked. The question says that he picked ""some"" apples, but it doesn't give us a specific number. So, let's assume that he picked 10 apples.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of insects in the garden by adding the number of ants and bugs together. Since there are 25 bugs and 50 ants, the total number of insects is 75 (25 + 50).

Therefore, the answer is 75 insects in the garden.";
"Response:  Total number of penguins = 36

One third of them jumped in and swam in the ocean = 12 (since there are 36 penguins, if one-third jumps in, then it is 36 / 3 = 12)

Another one-third went inside the cave to eat their dinner = 12 (again, since there are 36 penguins, if another one-third goes inside the cave, then it is 36 / 3 = 12)

So, the total number of penguins still sunbathing = 36 - (12 + 12) = 36 - 24 = 12

Therefore, 12 penguins are still sunbathing.";
Response:  To find out how many vines Steve needs, we first need to calculate the total number of tomatoes he will have in one week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, he will have 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes in one week. Now, since each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, Steve will need 42 / 3 = 14 vines to grow all the tomatoes he wants. So, Steve needs 14 vines to grow all the tomatoes he wants.;
"Response:  To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we need to divide the number of friends by the number of slices per pizza. Since there are 20 friends and each pizza has 8 slices, John will need to order:

20 friends / 8 slices per pizza = 5 pizzas

So, John needs to order 5 pizzas to ensure that each friend gets 4 slices.";

"Response:  Let's assume the age of each girl as follows:
Mary - 2 + x (where x is the current age of Jessa)
Joan - 5 + x
Jessa - 20
Now, we need to find the value of 'x'. We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age = Joan's age - 2. Substituting this in the equation for Mary's age, we get:
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Joan's age = 5 + x
Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get:
Mary's age = 5 + x - 2
Now, we can solve for 'x', which gives us the current age of Jessa:
x = 18
So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:
Mary's age = 2 + x = 2 + 18 = 20
Joan's age = 5 + x = 5 + 18 = 23
Jessa's age = 20
Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 20 + 23 + 20 = 63 years.";
"Response:  Let's first analyze the information given in the problem:

* Number of students in the school hall = 1000
* Number of entrances to the hall (including exits) = 3 (A, B, and C)
* Percentage of students who went out through exit A = 30%
* Remaining students who did not go out through exit A = (100 - 30) = 70%
* Fraction of remaining students who went out through exit B = 3/5
* Total number of students who went out through exit C = 100% - (30 + 3/5 x 70%) = 20%

Now, let's use the formula for finding a fraction of a quantity to solve the problem:

Fraction of quantity A = (number of students who went out through exit A) / (total number of students in the hall) = (30%) / (1000) = 0.03

Similarly, we can find the fractions of quantities B and C using the same formula:

Fraction of quantity B = (number of students who went out through exit B) / (total number of students in the hall) = (3/5) x (70%) / (1000) = 0.06
Fraction of quantity C = (number of students who went out through exit C) / (total number of students in the hall) = (20%) / (1000) = 0.02

Now, we need to convert these fractions into decimals to get the final answer:

Number of students who went out through exit C = total number of students in the hall x fraction of quantity C = 1000 x 0.02 = 20

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 20.";
"Response:  Let's assume that James has x candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, John has 2x candies. Now, we know that John has 54 candies, so we can write the equation:

John's candies = 2x

Now, we are given that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can write:

James's candies = Robert's candies + 6

Substituting the value of Robert's candies from the problem statement, we get:

James's candies = 30 + 6 = 36

So, John has 36 more candies than James.";
"Response:  By the end of this activity, Dolly and Pandora will have read a total of 3 books between them. Here is how I arrived at that answer:

Dolly has 2 books, so she will have read those twice = 4 books (1 book from each of her own books).
Pandora has 1 book, so she will have read it once = 1 book.
Together, Dolly and Pandora will have read 4 + 1 = 5 books.";
"Response:  To find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to first calculate the total number of pages he writes per week. Since each person sends 2 letters per week and each letter is 5 pages long, the total number of pages Mike writes per week is:

5 pages/letter x 2 letters/week = 10 pages/week

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes Mike to write one page. As you mentioned, he can write a page every 6 minutes, so:

1 page/6 minutes = 0.17 minutes/page

Now, let's multiply the total number of pages Mike writes per week by the time it takes him to write one page:

10 pages/week x 0.17 minutes/page = 1.7 minutes/week

Finally, to convert this time to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

1.7 minutes/week / 60 = 0.03 hours/week

Therefore, Mike spends approximately 0.03 hours (or 3 minutes) per week writing letters to his pen pals.";

"Response:  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 French fries initially.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin was left with 24 - 5 = 19 French fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, i.e., 2 × 5 = 10 French fries.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is equal to 5 French fries (since she had 20).
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which means he took 3 fewer than 10 French fries. So, Colby took 10 - 3 = 7 French fries.
6. In total, Griffin lost 5 + 10 - 3 = 8 French fries.
7. Therefore, the final number of French fries that Griffin had was 19 - 8 = 11 French fries.
8. Since Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, which is equal to 5 French fries, Ginger gave Griffin 5 + 5 = 10 French fries.

So, the answer is 10 French fries.";
"Response:  Let's assume that the number of fish in Aquarium A is x. Since the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, the number of snails in Aquarium B is 2x.
Now, we know that there are 4 snails in Aquarium A and 32 snails in Aquarium B, so we can write:
4 + 2x = 32
Solving for x, we get:
x = 8
So, there are 8 fish in Aquarium A and 16 fish in Aquarium B.";
"Response:  To find out how much Jean paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services over the duration of the movie shoot.

Total Cost = Number of Hours x Rate per Hour
= 6 x $250
= $1500

Since the makeup artist gave Jean a 10% discount, we subtract that amount from the total cost:
Discounted Total Cost = Total Cost - Discount Percentage x Total Cost
= $1500 - ($1500 x 10%)
= $1350

Therefore, Jean paid $1350 for the makeup services during the 5-week movie shoot.";
Response:  Each person paid $79 / 3 = $26.33.;
Response:  The chef spent a total of $600.;
Response:  Let's first find out how many cookies Sue ate in total. We know that on Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies. Therefore, Sue ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many calories Sue consumed compared to her sister. Since each cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed a total of 46 x 200 = 9200 calories. To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the number of calories her sister consumed from the total number of calories Sue consumed: 9200 - 5 = 9195 calories. So, Sue consumed 9195 more calories than her sister.;
