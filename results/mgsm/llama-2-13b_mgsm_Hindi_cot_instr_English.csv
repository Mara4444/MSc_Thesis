Response:  Firstly, we know that Jenny sells 16 eggs per day at $3 each. That means she earns $48 per day from egg sales (16 x $3). Secondly, we are told that she spends $3 on breakfast every morning and gives away $4 worth of eggs to her friends every day. So, her daily expenses come out to be: $3 + $4 = $7. Now, let's calculate how much profit Jenny makes in a day. We can do this by subtracting her expenses ($7) from her income ($48): Profit = Income - Expenses Profit = $48 - $7 Profit = $41 per day Therefore, Jenny makes $41 per day selling eggs.
Response:  We know that there are two balts of neel...
Response:  First, we know that Josh bought the house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on renovations, so the total cost of the house was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.  Next, we know that after the renovations, the value of the house increased by 150%, so the new value of the house is $130,000 x 1.5 = $195,000.  Finally, we can calculate the profit as follows: Profit = New Value - Original Cost = $195,000 - $80,000 = $115,000.  So, Josh made a profit of $115,000 from his investment in the house.
Response: 1) James runs three springs per week. 2) Each spring is 60 meters long. So, in one week, James runs 3 x 60 = 180 meters of distance.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Veni gives her chickens three cups of mixed feed twice a day (morning and evening).  In the morning, she gives them 15 cups of chara (chaff), which is equivalent to 3 cups of grains (rice, wheat, or corn) + 12 cups of vegetables (mattha kiided, etc.).  Similarly, in the evening, she gives them 25 cups of chara, which is equal to 5 cups of grains + 20 cups of vegetables.  Now, let's calculate the total amount of food Veni provides to her chickens daily. Total Daily Food = Morning Feed + Evening Feed Morning Feed = 3 cups of grains + 12 cups of vegetables = 15 cups Evening Feed = 5 cups of grains + 20 cups of vegetables = 25 cups Total Daily Food = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups So, Veni needs to provide 40 cups of food to her 20 chickens daily.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each glass costs $5, and there is a discount of 60%. So, if we calculate the cost of one glass after the discount, it would be: $5 x (1 - 0.6) = $5 x 0.4 = $2 per glass. Now, since Kailer wants to buy 16 glasses, the total amount he needs to pay can be calculated as follows: $2 x 16 = $32. Therefore, Kailer needs to pay $32 for 16 glasses.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in Charles Town, there are twice as many birds as in Toolooze. So, if there are x birds in Toolooze, there will be 2x birds in Charles Town. Secondly, we know that in each of the three places (Toolooze, Charles Town, and Seatle), there are four times as many birds as in the previous place. Therefore, if there are x birds in Seattle, there will be 4x birds in Toolooze, 8x birds in Charles Town, and 16x birds in Seattle. Now, let's find out what x is. We know that there are 20 birds in total. So, we can set up the following equation: 4x + 8x + 16x = 20 12x = 20 x = 20/12 x = 1  Therefore, there are 1 bird in Toolooze, 2 birds in Charles Town, and 16 birds in Seattle.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carl can download files at a rate of 2 GB per minute. So if he wants to download a file of 200 GB, it will take him approximately minutes to complete the download. However, as mentioned in the problem statement, Windows updates require 20 minutes to install, which means Carl will have to wait for these updates before continuing with his download. Therefore, the total time taken for downloading and installing all necessary updates will be: Total Time = Downloading Time + Installation Time Total Time = (200 GB / 2 GB/min) x min + 20 min Total Time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes Total Time = 120 minutes To calculate how much longer Carl needs to wait after restarting his computer, we need to subtract the installation time from the total time: Waiting Time = Total Time - Installation Time Waiting Time = 120 minutes - 20 minutes Waiting Time = 100 minutes So Carl needs to wait for additional 100 minutes to complete his download.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours to reach his home from work. This means he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 60 miles/hour x 3 hours = 180 miles So, John is 180 miles away from his home when he starts feeling tired and decides to take a break. Now, let's calculate how far he has traveled in the remaining 4 hours. We know that he drives at a constant speed of 30 miles per hour during this time. Therefore, the total distance covered in these 4 hours is: Total distance = Speed x Time Total distance = 30 miles/hour x 4 hours = 120 miles Since John had already traveled 180 miles before taking a break, the total distance he needs to cover to reach his home is: Total distance = Initial distance + Additional distance Total distance = 180 miles + 120 miles = 300 miles Therefore, John is 300 miles away from his home when he finally reaches there after taking a break.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Eliza works for 40 hours per week and her hourly wage is $10. This means she earns $400 per week ($10 x 40 hours). Now, we are told that she also receives an additional 1.2 times her regular wage as overtime pay for each hour worked beyond 40 hours. So, if she works 45 hours in a week, how much will be her total earnings for that week? Solution: To find out Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to calculate her overtime pay first. Since she works 5 hours more than her regular 40 hours (45 - 40 = 5), her overtime pay can be calculated as follows: Overtime Pay = Regular Hourly Wage x Number of Overtime Hours Overtime Pay = $10 x 5 Therefore, her total overtime pay for the week is $50 (5 x $10). Now, let's add her regular wage and overtime pay to find out her total earnings for the week: Total Earnings = Regular Wage + Overtime Pay Total Earnings = $400 + $50 Total Earnings = $450 Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week would be $450.
Response:  First month had 60 downloads, second month had three times as many downloads as the first month (i.e., 3 x 60 = 180), and the third month had 30% less than the second month (i.e., 180 x 0.7 = 126). Therefore, in total, there were 60 + 180 + 126 = 426 downloads over the three months.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately.  Donuts - 3 x 68 = 204 dollars Mini cupcakes - 2 x 80 = 160 dollars Mini cheesecakes - 6 x 55 = 330 dollars Total Cost = 204 + 160 + 330 = 794 dollars
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate how much money will be spent on planting and maintaining the tree for one year. We know that the cost of planting is $90 and the annual maintenance cost is $3 (water and food). So, the total cost per year is: Total Cost = Planting Cost + Maintenance Cost Total Cost = $90 + $3 Total Cost = $93 Therefore, it will take 93 years to break even. Now let's calculate how many years it will take to earn back the initial investment of $90. We can use the formula: Number of Years = Initial Investment / Annual Profit Number of Years = $90 / ($1.5 x 7) Number of Years = $90 / ($10.5) Number of Years = 8.6 years It means that after 8.6 years, the tree will have earned back the initial investment of $90. However, this calculation assumes that the price of neem leaves remains constant at $1.5 per kilogram and there are no other expenses or income streams. If these assumptions do not hold true, then the actual time taken to break even may vary.
Response:  Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling one each in Green House, Red House, and Orange House. So she has 5 - 3 = 2 vacuum cleaners left with her.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 20 students in the class and out of them, 20% (i.e., 4) are participating in classical dance, 25% (i.e., 5) are participating in jazz dance, and the remaining 55% (i.e., 11) are participating in hip-hop dance. Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total number of students is participating in hip-hop dance. To do this, we can use the following formula: Percentage = (Participants / Total Number of Students) x 100 So, Participants in hip-hop dance = 11 and Total Number of Students = 20 Therefore, Percentage of students participating in hip-hop dance = (11/20) x 100 = 55%
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the profit or loss of each option. For this, we will use the following formula: Profit = (Selling Price - Purchase Price) x Quantity So for Option A (Golden Gadgets), we have: Profit = ($5,000 - $3,000) x 100 = $2,000 per unit x 100 units = $200,000 total profit For Option B (Electronic Gadgets), we have: Profit = ($8,000 - $4,000) x 100 = $4,000 per unit x 100 units = $400,000 total profit Now, let's calculate the total profit for both options and compare them: Total Profit for Option A = $200,000 Total Profit for Option B = $400,000 Since Option B has a higher profit than Option A, it is the better choice for the business owner if they want to maximize their profits. However, there may be other factors to consider such as inventory management, market demand, and competition before making a final decision.
Response:  We know that each train travels for two days and covers a distance of 80 miles per day. So, if one train travels for two days, it will cover a total distance of 80 x 2 = 160 miles. Similarly, the other train will also cover a distance of 80 x 2 = 160 miles. Therefore, the total distance covered by both trains in three days is 160 + 160 = 320 miles.
Response:  First, we know that the teacher gets $20 per hour and works for 35 hours per week as a teacher. That means she earns $20 x 35 = $700 per week as a teacher.  Next, we know that she works as a coach for 15 hours per week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her income from coaching is $30 x 15 = $450 per week.  Now, let's calculate her total weekly income. We add up her income from teaching and coaching: $700 + $450 = $1,150 per week.  Finally, we need to convert this amount to an annual salary. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply $1,150 by 52: $1,150 x 52 = $58,200 per year.  Therefore, the teacher's annual salary would be $58,200.
Response: 1) The number of eggs consumed per day is 3. 2) The duration of consumption is 4 weeks or 28 days (since we are asked to calculate the total number of eggs consumed in 4 weeks). So, let's calculate the total number of eggs consumed in one week first: Total eggs consumed in one week = 3 eggs/day x 7 days = 21 eggs Now, let's multiply this by 4 to get the total number of eggs consumed in 4 weeks: Total eggs consumed in 4 weeks = 21 eggs/week x 4 weeks = 84 eggs Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed in 4 weeks is 84 eggs.
Response:  First, we know that Mary has been walking for 4 miles and it took her 1 hour to cover that distance. So, her average speed is: Average Speed = Distance / Time = 4 miles / 1 hour = 4 miles/hour Now, we need to find out how much time she will take to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles. We can use the formula again: Total Time = Distance / Average Speed = 8 miles / 4 miles/hour = 2 hours Therefore, Mary will take 2 hours to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 liters of water in the narangi pey and 2 liters of water is added to it. So, the total amount of water in the mixture is 3 + 2 = 5 liters. Now, if 1 liter of water is removed from the mixture, the remaining amount of water will be 5 - 1 = 4 liters. Therefore, there are 4 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture.
Response:  We know that Remand is 23 years old and has a son who was born 6 years ago. So, we can start by calculating how many years have passed since Remand's son was born.  There are 7 years between Remand's son being born and now (since Remand is currently 23 years old). Therefore, Remand's son was born 7 years ago. Now, let's calculate how many years have passed since Samantha gave birth to Remand. Since Remand is 6 years older than his son, and his son is 7 years old now, it means that Samantha gave birth to Remand when she was 29 years old (7 + 6 = 29).  So, Remand's father was born 29 years ago.
Response: 1st three customers buy one DVD each, so they spend Rs. 600 (Rs. 200 x 3) in total. The next two customers also buy one DVD each, spending another Rs. 200, making it a total of Rs. 800 spent by the first five customers. Since the last three customers do not buy any DVDs, there is no revenue from them. Therefore, Billie has sold a total of 5 DVDs and earned Rs. 800 as revenue.
Response:  We know that one mom can do 2 centimeters of work in one hour. So if she works for 5 hours (from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), how much work will she do in total? Total distance traveled = Distance per hour x Number of hours worked Total distance traveled = 2 cm/hr x 5 hrs Total distance traveled = 10 cm Now we need to find out how many small steps she takes during this time period. Since each small step is 0.5 meters long, and there are 10 cm of work done in total, she will take: Total number of small steps = Total distance traveled / Small step length Total number of small steps = 10 cm / 0.5 m Total number of small steps = 20 small steps Therefore, the mother will take 20 small steps between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the discount offered is 25%. Secondly, we know that the price at which Kail bought the book was $19.50. So, if there was no discount, the original price of the book would have been: Original Price = $19.50 x (1 + 0.25) = $19.50 x 1.25 = $24.38 Now, since Kail got a 25% discount, he paid: Actual Price = $24.38 - $6.09 = $18.29 Therefore, the original price of the book before any discounts was $24.38.
Response:  First, we know that Mary bought chicken for $12, five packs of milk for $3, four sebs for $1.50, and some pizza debts.  We also know that the total amount she spent was $50.  So let's start by calculating how much each item cost her: Chicken: $12 / 5 = $2.40 per pack Milk: $3 / 5 = $0.60 per pack Sebs: $1.50 / 4 = $0.38 per seb Pizza debts:? (we don't know the exact amount) Now we have our costs: Chicken: $2.40 per pack Milk: $0.60 per pack Sebs: $0.38 per seb Pizza debts:? Next, we can calculate the number of items she bought based on their costs: Chicken: $50 / $2.40 = 20 packs (rounded down to the nearest whole number) Milk: $50 / $0.60 = 83 packs (since $0.60 x 83 = $50) Sebs: $50 / $0.38 = 133 sebs (since $0.38 x 133 = $50) Pizza debts: $50 - ($2.40 + $0.60 + $0.38) = $47.70 (since $50 - $2.40 - $0.60 - $0.38 = $47.70) Finally, we can find out how many debts she had based on the remaining amount: $47.70 / $0.38 = 129 debts (since $47.70 / $0.38 = 129) Therefore, Mary bought 20 packs of chicken, 83 packs of milk, 133 sebs, and 129 debts of pizza.
Response:  First, we know that Mishka bought three sets of clothes - shorts, pants, and shoes. Second, we know the prices of each set of clothes: shorts for $16.50, pants for $22.50, and shoes for $42. Finally, we need to find out how much Mishka spent in total. To do this, we multiply the number of items she bought (three) by their respective prices: Shorts: 3 x $16.50 = $49.50 Pants: 3 x $22.50 = $67.50 Shoes: 3 x $42 = $126 Total cost: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243 So, Mishka spent $243 on her new clothes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 15 servings in each ice cream and the price of one serving is $4. So, the total cost of one ice cream is: Total Cost = Number of Servings x Price per Serving Total Cost = 15 x 4 = 60 Therefore, if Sinthia eats an ice cream every night for 60 days, she will spend: Total Amount Spent = Total Cost x Number of Days Total Amount Spent = 60 x 60 = 3600
Response:  Henry rode his bicycle for 60 miles in total. He stopped twice during his journey. His first stop was after riding for 20 miles, and his second stop was before completing the remaining 40 miles (15 miles before the end of his journey). So, he rode his bicycle for: 20 + 15 = 35 miles between his two stops.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of one pair of shoes is $50. Secondly, we are given two options for the high-end branded shoes - option A and option B. Option A has a price of $33 per shoe, while option B has a price of $28 per shoe. We need to find out which option is cheaper and how much cheaper it is compared to the original price of $50. To do this, we can calculate the cost of each option separately: Option A: 2 x $33 = $66 Option B: 2 x $28 = $56 Now, let's compare the costs: Option A: $66 (cost) - $50 (original price) = $16 cheaper Option B: $56 (cost) - $50 (original price) = $6 cheaper Since option A is $16 cheaper than the original price, it is the better deal. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Darla and Elan are currently 7 years old. So, if their combined age is 162 years now, then we can say that: Darla's age = (162 - 7) = 155 years Elan's age = (162 - 7) = 155 years Now, after 10 years, both of them will be: Darla's age = 155 + 10 = 165 years Elan's age = 155 + 10 = 165 years Therefore, the sum of their ages after 10 years will be: 165 + 165 = 330 years
Response: 1) The jar contains 80 + 20 = 100 marbles. 2) Of these, 25% are from the first half (i.e., 25/100 x 100 = 25). Therefore, the number of marbles in the second half is: 100 - 25 = 75. So, the average number of marbles per person is: 75 / 3 = 25.
Response:  Firstly, John spends 0.5 hours per day on each of his 10 dogs, so he spends a total of 5 hours per day on dog care (0.5 x 10 = 5). Therefore, in one week, John spends 5 x 7 = 35 hours on dog care.
Response:  We know that Gretchin has 110 coins in total and 30 of them are gold coins. So, we can say that Gretchin has 80 silver coins (110 - 30 = 80).
Response:  We know that Haroon has 2 less than Shivam's number of ghee. So, if Shivam has x ghee, then Haroon has x - 2 ghee. Now we are given that Remand has half as much ghee as Shivam. So, Remand has (x/2) ghee. Since Remand has more than 40 ghee, we can say that (x/2) > 40. Therefore, x > 80. Thus, Shivam has more than 80 ghee and Haroon has less than 80 ghee.
Response:  First, we know that Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. So, if he played for 40 minutes, he would have scored 4 x 2 = 8 points in the first half. Now, we are told that in the second half, he scored 25% more than his score in the first half. Therefore, his score in the second half is 8 + (25/100) x 8 = 8 + 2 = 10 points. In total, Mike scored 8 + 10 = 18 points.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Terry eats two eggs per day at $5.00 each. So, he spends $10.00 daily on eggs. Now, let's calculate how much he spends in 30 days.  Daily Spending = $10.00 x 30 days = $300.00  Therefore, Terry spends $300.00 on eggs in 30 days.
"Response:  Firstly, John has 13 sets of video games and he sells each set for $15. This means that his total revenue from selling all the sets is:  
Revenue = Number of sets x Price per set  
= 13 x $15  
= $195  Next, we know that John spends $20 on each game, so his total cost is:  
Cost = Number of games x Cost per game  
= 8 x $20  
= $160 Finally, we can find out how many sets John has left by subtracting his cost from his revenue:  
Sets remaining = Revenue - Cost  
= $195 - $160  
= $35 Therefore, John has 35 sets of video games left with him after selling all the games at $15 each."
Response:  Firstly, we know that John runs for 60 miles in a week and he runs for 3 days in a week. Secondly, we know that he runs for 3 hours on the first day and half the time on the other two days. So, let's calculate his running speed per hour. We can do this by dividing the total distance run (in a week) by the number of hours he spends running. Total distance = 60 miles/week = 20 miles/day = 3 hours/day x 10 miles/hour = 30 miles/hour Now, we need to find out how fast John is running during each day. For the first day, he runs for 3 hours at a speed of 30 miles/hour, so he covers a distance of 3 x 30 = 90 miles On the second and third days, he runs for half the time, so he covers half the distance in the same time. Therefore, on the second and third days, he covers 90 / 2 = 45 miles per day. In total, John runs for 90 + 45 + 45 = 180 miles in a week. So, his average running speed per hour is 180 miles / 7 hours = 25 miles/hour.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Dena can travel at a speed of 4 guns (guntas) per hour. Secondly, we are given that she takes a break for 2 hours in between her journey. So, if she travels for 3 miles per hour, how far will she go in 6 hours? To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Dena during those 6 hours. We can do this by using the formula: Total Distance = Speed x Time Now, let's substitute the values we have: Total Distance = 4 guntas/hour x 6 hours Total Distance = 24 miles In other words, Dena will travel 24 miles in 6 hours, assuming she travels at a constant speed of 4 guns per hour and takes a 2-hour break in between.
Response:  We know that Suji's phone is two years old and Ben's phone is four years older than Suji's phone. So if Suji's phone is one year old, then Ben's phone would be: 4 + 1 = 5 years old. Therefore, Brandan's phone is five years older than Ben's phone, making it: 5 + 1 = 6 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Pollie can throw the stone up to 400 feet distance. So if she throws the stone at an angle of 30 degrees (as mentioned in the problem), then the maximum height reached by the stone will be: 400 x sin(30) = 266.7 feet (approximately). Now, let's assume that the dragon is at a distance of 1000 feet from Pollie. If the dragon is at this distance and Pollie throws the stone straight towards it, then the time taken for the stone to reach the dragon will be:  Time = Distance / Speed = 1000 / 400 = approximately 2.5 seconds. Now, let's calculate how much time the dragon has to react after hearing the sound of the stone being thrown. We know that the speed of sound is approximately 768 miles per hour (mph). So, the time taken for the sound wave to travel from Pollie to the dragon will be: Time = Distance / Speed = 1000 / 768 = approximately 1.3 seconds. Therefore, the dragon has approximately 1.3 + 2.5 = approximately 3.8 seconds to react after hearing the sound of the stone being thrown. However, if the dragon is sleeping or not alert, it may take some more time for it to wake up and react. So, the actual time the dragon has to react might be longer than 3.8 seconds.
Response:  Firstly, Dadi Jon has 5 pieces of firewood to be distributed among her guests. She gives each guest 8 sticks of wood, so there are 5 x 8 = 40 sticks in total. Now, if she has 14 sticks left over after everyone has taken their share, then the number of sticks taken by each guest is 40 - 14 = 26 sticks. So, each guest took 26 sticks of wood.
Response:  Firstly, we know that one bag of chips contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in each bag. Secondly, we know that our daily calorie target is 2000 calories and we have already consumed 1800 calories earlier in the day. So, to calculate how many grams of chips we can eat, we need to subtract the number of calories we have already consumed from our total daily calorie target. Therefore, the calculation would be: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories remaining for the rest of the day. Now, let's divide this amount by the number of calories present in one serving of chips (250 calories) to determine how many servings we can consume: 200 / 250 = 0.8 or 8/10th of a bag. Since we cannot consume a fraction of a bag, we round off to the nearest whole number, which is 1 bag. Therefore, if we want to stick to our daily calorie target of 2000 calories and we have already consumed 1800 calories earlier in the day, we can safely eat only one bag of chips (300 grams).
Response:  Firstly, we know that each pound of mango pulp costs $10. So if Charlie wants to sell 10 pounds of mango pulp, he will need to spend $100 on raw materials (10 x $10). Now, let's calculate how much profit Charlie can make if he sells each bottle for $2. If he sells all 20 bottles, his total revenue will be: 20 x $2 = $40. Since he spent $100 on raw materials, his net profit would be: $40 - $100 = -$60 or -$6 per bottle. Therefore, Charlie will incur a loss of $6 per bottle if he sells each one for $2.
Response: 1. The number of hours Meridith spends writing her blog per day is given as 4 hours. 2. She writes 5 posts on Monday and twice as many (i.e., 2 x 5 = 10) posts on Wednesday. Therefore, she writes a total of 5 + 10 = 15 posts in three days (Monday to Wednesday). 3. On Wednesday, she wrote half as much as she did on Monday (i.e., 10 / 2 = 5) posts. So, she spent 5 hours writing on Wednesday. 4. To find out how many hours Meridith spent writing in total over these three days, we need to add up the time she spent writing each day: 4 hours/day x 3 days = 12 hours.  There are 12 hours in one day, so Meridith spent 12 x 3 = 36 hours writing over these three days.
"Response: 1) Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse before going to the coffee shop. 2) She bought a package of 220 cups of coffee with one post-it note each. 3) After using all the post-it notes, she had 23 left over. So, we can set up an equation based on these facts: 80 + (220 x 1) = 23 We know that 220 x 1 = 220, so the equation becomes: 80 + 220 = 23 Solving for the unknown variable ""x"", we get: x = 23 + 80 = 103 Therefore, there were 103 post-it notes in the package of coffee that Candice purchased."
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of lal tai is 50% more than neeli tai. So if the price of neeli tai was Rs. 40 per kg, then the price of lal tai would be Rs. 60 per kg (Rs. 40 x 1.5). Now, we are given that John bought 200 kg of lal tai for Rs. 80,000. Therefore, the cost of each kg of lal tai would be Rs. 80,000 / 200 kg = Rs. 400 per kg. Since John bought 200 kg of lal tai, he paid a total amount of Rs. 400 x 200 kg = Rs. 80,000.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Trisha has used 4 feet long iron rods to support the tomato plants in her bag. Secondly, each rod is 6 inches long and has been cut into 3 pieces of equal length. So, if we divide 4 feet by 6 inches per piece, we get: 4 ft / 6 in = 0.67 (or approximately 3/5) Number of rods required = Total length of rods needed / Length of each rod Therefore, number of rods required = 3 x 0.67 = 2.01 (or approximately 2) Trisha needs 2 iron rods of 6 inches each to support her tomato plants in the bag.
Response:  We know that each floor has 8 flats and 3/4 of the building has been sold. So, we can start by finding out how many floors are left unsold. 3/4 of the building is equal to 75% (3/4 x 100%). Therefore, the number of floors left unsold can be calculated as follows:  Number of floors left unsold = Total number of floors x Percentage of floors unsold  Number of floors left unsold = 15 x 75%  Number of floors left unsold = 1125  Now, we need to find out how many flats are left unsold in each floor. Since there are 8 flats in each floor, we can calculate the total number of flats left unsold as follows:  Total number of flats left unsold = Number of floors left unsold x Number of flats per floor  Total number of flats left unsold = 1125 x 8  Total number of flats left unsold = 9000  Finally, we can calculate the total number of vacant flats in the entire building by adding up the number of flats left unsold in all the floors:  Total number of vacant flats = Total number of flats left unsold x Total number of floors  Total number of vacant flats = 9000 x 15  Total number of vacant flats = 135000  There are 135000 vacant flats in the entire building.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Loyd sells 252 eggs per day at $2 each, which means he earns $504 daily ($2 x 252). Now, let's calculate his weekly income. There are seven days in a week, so: Weekly Income = Daily Income x Number of Days in a Week Weekly Income = $504 x 7 Weekly Income = $3,528 So, Loyd earns $3,528 per week.
Response:  Tom travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2 hours (from 1 pm to 3 pm). So he covers a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 2 hours = 20 miles. Then, he walks back at a speed of 6 miles per hour and takes 4 hours to cover the same distance. So we can calculate his return journey time as follows: Return Journey Time = Distance / Speed = 20 miles / 6 miles/hour = 3.33 hours or 3 hours and 20 minutes approximately.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Urviya has 15 pounds of books and each book is approximately 1 pound in weight. So, she has 15 x 1 = 15 pounds of books. Now, if she sells each comic for Rs. 100, then she will earn 15 x Rs. 100 = Rs. 1500 from selling all her books. However, if she wants to sell only 30 comics, then she will earn 30 x Rs. 100 = Rs. 3000. Therefore, the number of comics she needs to sell to earn Rs. 3000 is 3000 / Rs. 100 = 30 comics.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each truck tire costs Rs. 60 and each car tire costs Rs. 40. So, if a mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires in a day, the total cost of repairing all the tires would be: 6 x 60 = 360 + 4 x 40 = 160 = 520. Now, let's calculate the daily income of the mechanic. Since he works only on weekdays (Monday to Friday), we will consider only these days for calculation. On Monday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so his daily income would be: 520 x 1 = 520. On Tuesday, he did not work on any truck tires but repaired 8 car tires, so his daily income would be: 520 x 0.5 = 260. On Wednesday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires again, so his daily income would be: 520 x 1 = 520. On Thursday, he did not work on any truck tires but repaired 8 car tires again, so his daily income would be: 520 x 0.5 = 260. And finally, on Friday, he repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires, so his daily income would be: 520 x 1 = 520. Therefore, the mechanic's total daily income for the week would be: 520 + 260 + 520 + 260 + 520 = 2,220.
"Response:  We know that there are two birds in total - one from each of Mrs. Doubtfire's two houses.  So we need to find out how many chicks each bird has.  From the first house, Mrs. Doubtfire says she has three goslings, so we can write down ""3"" as our first number.  Now let's look at the second house.  Mrs. Doubtfire says she has twelve chicks, but then corrects herself and says she only has ten.  So we'll use the smaller number of ten for now.  Therefore, our final answer is:  3 + 10 = 13  The total number of chicks belonging to both birds is 13."
Response:  Firstly, we know that Geena has 30 lollipops in total and she wants to pack 2 lollipops in each bag. So, if we divide 30 by 2, we get: 30 / 2 = 15 Therefore, Geena can make 15 bags of 2 lollipops each.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Peter has $42 for seven days. So, his daily expense will be: $42 / 7 = $6 per day. Now, he spends $6 per day on tickets and popcorn. Therefore, the number of times he can go to the cinema in one week is: $6 / ($7 ticket + $7 popcorn) = 6 / ($14) = 4 trips.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each box of goods weighs 15 pounds and there are 3755 pounds in total (3755 x 15 =?). Secondly, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck if the weight of each box is less than or equal to 5000 pounds (5000 / 15 =?). Finally, we need to calculate the number of full boxes that can be loaded onto the truck. Solution:  We start with the first calculation: 3755 x 15 = 56,825 pounds. Next, we divide this amount by 5000 to get the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded: 56,825 / 5000 = 11.364. This means that approximately 11 full boxes can be loaded onto the truck. However, since we cannot load fractional boxes, we round down to 10 full boxes. Therefore, the answer is 10.
Response:  First, Stefen paid a delivery fee of $3.00. So his total cost before tax is: Total Cost = $40.00 + $3.00 = $43.00 Next, he paid a sales tax of 25%. What is the amount of sales tax he paid? Sales Tax = $43.00 x 25% = $10.75 Now we add the sales tax to the total cost: Final Price = Total Cost + Sales Tax = $43.00 + $10.75 = $53.75 Therefore, Stefen's final price after tax was $53.75.
Response:  We know that there are 20 fruits in each group and 6 groups in total. So, we can start by finding out how many fruits are in all the groups combined:  20 x 6 = 120 fruits There are also 67 fruits that do not belong to any of the groups. To find out how many rasberries these fruits represent, we need to divide the number of fruits by the number of groups:  67 / 6 = 11 rasberries per group Therefore, there are 120 + 11 = 131 rasberries in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 25 santres in total. Of these, 1 is kharab (bad), which means it cannot be considered as good. So, we have to subtract 1 from the total number of santres. Now, we are left with 24 santres. Next, we know that 20% of the remaining 24 santres are apripiquat (inadequate). This means we need to subtract 20% of 24, which is equal to 4.8 (since 20% of 100 is 20, and 20 x 24 = 480). So, we now have 24 - 4.8 = 19.2 (rounded off to the nearest whole number) good santres. Therefore, there are 19 good santres out of 25 in total.
Response:  Firstly, she spends $500 for materials to make the brush. Then, she spends $800 to make the product (brush). So, her total expenditure is: $500 + $800 = $1300. Next, she pays 10% of her profit as bima (insurance), which is: $1300 x 10% = $130. Therefore, her net profit is: $1300 - $130 = $1170.
Response: 1. Firstly, we need to calculate Marsie's total service period with the company. Since she has worked for 40 years, her total service period is: Total Service Period = 40 years 2. Next, we need to calculate her annual pension amount before the increase in salary. We know that her annual pension amount is $50,000 per year. So, we can calculate her total pension amount as follows: Total Pension Amount = Annual Pension Amount x Total Service Period Total Pension Amount = $50,000 x 40 years Now, let's calculate her increased pension amount after the 5% raise in salary. We know that her salary increases by 5% every year starting from the 20th year of her service. So, if she works for 30 more years (from 20th to 50th year), her total increased pension amount would be: Increased Pension Amount = Total Pension Amount x (1 + 0.05)^(30-20) Increased Pension Amount = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^(30-20) Using the formula for compound interest, we get: Increased Pension Amount = $50,000 x (1 + 0.05)^30 Increased Pension Amount = $50,000 x 1.15^30 Increased Pension Amount = $50,000 x 1.67895 (approximately) Increased Pension Amount = $83,952.50 approximately (rounded to two decimal places) Finally, we add her original pension amount and her increased pension amount to find out her total pension amount after working for 30 more years: Total Pension Amount = Original Pension Amount + Increased Pension Amount Total Pension Amount = $50,000 + $83,952.50 Total Pension Amount = $133,952.50 approximately (rounded to two decimal places) Therefore, Marsie's total pension
Response:  Firstly, we know that Elina has been charged $140 per month for her streaming service. Secondly, if the company offers her a discount of 10% on the second half of the year, it means she will be charged less for the remaining six months. So, let's calculate how much she would pay in total for the entire year. Total amount paid = (Monthly charge x Number of months) + (Discounted amount x Number of discounted months) Total amount paid = ($140 x 6) + ($140 x 6 x 0.9) Total amount paid = $840 + $504 Total amount paid = $1,344 Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Elina received. To do this, we can divide the discounted amount by the original amount and multiply by 100. Percentage discount = ($504 / $840) x 100 Percentage discount = 60% Therefore, Elina received a 60% discount on her streaming service for the second half of the year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sofia has 12 gallons of gas in her tank and she needs to travel 100 miles. We can start by converting miles to gallons. There are 3.8 liters in a gallon, so: 100 miles x (3.8 liters/mile) = 380 liters Now, we have the total amount of gas Sofia has: 12 gallons x (4 liters/gallon) = 48 liters So, Sofia can travel: 380 liters / 48 liters = 7.5 miles or approximately 12 kilometers with the current amount of gas in her tank.
Response: 1) He watches TV for 2 hours and then sleeps for 8 hours (as he wakes up at 6 am). So, in total, he spends 2 + 8 = 10 hours sleeping. 2) He spends 3 hours watching TV every weekend (Saturday and Sunday), so he watches TV for 3 x 2 = 6 hours per weekend. 3) Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he watches TV for 6 x 4 = 24 hours per month. Therefore, in one month, he watches TV for a total of 10 + 24 = 34 hours.
Response:  There are four schools participating in the basketball tournament, and each school has sent one boys' team and one girls' team with five players each. Additionally, each school has sent one coach for their respective teams. Therefore, the total number of people sent by all schools is: 4 x (1 boys' team + 1 girls' team) = 4 x (2) = 8 teams x 5 players per team = 40 players.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were 175 heirs in total. Secondly, we are told that 35 heirs had less than Rs. 35 each and their share was double the amount of the remaining heirs. Thirdly, we are given that the total amount distributed among all the heirs is Rs. 2000. Now let's calculate the number of ratnas (Rs. 35) required to make up for the difference between the total amount and the amount received by the 35 heirs with less than Rs. 35 each. We can do this by subtracting the amount received by these 35 heirs from the total amount and then dividing the result by Rs. 35. This gives us: Number of ratnas = (Total amount - Amount received by 35 heirs) / Rs. 35 Total amount = Rs. 2000 Amount received by 35 heirs = 35 x (Number of heirs with less than Rs. 35 each) = 35 x (35/175) = Rs. 675 Subtracting Rs. 675 from Rs. 2000 gives us: Rs. 1325 Remaining amount = Rs. 1325 / Rs. 35 = 38 ratnas Therefore, there were 38 ratnas (Rs. 35 each) distributed among the 175 heirs.
Response:  We know that there are 60 girls and 5 boys in Dr. Vertz's school. To find out how many teachers there are, we need to divide the total number of students (60 + 5) by the number of girls only. So, we have: Total Students = 60 + 5 = 65 Number of Girls = 60 Therefore, the number of teachers can be found by dividing the total number of students by the number of girls: Number of Teachers = Total Students / Number of Girls = 65 / 60 = 10/9 = 1.11 or 1 teacher for every 1.11 students.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Beli has $100 at the end of eight weeks. So, she must have started with some amount less than $100. We also know that she received $5 per week for eight weeks, so her total earnings are $5 x 8 = $40. Therefore, Beli started with $100 - $40 = $60.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how many classes are there in a week.  There are 7 days in a week and each day has 5 classes, so there are 7 x 5 = 35 classes in a week. Next, we need to calculate how much money is earned per student per class. We know that each student pays $15.00 per class, so the total amount earned per student per week is 35 classes x $15.00 per class = $525.00 per student per week. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money earned by the dance school in one week as follows: Total Amount Earned = Number of Students x Total Amount Earned Per Student Total Amount Earned = 100 students x $525.00 per student = $52,500.00 per week.
Response:  We know that there are two sets of instructions, one with 20 instructions and the other with 5 instructions (the first set of 10 instructions is repeated). So, in total, there are 20 + 5 = 25 instructions. Now, we need to find out how many instructions Kelian needs to read to prepare both sets of instructions. To do this, we can simply divide the total number of instructions by the number of sets: 25 / 2 = 12.5. Since we cannot have a fractional instruction, Kelian will need to read 13 instructions (12 + 1) to prepare both sets of instructions.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Tomie is selling each dollar for $3 and each cheeky for $4. So if he has sold 43 brownies and 23 cheeky, then he has sold a total of:  43 x $3 = $130 + 23 x $4 = $92 = $222  Now, let's calculate how much money Tomie has made in total. We can do this by subtracting his cost price from his sales revenue:  Total Sales Revenue = $222 - Cost Price  To find out the cost price, we need to add up the cost of all the items he has sold:  Cost Price = (43 x $3) + (23 x $4) = $130 + $92 = $222  Therefore, Tomie has made a profit of:  Profit = Total Sales Revenue - Cost Price = $222 - $222 = $0  In other words, Tomie has broken even. He has neither made a profit nor suffered a loss.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total cost of five phones for each month. Total Cost = (Number of Phones x Price per Phone) For three months, it will be: Total Cost = (5 x $150) x 3 = $9,000 Now, let's calculate the interest for three months at a rate of 2%. Interest = Total Cost x Rate x Time Period Interest = $9,000 x 2% x 3 = $540 So, Shilpa will pay $9,000 as the principal amount and $540 as interest over three months.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of all flowers sold by Artie today. We know that she sells each marigold for $2.74 per bunch, petunia for $1.87 per bunch, and begonia for $2.12 per bunch. So, if Artie sells 12 batches of marigolds, 9 batches of petunias, and 17 batches of begonias, her total revenue from flower sales would be: Revenue from Marigolds = 12 x $2.74 = $33.08 Revenue from Petunias = 9 x $1.87 = $16.83 Revenue from Begonias = 17 x $2.12 = $35.04 Total Revenue = $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.04 = $85.05 Now, let's subtract the total cost of all flowers sold by Artie today. We know that the cost of one marigold is $2.74, the cost of one petunia is $1.87, and the cost of one begonia is $2.12. So, the total cost of all flowers sold by Artie today would be: Cost of Marigolds = 12 x $2.74 = $33.08 Cost of Petunias = 9 x $1.87 = $16.83 Cost of Begonias = 17 x $2.12 = $35.04 Total Cost = $33.08 + $16.83 + $35.04 = $85.05 Since the total revenue is equal to the total cost, Artie will not make any profit or loss today.
Response:  We know that each floor of the building has an area of 16 square feet and there are four floors in total. So, the total area of all four floors is: Total Area = 16 x 4 = 64 square feet Now, we need to find out what is the average area per floor. To do this, we divide the total area by the number of floors: Average Area per Floor = Total Area / Number of Floors Average Area per Floor = 64 / 4 Average Area per Floor = 16 square feet Therefore, the average area per floor is 16 square feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first 180 days, Sesilia will have to feed her dog one cup of kibble per day. So, for those 180 days, she will use 180 cups of kibble. Now, let's calculate how many bags of kibble she will need for the remaining days of her life. We know that after 180 days, she will have to feed her dog two cups of kibble per day. So, for each year, she will use 365 x 2 = 730 cups of kibble. Since there are 110 cups in a bag, Sesilia will need 730 / 110 = 6.64 bags of kibble for the remaining years of her life. Therefore, the total number of bags of kibble Sesilia will need is: 180 + 6.64 = 246.64 bags.
Response:  We know that Remand has half as many shirts as David (i.e., 2/3 of 400 = 267). So, if David has 4 times as many shirts as Remand, then Remand has 267 shirts.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Vincent can buy three packs of flowers for $2.50 or two packs for $1.00. So, let's calculate the cost per pack of flowers:  For $2.50, he can get 3 packs, so each pack costs $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per pack.  Similarly, for $1.00, he can get 2 packs, so each pack costs $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per pack. Now, we need to find out how many flowers Vincent can buy with $18 at each price point. At $0.83 per pack, he can buy:  $18 / $0.83 = 21.74 packets (round off to 22 packets) Of flowers At $0.50 per pack, he can buy: $18 / $0.50 = 36 packets (round off to 36 packets) Of flowers Therefore, if Vincent buys flowers at $0.83 per pack, he will be able to buy 22 packets of flowers, and if he buys them at $0.50 per pack, he will be able to buy 36 packets of flowers.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John buys a dog for $100. Secondly, as a new customer, Groumer gives him a discount of 30%. So, after the discount, what is the amount paid by John? Thirdly, we need to calculate the total cost including taxes. Finally, we can find out the final price payable by John.  Here's the calculation:  Original Price = $100 Discount (in percentage) = 30% Discount Amount = 30% x $100 = $30 New Price = $100 - $30 = $70 Tax Rate = 8% Tax Amount = 8% x $70 = $5.60 Final Price = $70 + $5.60 = $75.60 Therefore, the final price payable by John for the dog is $75.60.
Response:  First, we know that two girls have 1/6 of 24 liters of water, which is equal to 24 / 6 = 4 liters each. Now, one boy has 6 liters of water. So, if we subtract the amount of water that the boys have from the total amount of water available (4 + 6), we get: 4 + 6 - 6 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 8 liters left over. Therefore, there are 8 liters of water left over after both the boys receive their share.
Response:  Firstly, Charlie bought 21 sticks from a shop and received 23 as gifts on his birthday. So, he has in total: 21 + 23 = 44 sticks. Next, he gave 9 sticks to his sister, so he is left with: 44 - 9 = 35 sticks. Finally, he used 28 sticks for greeting card making, leaving him with: 35 - 28 = 7 sticks. Therefore, there are 7 sticks left with Charlie.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Alex's weight is 4 kg less than Grace's weight. So, if Grace weighs 125 pounds, then Alex weighs 125 - 4 = 121 pounds. Now, we need to find out how much each pound of Grace's weight is equivalent to in terms of pounds of Alex's weight. To do this, we can divide Grace's weight by her own weight: 125 / 125 = 1. Therefore, one pound of Grace's weight is equal to 1 pound of Alex's weight. So, if Grace has x pounds of weight, then Alex has x pounds of weight as well.
Response:  Firstly, Dan has planted three gulab trees. Each tree has 25 flowers. So, in total, there are 3 x 25 = 75 flowers. Now, each flower has eight petals. Therefore, the total number of petals is 75 x 8 = 600.
Response:  The team played 22 matches and won 8 more than that number of matches. So, they won x + 8 matches. We know that x is the number of matches they won. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: x + 8 = 22... 29 To solve for x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: x + 8 - 8 = 22 - 8 x = 14 Now we have our answer! The team won 14 matches.
Response: 1) The number of years since she started wearing the T-shirt is 23 years. 2) She has worn it for every holiday (4 times). Therefore, the total number of blocks in her T-shirt = Total number of years x Number of times she wore it per year  = 23 x 4 = 92 blocks.
Response: 1st alarm went off at 8 am (given). The second alarm went off after 3 hours of the first one, so it went off at 11 am (since 3 hours have passed). The third alarm went off after another 3 hours of the second one, so it went off at 2 pm (since 3 hours have passed again). So, in total, there were three alarms that went off: 8 am, 11 am, and 2 pm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Silvi has worked for five years in the company and her annual salary is Rs. 600. Secondly, as per the company policy, there is an increase of 10% in the salary of each employee every year. So, if Silvi had been working for three years with the company, her annual salary would have increased by 3 x 10% = 30%. Therefore, her current annual salary (including the increase) would be: 600 + 30% of 600 = 600 + 180 = 780.  Now, let's calculate her monthly salary: 780 / 12 = 65. So, Silvi's monthly salary after serving the company for three years would be Rs. 65.
Response:  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harold. So if Marilyn sold 88,000 records, then Harold must have sold 88,000 / 10 = 8,800 records.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there will be 75 bags of upahar (gifts) and each bag contains $2. So, the total cost of all the bags put together is:  75 x $2 = $150 Now, we are told that only 3/4th of the guests have arrived, so we need to calculate how many bags they will receive. Since 3/4th of 75 is 50, the number of bags for the arriving guests is:  50 x $2 = $100 Therefore, the total amount spent on gifts is: $$150 + $100 = $250
Response:  Firstly, we know that one adult (10 pounds) will eat half a pound of aloo salad. So, for 20 adults, we need to prepare 20 x 0.5 = 10 pounds of aloo salad. Now, let's calculate the amount of aloo salad required for children. We know that one child will eat half as much as an adult, so for 5 children, we need to prepare 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 pounds of aloo salad. Therefore, the total amount of aloo salad required for the picnic is 10 + 2.5 = 12.5 pounds.
Response:  We know that Mars has three moons - Phobos, Deimos, and Mars itself.  If Cinderella has two mice as friends, then she has a total of three friends (including herself). Therefore, if we add up all the friends of Mars and Cinderella, we get:  3 (Mars) + 2 (Cinderella's mice) = 5
Response:  We know that Emmy is 5 years older than Jackson and Corrie is 2 years younger than Emmy. So, if Jackson is x years old, then Emmy is x + 5 years old. Also, we know that Jem is 10 years old and Corrie is 1 year younger than Jem. Therefore, Jem is 10 years old and Corrie is 9 years old. Now, let's find out how old Jackson is. Since Corrie is 2 years younger than Emmy, and Emmy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can set up an equation: Emmy's age = Jackson's age + 5 Corrie's age = Jackson's age - 2 Solving for Jackson's age, we get: Jackson's age = (Emmy's age - 5) + 2 Substituting Emmy's age from the first equation, we get: Jackson's age = (x + 5) + 2 Simplifying, we get: Jackson's age = x + 7 Therefore, Jackson is x + 7 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Lee can cover 400 meters in 38 seconds, so his speed is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 400 m / 38 s = 10.5 m/s Now, if Jerryald has increased his speed by 10%, then his new speed would be: New Speed = 1.1 x 10.5 m/s = 11.55 m/s So, Jerryald can cover 400 meters in: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 400 m / 11.55 m/s = 35.27 seconds Therefore, Jerryald can cover 400 meters in approximately 35.27 seconds, which is faster than Lee's time of 38 seconds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 60 dogs in total and each dog has two bills as pets. So, the total number of birds is 60 x 2 = 120 birds. Now, we need to find out how many cats are there in the neighborhood if the total number of animals (dogs + birds) is less than or equal to 80. We can start by adding the number of dogs and birds together: 60 + 120 = 180. Since the total number of animals is less than or equal to 80, we know that there cannot be more than 80 animals in the neighborhood. Therefore, the number of cats must be at most 80 - 180 = 100. So, there are at most 100 cats in the neighborhood.
Response:  We know that there are 200 students in class 5 and 2/5 of them are boys. So, the number of boys is: 200 x (2/5) = 80 boys. Now we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the scout group. So, the number of girls in the scout group is: 200 x (2/3) = 133 girls. Therefore, the total number of students who are not in the scout group is: 200 - 133 = 67 students. Of these, 80 are boys, so there are 67 - 80 = 47 girls who are not in the scout group.
Response: 1. Harry slept for 9 hours last night. 2. James slept only 2 hours less than Harry. So, James slept for 9 - 2 = 7 hours. Therefore, Harry slept for 7 more hours than James.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each tomato used by Freda makes 16 portions of soup. So if she made 32 portions in total, then she must have used (32/16) = 2 tomatoes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that out of 30 cars, 5 cars are allowed to go outside the line in the first 15 minutes. So, the number of cars inside the line for the first 15 minutes is: 30 - 5 = 25 Now, let's calculate how many cars will pass through the jam in the first 15 minutes. We know that each car takes 20 minutes to clear the jam, so: Number of cars passing through the jam in the first 15 minutes = Total number of cars inside the line x Time taken by each car to clear the jam Number of cars passing through the jam in the first 15 minutes = 25 x 20 = 500 cars Therefore, 500 cars will pass through the jam in the first 15 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, Marry has 18 new plants and she wants to give one plant each to her friends and family members. So, if she has 18 plants, how many plants will be left with her after giving one plant to each of her friends and family members? To find out, we can use subtraction. 18 - (18 x 1) = 18 - 18 = 0. This means that Marry will have no plants left with her after giving one plant to each of her friends and family members. Therefore, the correct answer is zero.
Response:  First, we know that Jerome had four friends who came to his house one day.  Second, we know that the first friend knocked on the door for 20 minutes before Jerome opened it. Third, we know that the second friend knocked on the door for half as long as the first friend (i.e., 10 minutes). Fourth, we know that the third friend knocked on the door for twice as long as the second friend (i.e., 20 + 10 = 30 minutes). Finally, we know that the fourth friend knocked on the door for 60 minutes. So let's calculate how many times each friend knocked on the door:  First friend: 20 minutes Second friend: 10 minutes Third friend: 30 minutes Fourth friend: 60 minutes Now, let's find out how many total minutes all four friends knocked on the door: Total minutes = 20 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 120 minutes Therefore, if the fourth friend knocked on the door for 60 minutes, then the total number of minutes all four friends knocked on the door is 120 minutes or 2 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Solomon has to read 4 pages of science textbook, 20 pages of social studies textbook, 7 pages of history textbook and 8 pages of geography textbook every day for 4 days to complete all the reading. So, he needs to read a total of: 4 x 4 = 16 pages per day 20 x 4 = 80 pages per day 7 x 4 = 28 pages per day 8 x 4 = 32 pages per day Total: 16 + 80 + 28 + 32 = 146 pages per day Therefore, Solomon needs to read an average of 146 pages per day to complete all his reading in 4 days.
Response: 1) Jon drinks water before sleeping every night. 2) He drinks one glass of water each time he wakes up at dawn and in the afternoon. 3) Therefore, Jon drinks three glasses of water per day (1 + 1 + 1). 4) Since Jon sleeps for seven hours per night, he drinks three glasses of water x seven nights = 21 glasses of water per week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that it takes 10 minutes for each mile of the city to be covered by the floodwater from the sea. So if there are 3 miles (4.8 km) between the shore and the center of the city, then it will take 3 x 10 = 30 minutes for the water to reach the center of the city. Now, let's calculate how long it would take for the entire city to be covered by the floodwater. We know that the distance between the shore and the center of the city is 42 miles (67.6 km). Therefore, it will take 42 / 3 = 14 times as much time for the water to cover the entire city as it took to cover the first 3 miles. Hence, the total time taken for the entire city to be covered by the floodwater will be 30 x 14 = 420 minutes or approximately 7 hours.
Response: 1) The mother has 400 tukde (small pieces of dough). 2) She gives 100 tukde to her daughter as boarding fee. 3) So, she is left with 300 tukde (400 - 100 = 300). 4) Her daughter takes 50 tukde from her as pocket money. 5) Therefore, the mother is left with 250 tukde (300 - 50 = 250).
Response:  We know that Codey Amir eats three cups of ice cream more than Kukiz. So if Kukiz eats 5 cups of ice cream, then Codey Amir would eat 3 + 5 = 8 cups of ice cream.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each box has dimensions of 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 20 cubic inches (since volume is calculated as length x width x height).  Secondly, there are three boxes in total. So, if we multiply the volume of one box with 3, we get: Total Volume = 3 x 20 = 60 cubic inches.  Finally, since the walls of the room are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume to find the usable space inside the room. In this case, the volume of the walls would be: Wall Volume = 3 x 1 x 6 = 18 cubic inches.  Therefore, the usable space inside the room is: Usable Space = Total Volume - Wall Volume = 60 - 18 = 42 cubic inches.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Frankie watches TV for 7 hours every night after completing her homework. On Monday and Tuesday, she watched an episode of her favorite show for 1 hour each. On Wednesday, she finished her homework quickly and watched two 1-hour episodes of the same show. Therefore, to calculate how many 30-minute episodes she watched on Wednesday, we can use the following calculation: Total time watched on Wednesday = 2 x 1 hour + 30 minutes (for each episode) = 2 x 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 4 hours + 30 minutes = 4.5 hours So, Frankie watched 30 minutes x 3 = 90 minutes of her favorite show on Wednesday.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Henry has 110 cookies in total and he wants to sell 15 more. So, if he sells all 15, how many cookies will be left with him? To find this out, we can subtract 15 from 110.  110 - 15 =?  Yes, you are right! There will be 95 cookies left with Henry after selling 15 more. Now, let's go back to the previous year when Henry sold 20% more than last year. We know that last year, he had 80 cookies (as mentioned in the problem). So, what was the total number of cookies he had last year? To find this out, we can multiply 80 by 1.2 (which is the ratio of increase in sales).  80 x 1.2 =?  Great job! Last year, Henry had 96 cookies (80 x 1.2 = 96)
Response:  Firstly, we know that the local gas station is selling gas for three dollars per gallon. Secondly, if you buy ten gallons of gas from this station, you will receive a cashback of twenty dollars as per the offer made by the app company. Now, let's calculate how much you would pay after receiving the cashback. If you buy ten gallons of gas at three dollars per gallon, you will pay: Ten Gallons x Three Dollars/Gallon = $30 So, after buying ten gallons of gas and getting a cashback of twenty dollars, your net payment would be: $30 - $20 = $10 Therefore, you would pay only ten dollars for ten gallons of gas, which includes the original price of the gas and the cashback amount offered by the app company.
"Response:  We know that Marsell and Beetroot have different numbers of roll-ups.  If we assume that both players played their full potential (i.e., they did not make any mistakes), then we can calculate how much each player could have eaten based on their respective roll-up counts.  First, let's convert the number of roll-ups to a common denominator.  For Marsell, we have 3 roll-ups x 4 = 12.  For Beetroot, we have 24 roll-ups x 3 = 72.  Now, let's divide each player's total roll-ups by their opponent's total roll-ups to get an estimate of how much each player could have eaten:  
Marsell: 12 / 72 = 0.167 or approximately 1/6th of Beetroot's roll-ups.  Beetroot: 72 / 12 = 6 or approximately 6 times Marsell's roll-ups.  So, if both players had played perfectly without making any mistakes, Marsell would have eaten approximately 1/6th of Beetroot's roll-ups, while Beetroot would have eaten approximately 6 times as many roll-ups as Marsell."
Response:  We know that Julie was swimming in the pool for 20 minutes (2 x 10 = 20). During this time, she covered a distance of 64 seconds (64 sec) towards the shore. So, we can calculate her speed as follows: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 64 sec / 20 min Speed = 3.2 m/min Now, let's find out how much water she drank during those 20 minutes. We know that she drank two liters of water every 10 feet (2 L/10 ft), so we can calculate the total amount of water she drank as follows: Total Water = Number of Feet x Amount per Foot Total Water = (20 min x 2 L/10 ft) Total Water = 400 ft x 2 L/10 ft Total Water = 800 L or 800,000 mL Therefore, Julie drank 800 liters of water while swimming in the pool for 20 minutes.
Response:  We know that there are four teachers in one classroom and each teacher has two periods per day.  If we assume that each period lasts for 50 minutes, then each teacher will have 100 minutes of teaching time per day (2 x 50).  Now, let's consider how many times the whiteboard can be used in one day.  Since each teacher uses the whiteboard twice during their respective periods, the total number of times the whiteboard is used in one day is:  2 x 4 = 8  So, the whiteboard is used eight times in one day.
Response:  We know that Raiyan plants 2 flowers daily in his garden and it takes 15 days for them to bloom fully. So, if he doesn't water them for 5 days, how many flowers will be left? Solution: To find out how many flowers are left, we need to calculate how many flowers Raiyan planted during those 5 days when he didn't water them. Since he plants 2 flowers per day, he would have planted 2 x 5 = 10 flowers during those 5 days. Now, let's add these 10 flowers to the total number of flowers he had before he stopped watering them. Total number of flowers = 2 x (15 - 5) = 2 x 10 = 20 flowers. Therefore, there will be 20 flowers left in Raiyan's garden after 5 days without watering.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Britney has 6 times more photos than Jamal in her phone. So if Jamal has x number of photos, Britney will have 6x number of photos.  Secondly, we are given that in Britney's phone, there are 50% more selfies than the total number of photos. This means that the number of selfies is equal to (6x + 50%) / 2 = 3x + 25%.  Now, we need to find out how many selfies Britney has. We can do this by multiplying the total number of photos by the percentage of selfies: 3x + 25% of 6x = 3x + 25% of x = 3x + 25%(x) = 3x + 25x = 75x.  Therefore, Britney has 75x selfies.  Finally, we need to find out how many bathtub pictures Britney has. We are given that in Jamal's phone, there are 50 bathtub pictures. So if Britney has 75x selfies, she will have 75x/50 = 15 bathtub pictures.  To summarize:  Britney has 75x selfies and 15 bathtub pictures.
Response:  Firstly, let's calculate the total cost of all the lumber that Sasha has. We know that she has 10 2x4x10 boards which cost $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is: 10 x $10 = $100  Next, we know that she has four bundles of five boards each, and each bundle costs $16. So the total cost of these bundles is: 4 x $16 = $64 Now, let's add up the total cost of all the lumber that Sasha has: $100 + $64 = $164 Finally, if Sasha sells all the lumber for $18 per board, how much profit will she make? To find this out, we need to divide the total cost of the lumber by the price at which it is being sold: $164 / $18 = 9 Profit = $164 - $9 = $155 Therefore, if Sasha sells all the lumber for $18 per board, she will make a profit of $155.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Kate has used 120 chammach of tea leaves and 1 cup of water to make coffee for herself. Now, let's convert the quantity of tea leaves from chammach to grams. There are 5 gm in 1 chammach, so: 120 chammach x 5 gm/chammach = 600 gm of tea leaves have been used. Next, we need to calculate how much coffee she has made using this amount of tea leaves. We know that 1 cup of coffee is equal to 200 ml, and 1 gram of tea leaves makes approximately 1.5 ml of coffee. So, to find out how many milliliters of coffee Kate has made, we can divide the weight of tea leaves by the number of milliliters per gram of tea leaves: 600 gm / (1.5 ml/g) = 400 ml of coffee. Therefore, Kate has made approximately 400 ml of coffee using 120 chammach of tea leaves and 1 cup of water.
Response:  Firstly, John buys two pairs of shoes for each child, so he buys six pairs in total (2 x 3 = 6). Secondly, each pair costs $60, so the total cost is: 60 x 6 = $360. Therefore, John spends $360 on shoes for his three children.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are two containers in each truck, and each container has five vehicles. So, if we have x trucks, then the total number of vehicles will be 2x + 2(5) = 2x + 10. Now, we are given that the total number of vehicles is 30, so we can set up an equation: 2x + 10 = 30. Solving for x, we get: x = 15. Therefore, there are 15 trucks with two containers each, carrying a total of 30 vehicles.
Response:  First, we know that Adrian's salary increased by 30% after four years, so if his original salary was x, then his new salary is 1.3x = $52,000 (since he earned $40,000 more in the past four years). Next, we know that Adrian and Leila's combined salary is 40% higher than what it was four years ago, so their combined salary now is 1.4(1.3x) = 1.84x = $97,680 (rounded to the nearest dollar). Therefore, Adrian's current salary alone would be $52,000 / 1.84 = $28,571.
Response:  Miguel uses two packets of paper per week for his drawings. That means he uses 2 x 4 = 8 sheets of paper per week. Since there are 30 sheets in one packet, Miguel uses 8/30 = 1/4 of a packet per week. Therefore, Miguel uses 1/4 of a packet of paper every week.
Response: 1) Morriset brought 5 seeds and 8 santres (weights), so he had a total of 5 + 8 = 13 things with him. 2) Kaail brought half as many seeds as Morriset, so he brought 5/2 = 2.5 seeds (rounded to 3 seeds). He also brought half as many weights as Morriset, so he brought 8/2 = 4 weights. In total, Kaail had 3 seeds and 4 weights, for a total of 7 things. Now we can add up all the items that both friends have: 13 (Morriset) + 7 (Kaail) = 20. So there are 20 fruits in total.
Response:  First, we know that Saadi slept for 8 hours on Sunday.  Next, we know that she slept for 2 hours less each of the next two days.  So, on Monday, she slept for 8 - 2 = 6 hours, and on Tuesday, she slept for 8 - 2 = 6 hours again.  Now, let's calculate how many hours she slept in total for the week:  Total sleep = (6 + 6) x 7 = (6 + 6) x 5 = 42 hours  Therefore, Saadi slept for a total of 42 hours during the week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rozii can run for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, she can cover a distance of: 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles in 3 hours. Now, we are given that after resting for 7 hours, she can run at a speed of 8 miles per hour. So, she can cover a distance of: 8 miles/hour x (7 hours + 3 hours) = 8 miles/hour x 10 hours = 80 miles in 10 hours. Therefore, Rozii can run a total distance of 30 miles + 80 miles = 110 miles in 10 hours.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jenny has 60 patrons and she has already spent money on some of them (past expenses). Now, if there are only 30 patrons left in her current list, then the number of patrons she had before spending money on them would be: 30 + past expenses = total number of patrons. We don't know the exact amount of past expenses, so let's assume it to be x. Therefore, the total number of patrons would be: 30 + x. To find out how much money Jenny spent on each patron, we need to divide the total number of patrons by the number of patrons she currently has: Total number of patrons / Current number of patrons = Amount spent per patron. Substituting the values, we get: (30 + x) / 30 = Amount spent per patron. Simplifying, we get: x + 3 = Amount spent per patron. Solving for x, we get: x = 27. So, Jenny had 27 patrons before spending any money on them.
Response:  Firstly, Julie bought three new packs of plastic wraps (cham cham) for Rs. 50 each. So she spent Rs. 50 x 3 = Rs. 150 on these packs.  Next, her husband brought five more new packs of plastic wraps as a gift to her. These packs cost Rs. 50 each too, so he spent Rs. 50 x 5 = Rs. 250 on them. In total, Julie and her husband spent Rs. 150 + Rs. 250 = Rs. 400 on plastic wraps. Now let's count how many wraps they got in total. Julie used three wraps to cover her dough while making the cake, so she had 12 - 3 = 9 wraps left. Her husband gave her five more wraps as a gift, so together they had 9 + 5 = 14 wraps. Therefore, there were 14 wraps in the package that Julie's husband brought as a gift.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Delan needed chicken and fish for his party. He bought 38 chicken skewers and 6 fish skewers. Now, let's calculate how many skewers he bought in total. Total number of skewers = Number of chicken skewers + Number of fish skewers Total number of skewers = 38 + 6 Total number of skewers = 44 So, Delan bought 44 skewers in total.
Response:  Firstly, Emily has made more than 20 friends in Lilie's class after joining the new school. This means that Emily has at least 21 friends in Lilie's class (since she has made more than 20). Now, we know that Lilie has 50 friends in total. So, if Emily has at least 21 friends in Lilie's class, then Lilie must have fewer than 50 - 21 = 29 friends left. Therefore, Lilie and Emily together have 29 + 21 = 50 friends.
Response:  First, we know that one tarbouz costs three times as much as one mirch. So if one mirch costs $15, then one tarbouz will cost $15 x 3 = $45. Next, we know that one santare costs less than one tarbouj but more than one mirch. We are given that it costs five dollars less than one tarbouj, so if one santare costs $45 - $5 = $40. Now let's calculate the total cost of the items Delan has purchased: 4 tarbouz x $45 each = $180 + 20 mirch x $15 each = $300 + 10 santare x $40 each = $400 Total Cost = $880
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of patients that visit the hospital daily. We know that there are 500 patients who come for treatment every day. Next, we need to determine how much time each patient spends at the hospital. We are given that each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Now, let's calculate the total amount of time all the patients spend at the hospital per day. To do this, we multiply the total number of patients by the average time spent per patient. So, Total Time Spent = Number of Patients x Average Time Per Patient Total Time Spent = 500 x 24 Total Time Spent = 12,000 minutes or 200 hours per day. Finally, we can calculate the revenue generated by the hospital based on the fees charged by the doctors and the hospital itself. The doctor charges Rs. 150 per hour, so the total revenue generated by the doctors is Revenue from Doctors = Total Time Spent x Doctor's Fee per Hour Total Revenue from Doctors = 200 hours x Rs. 150 per hour Total Revenue from Doctors = Rs. 30,000 per day. Similarly, the hospital charges Rs. 200 per hour, so the total revenue generated by the hospital is Revenue from Hospital = Total Time Spent x Hospital's Fee per Hour Total Revenue from Hospital = 200 hours x Rs. 200 per hour Total Revenue from Hospital = Rs. 40,000 per day. Therefore, the total revenue generated by the hospital per day is Rs. 30,000 (doctor's fee) + Rs. 40,000 (hospital's fee) = Rs. 70,000 per day.
Response:  Firstly, Nisa has 60 workers in her department store who work for 8 hours a day (1 shift). Secondly, she gives them an allowance of Rs. 250 per month. Thirdly, out of these 60 workers, 10 are children below the age of 14 years (younger than the legal working age) who work for only 2 hours a day (half shift). So, we need to calculate the number of elf workers who work for full shift (8 hours). To do this, we subtract the number of child laborers from the total number of workers: Total Workers = 60 - 10 = 50 Full-Shift Elf Workers Now, let's calculate their daily wages: Daily Wage per Worker = Rs. 250 / 50 = Rs. 5 per worker Therefore, there are 50 full-shift elf workers who earn Rs. 5 per day.
Response:  First, we know that in May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent less than $60. So let's start with what he spent in May:  $500 Now, let's subtract what he spent in June from this amount to find out how much he spent in total for both months:  $500 - $60 = $440 Therefore, Joseph spent a total of $440 in May and June.
Response: 1) Piam and Fred each took two roller coaster rides. So they together have taken 2 x 2 = 4 rides. 2) Each ride costs 6 tickets. Therefore, in total, they spent 4 x 6 = 24 tickets.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Somwar ran for 4 miles on Monday and then ran for 6 times as much distance on Tuesday (i.e., 6 x 4 = 24 miles). So, her total distance traveled from Monday to Tuesday is: Total distance = 4 + 24 = 28 miles Now, we need to find out how far she ran on Wednesday. We know that she ran for 6 guna more than her previous day's run. This means she ran for 6 x 28 = 168 miles on Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is: Somwar ran for 168 miles on Wednesday.
Response:  We know that Tom has four cars and each car costs $15 to wash. So, if we multiply $15 by 4, we get $60. This means that Tom spends $60 per month on car washing.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bob has 5 more videos than Brian. So, if Brian has x videos, Bob will have x + 5 videos. Now, we are given that Brian has won 5 games less than Bob. Therefore, we can say that Bob has won (x + 5) - 5 = x + 4 games. Since Brian has played 20 games in total, we can find out how many games Bob has played by subtracting the number of games Brian has lost from the total number of games he has played: x + 4 = 20 - 5 = 15. So, Bob has played 15 games.
Response:  There are 27 unicorns in the world and one of them is from Scotland. So, there must be at least one Scottish unicorn. Since we know that there is only one Scottish unicorn, we can say that there is one Scottish unicorn. Therefore, the number of Scottish unicorns is 1.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the order without delivery charge:  Total Cost = (2 sandwiches x $7.50) + (2 bags of chips x $1.50) + (2 cookies x $1.00) = $16.50 Next, we need to calculate the delivery charge based on the distance traveled:  Delivery Charge = $5.00 (as per the customer's request) Now, we add the total cost and the delivery charge to get the final amount due from the customer: Final Amount Due = Total Cost + Delivery Charge = $16.50 + $5.00 = $21.50
"Response:  Firstly, Mark had to solve 75 questions in 5 hours, which means he spent 1 hour and 20 minutes (5 x 3/4) on each set of 50 questions.  Now, if he had to complete 100 questions in 8 hours, he would have spent 1 hour and 20 minutes (8 x 3/4) on each set of 50 questions.  So, the number of questions that Mark left unanswered can be calculated as follows:  
Number of unanswered questions = Total number of questions - Number of questions answered in 5 hours + Number of questions answered in 8 hours 
= 100 - (50 x 1.5) - (50 x 1.25) 
= 100 - 75 - 62.5 
= 25  Therefore, Mark left 25 questions unanswered."
Response:  We know that there are 22 gulabi gambol in total and each gulabi gambol is four times as heavy as a neele gambol. So if we have 12 neele gambol, we can find out how many gulabi gambol there are by dividing 12 by 4. 12 / 4 = 3  Therefore, there are 3 gulabi gambol.
Response:  We know that there are 20 cars in total, and 12 of them are automatic. So, the number of manual cars is: 20 - 12 = 8. Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total cars are manual. To do this, we can use the following formula: Percentage = (part/whole) x 100. In this case, the part is 8 (the number of manual cars), and the whole is 20 (the total number of cars). So, we can calculate the percentage as follows: Percentage = (8/20) x 100 = 40%. Therefore, 40% of the total cars are manual.
Response:  We know that there are 700 workers in total and each worker has to work for 2 days. So, we need to find out how many workers will be working on each day.  Since there are more male workers than female workers, let's first calculate the number of male workers who will be working on each day.  Male workers = Total workers x Ratio of male workers (which is given as 3/4)  Male workers = 700 x 3/4  Male workers = 525  Now, we have calculated the number of male workers who will be working on each day. Next, we need to calculate the number of female workers who will be working on each day. Female workers = Total workers - Male workers  Female workers = 700 - 525  Female workers = 175  Therefore, there will be 525 male workers and 175 female workers working on each day.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jordan spends 2 hours daily playing video games and earns $10 per hour. So, he earns $20 per day from gaming. Now, let's calculate how much money he can make in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so: Weekly income = Daily income x Number of days in a week Weekly income = $20 x 7 Weekly income = $140 Next, let's calculate how much money he can make in a month. There are 30 days in a month, so: Monthly income = Weekly income x Number of weeks in a month Monthly income = $140 x 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month) Monthly income = $560 Finally, to find out how much money Jordan can make in a year, we need to multiply his monthly income by 12: Annual income = Monthly income x Number of months in a year Annual income = $560 x 12 Annual income = $6,720 Therefore, if Jordan dedicates all his time to playing video games instead of working, he could potentially earn around $6,720 per year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that John spends $2 on milk, $3 on eggs, $3 on bread, and $4 on chickens. So, his total expenditure on groceries is: 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 12 dollars. Now, if there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, then the tax amount can be calculated as follows: Tax = (12 x 10%) = 1.2 dollars. Therefore, John's total expenditure including tax will be: 12 + 1.2 = 13.2 dollars.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate Kim's total cost of goods sold (COGS) per month. COGS = Number of customers x Average order value (AOV) x Product price. Since there are three existing customers and five potential customers, let's assume that each customer places two orders per month on average. Therefore, the number of orders for all eight customers would be: 8 customers x 2 orders/customer/month = 16 orders/month. Now, let's calculate the AOV based on the products offered: 2 bottles of bleach @ $2/bottle + 1 pack of detergent @ $5/packet = $7/order. So, the AOV is $7/order. Next, we need to determine the product prices in dollars. Bleach costs $2/bottle, and the packet of detergent costs $5. Therefore, the total COGS per month is: COGS = 16 orders/month x $7/order x 2 bottles/order (bleach) + 1 packet/order (detergent) x $5/packet = $460/month (rounded off to the nearest dollar). To calculate the gross profit margin (GPM), we need to subtract the COGS from the total revenue. Total revenue = Number of customers x Average order value x Gross profit margin (GPM)% x Product price. Assuming a GPM% of 50%, which means that every dollar spent on products yields 50 cents as gross profit, the total revenue can be calculated as follows: Total revenue = 8 customers x $7/order x 1.5 (GPM% x Product price) = $840/month (rounded off to the nearest dollar). Subtracting the COGS from the total revenue gives us the gross profit: Gross profit = Total revenue - COGS Gross profit = $840/month - $460/month = $380/month (rounded off to the nearest dollar). Finally, to find out how much profit Kim will make per week, we need to divide the gross profit by the number of weeks in a month: Profit per week = Gross profit / Number of weeks in a
Response:  Firstly, we know that John has 10 hectares of land and each hectare contains 100 ananas plants. So, in total, he has 10 x 100 = 1000 ananas plants. Now, we are told that John can harvest his ananas every three months. This means he will have four harvests in one year (3 x 4 = 12). Therefore, in one year, John will be able to harvest 12 x 1000 = 12,000 ananas fruits.
Response:  Firstly, Johnny has 500 packets of chocolate weighing 3 g each. He wants to distribute them equally among four boxes so that each box contains an equal number of packets and the total weight of packets in each box is as close to 3/4 of the total weight as possible. We can start by finding out how many packets he needs to add to each box to make their weights equal. Let x be the number of packets added to each box. Since there are 500 packets in total, the total weight of all the packets is 500 x 3 = 1500 grams. To make the weights of the four boxes equal, we need to divide this amount by 4. So, the weight of each box should be: 1500 / 4 = 375 grams. Now, let's find out how many packets of chocolate Johnny needs to add to each box to achieve this weight. We know that each packet weighs 3 grams, so: Number of packets = weight of box / weight per packet Number of packets = 375 / 3 = 125 packets Therefore, Johnny needs to add 125 packets of chocolate to each of his four boxes to make their weights equal.
Response:  Firstly, we know that in the first six hours of the day, Debra saw 30 bees coming out of her hive and then returning back. This means she observed 30 bees leaving the hive and then returning within the first six hours. Now, let's consider the next six hours. During this time, Debra noticed only half as many bees leaving the hive as compared to the previous six hours. So, if 30 bees left the hive during the first six hours, then 15 bees (half of 30) would have left the hive during the second set of six hours. Therefore, the total number of bees that left the hive during both sets of six hours is: 30 + 15 = 45 bees.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Britney paid $12 for her ticket and $10 for her child's ticket. So, in total, she spent $22. If she received $8 from the cashier, then she must have given him $22 - $8 = $14. Therefore, Britney gave the cashier $14.
Response:  We know that Charlie has three times as many friends on Facebook as James does. So if James has 12 friends on Facebook, then Charlie must have 3 x 12 = 36 friends on Facebook.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve is 3 miles away from school and Tim is 2 miles away from school. We also know that both of them are moving at different speeds - Steve is moving at 440 feet per minute, while Tim is moving at 264 feet per minute. To find out who will reach home first, we need to calculate their travel time. Travel Time = Distance / Speed So for Steve, Travel Time = 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 6.8 minutes For Tim, Travel Time = 2 miles / 264 ft/min = 7.6 minutes Now, we need to add the travel time to the current time to find out when each of them will reach home. Current Time = (let's assume) 3 PM So, for Steve, Home Time = 3 PM + 6.8 minutes = 3:06:8 PM And for Tim, Home Time = 3 PM + 7.6 minutes = 3:07:6 PM Therefore, based on our calculation, Steve will reach home before Tim. The exact time difference between their arrival times would be: 3:06:8 PM - 3:07:6 PM = 9 minutes
Response:  Firstly, we know that each tire costs $25 to fill up. So if three people came with their bicycles and filled up both tires, they would have spent $25 x 3 = $75 in total.  Next, we are told that one person came with a car and filled up all four tires, which means he spent $25 x 4 = $100.  Finally, we are given that the total amount earned that day was $75 + $100 = $175.  Therefore, the person who came with the car earned $175 - $75 = $100.
Response:  First, we know that Carl buys 10 packets of cookies, and each packet contains 6 cookies. So, in total, Carl buys 10 x 6 = 60 cookies. We also know that the price of each cookie is $0.10. Therefore, the total amount Carl spends on cookies is 60 x $0.10 = $6. Now, if Carl pays with a $10 note, he will receive $10 - $6 = $4 change.
Response:  First, Dave bought a package of French fries that contained x number of fries. Then, one hungry seagull snatched half of the package from him (so now he has x/2 fries left). Next, three crows took away three fries each, leaving Dave with (x/2) - 3 fries. Finally, a raccoon stole two more fries, so Dave is left with (x/2) - 3 - 2 = x/4 fries. Therefore, the number of French fries in the original package was x/4.
Response:  We know that there are 30 days in a month and each semester has 16 weeks. So, we can start by calculating how many days are in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so we can multiply 7 by 4 to get the total number of days in one month (since there are four weeks in a month). This gives us: Total days in a month = 7 x 4 = 28 days Now, let's calculate how many hours Kim spends in class each day. We know that she attends three 1-hour classes on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and two 2-hour classes on Thursday and Friday. So, if we add up all the hours she spends in class each day, we get: Hours spent in class per day = 3 x 1 hour + 2 x 2 hours = 3 + 4 = 7 hours Since there are 28 days in a month, we can multiply 7 hours by 28 to get the total number of hours Kim spends in class each month: Total hours spent in class per month = 7 hours x 28 days = 196 hours Finally, we can divide the total number of hours by the number of weeks in the semester to find out how many hours Kim spends in class each week: Total hours spent in class per week = 196 hours / 16 weeks = 12 hours per week Therefore, Kim spends 12 hours in class each week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Bill has 300 rolls of wire, and each roll is 4 inches long. So, the total length of all the rolls would be: 300 x 4 = 1200 inches or 100 feet. Next, we know that Bill has 120 chocolates, and each chocolate is 6 inches long. So, the total length of all the chocolates would be: 120 x 6 = 720 inches or 60 feet. Now, let's calculate the total time it takes for all the items to fit in the bag. We know that each bag can hold 2 feet of material, so we need to divide the total length of all the items by the length of each bag: 100 + 60 = 160 feet Total length of all items 2 feet per bag 80 bags needed To find out how many minutes it takes for all the items to fit in the bag, we need to multiply the number of bags by the time it takes to fill one bag: 80 bags x 2 minutes/bag = 160 minutes or 2 hours and 40 minutes. Therefore, if Bill were to pack all his materials together, it would take him approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes to do so.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total number of animals in the zoo is 200 + 400 + 100 = 700.  Secondly, we know that each animal needs to be fed every two months. Therefore, the total number of feeding cycles per year is 700 x 2 = 1400. Now, let's calculate how many kilograms of food are required for each cycle. For goats, it is 200 kg / 2 = 100 kg per cycle. For gorillas, it is 400 kg / 2 = 200 kg per cycle. And for buffaloes, it is 100 kg / 2 = 50 kg per cycle. So, the total amount of food required for one cycle is 100 + 200 + 50 = 350 kg. Since there are 1400 cycles per year, the total amount of food required per year is 350 kg x 1400 = 490,000 kg.
Response:  Firstly, Black runs for 15 minutes and covers a distance of 100 gaz (which is equal to 1 km). Now, let's calculate how far Kelly has run in those 15 minutes. We know that she ran ahead and then turned back, so we need to find out how much distance she covered while running ahead. According to the problem, Kelly ran ahead for 40 gaz (which is equal to 400 meters) before turning back. So, in total, Kelly ran for 40 + 100 = 140 gaz (or 1.4 kilometers). Since Black ran for 15 minutes and covered 100 gaz, he must have run at an average speed of 6.67 gaz per minute (100 / 15). Now, we can use this information to find out how far Kelly is behind Black. We know that Kelly ran for 140 gaz, but since she didn't want to go beyond Black's back, she had to turn back after covering 40 gaz. Therefore, the distance between Black and Kelly is 140 - 40 = 100 gaz (or 1 kilometer). So, Kelly is 1 kilometer behind Black.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Rafel bought four pencils at $1 each, so he spent $4 on pencils. Next, we know that he bought two notebooks at $4 each, so he spent another $8 on notebooks. Finally, we know that he bought a ring at $20, so he spent $20 on the ring. In total, Rafel spent $4 + $8 + $20 = $32.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 11 tadpoles in the pond. Secondly, we know that six of them have hidden under the lily pads, and two have hidden under the cattails. So, if we subtract the number of tadpoles hidden under the lily pads (6) and the number of tadpoles hidden under the cattails (2), we get: 11 - 6 - 2 = 3. Therefore, Fin can see three tadpoles in the pond.
Response:  Firstly, we know that on Monday (मंगलवार), there were 7 feet more water in the tank than on Sunday (सोमवार). So, if the water level on Sunday was x feet, then the water level on Monday would be x + 7 feet.  Next, we are given that on Wednesday (बुधवार), the water level is 2 feet less than it was on Monday. So, if the water level on Monday was x + 7 feet, then the water level on Wednesday would be x + 7 - 2 = x + 5 feet. Finally, we are asked for the height of the water in the tank on Wednesday. Therefore, our answer is: Height of water in the tank on Wednesday = x + 5 feet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Enakin caught 10 fish, which is equal to 3 times the number of fish caught by Loksin. Therefore, the number of fish caught by Loksin is 10/3 = 3. Now, we know that Enakin caught 6 whales and Loksin caught 5 less than Enakin. So, the number of whales caught by Loksin is 6 - 5 = 1. Finally, we know that Enakin caught 3 sharks, while Loksin caught 2 more than Enakin. So, the number of sharks caught by Loksin is 3 + 2 = 5. Therefore, the total number of fish, whales, and sharks caught by Enakin is 10 + 6 + 3 = 19, while the total number caught by Loksin is 3 + 1 + 5 = 9.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the price of each bag is $20. Secondly, we are told that every two months (i.e., half a year), the price increases by 20%. So, after three years (which is equal to 36 months), the price will have increased by 3 x 20% = 60%. Therefore, the price of one bag after three years will be: Price of one bag = $20 + (60% of $20) = $20 + $12 = $32.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are five red cars and three action figures in total. So, if each red car costs four dollars, then the total cost of all five red cars would be: 5 x $4 = $20 Now, let's calculate the cost of the action figures. We know that there are three action figures, and each one costs $5. Therefore, the total cost of all three action figures is: 3 x $5 = $15 Finally, we need to add up the cost of all the items to find out the grand total. So, we have: $20 + $15 = $35 The grand total of all the items in the room is $35.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jackie is charging $35 per hour for her services and she has worked for 3 hours. So, her total earnings from the client are: 3 x $35 = $105  Next, we need to subtract the cost of the materials used in the project. We know that the cost of materials is $90. So, we subtract $90 from $105 to get: $105 - $90 = $15 This means that Jackie has made a profit of $15 from this project.
Response:  Firstly, Elvira has to pay for the computer and its accessories. The total cost of the computer is €1090, which includes a screen, keyboard, mouse, scanner, CD burner, and printer. So, she needs to spend €1090 - €150 = €940 (€150 is the amount her family gave her as a gift). Now, let's calculate how much money Elvira will have left after buying all these things. She spent €940 on the computer and its accessories, so she will be left with €150 - €940 = €560 (she had €150 before spending any money). Therefore, Elvira will have €560 left after buying everything.
Response:  Firstly, Sandra needs to make 3 Spanish fans for her school project. Therefore, she will need to collect 9 sticks (as per the given ratio) for each fan. Since she has to make 15 fans, she will need to collect 9 x 15 = 135 sticks in total. Now, let's calculate how many times she will have to take care of her baby while collecting these sticks. We know that she takes care of her baby every time she goes to collect 9 sticks. So, we can say that she will have to take care of her baby 135 / 9 = 15 times.
Response:  We know that Seeth is two years older than Brooke. So if Brook's age is x, then Seeth's age would be x + 2. We also know that Seeth's age will be 28 in two years. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows: x + (x + 2) = 28...(1) Now solve for x using the above equation. x + x + 2 = 28 Combine like terms: 3x + 2 = 28 Subtract 2 from both sides: 3x = 26 Divide by 3: x = 8 Therefore, Brook's current age is 8 years old and Seeth's current age is 8 + 2 = 10 years old.
Response:  We know that Jimi has twice as much money as Ethel. So if Ethel has $8, then Jimi has $8 x 2 = $16.
Response:  We know that Pancho walks 20 miles in a day and 10 miles in a week (7 days). To find out how many miles he walks in a week, we need to multiply his daily distance by 7: 20 x 7 = 140 miles So, Pancho walks 140 miles in a week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each wardrobe has one jacket and three tops. So, if we assume that the price of each top is $25, then the total cost of all three tops would be $75 (3 x $25). Now, let's consider the price of the jacket. Since it costs three times as much as each top, the price of the jacket would be $75 x 3 = $225. Therefore, the total cost of each wardrobe would be $75 + $225 = $300.
Response:  Firstly, Jack sees 80 macaws with 8 pairs of wings each = 8 x 8 = 64 wings. Next, he sees 90 kiwis with 6 pairs of wings each = 6 x 9 = 54 wings. Finally, he sees 3 ostriches with 10 pairs of wings each = 10 x 3 = 30 wings. Therefore, in total, Jack sees 64 + 54 + 30 = 158 wings.
Response: 1) The age of Salee is three years more than twice the age of Dadi Lal. So we can write an equation based on this information: Salee's age = 2 x Dadi Lal's age + 3 2) We know that Dadi Lal's age is 8 years. So we can substitute this value into the first equation: Salee's age = 2 x 8 + 3 3) Now solve for Salee's age: Salee's age = 2 x 8 + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 years 4) Since there are four birds in total, and each bird has an age of 19 years, the total age of all four birds together would be: Total age = 4 x 19 = 76 years
Response:  First, we need to calculate Jessica's total monthly payments for each type of debt: Credit Card: $200 x 12 = $2400 Student Loan: $300 x 12 = $3600 Total Monthly Payments: $2400 + $3600 = $6000 Now, let's calculate how much Jessica needs to save each month to reach her goal of paying off at least 50% of her debts within one year: Goal: Pay off at least 50% of debts within one year To achieve this goal, Jessica needs to reduce her total monthly payments by half. So, she needs to save half of $6000, which is: Half of $6000 = $6000 / 2 = $3000 per month Therefore, Jessica needs to save $3000 per month for one year to reach her goal of paying off at least 50% of her debts within one year.
Response:  Firstly, Billie needs to chop 60 potatoes for her big family dinner party. She takes approximately 1 minute (60 seconds) to chop each potato. Therefore, she will spend around 60 minutes (1 hour) chopping all the potatoes. However, it takes only 5 seconds to peel each potato, so she will need to spend an additional 5 minutes (300 seconds) peeling all the potatoes. In total, Billie will spend around 75 minutes (1.25 hours) preparing the potatoes for her dinner party.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carlos and Juan sell each bottle of water for $3 and earn a profit of $2 per bottle. This means they earn $6 in total from each gallon sold (2 x $3 = $6). Now, let's calculate how much they spend on each gallon of water. We know that they buy each gallon for $0.50, so they spend $50 per gallon (1 x $0.50 = $50). Therefore, their net profit from selling one gallon of water is: Net Profit = Total Revenue - Cost Price Net Profit = $6 - $50 Net Profit = -$44 Since the net profit is negative, it means they incurred a loss of $44 per gallon. So, if they sold 25 gallons of water, their total loss would be: Total Loss = Number of Gallons x Net Profit Per Gallon Total Loss = 25 x (-$44) Total Loss = $1,100
Response:  We know that there were 240 Asian people in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. That means there were 160 non-Japanese Asians (240 - 80 = 160). Since we are told that the Chinese team had 60 members, we can conclude that there were 60 Chinese players among the 160 non-Japanese Asians. Therefore, there were 60 Chinese women in the Chinese team.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Javed spends 1/4th of his salary on household expenses and gives half of the remaining amount to his wife as pocket money. So, if he earns $6000 per month, he will spend: 1/4 x $6000 = $1500 on household expenses And give: Half of $6000 - $1500 = $3500 to his wife as pocket money Now, let's calculate how much Javed has left after all these expenses: Total Expenditure = $1500 + $3500 = $5000 Left with Javed = $6000 - $5000 = $1000 Therefore, Javed will have $1000 left after paying all his household expenses and giving pocket money to his wife.
Response: 1) The number of goats with Rani is 10 more than the number of goats with Bo. So, if Bo has x goats, Rani has x + 10 goats. 2) Each goat with Bo gives 4 kg of milk. So, in total, Bo's goats give 4x kg of milk. 3) Rani's goats give 10% more milk than Bo's goats. So, Rani's goats give (4x + 10%) kg of milk. Now we need to find out what percentage increase in milk production there will be when Rani's goats produce milk. To do this, we can use the formula for percent increase: Percentage increase = (new amount - old amount) / old amount x 100 We know that the new amount of milk produced by Rani's goats is (4x + 10%) kg, and the old amount is 4x kg. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: Percentage increase = [(4x + 10%) - 4x] / 4x x 100 % = [10%] / 4x x 100 % = 25% Therefore, there will be a 25% increase in milk production when Rani's goats produce milk.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Loyd earned in the first week. Since he worked for 5 hours per day and there are 7 days in a week, he worked a total of 5 x 7 = 35 hours in the first week. If he was paid $10 per hour, then his earnings for the first week would be: Earnings (first week) = 35 hours x $10/hour = $350. Now let's move on to the second week. He worked for 8 hours per day and there are 7 days in a week, so he worked a total of 8 x 7 = 56 hours in the second week. His earnings for the second week would be: Earnings (second week) = 56 hours x $10/hour = $560. To find out how much Loyd earned in both weeks combined, we add his earnings from each week: Total earnings = $350 + $560 = $910. So, Loyd earned $910 in two weeks.
Response: 1) The winner needs to get at least 3/4 of the total votes cast. 2) There are 80 students in the class who have voted. 3) We know that the winner got x votes. So, we can set up an equation: 3x = 75 (since 3/4 of 80 is 75) Now solve for x: x = 60 Therefore, the winner got 60 votes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Sandra wants to sell 4 times as many red roses as she has of white ones. So if she has 200 white roses, she would want to sell 800 red roses (200 x 4).  Secondly, we know that Fred wants to buy 5 times as many red roses as he has of blue ones. So if he has 150 blue roses, he would want to buy 750 red roses (150 x 5).  Now, let's find out how many red roses Sandra needs to deliver to Fred by 5 pm. We can do this by subtracting the number of blue roses Fred already has from the total number of red roses he wants to buy:  750 - 150 = 600.  Therefore, Sandra needs to deliver 600 red roses to Fred by 5 pm.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Geen is 2 years older than Mark. So, if Mark was 5 years younger than Jan, then Geen must be 5 + 2 = 7 years older than Jan. Now, we are given that Jan is 30 years old. Therefore, Geen would be 7 + 30 = 37 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each member of Team A will run their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. So if there are four members in Team A, they will complete their respective legs in 55, 110, 165, and 220 seconds (since 4 x 55 = 220). Now let's look at Team B. Their first runner will take 60 seconds to cover his 400 meters, while the second runner will be 3 seconds slower than the previous one, so he will take 63 seconds (60 + 3), and so on. Therefore, the total time taken by Team B to cover all four legs will be: 60 + 63 + 86 + 110 = 329 seconds. Since Team A takes lesser time to cover their distance, they will win the race. The difference between their times is: 220 - 329 = 109 seconds or approximately 1 minute and 49 seconds.
Response: 1. The number of roles played by Jerry is given as 5. 2. He has played three roles so far. So, we can say that Jerry has played 5 - 3 = 2 more roles. Therefore, the answer is 2.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jenna and her mother together have collected 20 seeds from their field.  Secondly, we are given that Jenna has collected half of what her mother has collected. So, if Jenna's mother has collected x seeds, then Jenna has collected x/2 seeds. Now, let's find out how many seeds they have collectively. We can do this by adding up the number of seeds collected by both Jenna and her mother. Therefore, the total number of seeds collected is: x + (x/2) = 2(x) Since Jenna and her mother have collected the same number of seeds, they have collected 20 seeds in total. Therefore, the answer is: x = 20
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 pigeons in each group and each pigeon has 6 bhuse (pieces of grain). So, if there are 160 bhuse in total, then the number of groups = 160 / 6 = 26 groups. Now, since there are 3 pigeons in each group, the total number of pigeons = 26 x 3 = 78 pigeons.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of interest that Mandie would have earned in 3 months. To do this, we can use the formula for simple interest: SI = P x R x T, where SI is the simple interest, P is the principal (the initial amount lent), R is the rate of interest per period (in this case, 2% per month), and T is the time period (in this case, 3 months). So, SI = $100 x 2% x 3/12 = $6. Now, we need to add the interest to the principal to find out how much Benedicte should pay back. Therefore, the total amount that Benedicte should pay back is: $100 + $6 = $106.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the farmer sells each bag of wheat at Rs. 20 per bag to the trader. So, if the trader buys x bags, he will pay Rs. 20x rupees to the farmer. Secondly, we know that the cost of transportation from the farm to the godown is Rs. 2 per bag. Therefore, the total amount paid by the trader to the farmer and the transporter is Rs. 20x + 2x = Rs. 22x rupees. Thirdly, we know that the trader sells each bag of wheat at Rs. 30 per bag. So, if he sells y bags, he will earn Rs. 30y rupees. Finally, we want to find out how many bags the trader needs to sell so that his profit is Rs. 400. We can set up an equation as follows: 22x = 30y → x = (400/30) → x = 13.33 bags.  There fore, the trader needs to sell 13.33 bags of wheat to make a profit of Rs. 400.
Response:  First, we know that three friends spent $20.25 in total on tickets for the event.  Second, we know that they spent less than $4.50 per person on food.  Third, we know that each ride cost $33.  If all expenses are divided equally among the three friends, then each friend paid: Total amount spent = $20.25 (tickets) + $4.50 (food) + $33 (rides) = $68.75. Since there were three friends, each friend paid: $68.75 / 3 = $22.92. Therefore, each friend paid $22.92.
Response:  John can do 2 tasks in 1 minute. So, he can do 2 x 3 = 6 tasks in 3 minutes. Therefore, John does 6 tasks in 3 minutes.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each bat needs to eat 3.5 pounds of food per week. Secondly, there are 10 bats in total. So, if we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10 bats, we get a total requirement of 35 pounds of food per week for all the bats.
Response:  Firstly, Tom plants 10 trees every year for 10 years, so he will have planted a total of 10 x 10 = 100 trees in 10 years.  Secondly, each year, he cuts down 2 trees, so after 10 years, he will have cut down 2 x 10 = 20 trees.  Now, we need to find out how many trees are left standing after 10 years. To do this, we subtract the number of trees cut down from the total number of trees planted: 100 - 20 = 80. So, there will be 80 trees left standing after 10 years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there were initially 18 green plastic flamingos in Su's yard. Then, on Sunday morning, the neighbors put back 18 red plastic flamingos they had taken away earlier. So, at this point, there were 36 plastic flamingos in total - 18 green and 18 red. Next, on Monday morning, the neighbors painted all the red plastic flamingos white, so now there were 18 white plastic flamingos and 18 green ones. Finally, on Wednesday afternoon, the neighbors added 18 more white plastic flamingos to the mix, bringing the total number of plastic flamingos to 36 + 18 = 54. Therefore, as of Wednesday afternoon, there were 54 plastic flamingos in Su's yard, with 18 of them being white and 36 being green.
Response:  Firstly, we know that the total amount available for purchasing paint is $20. Secondly, each can of paint costs $2, so we need to buy 10 cans (20/2 = 10) to spend all the money. Finally, since there are five different colors to choose from, we have 5 options for each can of paint, so in total, we have 5 x 10 = 50 options or choices.
Response:  We know that one pen costs $0.30 and we want to find out how much eight pens would cost.  So, if we multiply $0.30 by 8, we get:  $0.30 x 8 = $2.40 Therefore, eight pens would cost $2.40.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 40 rest houses and each rest house will receive 2 pounds of wheat. So, in total, 40 x 2 = 80 pounds of wheat will be distributed among all the rest houses. Now, if 200 pounds of wheat is to be distributed and only 80 pounds are being distributed, then the remaining amount of wheat that will not be used is: 200 - 80 = 120 pounds.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 23786 residents in Sodha city, including 8417 males and 9092 females. Next, we need to find out how many children are present in the city. We can do this by subtracting the total number of males and females from the total population. Total Population = Males + Females + Children Children = Total Population - (Males + Females) Children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092) Children = 23786 - 17519 Children = 6267 Therefore, there are 6267 children in Sodha city.
Response:  First month, Ilen had 20 Pokémon cards. Second month, she added three times as many cards as she had in the first month (3 x 20 = 60). Third month, she added twice as many cards as she had in the second month (2 x 60 = 120). So, Ilen has a total of 120 + 20 = 140 Pokémon cards.
Response:  Firstly, Mark writes 1000 words per week for each of two publishers, A and B. So he writes a total of 2000 words per week (1000 x 2). Now, let's calculate his earnings from Publisher A. Since he is paid Rs. 5 per word, his earnings from Publisher A would be: Earnings from Publisher A = Total words written for Publisher A x Price per word Earnings from Publisher A = 1000 x 5 = Rs. 5000 per week. Similarly, his earnings from Publisher B would be: Earnings from Publisher B = Total words written for Publisher B x Price per word Earnings from Publisher B = 1000 x 5 = Rs. 5000 per week. Therefore, Mark's total weekly earnings would be: Total weekly earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B Total weekly earnings = Rs. 5000 + Rs. 5000 = Rs. 10,000 per week.
Response:  We know that Baldur drinks 5 balloons of water in the morning and 6 balloons in the evening.  Each balloon contains 5 liters of water. So, how much water does Baldur drink per day?  To find out, we need to calculate the total amount of water he drinks each day.  In the morning, he drinks 5 x 5 = 25 liters of water.  And in the evening, he drinks 6 x 5 = 30 liters of water.  Therefore, the total amount of water Baldur drinks per day is: 25 + 30 = 55 liters.
Response: 1) First, we need to calculate John's weekly earnings. We know that he works for 7 days a week and earns $2000 per week. So, his weekly earnings are: 2000 x 7 = $14,000 per week. 2) Next, we need to calculate John's monthly earnings. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply his weekly earnings by 4 to get his monthly earnings: 14,000 x 4 = $56,000 per month. 3) Now, let's calculate John's yearly earnings. There are 12 months in a year, so we can multiply his monthly earnings by 12 to get his yearly earnings: 56,000 x 12 = $672,000 per year. 4) Finally, we need to calculate how much John earned in the first half of the year (from January to June). Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, we can multiply his yearly earnings by 6 to get his first-half earnings: 672,000 x 6 = $397,200. Therefore, John earned $397,200 in the first half of the year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Josi produces 5 tons of grapes per hectare and each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine. So, to calculate the total production of wine in Josi's farm, we need to first calculate the total production of grapes. Total Production of Grapes = Number of hectares x Production per Hectare Total Production of Grapes = 10 x 5 = 50 tons Now, we can calculate the total production of wine as follows: Total Production of Wine = Total Production of Grapes x Yield Per Ton of Grapes Total Production of Wine = 50 x 2 = 100 barrels Therefore, there are 100 barrels of wine produced in Josi's farm every year.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carl had 8 sandwiches in total for the week, and he consumed 3 sandwiches per day on average. Therefore, the number of days he had sandwiches = Total number of sandwiches / Number of sandwiches per day  = 8 / 3  = 2 days  Now, let's calculate how many slices of bread Carl used in each sandwich. We know that he used 2 slices of bread per sandwich, so the total number of slices of bread used by Carl = Number of sandwiches x Number of slices of bread per sandwich  = 2 days x 2 slices/sandwich  = 4 slices/day  Since Carl had sandwiches for 2 days, the total number of slices of bread he used = Total number of days x Total number of slices of bread per day  = 2 x 4  = 8 slices  So, Carl used 8 slices of bread in total.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jenet had 22 blue and 10 red balls.  Next, she bought 6 bags of green balls (each bag containing 9 balls) and 2 bags of yellow balls (each bag containing 6 balls). So, let's calculate how many green and yellow balls Jenet has now: Green Balls: 6 bags x 9 balls per bag = 54 balls Yellow Balls: 2 bags x 6 balls per bag = 12 balls Total number of balls Jenet has now: 22 blue + 10 red + 54 green + 12 yellow = 98 balls Therefore, there are 98 balls in total with Jenet.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Brinley has scored an average of 84 in her first five exams. So, to calculate her score in the sixth exam, we need to find out what she needs to get in order to maintain her average. We can do this by subtracting her average from each of her scores and then finding the total of these differences. This will give us the minimum number of marks she needs to obtain in the sixth exam to maintain her average.  To begin with, let's list down Brinley's scores in her first five exams:  Exam 1: 89 Exam 2: 71 Exam 3: 92 Exam 4: 100 Exam 5: 86 Now, let's subtract each score from Brinley's average (84) to find the difference for each exam:  Exam 1: 89 - 84 = 5 Exam 2: 71 - 84 = -13 Exam 3: 92 - 84 = 8 Exam 4: 100 - 84 = 16 Exam 5: 86 - 84 = 2 Next, we add up all these differences to find the total minimum number of marks Brinley needs to obtain in the sixth exam:  Total = 5 + (-13) + 8 + 16 + 2 = 30 Therefore, Brinley needs at least 30 marks in the sixth exam to maintain her average of 84.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Michael rode his bicycle for four hours every day for three weeks, which means he covered a total distance of: 4 hours x 3 weeks = 12 hours x 21 days = 252 km (since there are 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week) Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled by Michael during the entire period of four weeks. We know that he rode his bicycle for only two hours on the last week, so the total distance traveled during the fourth week is: 2 hours x 7 days = 14 km Therefore, the total distance traveled by Michael over the entire four-week period is: 252 km + 14 km = 266 km
Response:  We know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and there are 25 bars in the bag. So, the total weight of all the chocolate bars is: 25 x 40 = 1000 grams Now, we also know that each candy box contains 80 candies and each candy weighs half as much as one chocolate bar. Therefore, the total weight of all the candies in the bag is: 80 x (1/2) = 40 grams To find out how many kilograms of candies are in the bag, we divide the total weight of the candies by 1000 (since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram): 40 / 1000 = 0.04 kilograms or 400 grams So, the weight of the candies in the bag is approximately 400 grams.
Response:  First, we know that on Monday, he spent Rs 4 on 4 kekda and on Wednesday, he spent Rs 3 more than the previous day, so he spent Rs (4 + 3) = Rs 7 on Wednesday.  On Friday, he spent Rs 5 more than the previous day, so he spent Rs (7 + 5) = Rs 12 on Friday.  Therefore, in total, he spent Rs 4 + 7 + 12 = Rs 23 on kecks over three days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that each plate costs $6000. So, if there are 12 plates in total, then the total cost of all the plates would be: Total Cost = Number of Plates x Price per Plate Total Cost = 12 x $6000 Total Cost = $72,000 Now, we have been given that the price of 24 cups is $1200, so let's calculate how much one cup costs: One Cup Cost = Total Cost / Number of Cups One Cup Cost = $72,000 / 24 One Cup Cost = $3000 Therefore, the cost of one cup is $3000.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that Sara has $10 with her before she starts buying anything.  Secondly, she spends $30 on the jacket and $20 on each pair of shoes (since there are two pairs), so in total, she spends $30 + $20 + $20 = $70.  Now, let's calculate how many times she will have to lend money from her parents.  We know that her parents give her $4 per week as allowance, so if we divide $70 by $4, we get:  
$70 / $4 = 17.5 weeks  Therefore, Sara will have to lend money from her parents for 17.5 weeks ($10 x 17.5 = $175) to buy the jacket and shoes."
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 3 lal murgiyon (red hens) and 5 safed murgiyon (white hens) in total. Each red hen lays 3 eggs per day, so there will be 3 x 3 = 9 eggs from the red hens daily. Each white hen lays 5 eggs per day, so there will be 5 x 5 = 25 eggs from the white hens daily. In total, there will be 9 + 25 = 34 eggs per day. Now, if there are twice as many white hens as red hens, then the number of white hens is 2 x 5 = 10. So, there are 10 white hens and 3 red hens.
Response:  First, we know that the distance traveled by the train is 1.5 miles in one hour. So, if it travels for 3 hours, it will cover a total distance of: Distance = Speed x Time Distance = 3 miles/hour x 3 hours Distance = 9 miles Therefore, the train covers a total distance of 9 miles in 3 hours.
Response:  First day, there were 100 customers and each customer spent $100, so total revenue was $10,000 (100 x $100). Second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so there were 150 customers in total (100 + 50), and each customer spent $100 again, so total revenue was $15,000 (150 x $100). Third day, there were 500 customers in total (50 x 10), and each customer spent $100 again, so total revenue was $50,000 (500 x $100). So, the total revenue for three days is $65,000 ($10,000 + $15,000 + $50,000).
Response:  Firstly, we know that there is a total of 8 gallons in both big and small pools combined. This means that the big pool has 4 times as much water as the small pool. So, if the small pool contains x gallons of water, the big pool will contain 4x gallons of water. Now, we are told that the small pool contained half of the water in the big pool 4 minutes ago. Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool at that time was (1/2) \* 4x = 2x gallons. Since 2x gallons were transferred from the small pool to the big pool, the current amount of water in the small pool is 0. Thus, the answer is 0 gallons.
Response:  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and belt together:  Shoes: $320 x 8 = $2560 Belt: $32 x 1 = $32 Total Cost: $2592 Now, let's divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $2592 / $8/hour = 324 hours So, she would have to work for approximately 324 hours (or about 40 days) to earn enough money to buy the shoes and belt.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jenet received $2000 as an advance and had to return 10% of it as extra. So, she has to pay back $200 (10% of $2000) to her employer. Now, let's calculate how much she will have left after returning the advance amount. Total amount paid by Jenet = $2000 + ($200 x 12 months) = $2000 + $2400 = $4400 Total amount earned by Jenet in 12 months = $4400 - $200 = $4200 Therefore, Jenet will have $4200 left after returning the advance amount of $2000.
Response:  We know that there are four gulab in the flowerbed and each gulab has seven daaliya (petals). So, we can start by finding out how many petals there are in total. Total number of petals = 4 x 7 = 28 petals Now, we need to find out how many flowers there are in the flowerbed. Since each gulab is a type of flower, we can simply divide the total number of petals by the number of gulab to get the number of flowers. Number of flowers = Total number of petals / Number of gulab Number of flowers = 28 / 4 Number of flowers = 7 flowers Therefore, there are seven flowers in the flowerbed.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Adrian is three times as old as Harry. So, if Harry is x years old, Adrian would be 3x years old. Now, we are given that Harry is 21 years old. Therefore, Adrian's age can be calculated as follows: Adrian's age = 3(21) = 63 years.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Naomi scored 68 marks and Brianne scored 17 more than Naomi. So, Brianne scored 68 + 17 = 85 marks. Next, we know that Jojo scored less than Brianne by 10 marks. Therefore, Jojo scored 85 - 10 = 75 marks.
Response:  Firstly, Carmen took 10 minutes to complete each crossword puzzle and Sudoku puzzle. So, for 3 crossword puzzles, she spent 3 x 10 = 30 minutes. For 8 Sudoku puzzles, she spent 8 x 10 = 80 minutes. In total, she spent 30 + 80 = 110 minutes or 1 hour and 50 minutes.
Response:  We know that the tank has a capacity of 120 liters and Selin took out 90 liters of water from it to fill her small bucket. So, the amount of water left in the tank is: 120 - 90 = 30 liters. Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank.
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total area of the garden that will be covered with flowers. We know that Andy wants to cover 90% of the garden with flowers and 40 cm of space should be left between each flower. So, the total area of the garden that can be covered with flowers is: Total Area = (100 - 40) x 90% of the garden area = (100 - 40) x 0.9 x 3000 sq m = 25200 sq m Now, we need to calculate how many flowers are required to cover this area. To do so, we need to divide the total area by the area of one flower. Let's assume that the size of each flower is approximately square-shaped with a side length of 10 cm. Therefore, the area of one flower is: Area of One Flower = Side Length^2 = 10^2 = 100 sq cm Since we have 25200 sq m of area to cover, we can calculate the number of flowers as follows: Number of Flowers = Total Area / Area of One Flower = 25200 / 100 = 252 flowers
Response:  First year, company spends $15,000 on advertising and then in second year, they spend half of that amount, which is $7,500. So, total expenditure on advertising for two years = $15,000 + $7,500 = $22,500.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Carlos earns $30 per hour and Benny earns $18 per hour.  Secondly, we know that Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benny uses it for 5 hours.  Now, let's calculate how much each of them will charge for their services:  For Carlos:  3 hours x $30/hour = $90  For Benny:  5 hours x $18/hour = $90  Since both Carlos and Benny are charging the same amount ($90), they will split the total cost equally between themselves.  Therefore, the final answer is:  $90 / 2 = $45 Each
Response: 1) The journey from Enderby to Rochester takes half a day by car (6 hours). 2) The bus journey from Enderby to Rochester takes 3 days. Therefore, if we take the bus from Enderby to Rochester and then return by car, our total travel time will be: 6 hours + 3 days = 9 days.
Response:  Firstly, we know that James has 30 agni cards, 20 ghas cards and 40 jal cards.  Secondly, he loses 8 agni cards and buys 14 ghas cards. Now, let's calculate the percentage of chance that one of his chosen cards will be an agni card.  To do this, we need to find out how many agni cards are left after losing 8 cards.  There are 30 - 8 = 22 agni cards left.  Next, we need to divide the number of remaining agni cards by the total number of cards he has: 22 / (30 + 20 + 40) = 22 / 90 = 1/4 or 25%.  So, there is a 25% chance that one of James' chosen cards will be an agni card.
"Response:  First, we know that the cost of the meal is $6.50.  Then, there is an additional charge of $2.00 for extra meat, $1.00 for extra cheese, and $1.00 for avocado.  So, the total cost before discounts is:  
$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $9.50  Next, there is a discount of $3.00 for using their gift card, so the new total is:  
$9.50 - $3.00 = $6.50  Finally, there is a remaining balance of $5.00 on the gift card, which can be used towards future purchases.  Therefore, the final answer is:  
$6.50 - $3.00 = $5.00"
Response:  Kalindi can do 4 tukti in one minute, and her mother can do half of that, i.e., 2 tukti in one minute. So, together they can do 4 + 2 = 6 tukti in one minute. To complete the entire paheli (360 tukti), it will take them: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes. Therefore, Kalindi and her mother will take 60 minutes to complete the entire paheli.
Response:  Firstly, we know that 120 children were born in a farm and after two months, they were shifted to a new place where they grew for three months. So, out of 120 children, only 90 survived (120 x 3/2 = 90). Now, let's calculate how many til (oilseeds) were produced. We are given that 30% of the surviving children were ready to harvest oilseeds. So, 30% of 90 is equal to 27 (90 x 30/100 = 27). Therefore, there were 27 til ready for harvesting.
Response:  First, we need to calculate how much Mark spends on each car. We know that he pays $20,000 for each car and adds a 10% commission, which is $2,000 (10% of $20,000). So, the total amount Mark spends on each car is: Total cost = $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000 Now, let's calculate the total amount Mark spends on all 12 cars: Total cost of all cars = 12 x $22,000 = $264,000 Finally, we can calculate the additional $1000 fee per car as follows: Additional fee per car = $1000 x 12 = $12,000 Therefore, the total amount Mark spends on all 12 cars, including the additional fee, is: Total cost of all cars with fee = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000
Response: 1) On Monday, Kaili scored 5 more goals than Robert, who scored 20 goals. So, Kaili scored 20 + 5 = 25 goals on Monday. 2) On Wednesday, Kaili scored twice as many goals as she scored on Monday. Therefore, Kaili scored 2 x 25 = 50 goals on Wednesday. 3) Now we need to find out how many goals Kaili scored on Tuesday (since we know she scored less than 50). We can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem: Let X be the number of goals Kaili scored on Tuesday. Since Kaili scored 5 more goals than Robert on Monday, Robert scored 20 - 5 = 15 goals on Monday. Therefore, Kaili scored X + 15 goals on Tuesday. Also, since Kaili scored twice as many goals as she scored on Monday on Wednesday, she scored 2(X + 15) = 2X + 30 goals on Wednesday. Now we have two equations and two unknowns (X and Y). Can you use these equations to solve for X and Y?
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are 50 chickens in the coop and each lays an average of half a dozen eggs per day. So, the total number of eggs laid per day is: 50 x 0.5 = 25 eggs per day. Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid in a week (7 days): 25 x 7 = 175 eggs per week. Finally, to find out the total number of eggs laid in a month (30 days), we can multiply the weekly egg production by 4: 175 x 4 = 700 eggs per month.
Response:  There are 36 penguins in total.  Of those, 18 swim in the ocean and dive into it. That leaves us with 18 penguins who go inside the cave to eat their dinner. So, there are still 18 penguins taking a bath in the snow.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and each tomato has a diameter of 5 cm. So, he consumes 6 x 5 = 30 cm of tomatoes daily. Now, if a bell produces 3 tomatoes per week, then it will produce 3 x 4 = 12 tomatoes in a month (since there are 4 weeks in a month). Therefore, Steve would need 12 x 30 = 360 cm of tomatoes every month to satisfy his hunger for tomatoes.
Response:  Firstly, John wants to ensure that each of his 20 friends gets at least 4 slices of pizza. So, he needs to order an odd number of pizzas. Since there are only 8 slices in each pizza, he can't order a whole number of pizzas. Therefore, he needs to order (20/4) = 5 pizzas.
Response: 1) Ram has 5 pens and he uses each pen to write one letter. So, in total, he can write 5 letters with his current set of pens. 2) If he buys 25 new pens, he will have a total of 30 pens (5 old pens + 25 new pens). 3) With these 30 pens, he can write 30 letters (since each pen can be used once). 4) Therefore, if Ram writes all 30 letters using his entire collection of pens, he will have no more pens left for future use. In other words, he will have exhausted all his pens. So, the number of letters he can write is limited by the number of pens he has.
Response:  First, Johnny invested $20 in a scheme that promised to triple his money in one year. This means he would get $60 back after one year ($20 x 3).  Next, he lost $10 in some other investment or expense. So, after one year, he has $50 left ($60 - $10).  Now, let's calculate how much he made overall. He started with $20 and ended up with $50, so he made $30 ($50 - $20).
Response: 1. Jessica is five years older than Marie. So if Marie is x years old, then Jessica is (x + 5) years old. 2. We know that Jessica is 20 years old. So we can set up an equation: (x + 5) = 20. 3. Solve for x to find Marie's age: x = 15. Therefore, Marie is 15 years old and Jessica is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
Response:  Firstly, we know that there are three doors - A, B, and C. And out of these, 30% students went out through door A, 3/5th of the remaining students (i.e., 60%) went out through door B, and the rest 20% (i.e., 400) went out through door C. Now, let's calculate the number of students who went out through each door: Door A: 30% of 1000 = 300 students Door B: 60% of (1000 - 300) = 60% of 700 = 420 students Door C: 20% of 1000 = 200 students Therefore, the total number of students who went out through all the three doors is: 300 + 420 + 200 = 920 students So, the number of students who went out through door C is: 200.
"Response:  Firstly, we know that James has more than 6 candies. Secondly, John has half as many candies as Robert. Finally, we are given that John has 54 candies. So, let's start by writing down what we know: 1) James > 6 (more than 6 candies) 2) John = Half of Robert (since John has half as many candies as Robert) 3) John = 54 (given) Now, we can use equation 2 to substitute for ""Half of Robert"" in equation 1: John = Half of Robert John = Half(James) Using equation 3, we can find out what Half of Robert is: Half of Robert = 54 / 2 Half of Robert = 27 Since John has half as many candies as Robert, John must have 27 candies. Therefore, John has 27 candies more than 6 candies, which means John has 33 candies (27 + 6). So, the correct answer is: John has 33 candies more than 6 candies."
Response: 1) Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book. 2) Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own. So, in total, they will have read three books (two from their own collection and one from the other person's). Therefore, the number of books they will have read is 3.
Response: 1) The friend writes one letter per week (7 days). 2) Each letter is 5 pages long. 3) Therefore, in one week, he can write 7 x 5 = 35 pages. 4) Since there are 6 minutes to write each page, he spends 35 x 6 = 210 minutes or 3 hours and 50 minutes writing letters every week.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Jess has 1000 minutes of phone plan per month. Secondly, she spends 15 minutes every day talking to her boss, which is equal to 450 minutes (15 x 30 days) in total. Thirdly, she spends an additional 300 minutes talking to other people, which brings the total number of minutes spent on calls to 750 minutes (450 + 300). Now, let's calculate how many minutes are left for Jess. We can do this by subtracting the total number of minutes spent on calls from the total number of minutes available in her phone plan. So, 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes. Therefore, there are 250 minutes left for Jess in this month.
Response:  Firstly, we know that Grifin had 24 fries and Kail took 5 from him. So, Grifin has 19 fries left (24 - 5 = 19).  Next, Billie took 3 more fries from Grifin, so now Grifin has 16 fries left (19 - 3 = 16).  Then, Jinger gave Grifin one mutthi full of fries, which is equal to 8 fries (since each mutthi contains 8 fries). So, Grifin now has 24 fries in total (16 + 8 = 24). Finally, Colbie took 3 fries from Grifin, leaving him with 21 fries (24 - 3 = 21). Therefore, Jinger gave Grifin 8 fries.
"Response:  We know that there are 4 fish in one aquarium and 32 fish in another aquarium.  If we compare the number of fish in both aquariums, we see that the number of fish in the second aquarium is twice the number of fish in the first aquarium.  So, if there are x fish in the first aquarium, then there will be 2x fish in the second aquarium.  Now, let's find out what x is.  We know that the total number of fish in both aquariums is 4 + 32 = 36.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:  
x + 2x = 36  Simplifying the equation:  
3x = 36  Dividing both sides by 3:  
x = 12  So, there are 12 fish in the first aquarium."
Response:  Firstly, we need to calculate the total amount of money that Jen has spent on makeup for all five weeks. We know that she spends $250 per day and works for six hours (i.e., 360 minutes) each day. Therefore, her daily expense on makeup is: Total Daily Expense = $250 x 360 minutes/day = $90,000 per week. Since she works for five weeks, her total expenditure on makeup would be: Total Makeup Expenditure = $90,000 x 5 weeks = $450,000. Now, let's calculate the percentage commission that Jen earned from the film. We know that she charged $250 per hour and worked for four hours (i.e., 240 minutes) each day. Therefore, her daily earnings from the film are: Daily Film Earnings = $250 x 240 minutes/day = $60,000 per day. Since she worked for five days, her total earnings from the film would be: Total Film Earnings = $60,000 x 5 days = $300,000. Finally, we can calculate the percentage commission that Jen earned as follows: Commission Percentage = ($300,000 - $450,000) / $450,000 x 100% = 22% So, Jen earned a commission of 22%. To find out how much she paid in taxes, we need to subtract the commission from her total income. Total Income = $450,000 + $300,000 = $750,000 Subtracting the commission, we get: Taxable Income = $750,000 - $99,000 (22% of $450,000) = $651,000 Finally, we can calculate the amount of tax that Jen needs to pay using the applicable tax rate. Assuming a tax rate of 30%, the tax liability would be: Tax Liability = $651,000 x 30% = $1
Response:  Firstly, we know that Isabell spent $12 on cake, $43 on gifts, $15 on decorations, and $4 on invitations. Therefore, her total expenditure on party preparation is:  $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 = $74 Now, we are told that she divided the remaining amount equally among her three guests, including her parents. So, if there were three guests in total (including her parents), each guest would have received one-third of the remaining amount, which is: $74 / 3 = $24.67 per person Therefore, each guest paid $24.67, including Isabell's parents.
Response:  First, we know that each bag of wheat costs Rs. 1.50 per pound. So if there are 4 bags, the total cost would be: 4 x 1.50 = 6 pounds x Rs. 1.50 = Rs. 9. Now, since each bag weighs 50 pounds, the total weight of all four bags is: 4 x 50 = 200 pounds. Therefore, the total cost of all four bags is: Rs. 9 x 200 = Rs. 1800.
Response:  First, we know that Somvar (Sun) has eaten 4 times more than his sister on Monday (Mangalwar). So, if his sister ate x cups of kheer, he ate 4x cups of kheer.  Next, we know that on Tuesday (Somvar), Sun ate twice as much as his sister. So, if his sister ate x cups of kheer, he ate 2x cups of kheer.  Now, let's calculate how many calories Sun consumed in total. We know that each cup of kheer contains 200 calories, so:  On Monday (Mangalwar): 4x x 200 = 800 calories On Tuesday (Somvar): 2x x 200 = 400 calories Total: 800 + 400 = 1200 calories Therefore, Sun consumed 1200 calories more than his sister over the two days.
