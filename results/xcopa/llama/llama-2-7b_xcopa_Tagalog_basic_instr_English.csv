"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang bagay ay nakabalot sa bubble wrap,"" option A (It's too heavy) is the more likely cause. The word ""nakabalot"" in Filipino means ""heavy."" Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: It's too heavy."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Binuksan ko ang aking mga bulsa,"" option A (Nakuha ko ang isang tiket na stub) is the more likely outcome. The word ""binuksan"" means to collect or gather, so it suggests that the speaker has taken something small like a ticket stub. Option B (Natagpuan ko ang isang baril) means I found a gun, which is a much larger and more significant item than a ticket stub. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the termites have invaded the house (Option A). The phrase ""Napasok ang mga termitas sa bahay"" implies that the termites have entered the house, rather than simply eating wood outside of it. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Inakusahan sila ng patrol agent na nag-smuggling) is the more likely outcome. The premise states that the group of travelers are being accused by a patrol agent of smuggling, indicating that they may be in trouble with the law for their actions. Option A (Sinuri ng patrol agent ang kanilang mga pasaporte) does not necessarily imply any negative consequences for the travelers, as it only mentions that the patrol agent confiscated their passports without providing further context or detail.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Isang bakasyon iyon) is the more likely cause of why there are no records in the office. This is because a bakasyon or vacation implies that the employee was not present in the office for an extended period of time, which could explain why there are no records available. On the other hand, tag-init na iyon means ""it's already over"" or ""it's been taken care of,"" which does not provide any explanation as to why there are no records in the office. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wala nang lakas ang dalaga,"" it is more likely that Option A (Naglaro siya ng dam) is the correct answer. The phrase ""wala nang lakas"" suggests a lack of strength or power, which could be used to describe someone who is weak or feeble. This fits with the idea of a person playing a game of dam, which requires physical strength and endurance. On the other hand, Option B (Tumalon siya sa lubid) does not fit as well with the premise, as it means ""She jumped into the river."" While this could potentially involve some level of physical exertion, it does not necessarily require the same level of strength or endurance as playing a game of dam. Therefore, based on the given premise, Option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Lumabas siya sa linya) is the more likely cause because it contradicts the statement that ""Nawala ang posisyon ng babae sa hanay."" If she had already left the line, then there would be no need to speculate about other people entering the line. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Nag-sweat ang sanggol sa kanyang bib"" - is the correct answer. The phrase ""pinilit ng dalaga ang kanyang ilong"" suggests that the baby is being forced or coerced to drink from its bottle, which could lead to discomfort or irritation for the baby, causing it to sweat. This is a plausible explanation for why the baby might be sweating, whereas the other option does not make as much sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sumaya ang mga tagapakinig sa musika) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""sumaya"" means to enjoy or appreciate something, so it suggests that the listeners are enjoying the music. In contrast, Option B (Ang mga tagapakinig ay may kagalang-galang na nakikinig nang tahimik) does not convey a sense of enjoyment or appreciation, but rather a state of being quiet or still. Therefore, Option A is the better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Nagdala ang dalaga ng mansanas sa guro) is more likely to happen because it implies that the girl will be giving her teacher a gift of mangoes as a token of appreciation for his teaching. This is a common practice in many cultures where students show their gratitude to their teachers by giving them gifts or tokens of appreciation. Option A (Ang batang babae ay nanatili pagkatapo ng paaralan para sa pag-aaresto) does not make sense in this context since there is no reason why a young girl would be arrested after school.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ang kanilang tagapayo sa kampo ay nagkuwento sa kanila ng kuwento ng multo) is the more likely cause of their fright. The mention of a ""multo"" or ghost in the premise suggests that the children were scared by something supernatural or paranormal, which aligns with Option A. On the other hand, Option B (Nag-toast sila ng marshmallows sa apoy ng kampo) does not provide any logical explanation for why the children would be frightened. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nawala siya sa pag-iisip) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""Naigo ang ulo"" suggests that something has happened to the man's head or mind, implying a loss of consciousness or confusion rather than gaining an extra brain. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premises, option A (Ang aking bank account ay walang laman) is more likely to be the cause of why my salary was not refunded. This is because if there is no money in the bank account, it would be impossible for the bank to process a refund. On the other hand, option B (Nakatanggap ako ng pagtaas ng suweldo) does not provide any information that would explain why the salary was not refunded.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ini-delete niya ang spam) is the more likely outcome. The fact that the man's inbox is full of spam suggests that he may not have the time or inclination to sort through it all and delete individual messages. Instead, he may opt for a quick solution like deleting everything without reading them first.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang marinero ay nasa kuwarentena,"" it is more likely that he is under quarantine because of his illness. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (binanggit niya ito sa kaniyang sarili) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""naalala ng dalaga"" suggests that the person forgot to write down the code, rather than simply neglecting to do so. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Inibuhos ko ang tubig sa baso,"" option A is the correct answer because it implies that the water evaporates into the air. Therefore, the statement ""Ang tubig ay nagpahinga sa aking uhaw"" (The water is evaporating into my sweat) makes sense. Option B does not make sense as there is no evidence to suggest that the basin becomes full of water."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Nais niyang suportahan ang kaniyang kaibigan) is more likely. The phrase ""nanatiling tahimik"" suggests that the speaker is in a state of calmness or tranquility, indicating that they are not actively thinking about what to say but rather passively receiving the words of their friend. This aligns with Option A, where the speaker wants to support their friend instead of actively considering what to say."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nadama kong may kasalanan ako) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""ako ang may kasalanan"" implies that the speaker believes they are responsible for the accident, rather than blaming others or filing complaints."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ang kadena ay nakabalot sa isang gulong) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""nakabalot"" suggests that something heavy or solid has fallen onto another object, which in this case is a chain. This implies that the chain was broken due to external force applied directly to it, rather than through an electronic malfunction or other internal issue. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why the chain broke."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Napagod na sila sa pagtatalo) is the correct answer. The passage states that nagpasiya ang mag-asawa na kumpromisyo, indicating that they are experiencing conflict or disagreement. This suggests that they have been arguing or fighting with each other, which can lead to feelings of exhaustion and frustration. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why their marriage has become strained.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Nag-upa siya ng isang tagapangasiwa ng kampanya) will occur. The phrase ""tumakbo para sa pampublikong opisina"" suggests that the woman is running for a public office, and therefore, she would need to campaign and gather support from the public. It is unlikely that she would be arrested by the court without any prior warning or opportunity to defend herself."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Naglagay siya ng mainit na datos sa kaniyang maleta) is the most likely outcome. The use of the word ""mainit"" to describe the temperature suggests that it was hot outside, making it more likely for the man to have packed lightweight and breathable clothing in his bag rather than a heavy one."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B - Nagkamali siya - occurred. The student made a mistake in answering the question.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (May alikabok sa kaniyang mga mata) is the more likely cause of why the man's eyes are red. This is because ""nag-uulan"" means to rain or storm, which could be causing the man's eyes to become red due to excessive watering or irritation from the rain. Option B (Nagsuot siya ng mga salamin sa mata) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of the man putting anything on his eyes."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Naawa sa kaniya ang kaniyang kalaban) is more likely. The phrase ""naawa"" implies a feeling of compassion or pity towards one's opponent, which suggests that the player may have developed some emotional connection with their rival despite winning against them in five games. This contrasts with option A, where the player would be punished for their victory, which does not align with the sentiment expressed in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nakuha niya ang estudyante na nag-iimpake) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the teacher failed the student who did not study, indicating that the student's lack of preparation was the reason for their failure. Option B (Mali ang mga sagot ng estudyante) does not provide any information about why the student failed the examination.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nawala ang boses ko) is the more likely cause of the speaker's inability to speak clearly. The phrase ""nagpahinga ako"" suggests that the speaker has lost their voice or has become hoarse, which can be caused by various factors such as overuse, illness, or injury. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Inilagay ko ito sa microwave) is the more likely cause of the frozen food thawing out. The premise states that the frozen food was left outside for an extended period of time, which could have caused it to thaw out. However, if the food was placed in a microwave oven, it would be heated from inside, causing it to thaw out faster than if it were simply left outside. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Gusto niyang magpahinga) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the employee has been feeling unwell for a while now, which could indicate fatigue or burnout from overwork. It does not mention any physical discomfort or pain in the legs, which would be more consistent with Option A (Cramp in the legs). Therefore, it is more likely that the employee's desire to take a break is related to their overall well-being rather than a specific physical issue.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she fell off the diving board (Option B) than running around the pool deck (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is the more likely cause. The sentence ""Ang pelikula ay nakatanggap ng hindi magandang mga pagsusuri"" suggests that the movie has received negative reviews, which could lead to a decrease in ticket sales. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will be ignored by people (Option B). The phrase ""Nawala ang timbang"" suggests that he has become invisible or unnoticeable to others, which could lead to him being ignored or overlooked by those around him. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sumakay siya sa isang lubid) is the more likely cause of the effect described in the statement. The phrase ""Nag-type siya ng isang liham"" does not fit with the context of the sentence and would not logically lead to the stated effect. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The artist juggling while riding a unicycle is an example of acrobatics, specifically swinging from one point to another using a trapeze or other equipment. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nawala ang pasensya ko,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct. The phrase ""pinahintay ako"" suggests that someone has been waiting for something or someone, which aligns with the idea of being patiently awaiting an arrival. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nag-unlad sila ng mga sandatang nuklear) is the more likely outcome. The premise suggests that the countries are in a state of conflict, which could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. This is a much more severe consequence than a simple agreement or disagreement between nations.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Siya'y naging pagod) will occur. The phrase ""Kinuha ng lalaki"" implies that someone took something from him, which could cause him to feel tired or exhausted. This is in line with the meaning of ""pagod,"" which refers to a state of weariness or exhaustion. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B (Nasugatan ang kanyang tuhod) is the correct answer because ""Ang babae ay bumagsak sa sofa"" implies that the woman fell or was pushed onto the sofa, resulting in injury to her head."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pinipis ng baby ang balon,"" it is more likely that the ball will pop than it will fall. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Nag-pop ang balon."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nakipag-usap ako sa kanya,"" it is more likely that Option A - ""Ang peach ay na-bruise"" - is correct. The bruised peach would be an appropriate consequence of having a conversation with someone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naging malagkit ang aking mga kamay,"" it is more likely that Option B (Ako'y mahilig sa matamis) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""malagkit"" suggests that something is not right or functioning properly, which aligns with the idea of being fond of something sweet like donuts. Therefore, Option B is the most likely choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A - ""Nagbukas ang pinto"" (The window broke) occurred. This is because breaking a window would be a physical action that could cause damage to the car's exterior, whereas locking the door might not necessarily result in any visible damage."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang mga produkto ay sinuri para sa pagtiyak ng kalidad) is the more likely cause of the boycott. The premise suggests that the activists are protesting against the quality of the products rather than their production process or use of child labor. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Isang daga ang lumabas sa butas) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""Nag-drill ako ng butas"" implies that something was inserted into the hole, so it's unlikely that nothing would come out of it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nagdiborsiyo ang kaniyang kapatid na babae) is the more likely cause. The use of the word ""nainggit"" suggests that the woman is feeling resentful or jealous towards her sister, which could lead to a confrontation or argument. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nagbubo ako ng alak sa akin kamiseta,"" option B (Binago ko ang aking shirt) is the most likely answer because it best completes the sentence based on its meaning."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sinuri ng customer ang wallet niya) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""sinuri ng customer"" implies that something was taken from the customer's wallet without their permission, which could be a result of theft or mismanagement. Option B (Binigyan siya ng customer ng pera) does not provide any context for how the money was obtained, making it less likely as a cause of the problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Binigyan siya ng pera ng mga tao."" The premise states that the musician in the street was able to earn money from the people, indicating that they were generous with their tips or donations. This suggests that the musician's performance had a positive impact on the audience, leading them to show appreciation through financial support."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Naawa siya sa kaniyang mga magulang) is the correct answer. The phrase ""umiiyak ang batang lalaki"" suggests that the boy is crying, and the reason for his tears could be due to his affection towards his parents or guardians. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation than option B (Panahon na ng meryenda), as there is no indication in the premise that the time of day has anything to do with the boy's emotional state."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ang piloto ay lumakad palayo sa bagyo) is the correct answer. The phrase ""lumakad palayo"" means to be blown away or swept off one's feet by a strong wind or storm, which suggests that the pilot may be in danger of being carried away by the hurricane. Therefore, option A is more likely than option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Naging kulay ang mga dahon) is the more likely effect. The phrase ""Ang puno ay nag-aalis"" suggests that something is being removed or taken away from the tree, rather than simply changing color. Therefore, it is more likely that the leaves will fall off the tree rather than staying put."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nagdesisyon siyang maglaro ng card kasama ang kaniyang kapatid na babae) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the negative connotation of the word ""masamang"" in the premise. The idea of playing a game that involves money with one's sister who is in a difficult situation is not something that would be considered appropriate or respectful in many cultures. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the information given."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Pinasara ng kaniyang ama ang Kotse sa isang Gas Station) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the idea of punishment or consequence for not following instructions given by a parent/authority figure. The other option (giving an soda to the child) does not necessarily imply any negative consequences for disobedience.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tumalon ang isda sa tangke) is the most likely outcome. The premise states that the baby will eat the fish in the tank, indicating that the fish will be brought closer to the baby's mouth for consumption. Option B (Lumangoy ang isda patungo sa pagkain) does not align with this scenario as it implies that the fish will move away from the baby towards food, rather than being brought closer to the baby's mouth for eating. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A - Binago niya ang kaniyang pagkakapareho sa partido. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the woman will change her political views rather than protesting. The phrase ""binago niya"" means ""she changed"" in Filipino, indicating that she altered her perspective on politics. Protesting, on the other hand, implies a more active and public display of opposition, which may not be as feasible or practical for an individual to do alone. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Inibuhos ko ang drain cleaner dito) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the given situation. The speaker wants to unclog a clogged drain, so using a drain cleaner would be the most appropriate solution. Option A (Binuksan ko ang gripo) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a grill or any other object that could be used to unclog the drain.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dumating ang tren sa istasyon) is the most likely cause of the passengers getting off at the station. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Naglagay siya ng selyo sa sobre) occurred because the phrase ""pinipilit ng lalaki"" implies force or coercion, which could lead to the man placing something inside the woman's bag without her consent."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Nag-enjoy sila sa pakikisama ng isa't isa) is the correct answer. The premise highlights the enjoyment of each other's company as the reason for their friendship, which suggests a deeper level of connection and understanding between them. Option B (Nag-alis sila sa iba't ibang lunsod) does not align with this idea, as it implies a more superficial or temporary nature to their friendship.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Siya'y pinalayas mula sa kaniyang posisyon) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Ang accountant ay hindi nagamit ang pondo ng kumpanya"" suggests that the accountant did not use the company's funds, which implies that they were fired or laid off from their position."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Narinig ko ang pagtiktik ng orasan) is the more likely cause of why I am late. This is because the phrase ""Tumingin ako sa orasan"" implies that the speaker is looking at their watch, indicating that they are aware of the time and are checking it to see how late they are. Option B (Gusto kong tingnan ang oras) does not provide any information about the speaker's awareness of the time and could potentially be interpreted as meaning that the speaker simply wants to look at their watch for some other reason."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (I wrote the essay with my cramped hand) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""nag-cramp"" or cramps in the hand, which could be caused by various factors such as fatigue, injury, or illness. It is unlikely that the second option, ""Kami ng aking asawa ay nagkamay-kamay,"" or ""My husband and I are cramping each other's hands,"" would be true based solely on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-tigil ang bolt,"" option A (Binago ko ang bolt) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Lumipat ang mag-asawa sa apartment."" The wording of the premise suggests that the couple has already signed a lease agreement for an apartment, indicating that they have already moved in."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Akala niya ay nakita niya ang kidlat) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""akalain"" means to think or believe, so it suggests that the woman is mistakenly thinking she saw something when in fact she did not. This is a common mistake people make when they misinterpret what they see or hear, especially if their perceptions are clouded by other factors such as fatigue, stress, or distractions. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for why the woman is sitting outside at dawn looking confused."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hindi siya marunong lumangoy) is the correct answer. The man did not know how to swim, which could have contributed to his difficulty in staying afloat in the water.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she pressed the ""Backspace"" key (Option B) rather than ""Inlipat"" (Option A). This is because pressing the Backspace key would delete a character from the document, whereas inlining a text would not have any effect on the document."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Naka-grade siya ng masama) is the correct answer. The premise suggests that the girl has been embarrassed or humiliated by her friends, which could be due to a low grade in school. This implies that she may have performed poorly academically, leading to the negative reaction from her peers. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang hardin ay mabahong,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""mabahong"" suggests that something has become too heavy or burdensome to carry, which could be due to a sudden increase in weight or volume. Therefore, it is more likely that the tree became overloaded with fruit rather than simply being full of fruits from the start."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Nagpa-night siya sa isang hotel) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Natulog ang babae,"" which means she slept, and then adds that she did so in a hotel. This implies that she went to a hotel specifically for the purpose of sleeping, rather than simply forgetting to set her alarm clock. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the woman overslept."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Umupo siya sa lilim) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nagsuot ng sunscreen"" implies that the man took measures to protect himself from the sun's harmful rays, such as applying sunscreen. This suggests that he was outside for an extended period of time, which could lead him to feel hot or uncomfortable. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man might have wanted to take a nap."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Inihinto ng mga mananaliksik ang teoriya) is more likely to occur. The use of the term ""mananaliksik"" suggests that the theory being discussed is a scientific or philosophical concept, rather than a popular belief or opinion held by individuals. Therefore, it is more likely that the experts are challenging or criticizing the theory rather than simply accepting it without question."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nag-overtime ang laro) is the most likely cause of the fans' disappointment. The premise states that the fans are unhappy with the game, which suggests that something positive did not happen during the game, such as a comeback or an exciting finish. Overrunning the clock would be a negative event that could lead to fan dissatisfaction. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Pinutol ko ang kandado"" will occur. The phrase ""Isinulat ko ang aking kombinasyon sa kandado"" suggests that the speaker has thought of a combination to open the lock, but does not necessarily mean that they have actually opened it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Kinuha ng ama ang kamay ng kaniyang anak) is more likely to happen because it goes against human nature for a parent to give their child money without any conditions or expectations attached. It's more plausible that a parent would demand something in return for giving their child money, especially if they are struggling financially themselves.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I pinagtipon ko ang niyebe sa isang bola ng niyebe) is more likely to happen. This is because ""pinagtipon"" means to crush or grind something into small pieces, which would not be possible if the niyebe were already in a liquid state. Therefore, it is more likely that the niyebe was solid before being ground into small pieces."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B is the correct answer. The phrase ""Ang kayak aynahulog sa alon"" means that the kayak is being pulled by a current or tide, indicating that it is moving forward. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she lost control of her bike due to a sudden obstacle in her path (Option B). The phrase ""nakipag-crash"" suggests that there was an impact or collision, which is consistent with Option B. Option A does not provide any information about why she might have lost control of her bike."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sinubukang ko ang fan,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct. The phrase ""sinubukang"" means to blow or fan something, so it makes sense that the water would be blown onto the speaker's body rather than felt directly on their skin. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sila'ynahuhumog) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""bumalik sa baybayin"" suggests that something has returned or come back to its original place, which aligns with the idea of the surfers being carried away by a wave. Therefore, it is more plausible that they were swept away by the ocean rather than encountering an animal."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The water flows out of the bath) is the most likely outcome. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Ang tubig ay lumabas sa banyo.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will happen - ""Inakusahan niya siya ng panghihina."" The reason for this is because the phrase ""pagkakasala"" implies a sense of guilt or shame, which could lead to feelings of anger or resentment towards one's spouse. This could result in the husband being punished or disciplined by his wife, rather than him confessing his mistake directly to her."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang tinta sa poster aynahuhulog,"" it is more likely that option A (Hinintay ko na magtuyo ang tinta) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""nahuhulog"" means to dry or to evaporate, suggesting that the ink has already dried and cannot be easily washed off with water. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the ink did not come off when you tried to use water."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nagkaroon siya ng pangarap) is the more likely cause of the baby's crying. The premise suggests that the baby has a dream or hope, which could be causing it to cry. Option B (Nag-uumi siya sa kama) does not provide any context or reason for why the baby might be crying.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Itinaas ng bata ang kanyang mga paa sa mesa,"" option A is more likely. The child is climbing onto the table, indicating that it is a physical action that can be observed or experienced by others. Option B does not fit with this premise as there is no indication of the child's father studying or learning anything from the child."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sinisgaw ko ang pangalan niya) is the most likely cause of the friend's change in behavior towards you. The premise suggests that your friend may have been offended or hurt by something you did or said, leading them to distance themselves from you. Option B (Iniyakan ko ang aking mga kamay) does not fit with the given premise as it implies that your friend has become cold and distant towards you without any specific reason being provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A: Nag-alsa ang mga mamamayan will occur. The phrase ""pinipilit ng pamahalaan"" suggests that the government is exerting pressure or coercion on the people to vote a certain way, which could lead to resistance or dissatisfaction among the population. This is in line with Option A, which states that the people are being forced to vote against their will."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (Sumisigaw siya para humingi ng tulong) will occur. The fact that the child is crying suggests that he/she needs help or support, so option B is a more plausible outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Gusto niyang matuto magdibuho) is more likely. The premise suggests that the woman wants to learn a new skill or craft, which aligns with Option A. Option B (Gusto niyang matuto tungkol sa ibang cultura) does not necessarily imply that she wants to learn about another culture, but rather that she wants to learn something new in general.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ang kaniyang katrabaho ay pinalakas) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the person's colleague has been promoted or advanced in their career, which could potentially make the person feel envious or resentful.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the person hallucinated) occurred. The phrase ""Ang lalaki ay nakasaksi ng mga dayuhan"" suggests that the man saw or experienced something supernatural or paranormal, which could be interpreted as a hallucination. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Naglagay siya ng bleach dito) is the correct answer. The phrase ""blonde ang buhok"" suggests that the person's hair has been lightened or bleached, which would require the use of a bleaching product rather than a regular shampoo. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely. The artist felt inspired to create a new work because of something they saw or experienced, rather than criticizing their previous work. This suggests that the artist was motivated by a desire for creative expression and exploration, rather than a need to correct past mistakes.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Siya ay pinaalis sa militar) is the correct answer. The premise states that the child was sent away from home, which could imply that they were taken by force or coercion to join the military. This is a common practice in some cultures where children are forced to serve in the military at a young age. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice based on the information given in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A is more likely. The books are falling off the shelf because they are too heavy to hold, not because the shelf is collapsing due to a sudden jolt or impact. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Nagpalit ako ng ilaw"" will occur. The reason being that turning off the light bulb can cause the circuit to be interrupted or broken, leading to a blackout in the house. On the other hand, buying a new circuit breaker may not necessarily solve the problem of a blackout if there are issues with the electrical wiring or other components of the power distribution system. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Nakakatakot ang hitsura nito) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nakakatakot"" generally means ""scary"" or ""frightening,"" which aligns with the idea of a roller coaster being intense and thrilling but also potentially frightening for some people."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nagbubuhos ako ng mantikilya sa bag) is the more likely cause of the popped corn. The premise mentions that the person is trying to make popcorn by heating kernels in a bag, which suggests that they are using a traditional method of making popcorn. It is less likely that they would use a microwave to make popcorn, as this is not a common way to prepare the snack. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nawala ang kuryente sa kapitbahayan) is the more likely effect to occur. The phrase ""Isang puno ang bumagsak sa linya ng kuryente"" suggests that a tree has fallen onto the power line, causing it to break or disrupt the flow of electricity. This could result in the loss of electricity in the neighboring area. Option B (Inihula ng hula ang malakas na hangin) means that a strong gust of wind is blowing, but this does not necessarily cause a power outage. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (He pinisil the listeners) will occur. The premise states that the speaker is creating false comments, implying that they are intentionally misleading or deceiving their audience. This behavior aligns with Option A, where the speaker manipulates or confuses the listeners.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (A patak ng dugo ang nabuo sa aking daliri) is more likely to occur because it directly contradicts the idea of ""Sinaksak ko ang aking sarili sa pin."" The phrase ""patak ng dugo"" means ""a drop of blood,"" which implies that something has caused injury or harm to the speaker's face. Therefore, option B better fits the context of the premise than option A (Isang butil ng pawis ang tumulo sa aking mukha), which simply means ""I am blinded by my own self."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang isda ay lumulutang sa ibabaw ng tangke,"" option A (Gutom ito) is the most likely cause. The fish is dead because it has been left in the sun for too long, causing it to spoil or rot."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang tinig ng lalaki ay parang maingay,"" it is more likely that option A (Siya ay may lagnat) is the correct answer. The term ""maingay"" is a derogatory term used to describe someone who talks too much or has an annoying voice, so it makes sense that the person's voice is causing them discomfort. Option B does not make as much logical sense, as there is no clear connection between the person's voice and their being tired from smoking."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the elevator arrived at its destination) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Nagbukas ang mga pinto ng elevator"" suggests that the elevator moved or traveled to a specific location, indicating that it reached its intended destination. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Nagsinungaling siya sa kanyang mga magulang) is the correct answer. The premise states that the person who runs away from home does not return, which suggests that they may have lied to their parents about where they were going or what they were doing. This is a common behavior among teenagers who want to assert their independence and avoid confrontation with their parents. On the other hand, Option B (Pinatay siya ng kaniyang mga magulang) is less plausible as it implies that the person's parents killed them, which is an extreme and unlikely scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nag- overflow ang banyo) is the most likely cause of the problem. The phrase "" nagbaha ang banyo"" suggests that there was an excessive amount of water in the toilet bowl, which could have caused it to overflow. Option B (Nasira ang heater ng tubig) does not make sense in this context as it refers to damaging the water heater, which is not related to the issue at hand. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang may-ari ay nag-iipon ng kuleryo sa tuta) is the more likely cause of why the dog is barking. This is because the phrase ""ang tuta ay nanatili sa tabi"" suggests that something is holding or restraining the dog, which could be a leash or a rope with food tied to it, rather than the dog being afraid of something else like in option B (Ang may-ari ay nag-iingat sa aso)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will get lost in the big forest. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tinawagan ko siya) is more likely to happen. The use of the word ""kasintahan"" suggests that the person being called has been previously mentioned or introduced, making it more likely that they will answer the phone when called. Option B (Nakilala ko siya sa hapunan) means ""I got to know him in a gathering,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise given."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tumakas ang aso nila sa bahay) is the more likely cause of the problem. The fact that their neighbor's dog keeps escaping into their house suggests that there may be a gap or opening in their fence or wall through which the dog can enter. This is more plausible than option B (Ang mamahaling alahas ay nawawala sa kanilang tahanan), which implies that something valuable has been stolen from them without any explanation for how it disappeared.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nakita ko ang aking hininga nang ako'y huminga,"" option B is the correct answer. The phrase ""nakita ko"" means I saw it, so the speaker is describing something they observed happening to their body. Option B is the most logical choice because it complements this idea by suggesting that the speaker felt dizzy or lightheaded."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nais nila ang mas mabuting mga kalagayan sa pagtatrabaho) is the more likely cause of the employees' dissatisfaction with their jobs. This is because the employees are seeking better working conditions and improved treatment by their employer, rather than simply accepting their current salary without question. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nagluto ako ng apple pie,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Ang amoy ng pagkalot ay pumuno sa kusina"" (The smell of baking fills the kitchen) will occur. This is because the phrase ""Nagluto ako ng apple pie"" implies that something is being cooked in the kitchen, and the smell of baking would be present as a result."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Nagsuot siya ng mataas na takong) is the correct answer. The premise states that the woman is "" nagpupumilit"" or persistent in her actions, which suggests that she may be willing to go to great lengths to achieve her goal. Wearing a high heel shoe would not necessarily require much effort or persistence, but sucking one's own feet might be more challenging and time-consuming. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the woman is walking funny."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-init ang singaw mula sa palayok ng tubig,"" option A (Nagulo ang tubig) is the most likely cause. The word ""nagulo"" means to swell or inflate, which suggests that the water in the bucket has expanded due to some external factor, such as heat or a gas being released from the rice. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lahat ng aking mga medyas ay nasa laundry,"" it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Nagsuot ako ng sandalyas."" This is because sandals are typically not washed with other clothes in a laundry machine, so it would be unlikely for all of your media to be in the laundry if you were wearing sandals."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nawala ang suporta ng mga botante) is the more likely effect. The argument suggests that the politician's popularity has eroded due to his involvement in corruption, which implies that he may have lost support from his constituents. Option B (Siya ay inakusahan ng katiwalian) does not necessarily imply a loss of support from voters but rather an investigation or accusation by the public or authorities for the politician's alleged wrongdoing.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nag-iwan ang mag-asawa) is more likely to happen because it goes against societal norms and expectations of a healthy marriage. The idea of one spouse abandoning the other without any explanation or reason does not align with traditional values of commitment, loyalty, and mutual respect in a marital relationship. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nais ng milyonaryo na sirain ang gusali) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""inialay sa milyonaryo"" implies that the valuable object was entrusted to a wealthy person, who may have had the means and motive to harm or destroy it. Therefore, it is more likely that the rich person intentionally damaged the painting rather than providing funds for its restoration."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nakita ng sales associate ang batang babae na naglalagay ng merchandise sa kaniyang bag) is the correct answer. The premise states that the sales associate saw the young girl putting items in her bag, indicating that she was attempting to conceal or steal merchandise from the store. This suggests that the cause of the situation is the young girl's actions rather than the sales associate's attempt to help her find what she wants.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B is the more likely outcome. The premise states that the soldiers were sent to fight in a nearby territory, indicating that they are involved in military operations. This suggests that they may be away from their families for an extended period of time, rather than being with them. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nagpalit ng panata ang isang mag-asawa sa harap ng korte) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""kontrobersyal na hatol"" suggests that there is a controversial issue at hand, and the fact that it involves a husband changing his testimony in court implies that there may be some sort of conflict or disagreement involved. Option A does not provide any specific details about what might cause a commotion in front of the courthouse, so it seems less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kinuha niya ang mga cookies sa bote) is the more likely cause because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""May amoy ng nasusunog"" suggests that something was left in a hot place, which could refer to a bag or container like a bote. Therefore, it's more plausible that the girl took the cookies from the bote rather than leaving them in the oven."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Malakas ang ulan,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the storm became stronger, indicating a more intense weather condition. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang gusali ay pinaalis,"" option A is the correct answer because it implies that the elevator stopped working or malfunctioned, causing inconvenience to those who were inside. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no alarm system installed in an elevator."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A - ""Binili ng ama ang kanyang anak ng beer"" will occur. The fact that the father is angry at his son's alcoholism suggests that he may try to control or manipulate him in some way, such as buying him drinks. This could lead to a cycle of enabling behavior where the father continues to enable his son's addiction rather than addressing the underlying issues."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (The elevator is not working) is more likely to be the cause of the lawyer's delay in reaching his office.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nainis ang lalaki sa kaniyang kaibigan) is the most likely cause of his sadness. The phrase ""nainis"" implies a deep feeling of sadness or depression, and the fact that it is directed towards a friend suggests that the source of his sadness is something related to their friendship. Option B (Ang kaibigan niya ang nag-alay sa kanya ng tanghalian) does not fit with this interpretation as it implies that someone else is responsible for causing his sadness, rather than his own feelings towards his friend."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the cashier gave the money to the young girl) will happen. The wording of the premise suggests that the cashier was responsible for giving the money to someone else, rather than forgetting about it or not intending to give it to anyone in particular. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Siya ay nabalian sa isang aksidente) is the more likely cause of her being confined to a wheelchair. The phrase ""inilagay sa isang wheelchair"" suggests that she has been immobilized or restricted to a chair for an extended period of time, which could be due to injuries sustained from an accident rather than a gunshot wound. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B is the more likely cause of the situation described. The premise states that ""Ang bansa ay nakaharap sa kahirapan sa economiya,"" indicating that the country is facing economic difficulties. This suggests that the people are struggling to make ends meet and are unable to afford basic necessities, leading to a decline in their quality of life. Therefore, Option B is the more likely cause of the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Nakapagbibida sila sa kanilang mga tagahanga) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nawala ang koponan"" suggests a loss or absence of something, which could be interpreted as a lack of inspiration or motivation among their fans. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why their popularity has decreased."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Naramdaman ko ang pagmamalaki) is more likely. The use of the word ""naramdaman"" suggests that the speaker feels something, which implies emotion or feeling. Option A (""Ako'ynahihiya"") does not convey any emotional response to the situation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Siya'y nakikinig sa klase) is more likely to be the cause of why the child failed in history. This is because the premise states that the child did not study for the exam, implying that they may have not paid attention in class or did not take notes, which could affect their performance in the exam.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dumami ang bilang ng krimen sa lunsod) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Nagbagsak ang gusali sa gitna ng bayan"" suggests that there is a breakdown or collapse in the middle of the city, which could be caused by various factors such as criminal activity. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Humihingi siya sa kaniya na tanggapin siya) is the more likely outcome. The use of the word ""naghiwalay"" in the premise suggests that the man is feeling embarrassed or ashamed about his situation, and therefore is unlikely to directly approach his parents for help. Instead, he may choose to humbly ask someone else, such as a friend or a teacher, for assistance."
"Response:  Option B - Nag-umpisa ang kanilang mga ulo. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the two children will start fighting over the ball rather than rolling it away from each other. The phrase ""lumapit"" (to come near) suggests a confrontational or aggressive approach, which aligns with the idea of the children fighting. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (The takip is in the trash) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Sinasamsam ng rakun"" implies that something has been thrown away or discarded, which supports the idea that the takip is in the trash. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pinasigla ng bata ang lapis,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct, as ""mura"" means cheap or inexpensive. Therefore, the statement ""Ito ay mura"" makes sense in this context."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (the resibo of the customer) caused the problem. The customer may have accidentally taken a wrong change or left without paying for something, leading to an overpayment. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Mabilis itong gumaling) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""Malalim ang gulo sa akin"" suggests that something is bothering or irritating the speaker's skin, which could lead to redness or inflammation. This implies that the rash will spread quickly and intensify over time, as suggested by Option A. On the other hand, Option B (""Nag-iwan ito ng isang marka"") does not necessarily imply a quick or intense development of the rash, but rather a gradual worsening over an extended period."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Nakatitig siya sa lupa) is the correct answer. The premise states that the man was ""receiving strange looks from passengers,"" which suggests that he was standing out or drawing attention to himself in some way. This could be due to his appearance or behavior, but it is also possible that he simply stood out because he was lying down on the train floor. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man received strange looks from the passengers."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang mga langgam ay lumulutang sa mga hiwa) is the correct answer. The premise suggests that the baby will be fed with milk, which means that the baby's hunger will be satisfied, not that the baby will be given something to eat. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang Kapatid Na Babae Ng Babae Ay Nag-Ipon Ng Mga Kamay) is the more likely cause of why a woman was given her sister's tissue. The premise suggests that the woman's sister had saved up money for something, implying that she may have been planning to buy something expensive or important. This could be the reason why the woman was given her sister's tissue instead of another person's. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang kaniyang mga labi ay napunit) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""napunit"" means to be worried or anxious, which suggests that the man's lips are twisted in a worried expression due to something he is thinking about or feeling. This is supported by the context of the sentence, which implies that the man is preoccupied with something. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (May mga direksyon sila papunta sa teatro) is the more likely cause. The premise suggests that the couple left early for the show, indicating that they have a specific destination in mind, such as a theatre or performance venue. This implies that they are planning to attend a show or event at the theatre, rather than simply wandering aimlessly with no particular direction. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she will be criticized by her boss (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sinabi niya na mga baliw sila) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the man supported their demands, which implies that he agreed with them and was willing to accommodate their requests. It is unlikely that he would have called them ""baliw"" or foolish if he did not support their demands. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Siya ay natatakot sa entablado) is the correct answer. The phrase ""tumatakbo bago ang kanyang pagganap"" suggests that the actor's heart is racing before he performs, which could be due to stage fright or fear of failure. This aligns with Option A, as the actor may be afraid of falling off the stage during his performance."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ako'y nawala,"" it is more likely that Option A (I lost my money) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nawala"" means ""lost"" or ""missing,"" which suggests that something valuable has been taken away from the speaker. This implies that the speaker may have misplaced their money rather than simply forgetting where they put it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang mga hinog na prutas ay nanatili sa araw,"" option A (Ito ay kinain) is the most likely answer because the phrase suggests that the ripe fruits will be eaten up during the day."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Binuksan ko ang pagsisimula) is the most likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Nagbabagsak ang Kotse"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the car's engine or transmission, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as overuse, poor maintenance, or a mechanical failure. However, the fact that the machine is ""nag-overheat"" implies that there may be an issue with the cooling system, which is more likely to be caused by a malfunction in the radiator or fan rather than simply starting the car without oil. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the problem."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will be embarrassed (Option A). The phrase ""sa likod"" suggests that someone or something is in front of him, implying that he is facing them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Wala na akong kahoy) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Nagpapilit ako sa apoy sa kamali"" suggests that the speaker is trying to convince someone of something, and the use of the word ""kahoy"" implies that the speaker is referring to an object or thing that they cannot find. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker has lost their keys rather than it being cold inside the house."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (May cramp siya sa kanyang gilid) is the correct answer. The phrase ""tumigil"" suggests a sudden or unexpected movement, which could potentially lead to muscle cramps in the legs. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the woman's body may be experiencing discomfort during her jogging session."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tinuktok ko ang pinto ng aking kapitbahay,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct, meaning that my neighbor invited me over.  "
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Hindi Nauunawaan Ng Kaniyang Asawa Ang Kaniyang Mga Alalahanin) is the more likely cause of why the woman's husband did not know her belongings. This means that the man was not aware or did not pay attention to his wife's things, indicating a lack of interest or care for them.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A is correct. The studnet's answer of ""Tama"" suggests that they agree with the statement that the teacher is always right. This implies that the student has a positive attitude towards their teacher and values their authority. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wala nang itlog ang babae,"" option B (pumunta siya sa supermarket) is more likely because it would be a logical consequence of not having any eggs at home to buy fresh ones from the supermarket. Option A (pumunta siya sa bukid) does not make sense in this context as there is no reason for her to go to the mountains without any eggs."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Isiniwalat ko sa kanya ang isang lihim) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""matandang kaibigan"" suggests a long-time friendship, and the word ""lihim"" implies a deep or dark secret that has been kept hidden for a long time. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will reveal a long-held secret to their old friend rather than simply binigkis (embracing) them."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she got wet from Option A - ""Nakapanghuli siya ng isda"" or ""She got wet from the fish."" This is because the phrase ""pumasok sa lawa"" means ""entered into water,"" indicating that she was submerged in liquid rather than contaminated by something."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nasira ang payong niya) is the most likely cause of why the student was late for class. The fact that he forgot his umbrella suggests that he may have been in a hurry or distracted, leading to forgetfulness. Option B (Ang kanyang bisikleta ay ninakaw) does not align with the given premise as it implies that someone stole the student's bicycle, which is an unrelated event from being late for class due to forgetting an umbrella.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ang gumagamit ay nag-click sa mouse) is the more likely cause because it implies that the user intentionally clicked on something using their mouse, whereas option B (Inilipat ng gumagamit ang mouse) does not specify who or what caused the mouse to move. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Isang aksidente ang naganap sa pangunahing daan) is more likely to be the cause of the traffic jam. The phrase ""nag-ikot ang tsuper"" suggests that there was an accident or obstruction on the main road, which caused the traffic jam. This is supported by the statement ""nasuhan siya ng trak na nasa unahan niya,"" which implies that the driver was unable to continue driving due to the blockage ahead. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the traffic jam based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the tela will get wet (Option A). The premise states that the tela is placed on top of the dress outside, indicating that it will be exposed to water or moisture from the environment. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she wore high heels because it states ""Ang babae ay nagsuot ng mga salamin"" which means ""The woman wore shoes"". Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tumingin ang lalaki sa langit sa gabi,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""tumingin"" means to look up or gaze at something in admiration or wonder, so it's likely that the man is looking up at the sky in awe rather than wanting to initiate anything."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ako'y pagod na pagod,"" option B (Nagising ako sa buong gabi) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B is the correct answer. The sentence ""Lalong lumalaki ang kaniyang buhok"" means ""His hair grew longer."" Therefore, the most likely cause for his hair to grow longer is Option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Binati ng bata ang bagong kaklase) is more likely. The use of the word ""naglaro"" in the premise suggests that the child may have enjoyed or liked their new classmate, rather than disliking them. Therefore, it is more probable that the child was excited to meet their new classmate than that they did not like them."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (kumain ako ng cookies) is the correct answer. The premise states ""Gusto ko ng isang baso ng gatas,"" which means ""I want to eat a bowl of ice cream."" This implies that the speaker wants something sweet to eat, which aligns with Option A. On the other hand, Option B (""Nagluluto ako ng tinapay"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""I cooked a sandwich"" and has no connection to eating ice cream. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sinindi ng tsuper ang mga ilaw ng harap) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the sun will be covered by clouds, which can block its light from reaching the earth. This is a plausible scenario as clouds are made up of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air, and they can indeed block the sun's rays. On the other hand, option B (Binago ng tsuper ang Kotse) does not make sense as there is no logical connection between covering a car with clouds and blocking the sun's light from reaching the earth.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nagparking ako malapit sa pasukan) is more likely to happen because it implies that there are other vehicles parked nearby, increasing the likelihood of someone accidentally hitting or bumping into your vehicle while you are parked. Option A (Nagparking ako sa kabilang daan ng kalye) does not provide any information about the proximity of other vehicles and therefore does not increase the likelihood of an accident occurring.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A: ""Siya ay may block ng manunulat"" (He has a block of writer's block). This is because the passage states that the person has a deadline to submit their draft but are unable to do so due to writer's block. It does not mention anything about the person editing the draft. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Humiling ako na makipag-usap sa isang superbisor) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the speaker's friend has something important to tell them, and the most likely scenario is that the friend wants to have a conversation with the speaker about it. It is less likely that the speaker would give their number to someone they don't know without any context or reason.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nag-ring ang doorbell) is more likely to cause the sound of knocking. The premise states that ""Ang hangin ay sumipsip sa bukas na bintana,"" which means that the wind is blowing through an open window. This suggests that there is a gap or opening in the window through which the wind can enter. Therefore, it is more likely that the sound of knocking will come from outside the room, rather than from inside the room where the kurtinas are located. Option B (Nagkurap ang mga kurtina) does not make sense in this context as kurtinas are curtains or blinds that block light, not create sounds."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Na-blown ko ang isang fuse) is more likely to be the cause of the power outage in your house. The phrase ""tumigil"" or ""tumiglas"" typically refers to a sudden loss of electricity, which could be caused by a blown fuse rather than simply turning off a lamp."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nagngungol ang weightlifter) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the weightlifter's excessive lifting has caused his brain to become overweight, which is a physical impossibility. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nalilito siya) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the student became frustrated or disinterested in solving the math problem, leading them to give up easily. Option A (Kinuha niya ang isang calculator) does not necessarily imply that the student gave up, as they may have simply used a calculator to solve the problem instead of struggling with it themselves.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Binago ng ama ang pampalasa ng sanggol) is the more likely cause of the baby's crying. The phrase ""Natulog ang sanggol"" suggests that the baby has just been born, and the reason for its crying could be due to discomfort or pain caused by the birthing process. Option B (Maingat na inuyog ng ama ang sanggol) does not provide a clear explanation for why the baby is crying, and it may not be a plausible cause based on the given context. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A - ""Ang mga larawan ay naging maliwanag"" (The images became clearer) will occur.

Therefore, Option A is the better choice."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-ehersisyo ako,"" it is more likely that Option A (Naramdaman ko ang lakas) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""nag-ehersisyo"" suggests that the speaker is experiencing some kind of discomfort or unease, which could be physical in nature (such as feeling weak or drained). This is consistent with Option A, which implies that the speaker feels strong or powerful. In contrast, Option B (Natakot ako) suggests that the speaker is afraid or scared, which does not fit with the context provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Inihibigpit ko ang basahang espongha,"" option A is the correct answer because ""tubig"" (water) is a substance that can be absorbed by sponge. Therefore, the effect of putting water on the sponge is likely to make it absorb more water."

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (She wakes up at night) is the correct answer.

Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sumiklab ang bulkan) is the more likely cause of the eruption. The phrase ""Nag-agos ang lawa mula sa bulkan"" suggests that there was a buildup of heat or pressure inside the volcano, which eventually led to an explosive eruption. This is consistent with the idea that magma rose to the surface through a vent in the Earth's crust, causing an eruption. In contrast, option B (Ang bulkan ay hindi nag-aandar) does not provide any explanation for why the eruption occurred, and simply states that the volcano did not move. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Isinulong ng babae ang kaniyang sapatos,"" it is more likely that Option B: Gusto niyang umalis sa party is the correct answer.

The phrase ""binayaran ko"" implies that the speaker has given something in exchange for the service, which in this case would be passing through the tollbooth. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will pass through the tollbooth rather than being stopped or held back."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Isinabog niya ang kaniyang kayamanan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the person has filed for bankruptcy, indicating that they are unable to pay their debts. Therefore, it is more likely that they have used up all of their savings rather than selling their company's stock.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nagkasakit ang lalaki) is more likely. The premise states that the man consulted a doctor, implying that he was already experiencing symptoms or discomfort. This suggests that he may have been sick or injured, rather than simply taking a vacation. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lumabas ako sa aking silid-tulugan sa pamamagitan ng bintana,"" it is more likely that there are people inside the house because the word ""lumabas"" means to come out or emerge from something, implying that someone or something has been inside the house initially. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Matagal siyang nag-shower) is the more likely cause for why the boy's hair became pruney. It takes a long time to shower to get wet hair, so it is more plausible that the boy took a long shower than him rubbing his hands with soap.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang trak ay nag-umpisa sa Kotse,"" option A is more likely. The word ""nag-umpisa"" means to start or begin, so it is unlikely that the car would stop suddenly without any warning. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Nanalo sila) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""nag-aayos"" implies that they made an effort to prepare for their needs, which suggests that they were successful in obtaining what they needed. Therefore, it is more likely that they won the lottery rather than stopping their efforts midway through."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Inibalik ko ang bote) is the most likely cause of the problem. The premise states that ""Nag-aahon ang bote ng soda,"" indicating that the bottle is tilting or leaning to one side. This suggests that there may be a problem with the bottle itself, such as it being unstable or not properly seated, rather than an issue with the cap. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will open the door through Option A - ""Lumapit siya sa loob sa pamamagitan ng bukas na bintana."" This is because the premise states that he is locked outside his house, indicating that there is a physical barrier preventing him from entering through the front door. Therefore, option A, which involves opening the door through a window, is a more feasible solution than option B, which involves riding on a bubble."

The passage states that ""Ang mga namatay na sibilyan sa digmaan ay dumami,"" indicating an increase in the number of dead civilians in the war zone. This suggests that the protest or parade organized by the passersby may not have had a significant impact on the situation. Instead, it is more likely that the increasing number of civilian casualties would lead to public outrage and calls for action from the government and other stakeholders."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Inibit niya ang ribbon) is the most likely answer. The phrase ""Hinugot ng dalaga"" suggests that someone or something has taken hold of the ribbon, implying forceful action. This implies that the person in question did not simply let go of the ribbon but actively took it away from their hair. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Siya ay tumanda) is correct.

The premise states that the student received a scholarship to study in college, which suggests that they may have excelled academically or demonstrated exceptional potential to warrant such recognition. It does not necessarily imply that they are naturally talented or gifted. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the student was able to get into college.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Kasama niya ang bahay nila) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""pinilit"" suggests coercion or force, which aligns with the idea of someone being made to do something against their will.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (The papers were launched into the air) is the more likely cause of the frisbee landing on my head. The premise suggests that the papers were thrown or launched into the air, and since they are lighter than the frisbee, it is more likely that they will land closer to the ground rather than higher up in the air. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kinagat ng dalaga ang kanyang mga kuko,"" it is more likely that option A (Nag-aalala siya) is the correct answer. The phrase ""kinagat"" means to worry or be anxious, so it suggests that the girl is feeling concerned about something. Option B (Nagulat siya) means to be surprised, which does not fit with the context of the sentence as much. Therefore, option A is a better match for the given premise."

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B will happen - ""Nag-file siya ng divorce.""

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nakuha ng kaniyang kalaban ang pas) is more likely to happen because it implies that the opponent has gained an advantage or taken something from the speaker's character. This creates a sense of loss or disadvantage for the speaker, which can be a common outcome in conflicts. Option B (Ang kaniyang kalaban ay bumagsak), on the other hand, does not convey any specific outcome or consequence for the opponent, making it less likely to occur based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sila'y hinog na) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Kinuha ko ang mga kamatis"" implies that the speaker has taken something from someone else without their permission, which suggests that the person who took the tomatoes did so without the owner's consent. This aligns with Option A, where it is implied that the speaker caused harm to someone else by taking their property without permission."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nakilala niya ang kanyang dating kasintahan sa tanghalian) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""kumilos nang romantikong paraan"" suggests that the man is trying to find a way to express his feelings for someone, and the fact that he realizes his date's liking through their interactions in the mall implies that he is able to read her emotions and understand her better. Option B (Binili niya ang tsokolate para sa kanyang kasintahan) does not align with this interpretation as it does not provide any context or clues about the man's ability to read his date's emotions."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the temperature has risen (Option B). The phrase ""tumaas ang mercury sa thermometer"" implies that the temperature reading on the thermometer has increased, indicating a rise in temperature. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."

The premise states that the student has been accepted for tutoring, which suggests that they may be struggling in their studies and could benefit from additional support to improve their marks. It is less likely that the student would be expelled from school (Option B) as this outcome does not align with the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Lumuhod ako sa lupa) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""lumuhod ako sa lupa"" means ""I fell into the ground,"" which suggests that the person may have tripped or fallen accidentally. On the other hand, ""binalot ko ang aking sarili sa isang kumot"" means ""I stuffed myself with rice,"" which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pinatuyo ko ang bato,"" option A (Naging makinis ito) is the most likely outcome. This is because ""pinatuyo"" means to crush or grind something into powder, so it's likely that the rock will be reduced to a fine powder rather than becoming misshapen or twisted."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nagdadag ako ng asukal sa kape,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Malakas ang amoy ng kape"" (The coffee smells strong) will occur. This is because the word ""nagdadag"" implies a strong or intense sensation, which suggests that the coffee's scent will also be powerful or overwhelming."

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (May pimple siya) is the correct answer. The premise states that the person's appearance is not pleasant, implying that they may have acne or other skin issues. This is a common problem for many teenagers, especially during puberty, and is more likely to be the reason why someone would feel self-conscious about their appearance.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Nakatanggap ako ng mabuting balita) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Mabuting balita"" means ""Good news"", so it suggests that the speaker received something positive or uplifting, which could explain why they are smiling."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pinipis ko ang aking mga kamay gamit ang towel,"" it is more likely that Option A: ""Malamig ang tuwalya"" (It's cold outside) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""pinipis"" suggests that the speaker is feeling chilly or cold, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nag-uugaling ang upuan sa ilalim niya) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nawala ang timbang"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away, and the fact that it was found at the bottom of a man's pants implies that it may have fallen there accidentally. There is no indication in the premise to suggest that he painted his bathroom. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the object was found where it was."

The fact that they were able to play well during practice but not during games suggests that there may be an issue with their motivation or focus during actual gameplay, rather than a lack of skill or training under their coach's guidance.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nagsisisi ako sa aking pagkakamali) is the more likely cause of my failure. This is because the phrase ""humingi ako ng kapatawaran"" suggests that I am taking responsibility for my mistakes, indicating that I are self-reflective and willing to acknowledge fault. In contrast, option B (""Nakamit ko ang aking layunin"") does not convey this same sense of introspection and accountability. Therefore, based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is the more likely cause. The phrase ""walang tigil"" suggests that there is no end or stopping point to her thoughts about herself, indicating a constant preoccupation with her own self. This aligns better with the idea of obsession than Option A's suggestion of simply asking questions about oneself."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nagngiti ang dalaga,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct - ""Nag-aubog ang kaniyang mga pinsgili."" The word ""nagngiti"" means to smile or blush, so it is likely that the girl's dimples are deeper when she smiles."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nakapasa ito sa minahan) is the more likely cause of the boat sinking because the phrase ""Ang barko ng kaaway"" suggests that the boat was hit by something heavy or strong enough to cause damage, such as a large wave or an object dropped from another vessel. The phrase ""bumagsak"" also implies that the boat has sunk completely, indicating that the damage was severe. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the boat sank."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Naglakad siya sa isang palayok) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Ang lalaki ay tumulak sa kanyang paa"" suggests that the person is walking with a cane or crutch, which would be difficult to do while carrying a heavy load like a large rock. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the man is walking slowly."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (They found traces of blood at the crime scene) is more likely. The phrase ""natuklasan nila"" implies that they discovered something at the crime scene, which in this case is blood. This suggests that there was a violent struggle or attack at the location where the body was found, which aligns with the idea of a murder investigation. Option B does not provide any information about finding evidence related to the crime, so it is less likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I went out) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that there are many traps inside the house, indicating that it is not safe to stay inside. Therefore, it makes sense for the speaker to go outside instead of waiting for someone to come in.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Maraming tao ang nakaharap sa kawalan ng trabaho) is the more likely effect. The statement ""Ang economiya ng bansa ay bumagsak"" implies that there is a shortage of jobs available in the country, which can lead to unemployment and underemployment among many individuals. This is supported by various reports from government agencies and international organizations that show an increasing number of Filipinos are struggling with job security and income stability due to the lack of decent work opportunities. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Handa na silang lumakad sa lumalapit na trapiko) is the more likely cause of why the children are being led astray.

The phrase ""nag-ikot-ikot ako ng mga mata"" suggests that the speaker's friend was being straightforward or honest with them, rather than joking around or trying to be funny. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ang tsuper ay nabaril sa daan) is more likely to happen because it implies that there are no longer any gas stations along the road, making it difficult or impossible for the car to continue driving. This scenario is consistent with a post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce and infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. In contrast, Option B (Ang tsuper ay pumili ng isang autostopist) suggests that the car will find an alternative means of transportation, such as an auto stop, but this does not necessarily imply a lack of gasoline availability.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nagpasubo ang babae,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct - ""Ang sanggol ay ipinanganak."" The word ""subo"" in Tagalog means to bear or carry something, so it is unlikely that the woman is sick in the morning (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang sombrero ng lalaki ay nawasak,"" it is more likely that option A (Inilabas niya ang sombrero) is the correct answer. The word ""nawask"" implies that something was taken or removed from its place, which fits with the idea of someone taking off their sombrero. Option B (""Malakas ang hangin sa labas"") does not fit well with the given premise and seems to be an unrelated observation."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Nakatanggap siya ng imbitasyon) occurred because the phrase ""Dumalo ang dalaga"" means to bring a gift or present for someone's birthday celebration. Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker brought a gift for their classmate's birthday party."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Gusto niyang mapahanga ang kaniyang kausap) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""nag-spray"" suggests that the person applied a spray or perfume to themselves, which aligns with the desire to smell good for someone they are talking to. It is less likely that they would use gel on their hair as it does not have the same olfactory purpose."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Naghanap ako ng isang flashlight) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of the situation. The character in the story is looking for something to light up their way, so it makes sense that they would search for a flashlight rather than a pala (a type of fishing gear).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ang ina ay nagpasilang ng kambal) is the more likely cause for the family to move into a bigger house because it suggests that there are now additional members in the household, specifically a new baby, who would require more space. Option A (Ang anak ay nagtapos sa hayskul) does not provide any information about the number of people in the household or their needs, so it is less likely to be the reason for the family's decision to move into a bigger house.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Nakita niya ang linya ng pagtatapos) is the more likely cause for why a marathon runner may be slow. The runner may have noticed that they are taking too long to finish their runs, indicating that there is an issue with their pace or speed. This could be due to various factors such as poor training, inadequate nutrition, or even an injury. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for why a marathon runner may be slow.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (binibigkis ko siya) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker has a close relationship with their friend's dog, and would therefore be able to comfort them in times of grief.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Nag-ulat siya ng isang utang) will occur. The use of ""tinanggihan"" in the premise implies that the negosyante's credit card was declined or rejected, resulting in a delay or failure to pay for the goods or services purchased. This is consistent with option A, where the negosyante experiences an unexpected debt or financial obligation due to the decline of their credit card."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (She pinched her ears) caused the pain in her head. The premise states that ""Ang tao ay sumpa,"" indicating that something happened to her body, specifically her ears, which led to the pain in her head. Option B (She got a nosebleed) does not align with this information as it refers to a different part of her body. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nag-aaway ang kaniyang kapatid sa kanilang mga magulang) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""ipinagmamalaki ng lalaki"" suggests that the man's son has been mistreated or abused by their parents, leading to a confrontation between them. This is a common scenario in many Filipino families where children are subjected to physical, emotional, or psychological abuse, causing them to rebel against their parents. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Looking at the stars) is more likely to result in the girl learning about the solar system. The premise states that she wants to know about the solar system, and looking at the stars can provide her with information about the position and movement of the planets in our solar system. Reading a book (option A) may not provide her with as much practical information about the solar system.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Inilagay ko ang poster sa itaas ng pintuan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the poster was placed too high, indicating that it was positioned above the door rather than behind it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B will occur - ""Binago ng arkitekto ang mga plano."" The word ""binago"" means to change or modify, indicating that the architect may alter or update their plans for the building. This choice aligns with the idea of the architect having some degree of control over the design process."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Sinapol niya ang kutsara) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's hand was trembling. The word ""sinapol"" means to shake or tremble, indicating that the man may have been experiencing some kind of physical reaction due to his emotional state. Option A (""Nanginginig ang kaniyang kamay"") does not provide as clear an explanation for the man's trembling hands."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Natagpuan ng lupon ng mga direктор ang kapalit niya) is more likely to happen. The use of ""natagpuan"" implies a negative outcome for the company, as it suggests that the directors were able to find a replacement for the CEO's position despite his efforts to prevent it.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (binayaran ng kaniyang pamilya ang kaniyang kahilingan) is the more likely cause of why the man was left by his family. This is because the phrase ""pinalaya mula sa bilangguan"" suggests that he was abandoned or left behind by his family, which could be due to financial difficulties or other reasons. Option B (sinaktan niya ang isang kasamahan sa bilangguan) does not provide any context or reason as to why the man would be left by his family."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option B (Their house caught fire) caused the loss of all their belongings. The passage states that ""their house caught fire,"" indicating that a sudden and unexpected event occurred that resulted in the destruction of their property. It does not mention anything about selling their house or any other possible causes of the loss. Therefore, Option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tinamaan ko ang lata ng aluminyo,"" it is more likely that Option B: Naputol ang lata.

The fact that the speaker left their house before sending the letter suggests that they may have forgotten to do so, which is consistent with the idea of forgetting something while leaving the house.

The phrase ""nagpapahinga"" suggests that something happened suddenly or unexpectedly, which aligns with option A where the baby emerged from the pool unexpectedly.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hinawakan ko ang buhok ng impostor,"" it is more likely that Option A will happen - ""Ang kanyang wig ay bumaba."" The word ""buhok"" in Tagalog means hair, so the phrase suggests that the person's real hair will be revealed or exposed, rather than their face becoming darker or their appearance changing in any other way. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given premise."

Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely. The speaker is expressing their desire to compose their own music, indicating that they have the creativity and inspiration to do so. Option A suggests that the speaker may be trying to amplify or enhance the existing sound of music, but this does not necessarily imply that they are creating new music themselves. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang buhok ng bata ay nakatayo,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct, as the phrase ""Ang batang babae"" means ""The girl child."" Therefore, the most likely explanation for why her hair is growing long is because she is a girl child."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sinispray ko ang aking sarili ng repellent sa insekto) is the correct answer. The use of ""nawasak"" in the premise suggests that something has bitten or stung the speaker, which aligns with the action of using an insect repellent to prevent further bites or stings. On the other hand, Option B (Tinakpan ko ang bug) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the speaker wants to trap the bug. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible response based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Binuksan ko ang aking mga mata,"" it is more likely that option A (Nagising ako) is the correct answer. The phrase ""binuksan"" means to wake up or become awake, so it suggests that the speaker may have been sleeping or in a state of unconsciousness before. This aligns with Option A, which states that the speaker was able to see their eyes."

The premise states that the student has graduated from university, indicating that they have completed their education and are now seeking employment. This is a common outcome for graduates of higher education institutions.

The premise suggests that the parents are annoyed by their child's constant crying, implying that the child is crying excessively or for no apparent reason. This could be due to various reasons such as colic, teething pain, or overstimulation, all of which can cause a baby to cry uncontrollably.

The phrase ""Sinusundan ng pusa"" implies that something heavy or solid is being pushed or pressed down onto the bird, which could cause it to fall or become injured.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang paaralan ay nag-iwan para sa tag-init) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Nagpalitan ng paaralan"" suggests that something has happened to the school building or facilities, which would require the school administration to move it somewhere else for safety reasons. This is a common occurrence in areas prone to natural disasters like typhoons or earthquakes where schools are often evacuated to safer locations until the danger passes.

Therefore, it is more likely that the child is smiling or happy rather than feeling uncomfortable or uneasy."

The sentence suggests that I accidentally sat or leaned on something hard while wearing my jeans, causing a small rip or tear.

The phrase ""Ang iba pang mga estudyante sa hapunan ay nadama na sila'y pinabayaan"" implies that the other students in the group are aware of the girl's bullying behavior and have chosen to ignore or tolerate it, rather than confronting her directly. This suggests a passive response from the bystanders, which can contribute to a culture of acceptance and enablement of bullying behaviors. Therefore, Option B is the more likely outcome based on the provided premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bumalik siya sa hangin) is more likely to happen. The premise states that the child was lifted by the bouncy castle, indicating that they were already in mid-air before landing back on the ground.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sinira ng bata ang kaniyang tuhod) is more likely to happen than option B (Nag-bandage ang kaniyang ina sa sugat). This is because ""sinira"" means to hit or strike someone, while ""nag-bandage"" means to wrap something around something else. Therefore, it is more likely that the child's head was struck with an object rather than being wrapped in a bandage."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He will revise his will) is the more likely cause. The passage states that the man is suffering from a terminal illness, indicating that he may be nearing the end of his life. Given this context, it is unlikely that he would be able to undergo an organ transplant (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Sinunog ko ang aking dila) is more likely to occur because it implies a stronger action than option A (Pinutol ko ang aking dila). The word ""sinunog"" means to hit or punch someone's teeth, implying a more forceful and violent act compared to ""pinutol,"" which means to close one's eyes lightly. Therefore, option B suggests that the speaker will take a more aggressive approach in dealing with their annoyance."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Hindi nag-aalinlangan ang manunulat sa kaniyang mga kuwento) is the correct answer. The phrase ""hindi nag-aalinlangan"" suggests that the writer did not meet the deadline for submitting their work, which implies a lack of effort or carelessness on their part rather than an external factor causing the delay."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sinaksak ko ang aking balat,"" option A (Ito ay pawis) is the most likely cause. The word ""pawis"" means ""itchy,"" so it is likely that the speaker has an itchy skin condition rather than feeling pain or discomfort due to something inside their body."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nawala ang kanyang pag-aalaga) is the more likely cause for the man's sudden illness during an emergency operation. The phrase ""sumailalim sa emergency na operasyon"" suggests that the situation was urgent and time-sensitive, making it less likely that he would have had time to take care of himself beforehand. Additionally, the use of the word ""nawala"" implies a sudden and unexpected loss or absence of something, which could be interpreted as the man's lack of self-care. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information given in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Inilipat niya ang kaniyang mga kamay) is the more likely cause of the bulging hands. This is because the phrase ""Ang mga kalamnan ng kamay"" means ""The fingers are swollen,"" which suggests that there is some kind of inflammation or fluid buildup in the hands, rather than simply being pinched or squeezed. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's hands are swelling due to some internal factor, such as an allergic reaction or a medical condition, rather than being directly pinched by something external."
"Response:  Option A - Nagulat siya.
Explanation: The phrase ""Itinaas ng lalaki"" means ""The man was amazed."" This implies that he was surprised or astonished by something, which aligns with option A. Option B does not fit well with the context as it means to confuse someone, which doesn't make sense in this scenario. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Naniniwala ako na mabuti ang kaniyang mga layunin) is the more likely cause. The statement suggests that the speaker believes their friend has good intentions, rather than implying that they know what is best for their friend. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Mas maaga na siyang nagising) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Tumigil na ang lalaki sa paninigarilyo"" suggests that the man was already sleeping in the house when the fire started, so it is unlikely that he would have been able to get up earlier than usual. Therefore, option B is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang katawan ng nag-atake ay wala nang buhay) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""Tinamaan ng babae"" suggests that a woman was involved in the attack, and the use of the word ""katawan"" implies that the victim's body was severely injured or damaged. Given these details, it is more likely that the victim did not survive the attack."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang lalaki ay hindi naka-aim) is the most likely cause of why the bull did not attack the man. The premise states that the man was not in the direct path of the charging bull, indicating that he took evasive action to avoid being attacked. Therefore, it is unlikely that the bull did not attack the man because it could not see him or because it lost interest in attacking him. Instead, it is more likely that the man successfully avoided the bull's charge by moving out of its way.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A is more likely. The phrase ""dumalaw sa kaniyang bahay"" suggests that something or someone has entered the house through a window or door, indicating that the person's home was not secure. Given this context, it is more plausible that the person discovered the rats in their basement rather than having them on their farm. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Sobrang pagod ako para maghanda ng anumang bagay) is the correct answer. The phrase ""sobrang pagod"" suggests that the speaker is feeling tired or exhausted, which could be due to preparing for a dinner guest. This implies that the speaker is making an effort to prepare something special for their visitor, rather than being unwelcoming towards them."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The fact that a new diary is mentioned suggests that the character may have started writing in a new one, rather than continuing to write in an existing one. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B: Iniwan niya ang trabaho niya will happen. The premise suggests that the woman has enough money for her needs but chooses to neglect her work responsibilities instead of working overtime to earn extra income. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (hinagkan niya ang mainit na kalan) is the more likely cause of the baby's crying because it suggests that the baby may have been exposed to something hot or spicy, which could irritate its mouth and cause discomfort or pain. Option B (pinakapatong niya ang ulo ng tuta) does not provide a clear explanation for why the baby is crying and seems less plausible based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nagbigay sila ng survey sa mga customers) is more likely to be the desired outcome of the company. By conducting a survey, the company can gather valuable feedback from its customers, which can help them identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes to enhance their overall experience.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Itinapon ng bata ang mga kusinang nasa sofa) is the more likely cause of the mess in the living room. The phrase ""itinapon"" suggests that something was thrown or placed carelessly on the couch, which could be toys, books, or other objects. Option B (Nag-drag ang bata ng upuan sa sahig) does not fit with the context as it implies that a person dragged something heavy across the floor, which would not create a mess on the couch. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the state of the living room."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tinutuya ako ng aking kaaway) is the more likely cause of my face being swollen. This is because the phrase ""Inihihinto ko ang aking mukha"" suggests that something has caused harm or injury to one's face, which could be due to an attack or assault by someone else. Option B (Ang aking kaaway ay nag-iipon ng pisngi) does not provide any logical explanation for why one's face would be swollen, and it seems unlikely that one's own face would become swollen simply by eating too much food. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (It was struck by lightning) is the more likely cause of the hole in the ground. The phrase ""it was struck by lightning"" implies a sudden and unexpected event that could create a hole in the ground. While Option B (Many people came to see it) does not provide any specific reason as to how the hole was formed. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iniwan ko ang prutas sa labas sa mesa,"" it is more likely that Option B will occur - The ants are likely to carry away the fruits outside the table."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Ipinakita niya ang kanyang mga daliri ng paa) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""Ang ballerina"" which implies a female dancer, and ""nagsubo ng ligamento"" which means she strained or sprained her ankle. Therefore, it makes sense that she would show her foot injuries to prove her condition. Option B does not make logical sense in this context as there is no mention of pooting or any other bodily function related to ballet dancing."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Natutunan niya kung paano ito ikakabit) is the more likely cause of why the boy's shoelaces are untied. This is because the premise states that the boy learned how to tie his shoes, indicating that he had previously tied them but then they became untied. Option B (Naglalakad siya sa palaruan) does not provide any information about why the shoelaces might be untied, and could potentially imply that the boy was simply running around without paying attention to his shoes.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""nawala"" means ""disappeared,"" indicating that the speaker's perspective has changed. Option A suggests bringing back something that was previously lost, which doesn't align with the context of the sentence. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (siya ay naiimpluwensiyahan ng kaniyang mga magulang) is the correct answer. The phrase ""naiimpluwensiyahan"" suggests a gradual or long-term influence of the parents' beliefs on the child, rather than an abrupt or sudden separation from them. Therefore, option A better fits the context given in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Wala na siyang gasolina) is the most likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""humingot"" suggests that something is not functioning properly or has stopped working altogether, which aligns with the idea of running out of fuel. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Nawala ang lasa ng ice cream."" The reason being that the phrase ""Kumain ang lalaki ng ice cream"" implies that someone has eaten too much ice cream, leading to a loss of taste or an unpleasant aftertaste. This is a common phenomenon that can happen when consuming too much sweet food or drink. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Mukhang marumi ang karpet) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""marumi"" in Tagalog means ""worn out,"" so it suggests that the carpet may have been damaged or worn down over time, leading to its current state. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Nagkasakit ang ulo ko) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""umalis sa trabaho"" suggests that something has caused the speaker to leave their job, and ""nagkasakit ang ulo ko"" (my head hurts) implies that there may have been some kind of conflict or problem at work that led to this decision. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B, which simply states that the speaker's boss asked for a day off without providing any context or explanation for why this might be the case."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Pinasisihan ng may-ari ang tuta) is the more likely outcome. The use of the word ""pinasisihan"" suggests that the owner of the carpet is disappointed or displeased with the behavior of the cat, rather than rewarding it with a gift. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Humingi ako ng paumanhin sa aking kaibigan,"" option A (Pinatawad ako ng aking kaibigan) is the most likely response. This is because ""paumanhin"" means to apologize or regret, so it's likely that the speaker would want to make amends with their friend rather than express anger towards them."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Nagdala siya ng isang backpack) is the correct answer. The premise states that the man is ""nakatayo"" or sitting in the middle of a crowd, which suggests that he may be carrying something to make him stand out or draw attention to himself. A backpack would be a practical item for this purpose, as it could hold various items such as food, water, or other supplies that might be needed during an emergency situation. On the other hand, wearing a neon vest may not provide enough visibility or protection from harm, especially if the person is already sitting in the middle of a crowded area. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Natawa ang mga tagapakinig) is the more likely outcome. The use of the word ""nagbiro"" in the premise suggests that the speaker's words had an amusing or entertaining quality to them, which could cause the listeners to laugh."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tumingin ako sa araw,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tumingin"" means to look or gaze at something, so it suggests that the speaker is facing the sun. Option B also makes sense, but it's less direct than option A in conveying this meaning."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ako'y nauuwi,"" option A (Nag-sniff ako) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (The steak is raw) is the most likely cause for not being able to cut it.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (she was given a salary) is the correct answer. The premise states that she declared her pregnancy, which suggests that she was employed or had a job that required her to disclose this information. As such, it is reasonable to assume that she received some form of compensation for her work, such as a salary. Option B (she accumulated a large debt) does not align with the premise provided and seems less likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will happen - ""Nagtataka ako kung wala na siya."" The phrase ""wala na siya"" implies that something has happened to make her disappear or unreachable, which could be worrying for the speaker. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Inilagay ko ang bulaklak sa ilalim ng aking ilong,"" option A is the correct answer because it suggests that the petals are falling off the flower."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Nakilala niya ang kaibigan niya noong bata pa) is the more likely cause of her nostalgia. The passage suggests that she has been reminiscing about her childhood friend, indicating that she has fond memories of them from when they were young. This is supported by the phrase ""Ang babae ay nadarama angnostalhiya,"" which implies that she is feeling a strong sense of nostalgia for her past. Therefore, it is more likely that she is thinking about her childhood friend than her adult children."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mas maaga niyang isinumite ang papel) is more likely. The student is expected to submit the paper earlier than the deadline, indicating that they are proactive in completing their tasks.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-break ang Kotse ko,"" it is more likely that Option B will happen, which is to call a mechanic. This is because breaking down one's car often requires professional help, especially if it involves serious issues such as a breakdown of the engine or transmission. In this scenario, calling a mechanic would be the most practical solution rather than going to the mall, which may not have any relevance to fixing the car problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iniwan ko ang sulat,"" option A is the correct answer because ""Hindi ito mababasa"" means ""This cannot be read."" Therefore, the speaker did not intend to write anything in the letter, making option A the most plausible explanation for why they left the letter unreadable."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Naglagay ito ng itlog) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""nagpatakbo"" suggests that something is moving or fluttering, which could be interpreted as an animal flapping its wings. Additionally, the mention of ""ibon"" specifically refers to a bird's egg, further supporting this interpretation. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nagparking ako sa daanan,"" it is more likely that Option A: ""Bukas ang garahe"" (The car is broken) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Nagparking ako sa daanan"" suggests that the speaker has parked their car somewhere, and the sentence ""Bukas ang garahe"" implies that the car is no longer functional or operational, which could be due to various reasons such as an accident, mechanical failure, or vandalism. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Inihulog ng kriminal ang baril) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""Itinutok ng kriminal ang baril"" implies that the criminal took the victim's gun, which suggests a violent act. Option B (""Itinaas ng biktima ang kaniyang mga kamay"") does not imply any violence or harm to the victim. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Plano kong dumalo sa libing ng aking tiyuhin) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Hinihintay ko ang katapusan ng linggo"" suggests that the speaker is eagerly awaiting something, and the use of the word ""libing"" (which means ""longing"" or ""yearning"") implies that the speaker is feeling a strong desire for something to happen soon. Option B (Plano kong dumalo sa kasal ng aking kaibigan) does not fit with this context as it refers to attending a wedding, which may be an interesting event but does not necessarily involve longing or yearning. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nag-isip ako nang Nakaisip) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the sentence. The use of ""nang"" in the phrase ""nang Nakaisip"" suggests that the speaker was lost in thought for some time before realizing something. Option B (""Naaliw ako"") does not convey this same sense of introspection and contemplation. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the printer ran out of ink) caused the document to be unreadable. The statement ""Ang printer ay kulang ng tinta"" directly implies that there is a lack of ink in the printer, which could result in poor or distorted printing quality. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Lumingon ang mga tagahanga sa watawat) is more likely to happen because it suggests that the audience will be drawn into the performance. The use of ""lumingon"" (to draw in or attract) implies a sense of pull or attraction towards the performance, rather than simply rushing through it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang lasa ng dip ay walang lasa,"" option A is more likely. The speaker is unlikely to add salt to something that already has no taste."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely. The phrase ""pagbubo"" can be translated to ""boiling,"" indicating that the liquid inside is hot or boiling. This suggests that the contents of the pot are likely to be very hot, which could cause burns if it comes into contact with skin. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she will bookmark her page rather than read the same chapter again. Therefore, option A (She bookmarks her page) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Tuning in to the man's voice) is more likely. The premise states that ""Ang eroplano ay tumama sa ilang mga kaguluhan,"" indicating that the plane is experiencing turbulence. This suggests that the passengers are feeling uncomfortable and anxious, which could cause them to tune in to a soothing or calming sound, such as a man's voice. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-aalala ang baby,"" it is more likely that option A (Hindi siya pinansin ng dalaga) is the correct answer. The word ""nag-aalala"" implies a sense of worry or concern, which suggests that the child was not noticed or attended to by the nanny. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the baby might be crying unattended in the room."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the doctors are examining the patient's vital signs (Option B). The phrase ""artipisyal na kamay"" suggests a medical or surgical procedure, and checking vital signs such as pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate would be an important part of that process. It is less likely that the doctors would pinch or squeeze the patient's fingers (Option A) during this type of examination."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she nag-aaksaya siya sa kanya (She scratched him). This is because the phrase ""sino-sino"" means to scratch or rub roughly, and ""lalaki"" means man. Therefore, the sentence implies that she scratched him. Option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-sandal ang bata sa putik,"" option B is the most likely outcome. The word ""sandal"" suggests that the child's foot was stepped on or crushed by something soft, like mud or sand. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Ang mga tao ay nagtatago sa ilalim ng lupa,"" indicating that people are hiding underground. This suggests that there may be a natural disaster or catastrophe occurring in the area, such as an earthquake or flood, where people would seek shelter beneath the ground to avoid danger. Option A, which states that schools are closed, does not provide any information about the cause of the situation and could potentially occur for reasons unrelated to a natural disaster."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the employee will be late for work (Option B). The phrase ""tapos na ang shift"" implies that the employee's shift has already ended, and they are expected to report back to work at their designated time. It is unlikely that the employee would be allowed to stay at home without any consequences, especially if they have been consistently late or absent from work. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible outcome based on the provided information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sinira ng puno ang bahay,"" it is more likely that option A (The tree fell on the house) is the correct answer. The phrase ""sinira"" means to fall or collapse, which implies that the tree fell onto the house, causing damage. Option B (""Ang puno ay naglilim sa bakuran"") does not fit with the given premise as it means ""The tree is leaning against the wall,"" which is a different scenario from the one described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang kahoy ay namaghati sa kalahati,"" it is more likely that option A (Inilagay ko ang kahoy sa apoy) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""namaghati"" means to be torn or cut into pieces, which suggests that the coconut tree branch is being broken or damaged by something. Option B (Inilagay ko ang wasay sa puno) does not make sense in this context as ""wasay"" means a type of vine, and there is no reason why a vine would be growing inside a coconut tree. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Ang mag-asawa ay nag-anunsyo na sila ay naghiwalay) is the correct answer. The premise states that the family is grateful to their husband for bringing them together, implying that they were previously separated or apart from each other. This suggests that the couple has gone through a difficult time in the past, such as a separation or divorce, and are now happy to be reunited with each other. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nagustuhan niya siya) is the more likely cause.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nalilito ako) is the more likely cause of why I am upset with my friend's statement. The phrase ""nalilito ako"" means ""I feel hurt"" or ""I am offended,"" indicating that the speaker is experiencing negative emotions due to their friend's comment. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Nag-flipped ang mga kaibigan ng barya) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""nag-flipped"" suggests a sudden change or flip in the situation, which could indicate that something unexpected happened to make the friends turn against each other. This is more consistent with the idea of a compromise being sought after than a deliberate plan to harm someone. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Inilabas ng lalaki ang mga pagkain sa refrigerator) will occur. The phrase ""nag-off ang timer"" suggests that something unexpected happened in the kitchen, such as a power outage or a malfunctioning appliance, causing the food to spoil. It is unlikely that someone would take food from the oven without permission, especially if they are not authorized to use the oven. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nagtrabaho siya nang husto) is more likely to happen because it suggests that the woman is working hard to achieve her goal of becoming a successful businesswoman. The phrase ""nagtrabaho"" implies a sense of urgency and effort, which aligns with the idea of striving towards a challenging objective. In contrast, option A (""Nag-iwan siya ng timbang"") does not convey the same level of intensity or determination, and may suggest a more passive approach to achieving one's goals."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ang kaniyang anak ang namana ng kaniyang kayamanan) is the more likely outcome. The fact that the wealthy man's son has inherited his wealth suggests that he will continue to enjoy the benefits of his father's hard work and success, rather than facing legal problems or difficulties due to his inheritance.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang babae ay tumakbo sa apoy,"" option A is the correct answer because it suggests that the woman is running away from something or someone (the apoy). Therefore, the most likely effect is that she will be escaping or leaving something behind."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Ang lisensya niya sa pagmamaneho ay inalis) is the correct answer. The phrase ""ang Kotse ng babae"" suggests that the woman's car was involved in an accident, which aligns with Option A. Option B does not provide any information about an accident involving a car. Therefore, Option A is the most likely explanation for the situation described by the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Natulog ako sa aking alarma,"" it is more likely that Option B: Nawala ako sa almusal will occur. This is because being late for breakfast can be caused by various factors such as oversleeping or traffic, but it is unlikely to cause someone to become pregnant."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ang kaniyang pamilya ay dumalo sa press conference) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of a celebrity's family attending a press conference. This option provides a logical explanation for why the cameras are flashing in their direction. In contrast, Option A (Ang mga kamera ay nag-flash sa kaniyang direksiyon) does not make sense in this scenario as there is no indication that the cameras are flashing towards any specific direction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-iingat ang babae sa banyo,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct. The water in the bathtub became warmer because she was careful not to let it get too cold."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the student will join a fraternity (Option A). The premise mentions that the student wants to be recognized by other students in the campus, which aligns with the purpose of joining a fraternity - to gain social recognition and acceptance among peers. On the other hand, studying engineering (Option B) may not necessarily lead to increased social recognition or popularity within the campus community.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Naghahanap ako ng maliit na pera) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""sopa"" which is Filipino slang for money, indicating that the speaker is looking for small amount of money. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will happen - ""Tumakas ang bata."" The premise states that the boy's wings are growing, indicating that he will grow and develop his wings further, leading to him flying.

The premise states that the woman has been summoned to appear before a court for committing a serious crime, implying that she will face legal consequences such as imprisonment or even capital punishment."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Inilagay ko ang asukal sa mainit na tsaa,"" option B is the correct answer because ""ang asukal ay natunaw"" means ""the asukal died."" Option A does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang beterano ay naglalakad na may pag-aakyat,"" it is more likely that option A (Siya'y inanyayahan para sa digmaan) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""may pag-aakyat"" suggests that the better player has a strategic approach to their gameplay, which could involve preparing for challenges or obstacles ahead of time. Therefore, it is more likely that the better player would be prepared for the challenge rather than being caught off guard by it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sinundan ng pulisya ang kriminal) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""sinundan ng pulisya"" implies that the police are actively pursuing or chasing after the criminal, which suggests a proactive approach rather than simply waiting for the criminal to come forward. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nahulog ko ito) is a more likely response because ""Hindi nag-on ang laptop"" means that the laptop is not working or functioning properly, so the speaker may want to charge it to make it work again. Option B (Ini-charge ko ito) does not necessarily imply that the speaker has control over the laptop's charging process."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she has a large wardrobe than that she has illegally dumped her laundry somewhere. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Nagkaroon siya ng malawak na wardrobe.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang kaniyang asawa ay nag-anak) is the more likely cause of the man's broken heart. The premise suggests that the man's wife had a child out of wedlock, which would be a significant betrayal or shock to him, leading to his broken heart. Option B (Iniwan siya ng kaniyang asawa) does not provide any specific information about why the man's heart was broken, making it less likely as a cause.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will happen - ""Siya'y naging kuwalipikado para sa trabaho na kaniyang nais."" This means that the man was able to secure a job that he wanted through his hard work and determination. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Binigyan niya ng pagbati ang mga tagapakinig) is the more likely cause. The fact that the sound of the man's voice can be heard throughout the entire auditorium suggests that he was using a microphone or some other amplifying device to project his voice, rather than simply speaking directly into the mic.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nagtapon ako ng barya sa bukal ng tubig,"" option B is the correct answer because ""barya"" means money, and ""bukal"" means bottom or depth of water. Therefore, it is more likely that the money will sink rather than float."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The ball entered through the window) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hinihinga ko ang alikabok sa loft,"" option A (Nag-hick-up ako) is the most likely answer because it matches the tone of the premise. The use of the word ""hinihinga"" implies a sense of longing or yearning, which could lead to feeling disappointed or frustrated if one's expectations are not met. Therefore, option A best captures the emotional response implied in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Gumamit ang kliyente ng pekeng pera) is the correct answer. The premise states that the cashier of a store stole money from the business, indicating that the thief was an insider with access to the store's funds. Using a client as a front for the illegal activity is a common technique used by insiders to conceal their involvement in financial crimes. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ang basura ay nakapapaamoy ng kusina) is the more likely cause of why I can't find my list of things to buy. This is because the premise mentions that the trash was thrown away, implying that it was disposed of in some way, which could have resulted in its loss or misplacement. Option B (Hindi sinasadyang itinapon ko ang aking listahan ng mga bagay na dapat bilhin) does not provide any information about the location or fate of the list, making it less plausible as the reason for the missing list.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (Sinusundan ng mga batang mga hayop) will occur. The phrase ""Nagustuhan"" implies a positive reaction, while ""Sinundan"" implies a negative or unwanted action. Therefore, it is more likely that the children were forced to watch the animals against their will, rather than enjoying them voluntarily."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang paghinga ng lalaki ay malakas,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""paghinga"" means to hesitate or delay, so it is unlikely that the man's stones are buried because of his hesitation. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B is more likely. The speaker is asking their friend if they are interested in attending the concert, indicating that they are considering going themselves.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Kinuha ko ang mga kumot) will occur. The reason for this is that the word ""nasira"" in the premise implies damage or destruction to something, which could potentially cause the AC unit's compressor to break down. This is a physical event that can be caused by external factors such as overheating or mechanical failure, rather than simply being turned off. In contrast, Option B (Binuksan ko ang mga bintana) does not imply any direct physical action that could cause harm to the AC unit's compressor."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Masakit ang likod ng bata,"" it is more likely that Option A (Bukas ang kanyang backpack) is correct. The word ""masakit"" means ""painful"" or ""aching,"" which suggests that something may be causing discomfort to the child's back. Opening the backpack could potentially provide relief from this discomfort by allowing the child to access what they need without straining their back further. Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I nagluto ako ng cake para sa kanya) is the most likely cause of the gift being given to her mother. The sentence ""binili ko ang aking ina"" suggests that the speaker bought something for their own mother, rather than giving it away as a gift. Additionally, the phrase ""nagluto ako ng cake"" implies that the speaker made or purchased a cake specifically for their mother's birthday, further supporting Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sinaksak ng bubuyog ang hardinero) is the more likely cause of why the daffodils in the garden are wilting. The phrase ""nawasak"" suggests that something has caused harm or damage to the plants, and ""bubuyog"" is a type of insect that can feed on plant sap and cause damage to flowers and other plants. Therefore, it is more likely that the daffodils are wilting due to the presence of these insects rather than the movement of the wind."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nakapag-iwan ako ng match,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct - ""Ang apoy ay nagpalabas."" This is because the word ""iwan"" in Tagalog means to desire or long for something, so it is possible that the speaker wants to watch a match but cannot due to some reason. On the other hand, Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the speaker has anything to do with causing an earthquake."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ayaw nilang makipag-usap sa korte) is the more likely cause. The parties involved in the conflict are unwilling to settle their differences through mediation or court proceedings, indicating that they may be motivated by other factors such as pride, power struggles, or a desire for revenge. This suggests that personal interests and emotions may be playing a larger role than simply trying to resolve the issue through legal means.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ang kanilang mga magulang ay nag-aabuso sa kanila) is the more likely cause of their situation. The fact that they are being sent to a place where there are no adults suggests that they have been neglected or abused by their parents/guardians, rather than simply dying in an accident.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (tsunami) is more likely to occur. The meteorite impact would create a massive shockwave that could trigger a tsunami wave. Option B (rainstorm) is less likely as it does not account for the catastrophic consequences of a meteorite impact.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Naging dehydrated siya) occurred. The phrase ""nakatagpo ang hiker"" suggests that the person has been walking for an extended period of time, which can lead to dehydration if they do not drink enough water. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Sinagot ko ang oven) is a more plausible explanation for why the dish turned out well because it directly addresses the problem of the food not being cooked properly in the previous attempt. On the other hand, Option B (Inilagay ko ang plato sa oven) does not provide any logical reasoning as to how that would improve the outcome of the dish's cooking. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nag-aamoy ang lemon) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pinutukan ko ang lemon wedge"" implies that the speaker has squeezed or pressed the lemon wedge, which would result in the release of its juice. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome than option B (Ang lemon ay sumipsip), which suggests that the lemon is being sucked or sipped."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang bansa ay nakatagpo ng bagong lupang,"" option B is the most likely answer. The phrase suggests that the country has colonized a new land, implying that it has expanded its territory through conquest or settlement. This is in contrast to option A, which implies that the country has abandoned its land, suggesting a loss of territory rather than an expansion."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang baso ay bumagsak sa mesa,"" option B is the most likely outcome. The word ""bumagsak"" implies that something will fall or drop onto a surface, such as a table. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-uyog ang mesa,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ang sahig ay hindi patas,"" is the correct answer. This is because ""uyog"" means to sink or submerge, so it is unlikely that the table would float if there is nothing underneath it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Ang kaniyang anak ay nagsisiapat ng katotohanan) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Nakapigil ang ama"" suggests that the father was caught off guard or surprised by his son's revelation, implying that he did not expect such a truth from him. This implies that the son has been lying to his father for some time, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kinuha niya ang sirop sa ubo) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the information given in the premise. The phrase ""Ang ulo ng lalaki ay tumitibok sa kirot"" suggests that the man's head is hot, which could lead him to take a cold drink like sirop (sirop is a Filipino term for a sweet, milky drink). Option B (Kinuha niya ang aspirin) does not make sense in this context as taking an aspirin would not provide relief from a hot head. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nagpabagal ang tren,"" option A (Papalapit ito sa istasyon) is the more likely cause. The word ""nagpabagal"" implies a sudden or unexpected event, which could lead to a train derailing near an station. Therefore, option A is the better choice as it suggests that the train may have been heading towards the station when it suddenly derailed."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man has depression rather than his family being affected by his painful thoughts. The phrase ""Nagkaroon ng therapy ang lalaki"" suggests that the man has sought professional help for his mental health issues, which is a common treatment approach for depression. Additionally, the mention of him being diagnosed with depression in Option B supports this conclusion. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tinupok niya ang kaniyang pagkain) is the more likely cause of why a woman's stomach hurts after eating too much food. This is because the phrase ""Kinupkop ng babae"" suggests that the woman has overeaten or consumed too much food, which can lead to discomfort in the stomach. Option B (Nakapag-iipon siya sa kanyang pagkain) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the woman's discomfort and seems less relevant to the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Ang boses niya ay parang masungit) is correct. The phrase ""Ang boses niya"" suggests a negative or unpleasant tone in her voice, which aligns with the idea of her speaking in a harsh or grating manner."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nag-swallow ito) is more likely. The word ""pinatingin"" in Tagalog means to swallow or gobble up, so it is unlikely that the steak would be stuck in the mouth."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A will happen - ""Nagtagumpay ang negosyo ng babae."" The reason being that if a woman-owned business becomes successful, it is unlikely for her to fire all of her employees without any valid reasons. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (tumunog ang kampana) is more likely to be the cause of the students' absence from school. The phrase ""Lumabas ang mga estudyente sa silid-aralan"" suggests that a large number of students have left their studies, which could be due to various reasons such as boredom or lack of interest in their classes. However, it is unlikely for teachers to give students homework without them being present in class. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ang mga kakilala niya ay may kaugnayan sa kaniya) is the more likely outcome. The woman has seen a ghost, indicating that there may be a connection or relationship between her and the spirit world. Therefore, it is more likely that her friends are also connected to the supernatural in some way.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Halos nalunod siya sa karagatan) is the more likely cause of the man's disappearance. The phrase ""halos nalunod"" suggests that he was swept away by a strong current or tide, which could be caused by a natural phenomenon such as a storm or high tide. This is a more plausible explanation than option B (Halos napatay siya sa isang pagsabog), which implies that someone intentionally harmed him."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iniwan ng bata ang tali ng balon,"" it is more likely that Option A: Nag-deflate ang balon will occur. This is because when a child holds onto a deflated balloon, it will not be able to fly or move around as much as it would if it were fully inflated. Therefore, Option A is the most logical choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Nagkaroon siya ng stroke) occurred. The phrase ""nawala ang kakayahan"" suggests a sudden and significant loss of ability to speak, which could be caused by a stroke or other brain injury. While option B (Huminga siya nang malalim) does not provide any specific evidence for a loss of speech abilities, it only implies a general decline in cognitive functioning. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Narinig niyang tinawag ang kaniyang pangalan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Ang babae ay natitisod sa gilid ng kalsada"" suggests that a woman was hit by a car while walking along the sidewalk. Hearing her name being called out could be a possible reaction to this situation, as people may try to identify the victim or notify loved ones of what happened. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B will happen. The phrase ""pagkatapos niya"" implies that the man has already done something before doing another action, in this case, pinasukan (to drown) the lifeguard.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ang aking impeksiyon ay kumalat) is the correct answer. The premise states that the patient's condition worsened after taking the antibiotics, indicating that the infection has become worse rather than better. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naging dilaw ang ilaw ng trapiko,"" option A (Pinilit ng tsuper ang preno) is the most likely outcome. The use of the word ""naging"" implies a gradual or continuous change, rather than a sudden or violent one. Additionally, the phrase ""dilaw ang ilaw"" suggests that something is being transformed from light to dark, which aligns with the idea of someone being pinched or squeezed. Therefore, it is more likely that the person was gradually compressed by the super's grip, leading to their transformation into a dilapidated state."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Inilamig ko ang lalagyan sa mainit na tubig) is the more likely cause. The word ""lalagyan"" in this context refers to a substance that can dissolve or break down easily, such as plastic. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will try to dissolve the plastic in hot water rather than placing it in hot sand."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang Kotse ay Na-Dent,"" option A is the most likely cause - ""Ang Tsuper ay Sumaksak sa Isang Poste Ng Telepono."" This is because the word ""kotse"" means car in Filipino, and dent refers to a damage or hole made by an impact. Therefore, it is more likely that the car was damaged after being hit by something hard like a post of a telephone pole rather than having its lights illuminated by a bright light source."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nag-aral ang baby sa buong gabi,"" it is more likely that option A (Hindi siya sumali sa eksaminasyon) is correct. The phrase ""nag-aral"" implies that the child did not attend school, therefore making option A the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Natatakot siyang matuto ng paglangoy) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tumigil sa gilid"" suggests that the boy is struggling or having difficulty swimming, which could lead to fear of learning how to swim. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Naramdaman ko ang pagtibok ng puso ko) is the more likely answer. The phrase ""Inilagay ko ang aking kamay sa aking dibdib"" suggests that the speaker has placed their hand on their heart, implying a physical sensation or emotion. The use of the word ""naramdaman"" in option A further reinforces this interpretation by indicating that the speaker feels something physically within themselves. Therefore, option A is the better choice to describe the effect of placing one's hand on one's chest."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A - ""Napakarami sa aking opisina"" (There are many things in my office) will occur. The use of the word ""napakarami"" suggests a large number or quantity of items, which aligns with the idea of construction work taking place inside the office."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B is more likely. The family is unlikely to invite their new neighbors over for a meal as it may be too early in their relationship to establish such close contact. Instead, they are more likely to keep their distance and observe their new neighbors from afar before deciding how to proceed.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the nag-spray ang tubig mula sa pool) caused the manlalangoy to sink. This is because when water is sprayed from a pool, it can create a lot of splashing and waves that could potentially push someone away from the side of the pool, causing them to sink. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""Hindi sinasadyang naputol ang aking ngipin"" means ""I didn't think my nose would grow."" This implies that the speaker was surprised by something unexpected happening to their nose, which is consistent with the idea of a nose growing longer. Option A, ""Hindi sinasadyang nilunok ko ang isang buto,"" means ""I didn't think I would stick my finger in an eye,"" which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she got drunk (Option B). The phrase ""nakapagbubukod siya ng mga tainga"" means ""she drank a lot of alcohol,"" indicating that she became intoxicated. On the other hand, ""nalilito siya sa ingay"" means ""she was attracted to the noise,"" which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ininom ko ang lahat ng tubig na nasa loob nito) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that the speaker has drunk all of the water inside the bottle, which implies that they have consumed all of its contents. This is supported by the use of the verb ""ininom,"" which means to drink or consume something completely. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given in the question."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (There are subtitles in the television show) is more likely. The use of subtitles suggests that the show is intended for a wider audience or for those who may not speak the language spoken in the show, which could include viewers from different countries or regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds. On the other hand, Option B (It's a complicated plot) does not necessarily imply that the show is intended for a global audience, as it could simply mean that the storyline is complex and requires close attention to follow.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Nakatagpo ang mga tripulante ng mga pirata) is the more likely outcome. The premise states that the ship was attacked by pirates, indicating a violent and dangerous situation in which the crew members are likely to be taken hostage or harmed. This outcome is more plausible than Option A (Nabubulok ang mga tripulante), where the crew members simply disappear without any explanation.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Nakapag-ayos siya ng palaisipan) is the correct answer. The premise states that the child was amazed by the thought, indicating a positive reaction to the idea of solving the puzzle. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the child tried to solve the puzzle, is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Inakyat ng lalaki ang telepono) is more likely. The word ""inakyat"" means to grab or hold tightly, so it suggests that the man may have physically taken the phone from someone else without their permission. This action is more aggressive than simply answering a call, which is what option B implies. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hinalikan ko siya) is more likely to be the correct response. The phrase ""tumingin sa akin"" means ""she's looking at me,"" so the speaker is likely feeling uncomfortable or threatened by her gaze. Option B (""Hindi ako komportable"") does not fit with this context as it means ""I can't handle it,"" which doesn't make sense in this situation."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sinuportahan ako ng aking kaibigan) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of the situation. The speaker is expressing frustration towards someone who has wronged them, and their friend is offering support rather than taking action against the person who hurt them.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pinapasok ko ang hangin sa gulong) is more likely to cause the bike's tire to go flat than option B (Nagpalitan ako ng gear sa bisikleta). The premise states that the bike's tire went flat, indicating that there was an external force applied to it, such as air pressure loss due to exposure to wind or other factors. Option A suggests that this external force was caused by air being sucked into the tire through a hole or puncture, while option B does not provide any explanation for why the tire would suddenly lose air pressure. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the bike's tire going flat based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Hinaplos ng kaniyang ama ang kaniyang noo) is more likely to happen because it implies that the woman's father will be angry with her for something she did or said. The phrase ""hinaplos"" suggests a strong emotion of anger or annoyance, which aligns better with this scenario than option A (""nagbasa sa kaniya ang kaniyang ama"")."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wala nang tinta ang bolpen,"" Option A (Gumamit ako ng lapis) is more likely to happen because it is a logical consequence of the given situation. The absence of ink means that there will be no writing or drawing possible with the pen, so using another substance like lapis would be the next best option."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Siya ay may utang) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Ang lalaki ay tinanggihan para sa isang pautang"" suggests that the man is in debt or owes money to someone. This is a common reason why people might be unhappy with their lives. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the girl has chickenpox rather than enjoying her math lesson. Chickenpox is a common childhood illness characterized by small, itchy blisters that can appear all over the body, while enjoying one's math lesson may not necessarily result in being absent from school. Therefore, Option A (May chicken pox siya) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ang sako ng basura ay puno,"" option A (Dinala ko ito sa basurahan) is the most likely outcome. This is because ""puno"" means full or abundant in Tagalog, indicating that there is already a lot of trash accumulated somewhere. Therefore, the next action would be to dispose of the trash properly by taking it to the dumpster (option A). Option B (Inihagis ko ito sa lababo) does not make sense in this context as ""lababo"" means to throw away carelessly or without proper disposal, which goes against the idea of wanting to dispose of the trash properly."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nagbubo ang punch ng kasama ko sa kuwarto) is the more likely cause of the problem. The use of the word ""punch"" suggests that something physical happened to the person in question, rather than a simple animal leaving its hair. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will break his computer (Option A).

It is unlikely that he would forget his towel as he would need it to dry himself after getting out of the shower. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man left the shower without rinsing off the soap.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Nagtabi sila ng pondo para sa tuition) will occur. The premise highlights the financial burden of sending children to college, indicating that parents may have to sacrifice their own needs or priorities in order to afford their children's education. This aligns with Option A, where the parents provide financial support for their children's tuition. In contrast, Option B (Pinasigla nila ang kanilang mga anak na maglaro sa labas) does not necessarily imply a financial burden or sacrifice on the part of the parents.

The phrase ""kinain ng lalaki"" implies that someone ate something, and ""kalahati"" means a portion or share. Therefore, it can be inferred that the person ate a large amount of food, which would make sense if they were to inhale or gobble down their meals without chewing properly."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Naglagay ako ng yelo dito) is more likely to happen because the word ""mamaga"" in Tagalog means ""to freeze or cool down"", so it's possible that the speaker wants to put ice cream inside the bucket. Option B (Pinipisil ko ito ng lotion) doesn't make sense with the given premise as ""pinipisil"" means ""to rub or massage something"", and there's no context for that action in relation to the bucket."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bukas ang pinto ng aking opisina,"" it is more likely that Option A (Kinausap ko ang akin kasamahan sa aking desk) is correct. The word ""pinto"" in Tagalog means ""open,"" so it suggests that something has been opened or uncovered, which could be interpreted as someone talking to their colleague at their desk."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Umupo ako) is the correct answer.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (May naisip akong solusyon) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""may naisip akong solusyon"" suggests that the speaker has already thought of a solution to the problem, which aligns with the idea of having a plan or strategy in mind. Option A (""Humingi ako ng payo"") does not necessarily imply that the speaker has come up with a solution, but rather seeks advice from others."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Natakot siya) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""na gyaya yabang"" suggests that the person is in a precarious or dangerous situation, and the word ""natakot"" means to be afraid or scared. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will feel fearful or anxious when faced with such a challenging situation."
