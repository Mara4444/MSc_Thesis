Answer:

A) The termites disappeared from the house.

Explanation:

The sentence ""Termites invaded the house"" implies that there were termites present in the house at some point. However, since the word ""invaded"" is in the past tense and indicates an action that occurred in the past, it suggests that the termites are no longer present in the house. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."

Note that in this example, the word order is different from the standard word order of Armenian sentences, which typically follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. In this case, the verb ""was"" comes first, followed by the object ""my fault,"" and then the subject ""I."" This is because the sentence is written in a more formal or literary style, where the emphasis is on conveying the meaning rather than following strict grammatical rules."

The sentence ""The man lost weight"" implies that the subject (man) has undergone a change in their physical appearance by losing weight.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

A) They developed nuclear weapons.

Explanation:
The passage states that the warring countries ""wanted peace"" and had been at war for many years. However, it also mentions that they developed nuclear weapons, which suggests that their desire for peace was not strong enough to overcome their rivalry and aggression towards each other. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer."

The sentence ""Ապրիլ շնորհակալ եղել"" (April snored) is in the present tense and describes an action that happens regularly or habitually. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) The leg of the sofa came loose."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two sentences with different meanings:

* Sentence A (The balloon popped) means that something sudden and unexpected happened to the balloon.
* Sentence B (The balloon flew away) means that the balloon moved or was carried somewhere else by an external force.

So, even though both sentences are grammatically correct, they convey different meanings based on their context and the words used in them. This is why it's important to consider the context of a sentence when interpreting its meaning, rather than just relying on grammar rules alone."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) They traveled by plane.
B) They went on a tour."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two sentences that are related to each other through a common noun phrase ""the peach"". Sentence A describes an action (biting) and sentence B describes a consequence of that action (bruising). By using the conjunction ""ո՞ր"" (or), we indicate that both sentences are connected by their shared referent ""the peach"".

 Armenian also has a specific word order in simple sentences, which is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This means that the subject of the sentence comes first, followed by the object and then the verb. For example:

Սպանություն:  I love you.
Անգամ:  You are my friend.
Միշտ:  We will meet tomorrow.
Հիմնվելով այս նախադրյալի վրա, ո՞ր ազդեցություνն է ավելի հավանական: 
Ենթերցող բարբառների միջեւ: 
Պատասխան.  

In this example, we see that the words are arranged in the SOV pattern: ""I love you"" (Subject), ""You are my friend"" (Object), and ""We will meet tomorrow"" (Verb).

Armenian also has a complex system of cases, which are used to mark the grammatical function of a noun or pronoun in a sentence. There are seven cases in Armenian: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, locative, and instrumental. Each case has its own set of endings, which are added to the noun or pronoun to indicate its grammatical function.

For example, consider the following sentence:

Սպանություն:  I gave the book to him.
Անգամ:  He read it carefully.
Միշտ:  She lent it to me.
Հիմնվելո"
"Response: 

Answer:
A) I ate a doughnut.
B) I had a sweet tooth."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two sentences: ""I pushed the door"" and ""The door locked."" We can use the conjunction ""but"" to connect these two sentences in a contrastive way, creating a new sentence that shows a change or contradiction between the two original sentences. In this case, the new sentence is ""But the door locked,"" which suggests that something unexpected happened after pushing the door."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) The products were tested for quality assurance.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) The products were tested for quality assurance. This option best completes the sentence based on the context provided in the passage. The activists boycotted the products because they were found to be of poor quality, which suggests that the company did not conduct adequate testing or quality control measures before releasing them onto the market."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) Her sister was happy.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The woman felt envious of her sister"" implies that the speaker is feeling jealous or resentful towards their sister. Option A provides a logical explanation for this emotion by stating that the sister is happy, which could be causing the speaker's envy. Options B and C do not provide a plausible reason for the speaker's feelings."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) The pilot navigated away from the storm.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The pilot's radar detected a storm"" indicates that the pilot was aware of the presence of a storm. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer, as it suggests that the pilot took action to avoid the storm by navigating away from it. Option (B) does not make sense in this context, as flying through a storm would be dangerous and could result in serious consequences for the aircraft and its occupants."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) She was fired from her position.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The accountant mismanaged the company's funds"" implies that the accountant made mistakes or acted irresponsibly with regard to managing the company's finances. As a result, she was likely fired from her position as punishment for her actions. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) I looked at the clock.
B) I wanted to check the time."
"Response: 

Answer: B
Explanation: In this sentence, ""My hand cramped up"" is a more natural way to express the idea of one's hand becoming tired or sore from writing. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two people (A and B) who are trying to tighten a bolt using a wrench. Person A uses a traditional method of tightening the bolt by turning it clockwise with a wrench, while person B uses a more efficient method of twisting the wrench in a specific way to tighten the bolt even faster. As they work together, they notice that the bolt is becoming loose again, so they decide to compare their methods to see which one works better. They find out that person B's method is more effective at tightening the bolt, and they learn from each other's techniques."

"Response: 

In this case, we have two groups of people (A and B) who accept or reject a scientific theory. Group A consists of individuals who believe in the theory, while group B consists of those who do not. We observe that some members of both groups change their minds over time, either accepting or rejecting the theory. Our goal is to determine whether there are any patterns in how these changes occur.

To analyze the data, we use a statistical technique called ""repeated-measures analysis of variance"" (ANOVA). This allows us to compare the means of each group at different points in time, taking into account the fact that some individuals may switch between groups over time.

The results show that there are significant differences between the mean belief levels of the two groups throughout the study period. Specifically, the mean belief level for group A increases over time, while the mean belief level for group B decreases. These findings suggest that exposure to the theory over time can lead to increased acceptance among those who were initially skeptical.

However, it's important to note that these results are based on observational data and do not necessarily imply causality. Other factors, such as individual characteristics or external influences, could also play a role in shaping beliefs about the theory. Therefore, further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms driving these observed patterns."

"Response: 

The above text is a simple example of a story problem that can be used to teach children about cause and effect relationships. In this case, the child learns that when they enter their combination on a lock (cause), the lock will pop open (effect). By understanding these cause-and-effect relationships, children can better understand how things work in the world around them and develop critical thinking skills."
"Response: 

The above text is a sentence in Armenian, which can be translated to English as follows: ""The crowd intensified. The father handed his son some money. The father grabbed his son's hand.""

In this example, the word order of the sentence is different from that of English, and there are also some differences in the way words are used or formed. For instance, in Armenian, the verb ""intensified"" is not used, but instead, the adjective ""intense"" is added to the noun ""crowd"". Similarly, the phrase ""handed his son"" in English becomes ""հանդեպ շունը"" (handep shune) in Armenian, where հանդեպ (handep) means ""father"", and շունը (shune) means ""son"".

Armenian has its own grammar rules and syntax, which may differ significantly from those of other languages like English. Therefore, it's important to understand these differences when translating between Armenian and English, or any other language for that matter."

"Response: 

The answer is (A) Waited for the ink to dry."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He had a nightmare.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The child woke up screaming"" does not provide enough information to determine which of the two options is correct. However, based on the context provided in the question, it is more likely that the child had a nightmare rather than wetting the bed. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two sentences that are grammatically correct but semantically incompatible. Sentence A expresses a physical action (putting one's feet up), while sentence B describes a situation where someone is sitting and being lectured. These two sentences cannot coexist in the same context without causing confusion or ambiguity. Therefore, we need to disambiguate them by adding additional information or modifying their meaning so they can be used together in a coherent way."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) I shouted his name.
B) I waved my arms."
"Response: 

Answer:

A) The government oppressed its citizens.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) The government oppressed its citizens because the sentence ""The government oppressed its citizens"" implies that the government was acting in an authoritarian or repressive manner towards its people, which led to their dissatisfaction and desire for change. This is supported by the context of the sentence, as well as the options provided."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) He was discharged from the military.

Explanation:
The sentence ""Աբգար շարք ժամը"" (Abgar shark jame) means ""The son moved away from home."" However, based on the context provided in the question, it is more likely that the correct answer is (A) He was discharged from the military.

Option (B) He offended the audience does not fit with the context of the passage, as there is no indication that the speaker's comments were intentionally insulting or hurtful to the audience."

A) She wore high heels.
B) She took off her shoes."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) Steam rose off of the pot of water.

Explanation:
The sentence ""Steam rose off of the pot of water"" is a correct and grammatically complete sentence in English. It uses the present participle form of the verb ""rise,"" which is used to describe an ongoing or continuous action. In this case, the steam is rising from the pot of water as it heats up.

Option B is incorrect because it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Covering a pot would not affect whether steam rises off of it or not. Option C is also incorrect because it changes the meaning of the sentence entirely. Instead of describing the action of steam rising, it describes the action of something being hidden under a cover. Finally, option D is incorrect because it is a nonsensical phrase that does not fit into the context of the sentence at all."
"Response:

"Response: 

Note that in this exercise, I used a different word order for the second sentence than what you would typically see in Armenian.

"Response:

"Response: 

Answer:

The correct answer is (A) The father resented his son's alcoholism.

Explanation:

In this situation, the father has a negative attitude towards his son's alcoholism and feels disrespected by it. This can be inferred from the fact that he buys his son a beer, which suggests that he may be trying to help him or encourage him in some way, but then kicks him out of the house, indicating that he does not approve of his son's behavior. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) The secretary went home for the day.

"Response: 

Answer:
A) They disappointed their fans.

Explanation:
The sentence ""They lost the tournament"" implies that the team did not perform well and failed to win the competition, which would likely disappoint their fans. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) I felt embarrassed.

Explanation:
The sentence ""My friend pointed out that I had food stuck in my teeth"" implies that the speaker was made aware of something unpleasant about their appearance (food stuck in their teeth). The word ""embarrassed"" is a common feeling people experience when they are made aware of something awkward or shameful about themselves. Therefore, option A is the best answer."

B began to cry."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) His lips were chapped.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The man took a mint"" (A) is the correct answer because it completes the story in a logical and coherent way. It explains why the man was taking a mint, which was to soothe his dry and chapped lips. This conclusion makes sense based on the information provided earlier in the story. On the other hand, option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the man was worried about bad breath. Therefore, option A is the best choice."

The sentence ""The woman stopped jogging"" indicates that the subject (woman) has come to a stop. Option A provides an explanation for why she stopped, which is a cramp in her side. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 

Answer:
A: My neighbor invited me in. (B)

Explanation:
The sentence ""I knocked on my neighbor's door"" implies that the speaker is trying to get someone's attention or gain entry into their home. The response ""My neighbor invited me in"" indicates that the neighbor welcomed the speaker inside, which is a more polite and hospitable response than simply leaving the house without an invitation."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) Her husband misunderstood her concerns.

Explanation:
The sentence ""Her husband kissed her goodbye"" (B) does not fit the context of the story as it is a positive action that contradicts the wife's frustration and concern about her husband's behavior. Therefore, option A is the best answer."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) I revealed a secret to him.

Explanation:
The sentence ""I encountered an old friend"" suggests that the speaker has come across someone they have not seen in a long time. The word ""revealed"" implies that the speaker shared something personal or hidden with this person. Therefore, option A is the best answer."

"Response: 

In this example, the subject is ""I"" and the verb is ""craved"". The object of the action is ""a glass of milk"", which is in the accusative case ( Armenian uses the nominative-accusative syntax). The second sentence has the same subject and verb as the first one, but the object is different - it's ""cookies"" in this case. The third sentence has a different subject (""was baking"") and a different verb tense (""was baking""), but the object remains the same - ""bread""."

Representative: Oh, hi there! How can I help you today?
Customer: Well, I received an email saying that my order was cancelled, but I didn't place any order. Can you tell me why?
Representative: Let me check on that for you. May I have your identification number please?
Customer: Sure, it's *insert ID number*.
Representative: Thank you. (pause) It looks like there was a mistake with your account. One of our associates accidentally cancelled your order. My apologies for the inconvenience this has caused.
Customer: Okay, so how do I get my order back?
Representative: Let me see what we can do. Can you hold on for just a moment while I transfer you to a supervisor?
Customer: Sure, thank you.
(After being transferred to a supervisor)
Supervisor: Hello, this is [supervisor's name]. I understand that there was a problem with your order. Can you tell me more about what happened?
Customer: Yes, I received an email saying that my order was cancelled, even though I never placed one.
Supervisor: I apologize for the confusion. Let me see if I can help you resolve this issue. Can you provide me with your identification number again?

A) The boy got a concussion.

Explanation:

B) The resort was on an island."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) She was afraid of needles.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) She was afraid of needles. This option best fits the situation described in the passage, as the teenager's fear of needles is mentioned explicitly. Option (B) She wanted to rebel does not fit well with the context, as there is no indication in the passage that getting a tattoo was a way for the teenager to express her desire to rebel against something."
"Response:

B) It's possible that someone stole the car and left it there on purpose to make me think it belongs to someone else."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) The volcano erupted.

Explanation:
The sentence ""Lava flowed from the volcano"" implies that the volcano is currently active and erupting, which means option A (the volcano erupted) is the correct answer. Option B (the volcano was dormant) does not fit with the context of the sentence as it suggests that the volcano was inactive, which contradicts the information provided in the sentence. Option C (the volcano will erupt) is also incorrect because it speculates about future events rather than describing a current or past event."
"Response: 

Answer key:
A) She knew everyone at the party.
B) She wanted to leave the party."

Note that in this example, both options are grammatically correct and can be used depending on the context. However, option A is more common and idiomatic in spoken Armenian, while option B may sound less natural or even awkward in some situations."

"Response: 

Answer:

Explanation:
In this sentence, the subject ""I"" exits the bedroom through the window, which means that the speaker is inside the burning house. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer."
"Response:

"Response: 

Answer:
A) He crawled in through an open window.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The boy was locked out of his house"" implies that there is a barrier preventing him from entering his home. Option A provides the most logical explanation for how he managed to gain entry - by crawling in through an open window. Options B and C are not as plausible, as they do not take into account the fact that the boy was locked out of his house."
"Response: 

The following are possible translations of the sentences into English:

A: The visitor knocked on the door.
B: The woman looked through the keyhole in the door.
As you can see, the Armenian verb forms do not match exactly with their English counterparts, and this is because Armenian has a more complex system of verb conjugation than English. However, by using the appropriate prefixes and suffixes, it is possible to convey the same meaning as in English."
"Response: 

Answer: B

Explanation:
The sentence ""He hung it in his closet"" is the correct answer because it completes the story in a logical and coherent way. Option A does not make sense as there is no mention of getting the suit dry-cleaned in the original sentence. Option B provides an unnecessary detail about hanging the suit in the closet, which does not contribute to the meaning of the sentence."
"Response: 

The girl squeezed the tube of toothpaste and it squirted out. She spat it out."
"Response:

The sentence ""Civilian deaths from the war surged"" is the correct answer because it best completes the paragraph with the given information. The other options do not fit logically or grammatically in the context of the paragraph."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) She tied the ribbon.
B) The ribbon looked babyish."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) He aged.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The man got plastic surgery"" implies that the subject underwent a cosmetic procedure to improve his appearance. However, the word ""aged"" means to become older or more mature, which contradicts the idea of the subject getting plastic surgery to look younger. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer."
"Response:

A) The egg hatched."
"Response: 

The answer is (A) He died."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He climbed up the ladder.
B) He fell off the ladder."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two sentences that are grammatically independent and convey different meanings. Sentence A expresses an action (he drank) while sentence B describes the result of that action (the can was opened). However, when combined into a single sentence using the coordinating conjunction ""but,"" the meaning changes to something entirely different: the man's belching is contrasted with his drinking. This change in meaning is known as a semantic shift or a change in valency, and it highlights the importance of understanding how words and phrases contribute to the overall meaning of a sentence."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) She lived next door to him.
B) She had a crush on him."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He incited pity.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The hungry vagrant stole food"" (line A) is the correct answer because it completes the story in a logical and coherent way. It provides a reason for why the man had no money (he was hungry), which is consistent with the context of the story. Additionally, it aligns with the tone and style of the original text, which often uses simple and direct language to convey its message."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) I called my friend to chat.
B) I felt lonely."
"Response: 

Note that in Armenian, the verb ""extend"" is not translated as ""Ապաշըլ"", but rather as ""Եղել"". Also, the word order for the imperative mood in Armenian is different from English, so you may need to adjust the sentence structure accordingly."
"Response: 

I hope you enjoy this lesson! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on anything."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) She was worried.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The girl bit her nails"" is a neutral statement that does not convey any particular emotion or feeling. Therefore, option (A) ""She was worried"" is the best answer as it provides an appropriate emotional context for the sentence. Options (B) ""She was surprised"" and (C) ""She was happy"" do not fit well with the sentence and are incorrect answers."

"Response: 

Answer:

A) Ազդեցությունն է ավելի հավանական (The student's grades improved).

Explanation:

In this sentence, we have two options for the meaning of ""received"":

1. The student received tutoring: This option is not possible because there is no information in the context about the student receiving any kind of support or help.
2. His grades improved: This option is the correct answer because it matches the information provided in the context. According to the passage, the student's grades did improve after he studied with a tutor. Therefore, the correct choice is (A) Ազդեցություνն է ավելի հավանական (The student's grades improved)."

"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) He got a paper cut."
"Response: 

Answer:

A) The nail sunk into the wood.
B) The nail became rusty."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two sentences that are similar but not identical:

* Sentence A is ""The fish bit the line."" which means that the fish took the bait and started to move towards the hook.
* Sentence B is ""The fisherman recast the line."" which means that the fisherman put a new line on his rod after catching a fish or because he wants to try a different spot.

As you can see, sentence B does not mention anything about the fish biting the line, it's just a general statement about the fisherman casting his line again. This is an example of how two sentences can be related but still convey different meanings."
"Response: 

Answer key:
A) She got a pimple.
B) She got her braces off."
"Response: 

Note that the Armenian language has a complex system of verb conjugation and declension, which can make it difficult to translate directly from English without proper knowledge of the language. In this exercise, we will focus on basic vocabulary and phrases commonly used in everyday conversation."
"Response: 

In this example, the subject of the sentence is ""I,"" and the verb is ""wiped."" The object of the sentence is ""a towel,"" which is mentioned in the indirect object position after the verb. The direct object of the sentence is ""my hands,"" which is mentioned in the direct object position before the verb.

 Armenian has a complex system of case marking, which can be challenging for learners to master. In addition to the three cases (nominative, accusative, and genitive) that are common in many languages, Armenian also has two more cases: the locative and the instrumental. These additional cases allow for greater nuance and precision in expressing the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence. For example, in the sentence ""Ամեն շունչ եղանդին է"" (""There is a dog""), the word ""dog"" is in the nominative case, indicating that it is the subject of the sentence. However, if we want to say ""The dog is on the table,"" we would use the instrumental case to indicate that the dog is performing an action (in this case, being on the table). This allows us to convey subtly different meanings depending on the context and the relationships between the words in the sentence."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) He asked her questions about herself.
B) He talked incessantly about himself."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) Her cheeks reddened.

Explanation:
The sentence ""Her cheeks reddened"" is the correct answer because it best completes the sentence based on the context provided. The phrase ""flashed a smile"" suggests that the girl was happy or smiling, and her cheeks may have become red as a result of this emotion. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response: 

Note that in this example, we are using a different set of words for each branch of the conditional sentence. This is because the Armenian language has two main types of conditional sentences: ""if"" and ""unless."" In the first type, the condition is introduced by the word ""երբ"" (erb), which means ""if,"" while in the second type, it is introduced by the phrase ""ուղեցոյց թե..."" (ughetsyoyts...), which means "" unless...""."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He walked into a puddle.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) He walked into a puddle because it best explains why the man punctured his foot. Walking into a puddle can cause someone to trip or fall and injure their foot. Stepping on broken glass does not explain why the man punctured his foot."

Answer:

A) The board of directors dissolved the company.

Explanation:

The sentence ""The CEO of the company resigned"" implies that the CEO left their position willingly or by choice. However, if the board of directors had to dissolve the company due to financial difficulties or other reasons, it would mean that the company is no longer operational and has been dismantled. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer."

"Response: 

Answer: B - The can got crushed."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) She learned to use a computer.

Explanation:
In this sentence, ""Ա"" represents the subject of the sentence, which is ""the girl."" The verb ""joined"" is in the third person singular form, indicating that it refers to one person. Therefore, the correct choice for option (A) is ""She learned to use a computer."" Option (B) does not fit grammatically as it uses the second person pronoun ""you,"" which does not match with the first person subject ""she."" Similarly, option (C) does not make sense in the context of the sentence as it implies that the girl learned something else entirely."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two sentences: ""My mood improved"" and ""I listened to music."" The first sentence is in the past tense, while the second sentence is in the present tense. To form a compound sentence using these two sentences, we need to use a conjunction (in this case, ""but"") to connect them. So, the resulting compound sentence would be: ""But my mood improved after listening to music."" This sentence combines the information from both of the original sentences in a coherent way, creating a new meaning that is greater than the sum of its parts."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) They fed the homeless."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) The passengers giggled.

Explanation:
In this sentence, the verb ""plunged"" indicates a sudden and rapid descent, which can cause fear or excitement in the passengers. However, the context does not suggest that the passengers were afraid or scared. Instead, they are described as giggling, which implies that they were enjoying themselves. Therefore, option (A) is the best choice."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) Leaders of other countries formed an alliance.

Explanation:
The sentence ""Leaders of other countries formed an alliance"" is the correct answer because it best completes the paragraph with the given information. The paragraph describes a natural disaster that affected the country and mentions leaders of other countries sending emergency relief. Forming an alliance would be a logical step for these leaders to take in order to coordinate their efforts and provide more effective support to the affected country."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) It was due to be returned to the library."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He was thrown in jail.
B) He was convicted of murder."
"Response: 

In this example, we have two verbs in the main clause: ""entered"" and ""unlocked"". The first verb is in the active voice, while the second one is in the passive voice. To form the comparative degree of the adjective ""active"", we need to use a special suffix -ier, which is added to the stem of the adjective. In this case, the stem of ""active"" is ""activ-"", so the comparative degree would be ""more activ-"".

As for the prepositional phrase ""of entering"", it functions as an attribute to the verb ""entered"", providing more information about the action being described. In this case, the preposition ""of"" indicates that the action of entering refers to the act of entering something or some place."

"Response: 

In this example, the editor has changed ""compelling"" to ""unclear,"" and added a note explaining why they made that change."
"Response: 

Answer: B
Explanation: Based on the context of the sentence, option B is the correct answer. The sentence states that the woman ""realized the card was expired,"" which means she canceled it because it had reached its expiration date and was no longer valid for use. Option A is incorrect because it implies that the card was stolen or lost, which is not mentioned in the sentence."

"Response: 

Answer:

A) He was frugal with his earnings.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The man's family lived in poverty"" implies that the man did not have a high income, and therefore he was frugal with his earnings to make ends meet. Option B is incorrect because it does not provide any information about the man's financial situation or why he might be living in poverty. Option C is also incorrect because it does not explain how the man's financial situation relates to his being frugal with his earnings."

"Response: 

Answer:

A) Ավելի հավանական (The hostage was released).

Option A is the correct answer because it means that the hostage was released, which is the opposite of what happened in the situation described in the passage. Option B does not fit the context of the passage and cannot be used to describe the outcome of the situation. Options C and D are also incorrect because they do not convey the meaning of the sentence."
"Response: 

The musician played a lively melody on his instrument, and the sound of it echoed through the hall. As he played, he tapped his foot in time with the beat, creating a rhythmic pattern that was both energetic and mesmerizing. At times, he pounded the drums with such force that the vibrations seemed to shake the very foundations of the building. Despite the intensity of his playing, however, the musician remained completely focused and in control, his movements fluid and precise as he poured his heart and soul into every note."

"Response: 

In this example, we have two sentences in Armenian: ""The cat chased the bird"" (A) and ""The bird caught a worm"" (B). By using the conjunction ""but,"" we are contrasting these two sentences and highlighting their differences. In this case, the first sentence describes an action that resulted in the bird escaping, while the second sentence describes an action that resulted in the bird obtaining something else entirely. This juxtaposition creates a sense of surprise or unexpectedness, which is the primary function of the conjunction ""but."""
"Response: 

Answer:

A) The school year ended.
B) She moved to a new town."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) The owner appointed a new manager.

Explanation:
In this situation, the owner of the factory refuses to raise employees' wages despite their hard work and dedication. To address this issue, the owner appoints a new manager who can help improve the working conditions and compensate the employees fairly. This solution is more effective than going on strike or protesting, as it addresses the root cause of the problem directly."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) The extremists influenced him.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The leader antagonized the extremists among his country"" implies that the leader's actions or policies had a negative impact on the extremist groups within his country. Therefore, option (A) is the best fit for the blank space. Options (B) and (C) do not make sense in this context as they are not related to the idea of influencing the extremists. Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the leader was killed by the extremists, which is not mentioned in the original sentence."

Answer:
A) He got a cavity.

The child landed on the trampoline and bounced back up into the air with ease. Deciding to try something more challenging, she attempted a flip in mid-air. As she rotated through the air, her body became a blur of motion, and for a moment, it seemed as though she would successfully complete the trick. But just as she was about to land safely on the trampoline once again, she lost control and crashed to the ground with a thud. Ouch!"

"Response: 

Answer:
A) His mother sent him to his room.
B) His mother put a bandage on the wound."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He signed his will.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The man survived the deadly illness"" implies that the subject of the sentence has already gone through a dangerous and potentially life-threatening experience, which is why it does not fit with option B (he received an organ transplant). Option C (he was cured) also does not make sense in this context because being cured from an illness means that one no longer has the disease, but it does not necessarily mean that they have survived a deadly illness. Therefore, the only logical choice is option A (he signed his will), as signing a will typically indicates that someone has come to terms with their mortality and is preparing for the end of their life."
"Response: 

Note that in Armenian, the verb ""to bite"" is not translated as ""պատաշխան"", but rather as ""բերգել"". So, the correct answer for option B should be ""բերգել""."

"Response: 

Answer:

A) She identified the patient's symptoms.

Explanation:

Option A is the correct answer because it describes the action of the physician in identifying the patient's symptoms, which is a crucial step in making an accurate diagnosis. Option B does not accurately describe the physician's actions as it mentions ""prescribing pills"" which is not related to identifying the patient's symptoms."
"Response: 

In this example, the subject of the sentence is ""I,"" and the verb is ""scratched."" The object of the sentence is ""my skin,"" which is the direct object of the verb. The prepositional phrase ""it was sweaty"" modifies the verb ""scratched,"" providing additional information about the circumstances under which the action took place. Finally, the adverbial phrase ""It felt itchy"" provides more information about how the action made me feel."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He lost his temper.
B) He suffered a heart attack."
"Response: 

In this example, the word order is different from that of a simple sentence in Armenian. Instead of saying ""The man's arm muscles bulged,"" we say ""He flexed his arms."" This is because the verb ""flex"" is in the third person singular form (he), and it agrees with the subject ""man"" in number. Similarly, instead of saying ""He rubbed his arms,"" we say ""He rubbed his arms."" In Armenian, the verb agreement between the subject and the auxiliary verb is marked by changing the form of the verb."
"Response: 

Answer: B) He felt discouraged."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) I excused my colleague's blunder.

Explanation:
The sentence ""I excused my colleague's blunder"" is the best fit for the blank space in the sentence. The word ""excused"" means to forgive or justify someone's mistake, which aligns with the context of the sentence where the speaker is explaining why they didn't reprimand their colleague for making a mistake."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) He began exercising more.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The man quit smoking"" implies that the subject has stopped doing something, which in this case is smoking. This means that they have made a change in their behavior. The next part of the sentence ""and he began exercising more"" suggests that the person has taken on a new habit or activity, which is exercising more. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer."

"Response: 

Answer:
A) He discovered rats in the basement.

Explanation:
The sentence ""Ա շարքերը"" (A sharker) refers to a rat, which is a common pest that can infest homes and buildings. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 

Answer: B

Explanation:

The sentence ""I suggested to my houseguest that we go out to dinner"" implies that the speaker is hosting someone in their home and wants to take them out for a meal. The phrase ""overstayed her welcome"" suggests that the guest has stayed longer than they were invited or expected to stay, which could be seen as rude or disrespectful. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) She started hiding the diary."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) She worked overtime.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The woman was short on money for rent"" implies that the woman did not have enough money to pay her rent. Option A provides a plausible reason why she might be in this situation - she worked overtime to earn extra money. Options B and C do not provide any logical explanation for the woman's financial difficulties."

Correct Answer: B - The ice cream dripped from the cone.

2. Ենտրություν A: The ice cream lost its flavor.

Context Clue: The sentence implies that the ice cream used to have flavor but no longer does. Therefore, the answer must be something related to loss of taste.

Correct Answer: A - The ice cream lost its flavor.

3. Հիմնվելով այս նախադրյալի վրա, ո՞ր ազդեցությունն է ավելի հավանական:...

Answer:
A) She ran into a childhood friend."
"Response: 

Answer:

A) He submitted the paper early.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) because it best completes the sentence with a meaningful and coherent phrase. ""He submitted the paper early"" makes sense in the context of the sentence and provides a clear explanation for why the student procrastinated on the paper. Option (B) does not make sense in this context as there is no evidence to suggest that the student submitted the paper incomplete."

The above table shows that in this situation, the criminal's action (putting down the gun) is more likely to lead to a peaceful resolution than the victim's action (raising his hands).

"Response: 

Answer:

A) I looked forward to the weekend.

Explanation:

In this sentence, ""I looked forward"" is in the past tense and indicates that the speaker was eagerly anticipating something in the future (the weekend). The verb ""looked"" is in the simple past tense, while ""forward"" is in the infinitive form.

The underlined phrase "" planned to attend"" is a subordinate clause, which provides additional information about the speaker's plans for the weekend. It is in the present perfect tense, indicating an action that started in the past and continues up to the present moment."

B) People hid underground."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He went home for the day.

Explanation:
The sentence ""Ապագան շաբաթաթիվ"" (He went home for the day) is a more appropriate translation of ""Նախադրյալ"" than either ""Թեղափոխություն"" or ""Հիմնվելով"". This is because ""Նախադրյալ"" specifically refers to the end of an employee's workday, and therefore implies that they have left their place of employment."

Answer:
A) The man put away the groceries in the refrigerator.
B) The man took the pizza out of the oven."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) She slacked off.
Explanation:
The sentence ""She set an ambitious goal"" implies that the woman had a clear objective in mind and was determined to achieve it. However, the phrase ""slacked off"" suggests that she did not put in enough effort or dedication to reach her goal, which resulted in her falling short of her ambition. Therefore, option (A) is the best choice."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) His son got into legal trouble.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The wealthy man died of old age"" does not provide any information about the cause of death or any other event that might have led to the man's demise. Therefore, option (A) is the best choice because it suggests a specific reason for the man's death, which is consistent with the context provided in the sentence.

Option (B) is incorrect because inheritance is not mentioned anywhere in the sentence. Option (C) is also incorrect because there is no mention of the man's son getting into legal trouble in the sentence."

Այս գիտությունը շատ շատ շատ շատ..."
"Response: 

Answer: B
Explanation: Based on the context, option B is the correct answer. The sentence ""She folded her laundry"" implies that the woman had a lot of clothes to deal with and needed more space, which is consistent with the meaning of the original sentence. Option A does not make sense in this context as it refers to acquiring a large number of clothes, which is opposite of what the situation describes."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) His wife gave birth."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He became qualified for the job he wanted.

Explanation:
The sentence ""He obtained a degree"" means that the man earned or received a degree, which is an academic qualification. However, in this context, it does not make sense as the man already has a job and is looking to get promoted. Therefore, option (A) is the best answer. Option (B) is incorrect because the man's job offer being rescinded does not relate to his obtaining a degree. Option (C) is also incorrect because there is no information in the passage about the man's current job or position."
"Response: 

Answer:
A) He greeted the audience.
B) He spoke into the microphone."
"Response: 

The probability of each outcome is as follows:

A: 0.6 (coin sinks)
B: 0.4 (coin breaks in half)

So, the expected value of this experiment is:

E(outcome) = P(outcome) × reward for that outcome
= 0.6 × 0
= 0

Therefore, on average, you will not gain anything by tossing a coin into the fountain of water."
"Response: 

The game is played as follows:

1. Player hits the ball from a position on the field (not necessarily near the hole).
2. If the ball goes into the hole, the player scores one point and their turn ends.
3. If the ball does not go into the hole, it will either bounce off the ground or roll backwards towards the player (depending on which side of the hole it landed on). In this case, the player's turn continues.
4. Players take turns hitting the ball until they score a point or until all balls have been used up (in which case the game ends).
5. The first player to score three points wins the game.

Note that the Armenian language version of the instructions uses different words for ""hit"" and ""retreat"", but these translations are equivalent and can be used interchangeably."

A) A tsunami occurred.

Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) A tsunami occurred because of the following reasons:

* The sentence ""A meteorite landed in the ocean"" indicates that a large object has fallen into the water.
* The word ""tsunami"" is mentioned in option (A), which means a large wave caused by an underwater disturbance, such as a meteorite impact.
* Option (B) does not mention anything about a tsunami occurring.
* Option (C) mentions hail, but it is not related to a tsunami.
* Option (D) is incorrect because there is no information in the given sentence about a pataschan (a type of storm)."
"Response: 

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) She became dehydrated.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The hiker encountered a poisonous snake"" implies that the hiker was in a dangerous situation and had to take action to protect herself. Becoming dehydrated is a common consequence of hiking in hot weather or during physical activity, especially if one does not drink enough water. Therefore, option (A) is the best explanation for the given sentence."

Sentence A describes the action as ""I turned the oven on,"" while sentence B describes it as ""I put the dish in the oven."" These two sentences are equivalent and convey the same meaning, but they use different verbs to express the action. This is known as synonymy or lexical substitution, where two words or phrases with similar meanings can be used interchangeably in a sentence."

Answer:
The correct answer is (A) The country discovered new land.

Explanation:
The sentence ""The country discovered new land"" implies that the country found something previously unknown or unexplored, which fits with the meaning of ""նախադրյալ"" as a discovery or exploration. On the other hand, options (B) and (C) do not fit the context of the sentence, as they imply either abandoning or colonizing land, respectively, which are different meanings from the original word. Option (D) is incorrect because it means to give up or relinquish something, which does not match the context of the sentence."

In this example, we have two sentences that are grammatically independent and can stand alone as separate sentences. However, they are connected by a conjunction (and) to form a compound sentence.

 Armenian has several types of conjunctions, including:

1. Անպաշտպան (anpashTPan): This is a general-purpose conjunction used to connect words or phrases in a sentence. Examples include ""and,"" ""but,"" ""or,"" etc.
2. Մեկը (mek`e): This conjunction is used to connect two equal clauses in a sentence. For example, ""I like coffee, tea"" would be written as ""Մեկը գործողությունն թեյ.""
3. Սաiből (sa bib): This conjunction is used to connect two unequal clauses in a sentence. For example, ""He likes music, but I don't"" would be written as ""Սաբիբ երբ մեն եմ.""
4. Համար (hamar): This conjunction is used to connect two clauses in a sentence where one clause is a condition and the other is its consequence. For example, ""If you study hard, you will pass the exam"" would be written as ""Համար թեյ շնորհակալություն.""
5. Մեկը համար (mek`e hamar): This conjunction is similar to համար, but it is used to connect two clauses where one is a condition and the other is its consequence, and both clauses are in the same tense. For example, ""If he studies hard, he will pass the exam"" would be written as ""Մեկը համար թեյ շնորհակալություν.""
