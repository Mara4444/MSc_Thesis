Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the termites ate away at the wood of the house (option B).
"Response:  Option B: The agent of the patrol accused them of smuggling. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the agent of the patrol will accuse the travelers of smuggling rather than checking their passports. This is because the mention of ""frontera"" (border) suggests that the travelers are crossing an international border, and therefore they may be carrying items that are illegal to transport across borders without proper documentation or authorization."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It was a holiday) is more likely. The sentence implies that the office was closed for a holiday or special occasion, rather than because it was summer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (She jumped over the rope) is more likely as it suggests that she was physically active and energetic enough to jump over a rope, whereas Option A (She played checkers) does not convey any information about her physical energy levels.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She sallied out of the line) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La chica se pellizcó la nariz,"" it is more likely that Option A (El bebé babeó en su babero) is correct because a baby's reaction to touching its nose would be to babble or make cooing sounds, rather than getting dirty in their diaper."
"Response: 
Option B: El público escuchó cortésmente en silencio. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the band played their hit song, but there is no indication that the audience was particularly enthusiastic or engaged in the performance. It is more likely that they listened politely in silence rather than applauding along with the music."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (La niña le trajo una manzana al maestro) is more likely. The fact that the girl brought her teacher a gift suggests that she wanted to express her gratitude in a tangible way. It's unlikely that she would stay after school for no reason.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the young campers were scared by their counselor's story of ghosts (Option A). The mention of toasting marshmallows in the fog suggests a campfire setting, which could be a common activity at summer camps. However, the focus on the counselor's story of ghosts implies that the fear experienced by the young campers was caused by something other than just the marshmallow toasting. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man has a concussion (Option B). The premise states that the man ""se golpeó la cabeza,"" indicating that he hit his head, which can cause a concussion or other forms of brain injury.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Él envió un correo electrónico masivo) is more likely. The man's email inbox was full of spam, indicating that he may have sent a mass email to someone or something. This is more plausible than him deleting the spam, as it would be unlikely for him to delete all of the spam emails in his inbox at once.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El marinero estaba en cuarentena,"" it is more likely that he was exposed to the disease (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She memorized the code) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""He vertido el agua en el vaso,"" it is more likely that option A, ""El agua saciaba mi sed,"" occurred. This is because the act of pouring water into a glass suggests that someone was thirsty and needed to drink something to quench their thirst. Therefore, option A is the most logical choice given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Quería ofrecerle apoyo a su amigo) is more likely. The man remained silent because he wanted to offer support to his friend, rather than being lost in thought.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Me sentía culpable) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that there was a broken link (eslabón roto) in the chain rather than the chain being wrapped around a tire (envuelta alrededor de un neumático). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Se cansaron de discutir) is more likely to be the correct answer because it suggests that the couple became tired of discussing their problems and decided to make a compromise instead of addressing them directly.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She hired a campaign manager) is more likely. 
Explanation: The premise states that she decided to run for office, indicating that she wants to take an active role in politics. Hiring a campaign manager would be a logical step towards achieving this goal, as they can help her manage her campaign and provide strategic advice. Testifying in court, on the other hand, does not seem directly related to running for office."

Explanation: According to the premise, the man packed warm clothes in his suitcase, indicating that he was prepared for cold weather during his trip. Therefore, option A is more likely."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Los ojos del hombre lloraron,"" option A (Se le metió polvo en los ojos) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""los ojos del hombre"" suggests that a human being's eyes are involved, and polvo (dust) is a common irritant that can cause eye discomfort or even tearing. Therefore, it is more plausible that polvo got into the person's eyes rather than them putting on glasses ( Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Su oponente la acusó de hacer trampa) is the correct answer. The premise states that the player won five games in a row, which suggests that they are in a competitive situation where there may be an incentive to accuse their opponent of cheating in order to gain an advantage.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the student's answers were incorrect) is a more likely explanation for why the teacher tore up the student's exam. The premise does not provide any evidence to suggest that the teacher cheated or tricked the student, only that the student's answers were wrong. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice.
"Response: 
Option B: Me quedé sin aliento.
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker was unable to continue speaking due to lack of breath or ""me quedé sin aliento."" This suggests that option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (putting it in the microwave) is a more likely cause of thawing frozen food than option B (covering it with plastic wrap). This is because microwaves are designed to heat up food quickly and evenly, which can help to speed up the thawing process. Covering the food with plastic wrap may actually slow down the thawing process by trapping in cold air and preventing the food from coming into contact with warm temperatures.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the employee was faking being sick to avoid work. Therefore, option A (he had stomach cramps) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She jumped from the diving board) is more likely. The fact that she landed in the pool suggests that she was not running or jumping from the deck of the pool, but rather from a higher platform such as the diving board. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La película recibió malas críticas) is more likely. The passage states that the movie ""se agotó,"" which means it sold out quickly, indicating high demand. This suggests that the movie was well-received and popular among audiences, rather than receiving bad reviews."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (La gente lo elogiaba) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Las manos de la niña se le hicieron ampollas,"" option B (She climbed up a rope) is more likely as it suggests an action that could potentially cause injury to her hands. Option A (She wrote a letter) does not suggest any physical harm or injury."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the acrobat balancing on a tightrope) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the artist was performing a ""malabaristic"" act, which typically refers to aerial or circus acts involving acrobatic feats such as tightrope walking, juggling, and other forms of physical skill. Therefore, it is more likely that the acrobat would have been balancing on a tightrope rather than riding a unicycle."

"Response: 
Option B: Negociated a treaty.

"Response:  Option A - Se puso somnoliente.
Explanation: The premise states that ""el hombre"" took a sleeping pill, indicating that he became drowsy or fell asleep. This is more likely to be the correct answer than option B, which suggests that he had fever."
"Response:  Option B: Se lastimó la rodilla.
Explanation: The woman crashed into the sofa, which means she hit it with her body. Since her leg was closest to the sofa when she collided with it, it's more likely that she injured her rodilla (knee) than the sofa's leg got loose."
"Response:  Option B: El globo se fue volando.
Explanation: The premise states that the child squeezed the balloon, implying that it was inflated to some extent. If the balloon had already broken (option A), there would be no air left in it to make it fly away (option B). Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They went to the airport) is more likely. The premise mentions that they checked into a hotel, but it doesn't mention anything about unpacking their luggage or going to the airport. Therefore, it is more likely that they went to the airport after checking in at the hotel.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Me mordí el melocotón,"" it is more likely that the fruit was bitten than that it got crushed or spilled. Therefore, Option A (El melocotón está magullado) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mis manos se pusieron pegajosas,"" it is more likely that option A (Me comí un donut) is the correct answer. The phrase ""se pusieron pegajosas"" suggests that something sticky or gooey happened to the speaker's hands, which could be caused by eating a donut."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Yo empujé la puerta,"" it is more likely that option A, ""La puerta se abrió."" When someone pushes a door, it is expected that the door will open rather than remain closed. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Me derramé vino en la camisa,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Me cambié de camisa,"" occurred. This is because spilling wine on one's shirt would typically require changing into a new shirt rather than putting on a different type of clothing like a delantal."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El cajero abrió la caja registradora,"" it is more likely that option B, ""El cliente le dio el dinero,"" occurred. The cashier opened the register, indicating that a transaction took place."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (La gente le dio cambio) is more likely. The phrase ""la gente le dio cambio"" means that people gave him money in exchange for his music, indicating that he was successful in attracting a crowd with his performance. Option B (""Él despidió a la multitud"") does not align with this interpretation as it implies that he dismissed or left the crowd, which is unlikely given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El niño lloró a su niñera,"" it is more likely that Option A (Echa de menos a sus padres) is the correct answer. The fact that the child cried to its nanny suggests that the child may be feeling homesick or missing its parents, rather than being hungry for lunchtime."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the pilot flew through the storm (Option B). The radar of the pilot detected a storm, indicating that the pilot was in close proximity to the storm system. Given the potential danger posed by flying through a storm, it is unlikely that the pilot would have simply flown away from it without taking any action to avoid or mitigate the risks involved. Therefore, Option B is the more likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El árbol derrama sus hojas,"" it is more likely that the leaves will change color (Option A). The premise does not suggest any accumulation of leaves in the ground, as there is no mention of a sudden or excessive release of leaves from the tree."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (decided to make his sister laugh) is more likely. The boy was in a bad mood, so he might have wanted to cheer himself up by making someone else laugh.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Su padre le dio una gaseosa para beber) will happen because the child complained about having to go to the bathroom, not needing a rest stop or fuel for their car.

"Response:  Option B: She participated in a protest. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""the woman's political opinions changed,"" indicating that she became more politically active or engaged in activism. Participating in a protest is a common form of political activism, especially for women who want to express their views on social issues. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Los pasajeros bajaron del tren,"" option A is more likely. The passengers got off the train, indicating that it arrived at its destination.  "
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B (Él selló el sobre) occurred because there is no mention of a stamp or seal in the premise. Therefore, it makes sense that he simply closed the over without any additional action taken to secure its contents.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she was fired from her job due to mismanagement of company funds (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Escuché el tictac del reloj) is more likely because it directly follows from the premise ""Miré el reloj"". The other option, ""Quería ver la hora"", does not follow logically from the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I wrote the essay by hand) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El cerrojo se apretó,"" option B (He girado la llave inglesa) is the most likely cause. The premise suggests that something happened to the lock or the mechanism of the door, rather than simply changing the lock itself. Girando la llave inglés implies turning the key in the lock, which could be what caused the door to jam or become difficult to open."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option B will occur - The city condemned the apartment.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Quería ver la puesta de sol) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for the woman to be sitting outside in the evening. The other option, Option B (Ella pensó que vio un rayo), does not provide any logical explanation for her actions.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the water was too shallow) is more likely. The man wearing a life jacket in the water suggests that he knew how to swim or had some other means of staying afloat, so it's unlikely that he didn't know how to swim. Therefore, option A (he didn't know how to swim) is less likely.
"Response:  Option B: She pressed the backspace key.
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman made an error in the processor of text. Pressing the backspace key would be a common action taken to correct errors in typing, making it the more likely option."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ella tiene una mala nota) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El césped estaba fangoso,"" it is more likely that Option A: Llovió toda la noche was the cause. The word ""fangoso"" means ""muddy"" or "" soggy,"" so it suggests that heavy rain may have fallen overnight, causing the grass to become muddy."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (she forgot to set her alarm clock) is a more plausible explanation for why she overslept than Option A (she spent the night in a hotel). Therefore, the answer is B.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre se puso protector solar,"" option A (Se sentó a la sombra) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Los investigadores se retractaron de la teoría) will occur. The passage states that ""the theory has been widely accepted for decades,"" indicating that many people have invested time and effort into studying and understanding this idea. If new evidence were to emerge that challenged the theory's validity, it is possible that some or many of these individuals would choose to retract their support for the theory rather than abandoning it entirely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (El juego entró en tiempo extra) is more likely because it directly follows from the fact that fans booed the game entering into overtime.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""He introduced my combination into the lock,"" option A (Yo cerré la cerradura) is the most likely outcome. The action of introducing a key or combination into a lock implies that someone has attempted to open it, so it's reasonable to assume that they were successful in doing so. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (El padre agarró la mano de su hijo) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He limpió la nieve) is more likely because it implies that the speaker was able to clear the snow from the path, making it easier for them to walk through. Option A (Reuni la nieve en una bola de nieve) does not necessarily imply that the speaker was able to remove the snow from the path.
"Response:  Option B: El kayak se ha golpeado con una ola.  
Explanation: The premise states that los kayakistas remaban sus remos, indicating that they are paddling their kayaks. This implies that the kayaks are moving through the water, which increases the likelihood of them encountering waves. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur."
"Response:  Option B: She crashed into a wall.
Explanation: The premise states that she lost control of her bike, which suggests that she may have been traveling at a high speed or in an unsafe manner. As a result, it is more likely that she would crash into something like a wall rather than simply letting go of the handlebars."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""He encendido el ventilador,"" it is more likely that option B (Sentí el aire fresco pasar por encima de mí) occurred. This is because turning on the fan would create a cooling breeze."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They were wet) is more likely. The premise states that ""the surfers returned to the beach,"" implying that they had been in the water and gotten wet. It does not mention anything about seeing a shark or being scared, which suggests that they were simply tired from their surfing session and wanted to get out of the water. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (El agua se vació de la bañera) is more likely. When you remove the plug from a bathtub drain, water will empty out of the bathtub, not spray onto the floor.
"Response:  Option B: Él le confesó su infidelidad.  
Explanation: The premise states that the husband felt guilty for cheating on his wife, indicating that he has been unfaithful. Therefore, option B is more likely as it aligns with the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Derramé agua en el cartel) is more likely to be the correct cause because it directly addresses the problem of the tinta having been manchada by something. Option A (Esperé a que se secara la tinta) does not address the issue of the tinta being manchada but rather waits for it to dry before taking action.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El niño se despertó gritando,"" it is more likely that he had a nightmare (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El niño puso sus pies sobre la mesa,"" it is more likely that Option A (Su padre se sentó a la mesa) occurred because putting one's feet on a table usually indicates sitting or standing near it."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (grité su nombre) occurred. The sentence suggests that the speaker's friend turned their head in the direction of the speaker, implying that they heard something, such as a shout or noise. Option B (agitó los brazos) does not provide any context for why the friend would turn their head in the speaker's direction.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A: The citizens rebelled.  
Explanation: The premise states that the government oppressed its citizens, which suggests that there was already some level of unrest or discontent among the population. Rebellion is a common response to oppression, so it is more likely that this option occurred rather than people registering to vote, as this would not necessarily address the underlying issue of government oppression."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the child cried out for help (Option B). The premise states that the child got lost in the forest, which implies a sense of confusion and fear. Crying out for help would be a natural response to this situation, whereas setting up a store might not be feasible or practical for a lost child.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She wanted to learn how to draw) is more likely. The woman's motivation for traveling abroad is not related to learning about other cultures but rather to develop her artistic skills by studying drawing in another country.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Su compañero de trabajo fue ascendido) is more likely to be the cause of the man's jealousy. The premise mentions that the man was ""celoso"" of his coworker, implying that he felt threatened or insecure about something related to him. Ascending a colleague to a higher position within the company can create feelings of resentment or insecurity among other employees, especially if they feel overlooked or undervalued themselves. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's jealousy stemmed from his perception of his coworker's success rather than their work hours."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Él estaba alucinando) is the correct answer. The man's claim of being a witness to extraterrestrial beings seems unlikely and could be explained by him experiencing some kind of hallucination or delusion.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he put lejía (dye) in his hair, rather than champú (shampoo). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option B: She felt a sudden surge of inspiration.
Explanation: The premise states that the artist created a new work, indicating that she was feeling inspired and motivated to create something new. Option A suggests that she criticized her previous work, which does not align with the premise as it implies a negative sentiment towards her own work. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Fue dado de baja del ejército) is the correct answer. The son moved out of his parents' house, indicating that he may have left the military service.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (a terremoto sacudió la estantería) is more likely. The books falling off the shelf due to a natural disaster like an earthquake (terremoto in Spanish) makes more sense than the other option, as it provides a plausible reason for the books to fall without any additional context or details.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He reiniciado el interruptor) is more likely. The premise states that the power went out in the house, which means that the circuit breaker or fuse may have tripped or blown, causing the power to go out. Reinicing the circuit breaker or fuse box would be a common solution to restore power to the house. Option A (Encendi una luz) does not address the cause of the power outage and is unlikely to solve the problem.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""We have built in the roller coaster,"" it is more likely that Option B (Seemed fun) is correct."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (He echado mantequilla en la bolsa) caused the bag of corn chips to burst. Mantequilla (butter) does not have any special properties that would make it explosive or flammable, so it is unlikely that it was the cause of the burst bag. On the other hand, microwaving the bag could potentially heat up the contents inside, causing them to expand and potentially leading to an explosion. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (El pronóstico predijo fuertes vientos) is more likely. The fallen tree would cause a disruption in the electrical line, leading to a power outage in the neighborhood. Fuertes vientos are also more likely to occur during storms, making it the most plausible explanation for the fallen tree.
"Response: 
Option B: Él ofendió a la audiencia. 
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker made politically incorrect comments, which are likely to offend someone in the audience. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that a little sweat (sudor) formed on my face than blood appeared on my finger. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Un poco de sudor me goteó de la cara.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El pez flotaba en la superficie del tanque,"" it is more likely that the fish was dead (Option B). The fact that the fish is floating to the surface suggests that it has died and is now at the surface of the tank rather than swimming there."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Tenía un resfriado) is the correct answer. The man's rough voice could be due to a cold or flu rather than him having stopped smoking.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Las puertas del ascensor se abrieron"", it is more likely that option A is correct, as the ascender arrived at the designated floor."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option B (Sus padres lo pusieron en castigo) is the correct answer. The premise states that the teenager escaped from the house, implying that he may have done something wrong or disobedient to warrant punishment from his parents. Option A (Él mintió a sus padres) does not align with this inference as there is no indication in the premise that the teenager lied to his parents.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (El inodoro se desbordó) is the more likely cause of the flooded bathroom. The premise mentions that the bathroom is flooded, but does not provide any information about a broken water heater or other potential causes. Therefore, it is more likely that the overflowing toilet caused the flooding.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (El dueño puso un collar en el cachorro) is correct because a collar is something that can be put around a dog's neck to keep them close, whereas a correa is a type of leash used to walk a dog. Therefore, if the dog was near its owner, it is more likely that the owner had placed a collar on the dog rather than using a correa to keep it close.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre vio su reflejo,"" option B is more likely. The man stopped over the lake to see his reflection. Option A does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of an extensive tree near the lake."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La llamé de vuelta) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that their dog escaped from home (Option A). The family searched the neighborhood to find their dog, indicating that they were looking for something or someone outside of their home rather than something inside their home.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vi mi aliento cuando exhalaba,"" option A (The time was cold) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""mi aliento"" refers to breathing or respiration, which is affected by temperature changes in the body. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker felt cold when they breathed out than their chest being squeezed."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (wanted better working conditions) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""He hace un pastel de manzana,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Un olor a putrefacción llenó la cocina,"" will occur because making a apple pie involves using ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, and butter, which can produce an unpleasant odor if not prepared properly. Therefore, it is possible that an unpleasant smell filled the kitchen after he made the apple pie."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (she took off her shoes) is a more plausible cause for why she struggled to walk because it would be easier to move around without the added weight of high heels.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El vapor se elevó de la olla de agua,"" it is more likely that option A, ""El agua hirvió,"" caused the steam to rise from the pot of water. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) El agua hirvió."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Yo llevaba sandalias) is correct because if all of my socks were in the laundry, it is unlikely that I would have been wearing sandals.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he lost the support of the voters (Option A). The politician's argument was considered absurd, indicating that it may have been unpopular or lacking in substance, leading to a loss of confidence among the electorate.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (La pareja se escapó) is more likely. The fact that everyone disapproved of their relationship suggests a level of tension or conflict in their dynamic, which could lead to one partner feeling trapped or unhappy enough to want to escape.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the millionaire contributed funds to build it) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the salesman saw the girl putting merchandise in her bag) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Los soldados fueron enviados a luchar) is more likely. The country declaring war means that there will be military action involved, rather than soldiers reuniting with their families.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Se desató un motín frente al juzgado) is more likely. The use of the word ""confirmó"" in the premise suggests that the court's decision was finalized or confirmed, leading to a reaction from those who disagree with it. This could manifest as a protest or outburst, such as a motín (mob violence). In contrast, Option B (Una pareja intercambió votos frente al juzgado) does not align with the context provided and seems less plausible given the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dejó las galletas en el horno) is more likely because it implies that she left something in the oven, which could have caused a fire or smoke.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La lluvia estaba cayendo a picadas,"" option A (the storm worsened) is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the elevator stopped working) caused the building to be evacuated. The alarm system may have been triggered by a malfunction in the elevator or another part of the building's electrical systems, but the elevator itself stopping functioning would likely result in an immediate evacuation order from building management or emergency services.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option B, ""El padre echó a su hijo de la casa,"" will occur because the father's resentment towards his son's alcoholism may lead him to take drastic measures such as kicking him out of the house."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The elevator was out of service) is more likely. The premise mentions that the lawyer ""subbed up the stairs to her office,"" implying that there was no available elevator for her to use. Therefore, it is more likely that the elevator was out of service than that the secretary went home early."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Su amigo lo interrumpió) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a clear reason for why the man was upset with his friend.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (El cajero le dio al cambio a la chica) is more likely. The premise states that the girl gave her money to the cashier, so it makes sense that the cashier would give her change in return. Option B (El cajero se olvidó de darle a la chica un recibo) does not align with this scenario as there is no indication that the cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ella quedó paralizada en un accidente) is the more likely cause for why a woman was put in a wheelchair. This is because an accident or injury can result in paralysis, making it more plausible that she would need to use a wheelchair as a mobility aid than if she were admitted to the hospital via ambulance or stretcher.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (the country was facing economic difficulties) is the correct answer. The fact that citizens are hanging flags outside their homes suggests a sense of national pride or solidarity, but it does not necessarily indicate that the country is celebrating an independence day or commemorating any other significant event. Economic hardship could be a reason why people would feel compelled to show their patriotism in this way.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ellos decepcionaron a sus fans) is correct. The team's loss in the tournament would likely have disappointed their fans rather than inspiring them.
"Response:  Option B: Me sentí orgulloso.
Explanation: The premise ""Mi amigo me dijo que tenía comida atrapada entre los dientes"" implies that the speaker's friend told them they had food stuck between their teeth. This is a humiliating situation, so option A (Me sentí avergonzado) is the less likely choice. Therefore, option B (Me sentí orgulloso) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he forgot to study than that he paid attention in class. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (a terremoto) is more likely to be the cause of the building's collapse than option B (an increase in crime rate).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She presented him to her parents) is more likely. This is because the premise mentions that she broke up with him, indicating that their relationship has ended, and therefore it makes sense for her to introduce him to her parents as someone she no longer wants to be associated with. Option A (He begged her to take him back) does not align with this scenario as it implies that he is still trying to win her back, which may not be the case if they have already broken up.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Sus cabezas chocaron) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Había cartón en el cubo de basura) is more likely because it provides additional information that supports the conclusion that the raccoon stole the trash can. The presence of cardboard in the trash can suggests that the raccoon was looking for food or shelter, rather than simply taking the trash can itself. Therefore, option A is a stronger explanation for why the raccoon stole the trash can.
"Response:  Option B: Fue aburrido. 
Explanation: The premise states that the child sharpened the pencil, which suggests that he was bored with it rather than finding it cheap."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The vestido no me quitaba) is more likely. The woman was denied a refund because the clerk did not have enough space to accommodate her request. This implies that the clerk had limited inventory or storage capacity, making it impossible for them to provide a full refund. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation based on the given information.
Response:  Option B: Dejó una cicatriz.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he was staring at the floor) is more likely. The passage states that he received ""strange looks"" from other passengers, indicating that his behavior was noticeable or unusual. It's unlikely that he was simply talking to himself without drawing attention to himself."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Las hormigas se arrastraron hasta las migajas occurred. The premise states that there are ""migas"" (singular form of ""miga"") on the ground, indicating a small amount or scattering of food. This suggests that the hormigas (ants) were attracted to the available food source and moved towards it, rather than the child storing the bread. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (La hermana de la mujer comenzó a llorar) is more likely because it provides a clear emotional response to receiving a gift from someone, whereas option A (La hermana de la mujer cruzó las manos) does not provide any explicit emotion or reaction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre tomó una menta,"" it is more likely that his lips were agitated (Option A). Taking mint can help freshen breath, but it will not necessarily make someone's mouth sore or painful. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Anticiparon el tráfico alrededor del teatro) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Her companion covered for her) is more likely to occur because it implies that someone else took responsibility for her work while she was away from home without working.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he supported their cause (Option A). The fact that he signed the petition suggests that he agreed with their demands or was willing to support them in some way. It is less likely that he would have denounced them as crazy (Option B) since this would imply that he disagreed with their actions or beliefs and found them unreasonable.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the actor had stage fright (Option A). The mention of his heart ""aleteando"" before his performance suggests anxiety or fear related to performing in front of an audience, which is a common symptom of stage fright. Memorizing lines (Option B) would not necessarily cause this physical sensation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He desplegado un mapa) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fruta madura se quedó en el sol,"" it is more likely that she became soft or mushy (Option B). This is because the word ""se quedó"" in Spanish means ""stayed"" or ""remained,"" implying that the fruit remained in the sun for a prolonged period of time, causing it to become overripe and soft."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El coche se averió,"" it is more likely that option B, ""El motor se sobrecalentó,"" caused the car to break down. Therefore, your answer should be (B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Se quedó en cama durante varios días) is more likely. The man's injury to his back may cause him discomfort or pain that would require him to rest in bed for several days. Going to see a psychiatrist (option A) may not be directly related to the physical injury and could potentially be an optional step taken by the man to address any emotional or mental distress caused by the incident.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Yo prendí fuego en la chimenea,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Me quedé sin leña,"" is the correct answer. This is because taking fire in the chimney implies that there was already a flame present, but since you ran out of wood (leña), there is no longer any fuel to keep the fire going. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of cold weather in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (She has a second wind) is more likely. The woman did not stop running because of a cramp or injury but rather due to exhaustion. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would have a cramp or injury at this point in her run. Instead, it makes sense that she would experience a sudden surge of energy and be able to continue running for longer.
"Response:  Option B: My neighbor left her house.
Explanation: The premise states that you knocked on your neighbor's door, indicating that they are not present in their home. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Su esposo malinterpretó sus preocupaciones) is more likely. The woman's sigh of frustration suggests that she was feeling upset or disappointed about something, but her husband misinterpreted her emotions as a sign of affection towards him. This implies that he may not have been paying close attention to her feelings or misunderstood their context, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (El estudiante respondió correctamente a la pregunta) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La mujer se quedó sin huevos,"" it is more likely that she went to the grocery store (Option B) rather than going to the farm (Option A). This is because buying eggs at a grocery store is a common practice for people who have run out of them in their kitchen, while visiting a farm may not be the most practical solution for obtaining eggs."
"Response: 
Option B: Le di un abrazo."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Se vio contaminada) is more likely. The woman avoided going to the lake because she saw it was contaminated, not because she caught a fish.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Le robaron su bicicleta) is more likely. The fact that he arrived to class ""empapado"" suggests that he was wet or muddy, which could be caused by someone stealing his bike rather than his umbrella breaking."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the user moved the mouse) is a more likely cause than option A (the user clicked with the mouse). Therefore, the answer is B.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Se produjo un accidente en la carretera principal) is more likely. The fact that the driver took a detour suggests that there was an obstacle or hazard on the main road, leading to a diversion. This aligns with Option A, as it implies that an accident occurred on the main road, causing the driver to take a different route. In contrast, Option B does not provide any context for why the driver followed the truck in front of them, making it less plausible given the information provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La ropa se secó) is more likely. The premise states that the clothes were hung out to dry, which means they will likely be exposed to sunlight and airflow, allowing them to dry completely. This makes it less likely for the clothes to become stained or damaged during the drying process. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La mujer se puso las gafas,"" option A (the light was bright) is more likely as it provides context for why the woman put on her glasses."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre miró fijamente el cielo nocturno,"" it is more likely that he was thinking about how beautiful it was (Option B). The phrase ""miró fijamente"" suggests a deliberate and intense gaze, indicating that he was paying close attention to his surroundings and appreciating their beauty. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Me quedé despierto toda la noche) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre fue al barbero,"" it is more likely that he went to get his hair cut rather than for his hair to grow longer. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The fact that the boy ""gave him tricks"" suggests that he may not have been very welcoming or friendly towards his new classmate."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Me apetecía un vaso de leche"", option A (Estaba comiendo galletas) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Comenzó a llover,"" it is more likely that the driver turned on his headlights (Option A). This is because turning on the headlights would help the driver see better in the rain."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Me estacioné cerca de la entrada) is more likely. The fact that the parking lot was empty suggests that there may be a closer entrance to the building, making it more likely for the speaker to have parked near it rather than across the street.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (she had a block of writers) caused her to fail to meet the deadline for submitting the draft. This is because the writer's block is mentioned explicitly as the reason for not being able to complete the task. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He pedido hablar con un supervisor) is more likely to be the correct cause. The fact that the caller was hung up on by their associate suggests that they may have been transferred or escalated to a higher level of support for further assistance, rather than simply being provided with a new number to call.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El viento soplaba a través de la ventana abierta,"" option B (Las cortinas se estremecieron) is more likely. The wind blowing through the open window would cause the curtains to tremble or rustle."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (Se me ha volado una mecha) is the correct answer. The phrase ""se me ha volado"" implies a sudden and unexpected loss of power, which is consistent with a blown fuse or other electrical issue rather than simply turning off a lamp."
"Response:  Option B: Levantó la barra sobre su head. 
Explanation: The premise states that the weightlifter grunted, indicating that he lifted a heavy weight. Option B correctly interprets this action as lifting the barbell above his head, which is a common weightlifting movement. Option A does not make sense in this context, as there is no indication of him bending or flexing his muscles in front of a mirror."
"Response: 
Option B: Se confundió."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the father meced softly to the baby) is more likely as it provides a gentle explanation for why the baby woke up smiling. Option A (changing the baby's diaper) does not provide an obvious reason for the baby's smile.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (el chico se empapó) is more likely. The premise states that the girl threw water at the boy, implying that he was struck by the liquid and became wet. Therefore, option B is the most logical choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Todos en las fotos se negaron a sonreír) is more likely. The reason being that if the photographer forgot to use the flash, it's unlikely that the photos would be blurry (option A). Instead, it's more plausible that everyone in the photos would refuse to smile due to the poor lighting conditions.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Estaba fuera de la ciudad) is more likely. The fact that he did not attend the party suggests that he was out of town or unavailable for some other reason.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""He hecho ejercicio,"" it is more likely that option A (Me sentí con energía) is the correct answer. This is because doing exercise can increase a person's energy levels, making them feel more alert and awake."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Asepticla la esponja húmeda) is more likely to occur than option B (Se filtró agua). This is because the premise mentions that the sponge absorbed water, indicating that it became wetter as a result of being submerged in liquid. Filtration typically involves passing something through a filter, rather than causing an object to absorb or retain fluid. Therefore, option A is the better match for the given premise.
"Response:  Option B: The complex was on an island. 
Explanation: Based on the premise that the tourists took a ferry to reach the resort, it is more likely that the resort is located on an island rather than being reserved. An island is a geographical landmass that is surrounded by water, making it easier for people to access through a ferry or boat ride."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ella quería rebelarse) is more likely as it suggests that the reason for getting a tattoo was to express defiance or nonconformity, rather than fear of needles.
"Response: 
Option B: He called the police.
Explanation: The fact that there was an unknown car parked outside your house could be considered suspicious, leading you to call the police as a precautionary measure. It's unlikely that you would become sospechoso (suspicious) in this situation without any other context or information provided."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre fue al médico,"" option A is more likely. The man went to the doctor, indicating that he was seeking medical attention, which suggests that he was feeling unwell or experiencing symptoms of an illness. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Salí de mi habitación por la ventana,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""La casa está en llamas,"" is true. The fact that the speaker left through a window suggests that there may be danger inside the house, such as a fire."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Se espumó las manas con jabón) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why the child's fingers became short. Soap can dry out and shrink skin, potentially leading to shorter finger length. In contrast, taking a long shower does not provide an obvious reason for why the child's fingers would become shorter. Therefore, Option B is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Yo escupo la leche,"" it is more likely that Option B, ""Mi boca estaba seca,"" is the correct answer. The premise suggests that something is wrong with the speaker's mouth or throat, rather than the taste of the milk itself."

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they withdrew (Option B). The premise states that the team manipulated the contest in their favor, which could mean that they cheated or bribed their way to victory. It is unlikely that they won fairly if they had to manipulate the contest. Therefore, Option B is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Me di vuelta la botella) is more likely. The premise states that a bottle of soda made a hissing sound, indicating that it was opened or turned over. Turning the bottle rather than twisting the cap is a more plausible explanation for this phenomenon. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Él subió al techo) is more likely. The premise states that the boy was locked outside his house, which means he would need to find a way to climb up or reach the roof in order to get inside. Option A (Entró por una ventana abierta) does not take into account the fact that the boy was locked out of his house, making it less plausible.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (La mujer miró por el ojo de la cerradura de la puert) is more likely because it implies that she was trying to see who was outside without actually opening the door.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he has his stained suit at the dry cleaner's (Option A). The premise states that he ""manchó"" or stained his suit, indicating that it needs to be cleaned. It would not make sense for him to simply hang it in his armory without attempting to remove the stain first. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Option A: La pasta de dientes salió del tubo.
"Response:  Option B: The pacifists made a parade. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the deaths of civilians due to war increased. This could be seen as a negative consequence of the conflict, and therefore the most likely response from pacifists would be to organize a parade or demonstration to raise awareness about the issue and advocate for peaceful solutions."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (La cinta pareció infantil) is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for why the girl might have arrancado (pulled) her hair tie. If the hair tie looked childish, she may have wanted to remove it to look older or more mature.
"Response: 
Option B: Parecía más joven."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Un pollito salió del huevo,"" it is more likely that option A, ""El huevo eclosionó."" This is because the phrase ""salió del huevo"" implies that something emerged from within the egg, rather than someone or something breaking the egg."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he died of hunger than that he escaped. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Se cayó de la escalera) is more likely. The man lost his balance while climbing the stairs, indicating that he fell down from the stairs rather than simply going up them.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Un corriente de aire frío entró por la ventana,"" it is more likely that the person will feel estremecido (shiver) than relajarse (relax). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: Me estremecí."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (her classmates respected her) is more likely to be the cause of why she received a scholarship. It suggests that her peers recognized her academic achievements or potential and therefore treated her with respect. In contrast, option B (she had good grades) does not necessarily imply any special recognition or respect from her peers.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She was in love with him) is more likely. The fact that she lived next to him does not necessarily imply a romantic relationship, but her being in love with him does suggest a deeper connection between them.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Él incitó a la compasión) is more likely. The fact that he was hungry suggests that he may have intentionally provoked or manipulated people's emotions to receive food. It is less likely that he simply didn't have money without any other means of obtaining food.
"Response:  Option B: Me sentía solo.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker called their friend to talk, indicating that they were feeling lonely or in need of social interaction. This aligns better with option B, as being alone can be a reason for someone to reach out to a friend for conversation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Le estreché la mano) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Me he agachado,"" option B (El frisbee se elevó hacia mi cabeza) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La chica se mordió las uñas,"" it is more likely that she was feeling anxious or worried (Option A)."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""El jugador atacó a su oponente,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Su oponente cayó al suelo,"" occurred."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Recogí los tomates de la vid,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Estaban maduros"" is the correct answer. The phrase ""recogí"" implies that the action of picking was performed by someone or something, and since the verb ""estaban"" is in the infinitive form, it indicates that the tomatoes were already ripe when they were picked. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Le compró chocolates a su novia) is more likely. The man wants to act romantic, so he buys his girlfriend chocolates as a gesture of affection. This choice aligns better with the premise than Option A (Se reunió con su ex novia para almorzar), which does not necessarily convey a romantic intention.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El mercurio en el termómetro subió,"" option B is the most likely cause: The temperature outside increased."

"Response: 
Option A: Sus notas mejoraron. "
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Me sentía cómodo,"" option A (Me arrodillé en el suelo) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Yo pulido la piedra,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Se volvió resbaladizo"" (It became slippery) is correct. The verb ""pulido"" means ""I ground"" or ""I crushed"", so it makes sense that the stone would become slippery after being ground or crushed. Option B, ""Se volvió brillante"" (It became brilliant) does not make as much sense in this context."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the coffee had a sweet taste) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre revisó los papeles,"" it is more likely that he reviewed them than that he cut or destroyed them. Therefore, Option A (He reviewed the papers) is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Me limpié las manos con una toalla,"" it is more likely that Option B is correct: ""Mis manos estaban mojadas."" When you washed your hands with a towel, it is likely that your hands were already wet or dirty, so the towel would not have been able to clean them. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the tabulete se tambaleó debajo de él) is more likely. The man losing his balance suggests that he may have accidentally knocked over the chair while trying to get up or move around, rather than spilling paint on it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Su entrenador canceló la práctica) is more likely. The team members are blaming each other for losing their game, suggesting that they were not prepared or did not perform well during the practice session. It is unlikely that they would lose a game without any preparation or practice. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the team members are blaming each other.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le pedí perdón,"" it is more likely that the speaker is asking for forgiveness (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Me arrepiento de mi error."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Hablaba sin parar de sí mismo) is more likely to be the cause of the woman's boredom.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre se perforó el pie,"" it is more likely that he stepped on broken glass (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Descubrieron la identidad del asesino) is more likely. The detectives are searching for digital clues at the crime scene, which suggests that they may have found evidence related to the identity of the killer. This is a crucial piece of information in solving the case, and it's unlikely that they would find the murder weapon without also discovering the identity of the perpetrator. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Le pedí que me llevara) is more likely because it implies that the speaker took action to get help rather than simply taking a detour.
"Response:  Option B: Many people faced unemployment. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the economy of the nation deteriorated,"" which could lead to a rise in unemployment as businesses struggle or fail. This option better aligns with the given information than option A, which does not directly address unemployment."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The fact that the crossing guard's whistle sounded indicates that the children were about to enter traffic from the opposite direction, rather than being recognized in their neighborhood.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Él hizo un comentario sarcástico) is more likely. The phrase ""Yo le hice rodar los ojos a mi amigo"" suggests that the speaker may have played a prank or joke on their friend, rather than telling the truth about something they did. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The conductor recogió a un autostopista) is more likely. The fact that the car ran out of gas suggests that it was traveling for an extended period of time, making it unlikely that the driver would be stranded in one location. Therefore, option B, where the conductor picked up a hitchhiker, is more plausible as they could have traveled together to find help or a gas station.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La mujer entró en trabajo de parto,"" it is more likely that Option A: El bebé nació (The baby was born) will occur."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Se quitó el sombrero) is more likely. The fact that the man's hat flew away suggests that he removed it voluntarily or accidentally, rather than due to external factors such as strong winds.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She received an invitation) is more likely. The premise states that she attended her classmate's party, indicating that she was invited to the event. It does not mention anything about buying a gift, which suggests that she may have been invited by the host or organizer of the party. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Su madre le tomó la temperatura) will occur because the front of a child's head feeling hot could be a sign of a fever or illness, which would require taking their temperature to determine the cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Quería impresionar a su cita) is more likely as it suggests that the man applied cologne to impress his date, rather than simply putting gel in his hair.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Tomé una pala) is more likely. The premise states that the power went out in the house, which suggests a sudden and unexpected event. Taking a shovel to help deal with the situation would be a more practical choice than searching for a flashlight, as it could potentially be used to clear debris or make a path through the dark house.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (the son graduated from high school) is more likely to be the cause of the family moving into a larger house.
"Response:  Option B: She saw the line of finish. 
Explanation: The premise states that the runner maintained a slow pace throughout the race, indicating that she was saving her energy for the final stretch of the race. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer as it suggests that she could see the finish line ahead and push herself to cross it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La máquina escupió el cambio) is more likely. The fact that the boy kicked the vending machine suggests that there was an issue with the machine itself, rather than a problem with the bag of potato chips being stuck. Therefore, it is more likely that the machine spat out the change than the bag getting stuck.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Le hice girar los ojos) is the correct answer. The phrase ""murió"" means ""died"" in Spanish, so the speaker's friend has lost their dog. There is no logical connection between this event and giving someone a hug, as there would be if the speaker were expressing condolences or offering support to their friend after the loss of their pet.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Su hermano se peleó con sus padres) is more likely. The man's pride in his brother suggests that they have a close relationship, but if his brother had gotten into law school, he would be proud of him regardless of their relationship with their parents.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that their house was destroyed by a fire (Option B).

"Response: 
Option B: Los líderes de otros países enviaron ayuda de emergencia. 
Explanation: Given the premise that a natural disaster has occurred in the nation, it is more likely that other countries would send aid rather than forming an alliance to address the issue. This option better aligns with the scenario presented in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La ropa del niño se empapó,"" it is more likely that option B (Se cayó a la piscina) occurred.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Se le quitó la peluca) is more likely. The phrase ""le he tirado del pelo"" implies that someone pulled or yanked something hard enough to make it fall off, which could be a wig or hairpiece rather than their natural hair. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the person's appearance changed."

"Response: 
Option B: Se casaron.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""El hombre y la mujer se enamoraron,"" it is more likely that they got married than went to university together. The premise implies a romantic relationship between the two characters, which would lead them to consider marriage as their next step. Going to university together does not necessarily imply a romantic relationship or future plans for marriage. Therefore, option B (Se casaron) is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He composed his own song) is more likely. The speaker mentions that the music was too weak to hear, suggesting that they were not able to appreciate or enjoy it fully. Composition of one's own song would allow for greater creative control and potentially a better listening experience than simply adjusting the volume.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El pelo del niño estaba saliendo,"" it is more likely that Option A (the girl did it) is correct.

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that you will ask your neighbor to turn down the music rather than borrowing their CD.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (El niño se despertó gritando de una pesadilla) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the parents ran to their daughter's room.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option B (she was born deaf) is the correct answer. The woman communicated with sign language, indicating that she may have been unable to hear or had difficulty hearing. Being born deaf would be a more common reason for someone to use sign language as their primary means of communication than being born prematurely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the crops perished (Option B) than that the water became contaminated (Option A). The premise states that a drought occurred in the region, which can lead to water scarcity and potentially cause damage or death to crops due to lack of moisture. However, there may be other factors that could contribute to water contamination, such as industrial pollution or human error, but these are less likely causes of a drought-related event. Therefore, Option B is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El gato persiguió al pájaro,"" it is more likely that the pájaro will fly away (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Se mudó a una nueva ciudad) is more likely. The fact that the girl changed schools suggests that she moved to a new city or town, which could be due to various reasons such as her parents' job transfer, family issues, or personal preferences.

Explanation: The premise states that the leader was once an advocate for peace but became radicalized by extremist groups. This suggests that the extremists had some level of influence over the leader, potentially through propaganda or other forms of persuasion. It is less likely that the leader would be assassinated without any prior indication of such a threat. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible answer."
"Response:  Option B: Las olas chocaban contra la orilla.  
Explanation: The sentence ""Caminé descalzo por la playa"" implies that the speaker was walking barefoot on the beach.

"Response: 
Option B: Tomé un vaso de agua.
Explanation: According to the premise, you woke up feeling cold in the middle of the night.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Un agujero en mis jeans,"" it is more likely that option B (Me tropecé en el pavimento) caused the hole in my jeans than option A (He cerró el cierre de los jeans).

This is because exercising at the gym can cause muscle soreness or fatigue, especially if you are new to a particular workout routine or have not exercised in a while. On the other hand, having a sore throat (Option B) could be caused by various factors such as allergies, cold, or flu, and may not necessarily be related to exercise."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Apuesto todo su dinero) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Los vientos se hicieron más fuertes) is a more plausible explanation for why the fire spread quickly.

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option B: Su madre puso una venda en la herida. The fact that the boy's mother put a bandage on his injured knee suggests that she took care of him and tried to treat his injury, rather than simply sending him to his room as punishment.
"Response:  Option A (Él firmó su testamento)

"Response:  Option A: Él flexionó sus brazos.
Explanation: The premise states that the man's arm muscles swelled, indicating that he performed some form of exercise or activity that caused them to expand. Flexing one's arms is a common way to build muscle mass and strengthen the muscles in the upper limbs, making it the most likely explanation for why the man's arm muscles swelled. In contrast, rubbing one's arms would not typically lead to increased muscle growth or swelling."
Response:  Option A: Él estaba sorprendido.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Creía que sus intenciones eran buenas) is more likely. The speaker assumes that their colleague's intentions were good, rather than believing that they knew better.

Reasoning: The premise states that the homeowner requested an exterminator to come to their house, implying that there was already a problem with pests in the house. While rats could potentially be found in the basement, it's less likely that they would be living in the bedroom or other areas of the house where the homeowner sleeps. Therefore, option B is more likely."

Option B: My invitee stayed longer than expected."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she began to hide her brother's diary (Option A).

"Response: 
Option B: Distribuyeron una encuesta a los clientes.

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Fue golpeado por un rayo) is more likely.

It's less likely that people would be drawn to venerate a burning statue by chance."

The fact that he was running suggests that there may have been some movement or jostling that caused the laces to come loose.

The passage states that ""Me fascó el libro,"" which means ""The book fascinated me,"" but does not provide any information about how long the speaker was reading or what happened to their sense of time while they were reading.

"Response:  Option B: El helado goteó del cono.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man ate the ice cream in the sun, which means it was exposed to heat. As a result, the ice cream would melt and ""gotea"" (spill) out of the cone. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."

Explanation: Given that there was turbulence in the air, it's more likely that the man would look out of the window to see what was happening rather than tightening his seatbelt."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El chico se estremeció,"" it is more likely that Option B: La chica lo ha pinchado is correct. The use of the verb ""se estremeció"" implies that the boy was startled or jolted, which could be caused by a sudden physical contact such as being pinched.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Golpeé el hacha hacia abajo en la madera) is more likely to have caused the wood to split in half. When a hammer is swung downward onto wood, it can apply pressure from above, which can cause the fibers of the wood to break and split. In contrast, stacking firewood in a chimney does not typically result in splitting the wood in half. Therefore, option B is the better answer based on the given premise.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""La mujer pisó las llamas,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Las llamas se apagaron,"" will occur. When a person steps on flames, they can extinguish them, not create smoke. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (her driver's license was revoked) caused her car to be in the shop. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Me dormí durante la alarma,"" it is more likely that Option B, ""Me perdí el desayuno,"" occurred. This is because falling asleep during an alarm suggests that you were not awake to eat breakfast."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Las cámaras se dirigieron hacia él) is more likely. The premise suggests that the public figure's image is being broadcasted or televised, implying that cameras are directed towards him. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the water in the bathtub became warm) is more likely. The premise states that ""la mujer se quitó el pantalón y se subió a la bañera,"" indicating that she got into the bathtub. Since she was already inside the bathtub when she removed her pants, it's unlikely that the water temperature would have changed significantly enough to make the water feel warm without any other explanation. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Se especializó en ingeniería) is more likely to help him meet other students in his major or field of study. By specializing in engineering, he will be surrounded by other students who are also interested in engineering, making it easier for him to connect with them and form friendships. On the other hand, joining a fraternity may not provide as many opportunities to interact with other students in his major.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Estaba buscando el cambio suelto) is more likely. The fact that he lifted the cushions from the sofa suggests that he was looking for something specific, such as a lost coin or a small toy, rather than simply reorganizing the room.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (El chico se escapó) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she was sentenced to perform community service (Option A). The sentence of being put in death row (Option B) is unlikely given the nature of the crime mentioned in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the té has turned into steam) is more likely to occur because when sugar is added to hot tea, it dissolves in the liquid rather than turning it into steam.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he was injured in battle (Option B). The mention of a ""cojera"" suggests that his injury may have been severe enough to affect his mobility, which could have occurred as a result of combat injuries. Therefore, Option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (La policía persiguió al criminal) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Se me cayó) is the correct answer. The fact that the laptop won't turn on suggests that there may have been physical damage to the device, such as a drop or impact, rather than simply forgetting to charge it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She doubled her rope) is more likely. The premise states that she has no space in her closet, indicating that she already has a lot of clothes but needs to find additional storage space. Doubling one's wardrobe would not provide any extra space unless it was done by donating or discarding some items first.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre estaba desconsolado,"" option B (Su mujer lo dejó) is more likely as it provides a reason for his sadness that aligns with the context provided in the premise. Option A (Su esposa dio a lux) does not provide any information about why he might be feeling despondent."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Su oferta de trabajo fue rescindida) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Habló en el micrófono. 
Explanation: The premise states that the man's voice projected clearly throughout the auditorium, indicating that he spoke into the microphone. Option B is therefore the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the coin broke in half) is more likely to occur than option A (the coin sank to the bottom). This is because the force of the throw was not strong enough to make the coin sink all the way to the bottom of the fountain, but it could potentially break if it hit something hard inside the water.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the ball entered the hole) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B - Yo estornudé. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""Respiraba el polvo en el ático,"" which means that there was dust in the attic. When someone snores, they are breathing heavily, which suggests that they are inhaling deeply. Therefore, option B is more likely because it implies that the speaker estornudó (snorted) due to inhaling deeply."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the customer used fake money) is more likely. The reason for this is that the cashier called security because someone tried to use counterfeit money at the store, not because they left their headlights on.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (La basura hace que la cocina huella mal) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the presence of trash in the kitchen is causing an unpleasant odor, rather than the other way around. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Los niños admiraron a los animales. The premise states that the family went to the zoo, indicating that they were there to observe and appreciate the animals rather than chase them.
"Response:  Option B: His lungs were congested.
Explanation: The premise states that a man's breathing was labored, indicating difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath. Congestion of the lungs is a common cause of this symptom, as it can make it harder for air to move in and out of the lungs properly. On the other hand, kidney failure (option A) would not directly affect a person's ability to breathe. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Le pregunté a mi amigo por las direcciones al lugar) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he has opened the windows (Option B). This is because opening the windows would allow cooler air to enter the house from outside, rather than relying solely on the broken air conditioning unit.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Su mochila era pesada) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's back pain. The weight of a heavy backpack can put strain on the muscles in the upper back and shoulders, leading to discomfort or pain. This is a common cause of back pain among students who carry heavy school bags. Therefore, option B is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Mi madre cumplía años) is more likely because it provides additional context that suggests why the speaker bought a gift for their mother.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (a bee stung the gardener) is more likely to have caused the destruction of the narcissus in the garden. The reason for this is that bees are known to be aggressive when they feel threatened or provoked, and it's possible that a bee may have attacked the gardener while he was tending to the plants. In contrast, option B (the squirrels unearthed the bulbs) does not seem as plausible given the context of the premise, as squirrels do not typically dig up flowers or bulbs without a valid reason.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""He hace el juego,"" option A (La llama se apagó) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""he hecho"" means ""I have made"" in English, so it implies that someone has created or caused something to happen. In this case, since a llama is not a living being that can make things happen, it is unlikely that a llama would produce a light source like a lamp. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (No querían debatir en el tribunal) is more likely. The fact that the parties reached an agreement suggests that they did not want to continue arguing in court, implying that they were willing to find a resolution outside of the legal system.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Sus padres murieron) is the correct answer. The phrase ""los niños fueron enviados a un orfanato"" suggests that the children were sent to an orphanage after their parents died, rather than being spoiled by them."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that a tsunami occurred (Option A). The reason for this is that a meteorite impact in the ocean would create a massive disturbance in the water, leading to a tsunami wave rather than a storm of hail (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the hiker was startled (Option B). The premise states that the hiker encountered a venomous snake, which would likely cause a strong emotional response of fear or alarm. Deshydration (Option A) may occur as a result of excessive sweating due to fear or exertion during an encounter with a dangerous animal, but it is not directly related to the initial event described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El horno se calentó,"" it is more likely that option A, ""He encendido el horno,"" caused the oven to heat up. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) He encendió el horno."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Yo apreté la cuña de limón,"" it is more likely that option A, ""El limón se ha mohoso"" (The lemon has become soft) will occur. This is because applying pressure to the stem of a lemon will cause it to release its juice, making it softer. Option B, ""El limón rociado"" (The lemon sprayed), does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the lemon was sprayed with anything."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the country abandoned the land rather than colonized it. The phrase ""el país descubrió nuevas tierras"" implies that the country discovered new lands, which suggests that they were not already inhabited by another group of people or nation. Therefore, option A (the country abandoned the land) is a more plausible explanation for why the country would have left its mark on the map."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El vaso se cayó de la mesa,"" option A is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the vase broke into pieces after falling from the table, rather than simply landing in a pile of clothes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the floor was not levelled) is a more likely cause for the table to have tilted than Option B (the floor was slippery). This is because an uneven surface can cause a table to tip or wobble more easily than a smooth one.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Su hijo confesó la verdad) is more likely. The father caught his son lying, so it's likely that the son admitted to the truth when confronted by his father.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La cabeza del hombre palpitaba de dolor,"" it is more likely that he took aspirin (Option B) than jarabe for his throat (Option A). Aspirin is a common pain reliever used to treat headaches and other types of pain, while jarabe is not typically associated with treating pain. Therefore, Option B is the better answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El tren se ralentizó,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Estaba retrasado,"" is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre fue a terapia,"" it is more likely that he was diagnosed with depression (Option B). The fact that he went to therapy suggests that he is seeking treatment for his mental health issues, which are commonly associated with depression. It is less likely that he has a family history of mental illness (Option A) as there is no indication in the premise that this is the case."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La mujer se agarró de la garganta,"" it is more likely that she choked on her food (Option B)."
"Response:  Option A (Su voz sonaba áspera).
Explanation: The premise states that the woman had a sore throat, which can cause her voice to sound hoarse or aspera. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Option B: Se puso abajo. (The dog put itself down.)
Explanation: The sentence ""El perro miró el jugoso filete sobre la mesa"" implies that the dog looked at a juicy steak on the table. However, the phrase ""se puso abajo"" means ""put oneself down,"" which is an uncommon usage of this verb in Spanish. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: She became rich."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Los estudiantes salieron del salón de clases,"" option A is more likely because it provides a clear reason for why the students left the classroom (the bell rang). Option B does not provide any explanation for why the students left."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sus conocidos expresaron su escepticismo) is more likely. The woman's claim of seeing a ghost may not be taken seriously by her acquaintances due to their skepticism or disbelief in supernatural phenomena.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Casi murió en una explosión) is more likely. The man lost his hearing in an explosion, which suggests that he was exposed to a loud noise or blast that damaged his ears. Drowning in the ocean would not typically result in sudden deafness.
"Response:  Option B: El globo se elevó en el aire.
Explanation: According to the premise ""El niño soltó la cuerda del globo,"" when the child let go of the string attached to the balloon, it was likely that the balloon would rise into the air due to the buoyancy caused by the gas inside it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (todo un derrame cerebral) is more likely to be the cause of the man's lost ability to speak. This is because a stroke or brain hemorrhage can damage the language centers in the brain, leading to difficulty speaking or even loss of speech. On the other hand, taking a deep breath may not directly affect the brain regions responsible for language processing and production.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La mujer se tropezó en la acera,"" option B (Oyó que llamaban por su nombre) is more likely as it suggests that the woman heard someone calling her name just before she fell, indicating that she may have been distracted or disoriented at the time of the fall. Option A (Había una grieta en el cemento) does not provide any information about a possible cause for the woman's fall."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (El hombre empapó al salvavidas) is more likely to occur because it implies that the man's action of throwing a cannonball into the pool caused water to splash back onto the rescuer, rather than the other way around.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A - ""Mi infección se ha curado"" - is correct. The premise states that you took antibiotics, which suggests that your infection was treated and has since resolved. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El semáforo se puso amarillo,"" it is more likely that the driver pressed the brake (Option A) than honked his horn (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option B: Puedo put the recipient in the hot stove. The premise states that the plastic container melted, which suggests that it was exposed to high temperatures. Placing a plastic container in a hot oven or stove would likely cause it to melt or warp. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El coche se abolló,"" it is more likely that Option A (the car collided with a post) occurred. This is because the word ""abollar"" implies a violent impact, such as hitting something solid like a post. In contrast, Option B (""el conductor pasó una luz roja"") simply means the driver ran a red light, which may not have caused as much damage to the vehicle."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El chico estudió toda la noche,"" it is more likely that he passed the examination. Therefore, option (B) Él pasó el examen is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (El salvavidas estaba de servicio) is more likely. The fact that the child grabbed the edge of the pool suggests that he was in distress or needed help, which is where the lifeguard comes in. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the child held onto the edge of the pool.
"Response: 
Option B: My heart rate accelerated."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mi oficina estaba ruidosa) is more likely. The fact that there was construction going on next to the office suggests that there may have been noise from the building site, making it difficult for people to concentrate or work effectively.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (La familia invitó a los vecinos a cenar) is the correct answer. The family wants to get to know their new neighbors better, and inviting them over for dinner is a friendly and informal way to do so.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El agua salpicó de la piscina,"" it is more likely that option A, ""El nadador se zambulló en la piscina,"" caused the water to splash out of the pool. When a person jumps or dives into a pool, they create movement in the water that can cause waves and splashing. In contrast, floating in the pool would not typically produce enough movement to cause splashing. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Me mordí una rebanada de sandía,"" it is more likely that option A (Me tragué una semilla por accidente) occurred. This is because the word ""mordí"" means ""bit"" or ""chewed,"" indicating that something entered the person's mouth, rather than something coming out of their body. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Su chaqueta estaba desabrochada) is the more likely cause of the boy's fall. The fact that he ""se tropezó"" suggests that he lost his balance suddenly, which could be caused by an unexpected opening of his jacket. It is less likely that he would lose his balance due to loose laces, as this would give him more warning time to adjust his footing. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ella estaba distraída por el ruido) is more likely. The woman put earplugs in her ears because she was distracted by the noise, not because there was a hole in her ears.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Me bebí toda el agua) is more likely. The premise states that you have filled the water bottle again, implying that it was previously empty or had run out of water. Therefore, it is more likely that you drank all the water in the bottle rather than storing it in the refrigerator.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the program was censored due to containing mature language (Option A). The mention of a ""program"" being censored suggests that there are certain restrictions or limitations placed upon its content, which could be related to language or other forms of objectionable material. While a complicated plot may also be a reason for censorship in some cases, it seems less likely given the context provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La nave se estrelló,"" it is more likely that the tripulación se ahogó (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Él resolvió el enigma) is correct. The premise states that the boy was perplexed by the riddle, suggesting that he did not immediately solve it but rather struggled with it. Therefore, it is more likely that he eventually resolved the enigma through his own efforts rather than asking for a hint.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El teléfono sonó,"" it is more likely that option A (el hombre colgó el teléfono) occurred because when a phone rings, it is typically picked up rather than put down. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Me sentía incómodo.
Explanation: The woman was staring at him fixedly, which made him feel uncomfortable rather than being emboldened to approach her or hug her."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tomaron fotos de las exhibiciones) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre comenzó una discusión conmigo,"" option A (Mi amigo me presentó al hombre) is more likely."
Response:  Option A (He bombeado aire en el neumático) is more likely because it directly addresses the problem mentioned in the premise of having a flat tire due to under-inflation.
Response:  Option B: Her father touched her forehead.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Yo firme mi nombre) is more likely. The premise states that there is no ink left in the pen, indicating that the writer may have used up all of their ink. As such, it would be unlikely for them to use a pen again without replenishing its supply of ink. Therefore, option B, where the writer signed their name, is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (he was rejected for a loan) is more likely than Option B (he started a business).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tenía varicela) is more likely. The reason for her absence from school is not related to her interest in learning maths but rather due to an illness she had contracted.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Lo tiré en el fregadero) is more likely. The premise states that the trash can was full, so it's unlikely that you would take it to the recycling bin. Throwing it in the sink is a more common action when there is no other place to dispose of something.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mi compañero de cuarto derramó ponche) is more likely than option B (Mi perro pierde el pelo). This is because the first sentence mentions a person's roommate spilling something, while the second sentence only refers to a dog losing its hair, which is not directly related to the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tiró una silla por la habitación) is more likely. The man lost his patience, indicating that he may have acted impulsively or angrily, leading him to throw something in frustration. This choice better aligns with the emotional state described in the premise than Option A (Él apagó su computadora), which does not convey a sense of physical action or anger.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La ramita se quemó) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El hombre salió de la ducha,"" it is more likely that option A, ""El agua caliente se había ido,"" is the correct answer. The man leaving the shower suggests that he has finished his bath or shower, and therefore the water would have cooled down by then. Option B does not provide a logical explanation for why the man left the shower without finding a towel."
"Response:  Option B: They animated their children to play outside.  
Explanation: The premise states that the parents wanted their children to go to university, but option B suggests that they encouraged their children to play outside instead of saving money for tuition fees. Therefore, it is more likely that they animated their children to play outside rather than setting aside a college fund."
"Response:  Option A - The zapatos se aflojaron.
Explanation: According to the premise, the man undid his shoelaces. This means that the laces were previously tied tightly around the shoes, but he loosened them. It's unlikely that the shoes would have worn out or become damaged as a result of being tied too tightly, so option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he refrigerated the leftovers (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Le puse hielo) will help reduce swelling in the toe. This is because ice can help reduce inflammation by constricting blood vessels and reducing blood flow to the affected area.
"Response: 
Option B: Escuché la conversación en el pasillo.
Explanation: The premise states that the office door was open, indicating that someone entered or exited the office. Option B suggests that you overheard a conversation in the hallway, which is a common area where people often walk through while going to other parts of the building. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A, as it aligns better with the context provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Me senté) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the mosquita will fly away (Option A).
"Response:  Option B: Él era viudo.  
Explanation: The man wrote a will because he was getting married or had already been married (viudo). This implies that he has assets to distribute after his death, which is why he created a will. Being in poor health or nearing death does not necessarily require him to create a will, as there may be other reasons for doing so."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he accelerated his pace (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Se me ocurrió una solución) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Se sintió extasiado.
Explanation: The word ""extasiado"" suggests a feeling of joy or wonder, which is more in line with the idea of walking on a suspension bridge that sways beneath one's feet. While ""aterrorizado"" could also be possible given the uncertainty and potential danger of crossing such a structure, ""extasiado"" better captures the sense of excitement and thrill that might come from experiencing something new and challenging."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (made a bet with his friends) is more likely. The man's excitement about the team's victory suggests that he has something riding on the outcome of the game, implying that he made a bet with his friends.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Él contó ovejas) is more likely. The idea of counting sheep to fall asleep is a common technique used by many people when they have trouble sleeping. It is less likely that he would set his alarm clock, as this is not a typical method for falling asleep.
