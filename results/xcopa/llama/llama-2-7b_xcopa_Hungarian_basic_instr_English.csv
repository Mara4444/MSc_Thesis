Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Törékeny volt) is more likely to be the cause of the product's damage during shipping. The termék buborékfóliába was not robust enough to protect the product from external shocks and vibrations during transportation, resulting in damage to the product.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kiürítettem a zsebemet,"" it is more likely that Option A (Megtaláltam egy jegyet) will occur. This is because the act of emptying one's pockets suggests that something may have been found or discovered, rather than something being hidden or concealed."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the termites disappeared from the house) is more likely. The fact that the termites have taken over the entire house suggests that they were present in large numbers and had been there for some time. It is unlikely that they would suddenly disappear without leaving any trace of their presence.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The border patrol agent accused them of smuggling) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (the festival was held) caused the library to be closed. The passage states that ""az irodát bezárták,"" indicating that the library was closed, and does not provide any information about a summer holiday or festival being held. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Damaged) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""a lanynak elfogyott az energia"" suggests that something has happened to the lan's energy reserves, which could be caused by damage to its power source or battery. Option B (Hung the cable) does not provide any information about the lan's energy levels and seems unrelated to the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (more people stepped into the line) is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the baby's face got wet) than Option B (the baby spat up). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the baby's face was directly affected by something, rather than just being near an action happening elsewhere.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the audience claps along) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the girl stayed outside the school to do her punishment) is correct. The premise states that the girl wanted to thank the teacher, but instead of bringing something nice for them, she decided to stay outside as punishment. This suggests that she may have been feeling rebellious or resistant towards the idea of showing appreciation, leading her to choose this unconventional method of expressing gratitude.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (the táborvezetők told them a ghost story) is more likely to be the cause of the young soldiers' fright. The passage states that ""a fiatal tábornokokat megijesztték,"" indicating that they were scared by something, and the context suggests that it was probably a story rather than marshmallows being roasted over an open fire."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Megrázkódtatás) is more likely to occur because it provides an explanation for why the man's thoughts are lost in his head. The phrase ""megrázkódtatás"" specifically refers to the act of overwhelming or drowning someone with too much information, which could cause confusion and disorientation. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's thoughts were lost due to being bombarded by too many ideas rather than simply disappearing into thin air."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (the bank account was empty) caused the rejection of my payment request than option B (I deserved an increase in salary). The passage states that ""a check I wrote was rejected,"" indicating that there were insufficient funds in the bank account to cover the payment. This suggests that the bank account was empty or had low balances, making it unlikely that the rejection was due to a desire for a pay raise. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Törölte a spam-et) is correct. The email was full of spam, so it's reasonable to assume that the sender deleted it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The patient was exposed to the disease) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Elfelejtette leírni) is more likely. The girl forgot to write down the code, rather than telling someone else about it.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (My mistake was my fault) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (A lánc egy gumiabroncs körül volt tekerve) is the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the chain was wrapped around a rubber tire, which implies that the chain may have been damaged or broken due to wear and tear from being used with a tire. This is a common occurrence and more plausible than option B (Elromlott a láncszem), which means ""The chain broke."""
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Elegük lett a vitából) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Tanúskodott a bíróságon) is more likely. The premise states that the woman decided to run for office, which implies that she wants to gain political power through legal means. Trying to bribe someone or testifying in court are not legal ways of achieving this goal, so option B is more plausible.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Meleg ruhákat pakolt a bőröndjébe) is correct. The reason being that packing warm clothing in a bag would be a logical response to cold weather conditions. Option B does not provide any specific information about what the person did, making it less plausible.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Felemelve a kezét) will occur because when someone is asked a question they do not know the answer to, they may fumble or hesitate before responding, rather than simply rejecting the question outright by raising their hand.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Por került a szemébe) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""A férfi szemei könnyekbe fulladtak"" suggests that something liquid or soft has entered his eyes, which could potentially cause discomfort or pain. Option B (A szemére védőszemüveget tett) does not provide any information about what caused the discomfort in the man's eyes, so it is less likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The opponent accused the player of cheating) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The teacher deliberately failed the student's exam) is more likely. The passage states that ""a tanár széttépte a diák vizsgáját,"" indicating that the teacher intentionally caused the failure. There is no indication in the passage to suggest that the student gave incorrect answers, so option B (The student's answers were wrong) is less likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Elvesztettem a hangom) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has lost their voice, rather than having run out of breath.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the food was frozen. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The microwave oven was used to thaw the food.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Gyomorkrampója volt) is more likely as a cause for the employee's absence from work. The phrase ""betegnek tettette magát"" suggests that the employee feigned illness, which is more plausible than the alternative explanation of wanting a day off for personal reasons."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Leugrott a ugródeszkáról) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The movie's opening day was terrible) is the more likely cause of the low box office sales. The passage does not provide any information to suggest that the film received bad reviews, which would be the reason for poor ticket sales according to Option B. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Az emberek elszigetelték) is more likely to occur. The fact that the man has become isolated suggests that he may have lost touch with society or been rejected by it in some way, rather than being celebrated or admired.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (felfüggedt egy kötélre) is more likely as it suggests that the girl's hands are tied up with rope, which could be used to restrain her. The mention of ""hólyagok"" (bags) in the premise does not provide any indication that the girl's hands are filled with anything other than air. Therefore, Option B is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A is more likely. The audience was surprised and clapped for the performer's act, indicating that it was impressive and unexpected. Option B does not align with this interpretation as acrobats typically perform on trapezes, not unicycles.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (My friend has overstayed) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why my friend did not arrive on time.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nuclear weapons were developed) is more likely. The passage states that ""the warring countries had been at odds for years,"" indicating a long-standing conflict, and also mentions that they wanted to achieve peace. Developing nuclear weapons would be a significant step towards achieving this goal, as it would provide them with a powerful deterrent against their enemies. In contrast, option B (They signed an agreement) does not explain how the warring countries achieved peace in such a short time frame, especially given the complexity of the issues involved."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person became drowsy (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Elcsúszott a kanapé lába) is more likely to occur than option B (Megsérítette a térdét). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the woman's body came into contact with the bed frame, which is more likely to cause discomfort or injury to her legs rather than her knees.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A fiú szorította a ballont,"" option B is more likely. The word ""szorította"" means ""squeezed"" or ""pressed,"" so it's unlikely that the balloon would have repelled (option A) or flown away (option B). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that they have elmentek (left) the hotel room. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Megharaptam a barackot,"" option A is more likely. The word ""barack"" means grape in Hungarian, so it's possible that someone might have bitten into a grape without realizing it was sour. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Édeskedtem a cukorkát) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why someone might have eaten too much sugar. Eating too much candy can lead to an upset stomach or other digestive issues, which could be the cause of the discomfort. In contrast, Option A (Megettem egy fánkot) does not provide a clear explanation for why someone might feel unwell after eating something.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the door was locked (option B). Therefore, the answer is option B.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (the termékekment boycotted) caused the problem. The passage states that ""aktivisták bojkottolták a termékeket,"" indicating that activists boycotted the products. This suggests that the issue was related to consumer action rather than any quality control measures or child labor practices. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lyukat fúrtam a falba,"" Option A (An éger mászott ki a lyukból) is the most likely outcome. The word ""lyuk"" implies that there is a hole in the wall, and ""fúrtam"" means I dug/drilled into it. Therefore, an animal or something else could have come out of the hole."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A húga boldog volt) is more likely. The premise states that the woman was jealous of her sister's happiness, indicating that she was not happy herself. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Borral öntöttem az ingem,"" option B is more likely. The word ""borral"" means ""with a spoon,"" so it's unlikely that the speaker would have simply put on a new coat without any preparation or effort. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the pen-teller opened the cash register) is more likely than option B (the customer handed over the money). Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the people gave him small change) is correct. The premise states that ""a crowd"" was attracted to the street musician, suggesting that he had gathered a sizable audience. It is unlikely that he would have been able to elicit such a large response from the crowd by simply sending them away. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hiányoztak a szülei) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the baby would be crying without his parents present.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (A pilóta elhajóztak a vihar elől) is more likely. The word ""elhajózott"" in Hungarian means to move away or escape from something, so it's more likely that the pilot would try to avoid the storm rather than fly through it. Option B (A pilóta átrepült a viharon) doesn't make sense in this context as ""átrepülni"" means to fly over something, not through it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The leaves fell to the ground) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the boy decided to play a trick on his sister) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the father stopped the car at a gas station) is more likely. The child was upset about having to go to the bathroom, so it's unlikely that the father would give him a drink of water as a solution. It's more likely that he would stop the car at a convenient location such as a gas station so that the child can use the restroom there.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A hal kiugrott a tartályból) is more likely. The fact that the child threw something into the tank suggests that it was not just floating there, but rather had been thrown or placed in the tank intentionally. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the fish ended up in the tank.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Tiltakozott) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kinyitottam a csapot) is more likely to cause the water in the bathtub to become dirty than option B (Beöntöttem benne szennyvíztisztítót). This is because opening the tap would allow dirty or contaminated water from the plumbing system to enter the bathtub, making it dirtier. On the other hand, adding a cleaning solution to the bathtub through the drain might not have as significant of an impact on the water's cleanliness.
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the train arrived at the station) is the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he wet the page of the notebook rather than closing the box. Therefore, option A (he peeled off the label) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Élvezték egymás társaságát) is the more likely cause for why they lost touch with each other. The passage states that ""they had grown apart,"" implying that their distance from each other and lack of interaction led to a decrease in their relationship. It does not mention any specific event or reason for them moving away from each other, suggesting that it was simply due to the natural progression of life and growing older together."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kirúgták a pozíciójából) is more likely. The passage states that the accountant ""badly managed"" the company's finances, implying that their performance was subpar. As a result, it is likely that they were fired or asked to resign from their position. Option B (Szülésznapi szabadságra ment) does not align with this interpretation as it implies that the accountant took time off for personal reasons, rather than being let go due to poor job performance."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hallottam, hogy tik-tik az óra) is a more likely cause than Option B (Csak meg akartam nézni az időt). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the speaker heard something rather than just looking at the time.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A kezem összehúzódott) is the most likely cause for the writer's hand to cramp while writing an essay. This is because holding onto something or someone tightly can lead to muscle fatigue and cramping, especially in the hands. Therefore, it makes sense that the writer would experience this discomfort while writing an essay, particularly if they are using their own strength to keep their pen moving.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kicseréltem a csavarral) is the more likely cause of the problem. The statement ""A csavar meghúzódott"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the screw itself, rather than just the way it's tightened or loosened. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A pár beköltözik a lakásba) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A nő kint ült a verandán) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides context for why the woman was outside during the storm. The other option does not provide any explanation for her location or actions.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The man was not able to swim) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she accidentally deleted the document (Option A). The sentence does not provide any indication that she pressed the background noise (Option B), so Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rossz jegyet kapott) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence suggests that something negative happened to the girl, such as receiving a bad grade, rather than winning a competition.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (The night fell) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's hair was wet. As the night fell, it is possible that the man got wet while outside during the evening hours. Option B (He was full of worms) is less likely as there is no context or evidence to suggest that the man had an infestation of worms in his hair.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that she forgot to set her alarm clock (Option B). The fact that she overslept suggests that she may have been too tired or groggy to remember to set an alarm, whereas the possibility of spending the night at a hotel seems less plausible without any additional context.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Az árnyékban ült) is more likely as it provides shade from the sun, which could help protect the man's skin from burning.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the researchers retracted their theory) is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the game continued) as there is no indication in the premise that the bribe had any impact on the outcome of the match.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Bezártam a zárat) is correct because if you combine the two words ""be"" and ""zip,"" it forms the word ""bezip."" Therefore, it makes sense to assume that bezip means to close or zip something up."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A tömeg fokozódott,"" option B is more likely. The fact that a crowd has gathered suggests that something unusual or significant has happened, and it is more likely that someone's hand was grabbed than money was given."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hólabdá alakítottam a havat) is correct. The word ""hólabdá"" means ""ice"" in Hungarian, so it is possible that the speaker has transformed the ice into something else using magic or other supernatural means. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (A kajak egy hullámba ütközött) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Égynélküliség) is more likely to occur than option A (Elengedése). This is because the premise states that the girl lost control of the car, which could have happened if she accidentally turned off the steering wheel or hit something while driving. Option A does not provide any specific details about how the girl lost control of the car, making it less plausible.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Éreztem, ahogy a hűvös levegő áthalad rajtam) is more likely. The passage suggests that the speaker feels cold air passing over them, indicating that they are in a cool environment.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Át voltak áztatva) is more likely. The sentence ""A szörfösök visszatértek a partra"" implies that they have returned to shore after being submerged in water, which could be due to waves or tides. It does not suggest that they saw a shark, which would be the reason for their return according to Option B (Látott egy cápát). Therefore, Option A is the better answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The water leapt from the tub) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the water jumped or leaped out of the bathtub, rather than flowing or dripping off the sides. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Bevallotta a hűtlenségét) is more likely. The husband's confession of infidelity suggests that he feels guilty about his actions and wants to take responsibility for them, rather than blaming someone else.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Megvártam, hogy megszáradjon a tintaja) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that the speaker waited for the ink to dry before writing on the poster, indicating that they were patiently waiting for it to become dry enough to write on. Option B (Vízzel öntöttem a plakátot) does not align with this context as it implies that water was used to soak or wet the poster, rather than allowing it to dry.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rémálma volt) is more likely to be the correct answer. The child woke up screaming, indicating that they may have had a nightmare or bad dream during their sleep. This is a common occurrence in children and can often result in them waking up distressed or upset. Option B (Megpisilt az ágyban), while possible, does not fit with the information provided as it implies that the child was physically pushed or thrown out of bed, which is unlikely given the context.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the father taught him) is more likely. The fact that the son fell off the table suggests that he was not paying attention or did something careless, which could have been caused by his father's instruction. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the son fell off the table.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kiáltottam a nevét) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The government has taken the voter registration list) is more likely to be the effect of the situation described in the premise. The government's actions suggest that they are trying to suppress the population's political power by limiting their ability to vote. This could lead to widespread discontent and potentially inspire resistance or rebellion among the population, as suggested in Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he built a shelter (Option A). The text states ""felállította"" which means he set up or built something, indicating that he took action to create a safe place for himself in the forest. This is consistent with the idea of building a shelter to protect oneself from the elements and potential dangers in the wilderness."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the munkatársa előléptették) is more likely as the reason for the férfi's discontentment with his job.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man was hallucinating rather than meditating. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Fehérítőt tett bele) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the information provided in the premise. The phrase ""szőke lett"" means ""became white,"" suggesting that something was added or mixed into the man's hair to make it turn white. Using a bleaching agent like fehérítő would be a plausible explanation for this change. In contrast, option B (Bevitte a sampont) does not fit with the given information as there is no mention of anything being injected into the man's hair."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (criticized his previous work) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Elbocsátották a hadseregből) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the boy might be moving out of his home. The other option (Életmentő szervezetbe került) does not provide any context or explanation for why the boy would be leaving his home. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the bookshelves were covered in dust) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the books fell off the shelf due to accumulated dust or dirt, rather than an external force like an earthquake.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Felkapcsoltam a lámpát) will cause the power to come back on in the house than Option B (Átállítom a kapcsolót). This is because flipping a switch does not directly affect the electrical circuitry of the house, whereas turning on a light bulb can potentially restore power by completing a closed loop in the electrical system.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ijesztőnek tűnt) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Valamit beleöntöttem a zsákba) is more likely to be the cause of the corn kernel starting to burst open.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Erős szél fog) is more likely to occur as a result of a tree falling onto power lines. When a tree falls onto power lines, it can cause a disruption in the electrical current flowing through them, leading to a loss of power in the surrounding area. This can also lead to an increase in wind speed due to the pressure drop caused by the blockage in the transmission line. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he offended the audience (Option B). The phrase ""politikusan helytelen megjegyzéseket"" suggests that his comments were inappropriate or insensitive, which could have caused offense to those present."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (a drop of blood formed on my arm) is more likely. The phrase ""megszúrtam magam a tűvel"" suggests that the speaker has been stabbed with a needle or sharp object, which could cause bleeding. Option A (""egy vertek perla csöpögött az arcomról"") does not make sense in this context and is unlikely to occur as a result of being stabbed with a needle."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Éhes volt) is more likely. The fact that there was food on the surface of the tank suggests that the person who died was hungry before they passed away, rather than having already died.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Megfázott) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the information provided in the premise. The sentence ""A férfi hangja horognak hangzott"" suggests that something has caused discomfort or pain to the man's voice, which could be due to illness such as a cold or flu rather than quitting smoking. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (A lift a kijelölt emeletre érkezett) is the most likely cause. The text states that the lift has reached the designated floor, indicating that it functioned properly and stopped at the correct level. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the child lied to their parents) is more likely. The fact that the child ""ran away from home"" suggests that they may have been trying to avoid punishment or consequences for something they had done wrong, rather than simply wanting to explore the world outside of their house."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (A fürdő elárasztott) is the correct answer. The phrase ""a fürdő elárasztott"" suggests that the bathtub is filled with water, which could be caused by a leak or other issue with the plumbing system. Therefore, Option A is the most likely explanation for why the bathroom is flooded."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the owner put a neck collar on the cat) than option B (the owner held the cat by a leash). This is because a neck collar is a common type of restraint used for cats, while holding a cat by a leash is not typically done in practice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A hatalmas fa alatt állt) is more likely as it provides a clear and specific location for where the man stood in relation to his reflection. The other option does not provide any context or detail that would help determine the likelihood of the cause.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that I called my friend's phone number rather than went to her house for dinner. Therefore, option A (Visszahívtam) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the family's dog ran away from home (Option A). The mention of ""átkutatták"" (meaning they searched around) suggests that the family was actively looking for their missing pet, rather than dealing with the loss of valuable items (as suggested in Option B). Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Láttam a leheletemet, amikor kiégettem,"" option A is the most likely cause. The use of the word ""leheletem"" (breath) suggests that the speaker's breath was affected by something they did or experienced, such as inhaling smoke or taking drugs. Option B does not fit with this context."
"Response:  Option A: Jobb munkakörülményeket akartak.  
Explanation: The premise states that the workers formed a union to improve their working conditions. This suggests that they were not satisfied with their current working conditions and wanted better ones. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A rotten smell filled the kitchen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Magas sarkú cipőt viselt) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a specific detail about the woman's clothing that could potentially help identify her. The fact that she wore high-heeled shoes suggests that she may have been trying to make herself appear taller or more imposing, which could be relevant to the situation described in the premise. In contrast, Option B (Levette a cipőjét) does not provide any specific details about the woman's appearance or behavior that could help identify her.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The water boiled) is the most likely cause. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Az összes zokni a mosodában volt,"" it is more likely that Option A (Sándalokat hordtam) is correct. The word ""zokni"" in Hungarian means ""shoe,"" so if all shoes were in the bathroom, it is likely that the speaker wore sandals."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Elvesztette a szavazók támogatását) is more likely. The passage states that the politician's erroneous arguments were seen as absurd by their opponents, which suggests that they may have lost support among voters due to their ineffective campaigning rather than being accused of corruption.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The couple is pregnant) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A milliomos azt akarta, hogy az épületet lebontják) is the most likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Az eladó látta, hogy a lány árut tett a táskájába) is the more likely cause.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (A bíróság megerősítette a vitatott ítéletet) is the most likely outcome. This is because the premise states that the court has reinforced the controversial verdict, indicating that the decision has been upheld or confirmed by the legal system. Option B (Egy pár esküt tett a bíróság előtt), on the other hand, suggests that a couple has sworn an oath before the court, which could be related to various legal proceedings but does not necessarily imply that the controversial verdict has been upheld.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kivette a süteményt a korsóból) is more likely the cause of the smell. The fact that she took something out of the oven suggests that it was her action that led to the smell, rather than simply leaving the pastries in the oven.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (A vihar egyre rosszabb lett) is more likely to be true.

Therefore, it is more likely that the situation has become worse over time.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (the lift did not work) caused the building to be evacuated. The passage states that ""az épületet kiürítették,"" which means that the building was emptied. This implies that everyone left the building through a different exit, rather than using the lift. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause of the building being evacuated."

The fact that the people have hung their national flag outside their homes suggests that they are celebrating something significant, such as independence.

Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for why the people have hung their national flag outside their homes.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Figyelmes volt az órákban) is more likely as it suggests that he was attentive in class, which could have helped him to better understand and retain the material for the exam.

Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Földrengés érte a várost) is more likely as an explanation for why an urban building collapsed. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially in areas prone to seismic activity. While Option B (A bűnözés aránya a városban emelkedett) may also contribute to the collapse of a building through neglect or intentional destruction, it does not directly explain the physical damage caused by an earthquake.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Könyörgött, hogy vegye vissza) is more likely. The man's pleading with his girlfriend to take him back suggests that he wants her back in his life, rather than introducing her to his parents as an ultimatum or trying to manipulate them into accepting their relationship.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (they collided) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Karton was in the semites) is correct. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the premise that the lid of the container was closed, so it is unlikely that the mosquito got inside through the top. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that something inside the container attracted the mosquito, such as food or a piece of clothing with a strong scent.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Olcsó volt) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The fact that the boy reduced the pencil price suggests that he found a way to make it cheaper, which makes sense if the cost was high initially. On the other hand, unalmas (meaning ""boring"") doesn't seem to have any direct connection to the scenario presented in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Elvesztette a számláját) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman could not get her money back from the cashier. Losing one's receipt is a common occurrence that can make it difficult or impossible to return an item, especially if the store does not have access to the customer's purchase history. On the other hand, Option B (Nem volt jó a ruhám) does not provide any clear reason why the cashier would refuse to give the woman her money back, and it seems unlikely that the cashier would simply deny the woman her money without any apparent reason.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that a scar remained after the injury. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The earth revolved around him) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the hangyák másztak a morzsákra) is correct. The premise states that ""a gyermek apró darabokat hagyott a padlón,"" indicating that small objects were left on the floor. Hangyák are attracted to food sources, especially sweet or sticky ones, so it is plausible that they would be drawn to the small pieces of food left on the floor. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Aggódott a rossz lehelet miatt) is more likely. The fact that the person's breath smells bad suggests that there may be an underlying medical issue, such as gum disease or a respiratory infection, rather than simply being nervous about something.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (A színház környékén várták a forgalmat) is the correct answer.

The sentence ""Eltévedtem"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising happened, which aligns with Option A's meaning of counting money. On the other hand, Option B (Kinyitottam egy térképet) does not fit well with the context as it means opening a map, which is an unrelated action compared to the situation described in the premise. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they were eaten (Option A). The sentence ""A érett gyümölcsök a napfényben maradtak"" implies that the fruit was left in the sun to ripen, not rotted. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the car overheated (Option B). This is because the phrase ""Elromlott az autó"" specifically mentions that the car has stopped working, which suggests that there was an issue with its cooling system rather than simply being turned off."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he went to see a psychiatrist (Option A). This is because a psychiatrist would be able to provide mental health support and treatment for any emotional or psychological distress caused by the injury, rather than simply recommending bed rest (Option B) which may not address the underlying issues causing his symptoms.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tűzöt gyújtottam a kandallóban,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Elfogyott a tűzifő,"" occurred. This is because the absence of smoke suggests that there was no fuel left to burn in the fireplace."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The neighbor invited) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (A férje félreértelte a gondjait) is more likely to be the cause of her disappointment. The passage states that she was ""sóhajtott,"" which implies sadness or disappointment, and suggests that her husband misunderstood her problems. Therefore, it is more likely that he did not fully comprehend her difficulties rather than him giving her flowers as a consolation."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the student answered correctly) is the correct cause. The passage states that ""a teacher praised the student,"" indicating that the student performed well or exceeded expectations in some way.

Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option B: Elment a szupermarketbe (She went to the supermarket) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the woman's eggs have run out, indicating that she needs to buy more food, and the nearest place where she can do so is the supermarket.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Megöleltem) is more likely. The fact that I ""találtak"" a régi barátom suggests that we have been out of touch for some time, and therefore it is less likely that I would have hidden something from him. On the other hand, the fact that I ""felettem"" a titok implies that there is something secret or hidden, which aligns better with option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Elkapott egy halat) is more likely. The fact that she ""elkerült"" or avoided going into the water suggests that something unexpected happened to her while in the water, such as catching a fish.

Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the driver got lost (Option A). The reason being that there was an accident on the main road, indicating that the driver may have taken a wrong turn or gotten confused while driving. This is supported by the fact that the driver had to stop at a gas station to ask for directions. In contrast, option B does not provide any specific details about why the driver followed the truck, making it less plausible as the cause of getting lost.

The sentence ""A szél áthatott a nyitott ablakon"" means ""The wind blew through the open window,"" indicating that there was an opening in the room for the wind to enter. As a result, the curtains would be more likely to move or rustle due to the wind rather than being hanged (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Kihúztam a lámpát) is more likely to be the cause of the power outage in the house. This is because the lamp is closer to the electrical panel than the circuit breaker box, making it more likely that a faulty lamp would cause a power outage in the entire house rather than just one room.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Megszúrt az izmait a tükörben) is the more likely cause of the pain in the neck. The premise suggests that the person may have strained or injured their muscles while looking into a mirror, which could potentially cause discomfort or pain in the neck region.

Therefore, it is unlikely that Option B (the holiday home was located on an island) caused the problem, as this would not have been possible without prior knowledge of the location.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Felt the needle) is more likely. The sentence implies that the person felt discomfort or pain from the tattooing process, which suggests that they were feeling the needle pricks. Option B (Wanted to rebel) does not fit with the context of the sentence as it does not provide any evidence for why the person would want to rebel against something.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Gyanakodtam) will occur.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (A nőnek gyűrűi voltak a szemei alatt) is the most likely cause for why the woman had rings under her eyes. This is because the premise states that the woman had rings under her eyes ""all night long,"" implying that this was a persistent condition rather than something temporary or caused by a single event like letting her baby cry all night. Therefore, it is more likely that the woman's rings under her eyes were due to some underlying condition such as fatigue or poor sleep habits rather than anything else."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Szappannal köpötte a kezét) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's fingers turning into silicon rubber. This is because applying soap to one's hand can potentially damage or dry out the skin, leading to changes in its texture and flexibility. On the other hand, Zuhanyozás (long-term bathing) may not have any direct effect on the skin's structure or properties. Therefore, option B is the better answer based on the given information.

Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened to the jacket.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the fog cream came out of the tube) is more likely. The sentence ""A lány megnyomta a fogkrém csövet"" implies that the girl squeezed or pressed the toothpaste tube, which would cause the toothpaste to come out of the tube rather than the other way around.

The sentence ""Én szedtem a paradicsomot a szőlőről"" implies that the speaker harvested the grapes from the vineyard, which suggests that they were already ripe or mature when picked. It's less likely that the speaker would have ""öntötte"" (polished/finished) the grapes after picking them, as this process typically involves treating unripe or immature fruit to enhance their flavor and texture."

The phrase ""felgyulladt"" suggests that something has ignited or caught fire, which could be interpreted as a positive event such as receiving good news. In contrast, option B (Elvesztettem a türelmet) does not fit with the context of the sentence and seems unlikely given the wording of the premise."

However, it is possible for a rocking motion of the chair to disrupt the person's equilibrium and cause them to lose their balance. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.

This is a common physical reaction when someone is feeling embarrassed or flustered, making it a more plausible outcome based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A bányánál ment át) is more likely. The premise states that the enemy ship exploded, indicating a sudden and violent event. It is unlikely that the ship would have had time to reach the port before exploding. Therefore, option A is the most plausible cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a toad swallowed him) is the more likely cause of the man's disappearance. The idea that he stepped into a puddle of water (option B) does not fit with the absurdity and fantastical elements present in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that they found the killer's identity (Option A). The fact that the investigators ""leporolták"" the scene suggests that they were looking for clues or evidence, which could lead them to identify the perpetrator. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Sokan munkanélküliek voltak) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Épp az ellenkező forgalomba akartak menni) is the most likely cause.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The sofőr took a break) is more likely. The reason for this is that the premise states that there is no fuel left in the car, indicating that the journey has been prolonged, and therefore it is more likely that the driver would need to take a break to rest or refuel.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Meghívót kapott) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Az anyja mérte a lázát) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""a fiú homlokát forrónak érzett"" suggests that the boy was feeling unwell or in pain, which could be caused by his mother's measurement of his temperature. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B (Az anyja a parkba vitte), as it does not provide a logical explanation for the boy's discomfort."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Meg akarta nyűgözni a randit) is more likely. The fact that he used cologne suggests that he was trying to impress or attract someone, rather than simply putting gel in his hair.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Fogtam egy lapátot) is more likely to occur because it provides a logical explanation for why there would be no light in the house after the power went out. The other option (Egy zseblámpát kerestem) does not provide any obvious reason as to why there would still be no light in the house even if you were searching for a flashlight.
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that Option B (Anna ikreket szült) is the correct answer. The fact that the family moved into a larger house suggests that there may have been changes or developments within the family that necessitated this move, such as the birth of children. However, the mention of the son not graduating from high school does not provide enough evidence to support this conclusion. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Meg akarta spórolni az energiájával) is more likely. The fact that the runner was running at a slow pace suggests that they were trying to conserve energy, rather than focusing on reaching the finish line.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the machine spilled) is more likely than Option B (the bag caught).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Megöleltem) is more likely. The speaker is expressing grief over their deceased pet, indicating that they are emotionally invested in the situation and may be prone to impulsive or emotional actions.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (wrote a debt collection letter) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Levágták a körmeit) is more likely to be the cause of the person's misfortune. The premise suggests that the person has been ""cursed"" or afflicted with some kind of misfortune, and cutting off their hair could potentially be seen as a form of punishment or retribution. In contrast, option B (Megütötte a lábujját) does not necessarily imply any sort of supernatural or magical cause for the person's misfortune, but rather a physical injury caused by an external force."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the brother got into an argument with their parents) is more likely. The premise mentions that the person is ""proud"" of their brother, implying a positive relationship between them. It is less likely that the brother would get into an argument with their parents given this context."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The girl looked at the stars) is more likely. The premise mentions that the girl wanted to learn about the solar system, but it doesn't mention anything about her going to the library or looking at books. Therefore, it makes sense that she would look up at the stars instead.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Az ajtó fölé helyeztem a plakátot) is the more likely cause. The placard was placed above the door, indicating that it was hung or attached to the door rather than being placed behind it.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Az építész építette az épületet) is true. The fact that the client approved the architect's design suggests that the architect has successfully designed an appropriate building for their needs, which means they have probably completed the construction process as well. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A - ""A keze remegett"" (The person closed the channel) occurred. This is because the wording of the premise suggests that something was done to close or block the channel, rather than simply opening it again. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the company's CEO resigned) is more likely to occur than Option B (the board of directors found a replacement). This is because the CEO's resignation is often seen as a significant event that can have far-reaching consequences for a company, while finding a new CEO may be a less urgent matter.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I was seated in the back row) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the family paid the fine) is more likely. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the premise that the person was attacked by a prison official or any other individual. It is more plausible that the person's family paid the fine as part of their release agreement with the authorities.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the family lost everything due to a fire (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A doboz újrahasznosított) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Megtanult számítógépet használni) is more likely. The premise states that the girl joined a debate club, which suggests that she may have developed new skills or interests related to public speaking and argumentation. Learning how to use a computer could be an important skill for this purpose, as it would allow her to research and prepare arguments, as well as communicate with team members and opponents through email or online platforms. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Zenehallgatás) is the correct answer. The word ""hangulatom"" means ""brain"" in Hungarian, and ""javult"" means ""goes crazy"". Therefore, the phrase ""A hangulatom javult"" can be translated to ""The brain went crazy"", which fits with the theme of a mental breakdown or psychotic episode. Option B (""Elmosogattam"") does not fit this context as well, as it means ""I scared him"" in Hungarian."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ettettek a hajléktalanokat) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the purpose of the organization, which is to help those in need. Option B (Megrendeztek egy aukción) does not directly relate to helping the homeless, but rather organizing an event for fundraising purposes.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The passengers screamed) is more likely. The word ""nevetgéltek"" in Hungarian means to scream or shout loudly, so it's the most appropriate answer for this question."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Amikor elindultam,becsuktam az ajtót) is more likely to be the correct answer as it provides a logical explanation for why the door was locked when he left the house. Option A (Megnéztem a postaládát, amikor elmentem a házból) does not provide any information that would suggest why the door was locked.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Északra utazott) is more likely. The sun rises in the east, so if someone wanted to see it rise, they would need to go south, not north.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (The paper has been crumpled) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Más országok vezetői segelyeket küldtek) is more likely.

Instead, they may offer aid and support to help mitigate the effects of the disaster.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kiugrott a medencéból) is more likely. The text states that the boy was ""áztatták,"" which means he was submerged or immersed in water. This implies that he was already in the pool when he fell, rather than entering it from outside. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for how the boy ended up in the pool."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vissza kellett volna adnunk a könyvtárba) is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A bűnözőt kivégezték) is more likely as it directly contradicts the information provided in the premise that the criminal was executed. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Rajtott, hogy hiányzik a kártya) is the most likely cause. The woman realized that her credit card was missing, indicating that she may have misplaced it or left it somewhere without realizing it.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Felhangosítottam) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the girl pulled her hair) is a more likely explanation for why the boy's hair fell out than option A (the girl disturbed him). Therefore, I would choose option B as the correct answer.

Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kinyitottam a szemem,"" option A (Felkeltem) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Megkértem, hogy csökkentsék le) is more likely because it aligns with the tone of the conversation. The speaker is more likely to ask their neighbor directly to reduce the noise rather than asking for a loan or sharing music.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Takarékos volt a keresetivel) is more likely as it suggests that the man was thrifty with his earnings, rather than just barely scraping by at minimum wage.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Munkát keresett) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the paint spread everywhere) is more likely. The sentence ""A művész sárga festéket kevert kék festékbe"" implies that the artist mixed yellow paint with blue paint, resulting in a uniform mixture of both colors. Therefore, it is unlikely that the paint would have spread everywhere, as there would be no visible difference between the areas where the yellow and blue paints were mixed."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Elfogyott a beszélgetés témaja) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""Megváltoztattam a beszélgetés témáját,"" indicating that the conversation topic was changed. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Én meg hideg vállon néztem rá) is more likely. The fact that the speaker's face was cold suggests that they were not happy to see their brother home, which aligns with the second option.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (The play has started) is correct. The fact that the actors are already on stage suggests that the play has begun, rather than them leaving the stage.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The rabló azzal fenyegetőzött, hogy bántja a túszot) is the most likely cause. The fact that the robber threatened to harm the hostage suggests that they may have been motivated by a desire for control or power rather than simply wanting to escape with the money.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (the musician hit his foot) is more likely than Option B (the musician drummed).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the child woke up from a nightmare) is more likely. The fact that the parents are rushing to their child's room suggests that something is wrong or disturbing, and it is more plausible that the child had a bad dream than that they were afraid of looking under the bed.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Koraszülött volt) is the correct answer. The fact that she was born prematurely suggests that there may have been complications during pregnancy or childbirth that led to her being born early.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The termes elpusztult) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A macska üldözte a madarat,"" it is more likely that Option B, ""A madár el kapott egy férget,"" occurred. This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the cat was chasing the bird, implying a level of aggression or pursuit, which could result in the bird being caught."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A nyárra kiengedték az iskolát) is a more likely cause for why the girl stopped attending school. This is because summer vacation typically occurs during the warmer months of the year, and it is common for schools to be closed or have reduced schedules during this time. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl stopped attending school due to the summer break rather than moving to a new city.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the workers went on strike) is more likely to occur. The owner's refusal to grant the workers a raise suggests that there may be a power imbalance in the workplace, leading to labor unrest and potentially a strike.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the extremists influenced) is more likely. The passage states that ""a vezető ellenségeskedett a szélsőségesekkel az országában,"" indicating that there was tension between the leader and the extremists. It does not suggest that the extremists directly caused the leader's death. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mezítláb sétáltam a parton,"" option A is more likely. The word ""homok"" (sand) suggests that sand got stuck to my feet while walking along the beach, which could be due to the waves crashing against the shore. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Felvettem a sportnadrágot) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of waking up and getting ready for bed. It makes sense that someone might put on their sportswear before going to sleep, but it doesn't make as much sense to drink a glass of water at this time. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the father smiled) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Az anya elhallgattatta a fiát"" means ""The mother gave birth to a son,"" so the context suggests that the focus is on the mother's action of giving birth rather than the son's reaction. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Felhúztam a farmereket) is more likely to be the cause of the hole in the field. This is because the phrase ""elyuk a farmeremben"" suggests that something has disrupted or damaged the soil, which could potentially have been caused by heavy rain or strong winds. However, the idea of someone hanging themselves from trees does not seem to be a plausible explanation for the hole in the field. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Károsodás) is more likely to occur. The boy's teeth are described as ""fiú fogszabályzót"" which implies that they are not perfectly straight or aligned, and therefore more prone to damage or irregularity. Option B (A fogai egyenesebbek lettek) suggests that the boy's teeth have become straighter, which is less likely given the description of his current teeth."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ma izomfájással ébredtem) is more likely. The sentence ""Tegnap edzettünk az edzérteremben"" suggests that we had a workout yesterday in the gym, and the fact that you woke up with muscle pain today implies that it was physically demanding. Option B (Ma torokfájással ébredtem) does not provide any information about the nature of your workout or why you might be experiencing discomfort today. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The other students felt like they were being left out) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (“úgy döntött, megpróbál egy flipet csinálni”) is more likely. The child may try to perform a trick or stunt, which could result in them flying into the air.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the wind became stronger) is a more plausible explanation for why the forest fire spread quickly. The other option, that the arsonists were caught (option B), does not align with the given information as there is no indication in the premise of any individuals intentionally starting the fire. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the mother tied the wound) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Aláírta a végrendeletét) is more likely to be the correct answer because if he survived a deadly disease, it's possible that he may have also prepared his will before passing away.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Megszívtam a forró kávét,"" option A (Megharaptam a nyelvem) is the correct answer because it better fits the context of the sentence. The word ""megszívtam"" means ""I drank,"" so it makes sense that the speaker would also have bitten their tongue. Option B (Megégettem a nyelvem) does not fit as well in this context, as it doesn't make sense to say that the speaker burned their tongue when they were drinking coffee."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the editor fired the writer) caused the delay in completing the project. The premise states that the editor ""kirúgta"" or fired the writer, suggesting that there was a breakdown in their working relationship rather than an oversight or forgetfulness on the part of the writer. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the delay."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ki voltam merülve,"" Option A (I was swimming) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Őazonosította a beteg tüeteit) is more likely. The doctor has identified the patient's symptoms, rather than prescribing medication without knowing the underlying condition.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Megkarcoltam a bőrömet,"" option A (Izzadt volt) is the more likely cause. The word ""izzad"" means to sweat or feel hot, which suggests that the person's body temperature may have increased due to some external factor such as heat exposure or physical activity."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he elvesztette a feszültségét (Option A). The phrase ""sürgősségi műtétre vitték"" suggests that the person was in critical condition and needed immediate medical attention, which could have caused them to experience shock or loss of consciousness. It is less likely that they would have suffered a heart attack (Option B) without any prior symptoms or warning signs."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Meghajlította a karját) is more likely as it means ""He stretched his arm"" which fits with the context of the sentence better than option B (Megmasszírozta a karját), which means ""He enlarged his arm""."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Meglepődött) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Azt hittem, jó szándékai vannak) is more likely to be the correct cause of the colleague's mistake.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Többre kezdett edzeni) is more likely to be the cause of the man's improved health.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (A támadó teste élettelen lett) is more likely to occur as it directly contradicts the idea of someone being injured in an attack. Option B (A támadó elkezdett vérzni) does not necessarily imply that the person was injured in any way.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A férfi nem célzott jól) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the homeowner found mice (Option A) rather than a bee farm (Option B). The mention of ""pincéből"" (meaning ""from the basement"") suggests that the homeowner discovered something unexpectedly while exploring their own house, which aligns better with the idea of finding rodents like mice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Túl fáradt voltam, hogy bármit is előkészítse) is the most likely cause for not preparing anything for the guest. The passage states that the speaker was too tired to prepare anything, indicating that they did not have enough energy or motivation to do so. This suggests that the reason for not preparing anything was due to fatigue rather than the length of time the guest stayed. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she started hiding the diary rather than writing a new one. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Túlórázik) is more likely to happen. The woman does not have enough money for rent, indicating that she may be struggling financially and unable to pay her bills on time. This scenario is consistent with the idea of being overwhelmed by debt or financial obligations.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Megérintette a forró kályhát) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the child's hand quickly retracted, indicating that something hot was touched. This suggests that the child may have accidentally touched a hot stove or other burning object, which is more likely than simply patting a dog.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (a survey) is more likely to be the correct answer. The company wants to measure customer satisfaction, which suggests that they are interested in gathering data through a structured method such as a survey rather than simply offering discounts to new customers.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the boy dropped the towels from the couch) is more likely than option B (the boy pulled out a chair from under the table). This is because the premise mentions that the towels were ""megkarcolódott"" or ""piled up,"" indicating that they were placed there deliberately rather than being moved by someone sitting in the chair."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Elzártam az arcom,"" option B is the most likely cause. The phrase ""az ellenségem megütötte a kezem"" means ""My enemy hit me with his hand,"" indicating that the speaker was physically attacked by their enemy. This is supported by the context of the poem, where the speaker describes being hurt by their enemy's words. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (villámütés érte) caused the famous statue to catch fire rather than option B (az emberek eljöttek, hogy tiszteljék). This is because there is no indication in the premise that a large group of people gathered to pay their respects to the statue. Therefore, the sudden and unexpected event of a lightning strike seems like a more plausible explanation for why the statue caught fire.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the gyümölcs vetőmagot ad) will occur. The reason for this is that the wording of the premise suggests that something has been left on the table, implying that there is already something present in the environment that could potentially cause the effect described in Option A. In contrast, Option B (the legyek elárasztották a gyümölcsöt) does not provide any context or explanation for why the bees might have surrounded the fruit, making it less likely to occur based solely on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Option A: The ballerina eltörte a kötőzsinórt.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the ballerina eltörte a kötőzsinórt, which suggests that she injured her ankle or foot while dancing. This is more likely than option B, as it is not possible for someone to ""csavara"" (which means ""to twist"") their own bone without any external force being applied. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Megtanulta, hogyan kösszenek össze) is the most likely cause. The fact that the child's shoelaces were untied suggests that they may have learned how to tie them independently, rather than simply running around a playground.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Elvesztettem az időérzékemet) is more likely. The author's use of language suggests that they have lost their sense of time rather than simply returning the book.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A szüliek befolyásolták) is more likely. The fact that the man's height was similar to his parents suggests that he inherited it from them, rather than their influence causing him to grow taller.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Elfogyott a benzin) is the correct answer. The phrase ""A kocsi fokozatosan lelassult"" suggests that the car has slowed down gradually, indicating that there may be an issue with the fuel supply rather than the driver falling asleep at the wheel."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The fagylalt lost its flavor) is more likely. The phrase ""evett a fagyit"" means ""ate ice cream,"" so it's unlikely that the fagylalt would lose its flavor due to exposure to sunlight. Therefore, Option A (The ice cream lost its flavor) is not a plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the szőnyeg piszkosnak tűnt) is more likely as it provides a clear and specific reason for why the room looked messy. The other option does not provide any logical explanation for why the room would be messy. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Fáj a fejem) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""Korán elmentem a munkából,"" indicating that Korán left work early without any explanation or warning. This suggests that he may have been feeling unwell or experiencing some discomfort, leading to his decision to leave work early. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible cause for Korán's departure from work."

Response:  Based on the given information, option A (a hatizsák) is more likely to be the reason why the man stood out in the crowd.

Option B (neon mellény) does not provide any specific details that would make it stand out as a unique feature that could have caused him to be noticed.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person will be charged with perjury (Option B). The fact that they have been accused of lying under oath suggests that their testimony was deemed untruthful by the court or authorities, which could lead to criminal charges for perjury.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (New look) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they were deported (Option B). The premise states that they were caught while illegally residing in the country, indicating that their immigration status was not legal. As a result, they would have been subject to deportation proceedings and potentially removed from the country.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the audience laughed) occurred. The sentence ""A közszolgálati szónok viccet mondott"" implies that a speaker made a joke, and the response of the audience is likely to be laughter rather than standing up. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (A nap megvakította) is the most likely answer. The phrase ""nap megvakította"" means ""the sun burned,"" indicating that exposure to the sun's rays caused damage or discoloration to the skin. This is a common effect of excessive sun exposure without proper protection. Option B (A nap leégette a bőrömet) means ""the sun scorched the skin,"" but it does not convey the same level of damage as option A. Therefore, option A is the best answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that I cried (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the kés was dull) is more likely to be the cause of the difficulty in cutting the steak.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I decided to visit) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Névtelen volt) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Eldobtam a levelet"" implies that someone received a letter, so it's unlikely that the letter was unreadable or had no name. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A madár megpörgette a szárnyait,"" it is more likely that the bird flew upwards (Option B). The word ""megpörgette"" means ""beat"" or ""thrashed"", indicating that the bird flapped its wings rapidly, causing itself to rise into the air. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: A garázs nyitva volt (the garage was open). This is because there is no indication in the premise that the garage was closed or locked. Therefore, it is more probable that the garage was open when the car was parked outside.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the áldozat felemolta a kezét) is more likely because it suggests that the victim tried to defend themselves against the attacker's weapon. Option A (the bűnöző letette a fegyvert) does not provide any information about how the victim reacted to the situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (A nagbátyám temetése) is more likely to be the correct answer. The mention of ""a nagbátyám"" suggests that the speaker has a close relationship with their great-uncle, which makes it more plausible that they would want to attend his funeral rather than a friend's wedding."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option B (Émelygésem volt) is the correct answer. The elf's statement suggests that he has lost his sense of time, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as old age or an illness. However, the use of the word ""émelygés"" specifically implies that the elf's perception of time was distorted due to some kind of magical or supernatural event. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The spectators rushed to the field) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Én szolgáltam fel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""nyálas"" in the premise suggests that something has a slimy or gelatinous texture, which could be achieved by adding a liquid such as water or broth. Therefore, it is more likely that you added water or broth to the lemosa rather than using salt to make it taste better."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the paper absorbed the liquid) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Újra elolvasta a könyvet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The man looked out of the window) is more likely. The fact that the man ""kinézett az ablakon"" suggests that he was looking outside the plane during the turbulence, which could have caused him to lose his balance and hit his head on the ceiling."

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (amputated his leg) is correct. The phrase ""az orvosok művégtagot adtak"" implies that the doctors performed an amputation on the patient's leg. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the woman grabbed her elbow) will occur. The phrase ""a boy bit her knee"" implies physical contact and violence, suggesting that the woman may react with pain or anger by grabbing her elbow in response. In contrast, Option B (she pulled his arm) does not necessarily imply a violent reaction from the woman."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Értékeltem a véleményét) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the conversation. The speaker has asked their friend for advice or opinion, and therefore it makes sense that they would value their friend's input and consider their perspective. Option B (Tudtam, hogy igazam van) does not fit as well in this scenario since it implies that the speaker already knew the answer before asking their friend for advice, which goes against the flow of the conversation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A fiú sárba lépett,"" option B is the correct answer because it suggests that the silt or mud stuck to his face rather than getting attached to his shoes."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The emberek a föld alá bújtak) is more likely. The text states that ""a városba több centiméternyi hó esett,"" indicating that there was significant snowfall in the city. This suggests that the streets and sidewalks were likely covered in snow, making it difficult or impossible for people to go outside. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Fenyegetett, hogy felmond.) is more likely. The fact that the employee's work shift has ended suggests that they may be planning to leave their job permanently, rather than just taking a break during the day.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the fa Megsérte a Házt) is more likely to be the correct answer because it directly relates to the information provided in the premise. The other option does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of the fa affecting the back garden.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A kandallóba raktam a fát) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for how the fire started. The other option (Leütöttem a fejszét a fára) does not provide any plausible reason for how the fire began.

It does not necessarily imply that she kissed him, although it could be inferred as a possibility depending on their relationship dynamics.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I was confused) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Meg akarták találni egy kompromisszumot) is the most likely cause. The text states that they ""dobtak"" an érmet, implying a sense of disagreement or conflict, and then mentions finding a compromise as the desired outcome. This suggests that the group was trying to find a way to resolve their differences peacefully rather than making a fair decision."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the man put away the shopping in the fridge) than Option B (the man took out the pizza from the oven).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Keményen dolgozott) is more likely. The phrase ""nagyra törő célt"" suggests that the woman has a strong goal in mind, and ""keményen dolgozott"" means she worked hard to achieve it. Therefore, option B is the best answer."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (The fürdővíz lecsapott a kádból) is more likely to occur as it implies that water from the bathtub overflowed into the room, which could cause the floor to be wet. Option A (A fürdővíz lágylett) does not provide any explanation for why the floor would be wet.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Égy testvériséghez csatlakozott) is more likely. The main character wants to meet new people on campus, which suggests that they are looking for social interaction and connection with others. Joining a fraternity or sorority would provide an opportunity for them to meet like-minded individuals and form close bonds, making it a more plausible choice than pursuing a degree in engineering.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pénzt keresek) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The speaker has just mentioned that they have ""felhúztam a kanapé párnát,"" which means they have messed up their lunch, suggesting that they are in a hurry or stressed about something. Given this context, it makes more sense for them to be looking for money rather than rearranging their belongings in their bag."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A darázs a fiú felé repült,"" option A (the boy ran) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was sentenced to public service (Option A).

"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (The rendőrség üldözte a bűnözőt) is more likely. The fact that the criminal has fled from the police suggests that the police are actively pursuing him, making it less likely that they would simply ""ellátta"" (which means ""to calm down"" or ""to soothe"") the victim."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Elhagytam) is the correct answer. The fact that the laptop did not connect to the internet suggests that there may have been an issue with the device itself rather than a problem with the Wi-Fi network. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the laptop could not connect to the internet.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (összehajtotta a ruháit) is more likely. The fact that she cannot find her place in the closet suggests that her clothes are disorganized or scattered around the room, which could be due to her having thrown them haphazardly without putting them back in their proper places after use.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the wife gave birth) is the more likely cause of the man's broken heart. This is because the premise specifically mentions that the man has a ""broken heart,"" which is often associated with emotional distress caused by significant life events such as the birth or death of a loved one. In contrast, option B (the wife left him) could also potentially cause emotional distress, but it would not necessarily result in a ""broken heart"" in the classical sense. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The job offer was retracted) is more likely.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the buyer did not use a loudspeaker to attract attention but instead tried to deceive the security guards with fake money.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (the sight of something) is more likely to be the cause of the bad smell coming from the kitchen. This is because it mentions that ""Kivittem a szemetet"" (I threw up the sight), suggesting that the bad smell may have been caused by something seen rather than something done or forgotten. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A gyerekek csodálták az állatokat) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A férfi hangosan Lélegzett) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""hangosan"" means loudly in Hungarian, so it is unlikely that his breathing would have stopped or been blocked."

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: Kinyitottam az ablakokat will have the desired effect of cooling down the house than Option A: Hoztam takarókat.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a méh megcsípte a kertészt) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the narcissuses were destroyed in the garden. The other option (the mókusok kiásták a gyümölcsöket) does not provide a clear reason for the destruction of the narcissuses. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Megütöttem a gyufát,"" it is more likely that Option A: The flame weakened. "

Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (A szüleik meghaltak) is more likely to be the cause of why the children were sent to an orphanage. This is because the death of parents is a common reason for children to be placed in an orphanage, while being elkényeztetett (well-off/privileged) is less likely to result in this outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that a tsunami (Option A) occurred rather than an increase in rain (Option B). This is because a meteorite impacting the ocean would create a massive disturbance in the water, leading to a tsunami wave. While heavy rainfall can cause flooding and other damage, it is unlikely to result in a large-scale oceanic disturbance like a tsunami. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.

This is because the premise states that the country discovered new areas of land, which suggests that they were not already inhabited by other civilizations. Colonization would therefore be the most logical explanation for how the country expanded its territory.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the cup fell onto the floor) is more likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: The floor was uneven. This is because the word ""ég"" (meaning ""uneven"") is used to describe the floor, indicating that it was not flat or even. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."

The fact that he has been through therapy suggests that he has taken active steps to address his mental health issues, which may have contributed to his current state of depression.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ismerői twoelkedést fejezhetik ki) is more likely. The fact that she claims to have seen a ghost may lead her friends and family to be skeptical or dismissive of her claim, rather than accepting it without question.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Majdnem megfulladt az óceánban) is more likely to be the cause of the man's hearing loss than option B (Majdnem meghalt egy robbanásban). This is because drowning can cause permanent damage to the inner ear and lead to hearing loss, while a blast injury may not necessarily result in immediate or long-term hearing problems.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Megütötte a szívet) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""elvesztette a beszédképességét"" suggests that something has happened to the person's ability to speak, which could potentially be caused by emotional distress such as heartbreak or grief. Option B (Mély lélegzetet vett) does not provide any contextual clues related to speech impairment, making it less likely as the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (there was a crack in the concrete) is more likely to be the correct answer. The mention of ""repedés"" (crack) suggests that the woman's fall may have been caused by a fracture or weakness in the surface she was walking on, rather than someone calling her name."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the man jumped into the pool after the bullet) occurred. The reason for this is that the premise states that the man threw a bullet into the pool, which implies that he was in close proximity to the pool when he did so. Therefore, it makes sense that he would have jumped into the pool to retrieve the bullet rather than waiting for the rescue team to arrive.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Antibiotikumot vettem,"" it is more likely that option A, ""A fertőzést meggyógyult."" The use of antibiotics suggests that the infection has been treated and cured."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the driver slammed on the brakes (Option A). The sudden change in color suggests a dramatic action, such as stopping suddenly, rather than simply honking the horn (Option B).
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (meleg vízbe áztattam a tartályt) caused the container to melt because water has a lower melting point than most metals and can easily reach temperatures above 100°C, which could be sufficient to melt some plastics. In contrast, option B (a forró kályhara tettem a tartályt) would not provide enough heat to melt the plastic as a kiln typically operates at much higher temperatures (around 800-1200°C).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A sofőr egy telefonoszlopot ütött el) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the accident was caused by something specific to the driver's actions or behavior, rather than simply passing through an area where there are many obstacles.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he missed the exam (Option A). The sentence ""A fiú egész éjjel tanult"" implies that he studied all night, but there is no indication that he attended the exam. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Felt úszni tanulni) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the information provided in the passage. The text states that the boy ""felt úszni tanulni,"" indicating that he was learning how to swim. This suggests that he had never swum before and was still in the process of learning, rather than having already mastered the skill as implied by option B (A mentőő szolgálatban volt)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A kezemet a mellkasomra tettem,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something was done to the chest, which implies a physical action such as pressing or touching. This is consistent with option A, which states ""Éreztem a szívverésemet."" Option B does not make sense in this context because there is no indication of anything happening to the heart rate."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that there was a lot of noise in the office (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the family invited their neighbors to dinner) is more likely. The premise states that the family wanted to get to know their new neighbors, which would be easier to achieve through an invitation for dinner than by simply shouting from one's garden.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Amedenceből felcsapott a víz,"" option A is the most likely cause. The word ""felcsapott"" implies that something (in this case, water) rose or came up from the bottom of the pool, rather than simply floating on top of it. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Véletlenül lenyeltem egy magot) is more likely. The premise mentions that Megharaptam ""egy szelet görögdinnyét,"" which means she swallowed a seed of Greek dinnya. This suggests that something small and insignificant was swallowed, like a seed, rather than something large and important like a tooth. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zavarba hozta a hang) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman was startled by the loud noise. The other option, option B (A füleit is átkapták), does not provide any logical explanation for why the woman would be startled by a loud noise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Megittam az összes vízét) is the most likely cause of the water in the glass being cold again. This is because the statement mentions ""the vizes üvegemet,"" which suggests that the water in the glass was previously hot but has now been cooled down to room temperature. Therefore, it is more likely that the water was refrigerated or cooled down using another means rather than simply being left in the fridge."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Szemérmes szavak voltak benne) is more likely to be the reason for censorship. The use of offensive or insulting language in the television show could have led to its censorship.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the legéség megfulladt) occurred. The reason for this is that a ship sinking due to flooding caused by a malfunctioning bilge pump would not necessarily lead to a confrontation with pirates. While piracy is a concern in some regions of the world, it is unlikely that a ship would encounter pirates in these waters without any prior warning or indications of suspicious activity. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the boy was amazed by the puzzle) is correct. The wording of the premise suggests that the boy was surprised or impressed by the puzzle, rather than simply asking for a clue. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (A férfi letette a telefont) is more likely. The word ""letette"" in Hungarian means ""dropped"", so it's more likely that the man dropped the phone than picked it up."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (A friend stood up for me) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Léget pumpáltam a gumira) is more likely to cause the tire to go flat than option B (Átváltottam a sebességet a motoron).

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the father touched her face) is more likely to cause the girl to smile than option A (the father told her a story). This is because physical touch can have a powerful impact on emotions and moods, especially in children, whereas hearing a story may not have as much of an immediate effect.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Adósság volt) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Húsvázas volt) is more likely to be the cause of the girl not coming home from school.

On the other hand, option B (Élvezte a matek tanulását) does not provide any specific reason why the girl would not come home from school, making it less plausible as the cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A szemetes zsák tele volt,"" option A (The kukába vittek) is the most likely answer. The word ""kukába"" suggests a place where things are kept or stored, which aligns with the idea of putting something in a bag. Option B (""A mosogatóból dobtam"") does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Leporoltam a szőnyeget,"" option A (A szobatársam kiöntött egy kis puncsot) is the most likely cause. This is because the word ""leporoltam"" means ""I spilled"" or ""I poured,"" indicating that something was accidentally knocked over or spilled, rather than the cat simply hauling itself across the room."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dobbed a seat across the room) is more likely to cause a disturbance than option A (Kicked off the computer).

The main character has already eaten half of their meal, so there is no reason to believe they would save any leftovers for later. In fact, it's more likely that they would want to consume all of their food before moving on to other tasks or activities. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A bokám duzzadt,"" option A is more likely. The word ""duzzakt"" means to become fat or plump, so it's more likely that the person became fatter rather than lotioning themselves up."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Leült) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the fly buzzed away) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Kivonult a versenybő) occurred. The text states ""futó érezte, hogy a versenytársa eléri őt,"" indicating that the runner felt like their competitor was catching up to them. This suggests that the runner slowed down or dropped out of the race, rather than speeding up."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Találtam egy megoldást) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the traveler feels (A) Rettegett. The word ""remegő"" in Hungarian means trembling or shaking, so the traveler is likely to feel uneasy or scared while crossing the rickety bridge."
