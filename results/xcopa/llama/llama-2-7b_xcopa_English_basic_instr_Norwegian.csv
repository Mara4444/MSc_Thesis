"Response:  Alternativ B: The patrol agent accused them of smuggling. 
The reason is that option B provides a more dramatic and unexpected outcome, which can create a sense of tension and suspense in the story. By accusing the travelers of smuggling, the patrol agent has created a conflict that could lead to further complications and obstacles for the characters, adding complexity and intrigue to the plot. In contrast, option A simply states that the patrol agent checked their passports without providing any additional detail or conflict."

Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative A (their camp counselor told them a ghost story) led to their fear. This is because telling a ghost story can create an atmosphere of fear and unease, especially in a setting like a camp where children are already vulnerable and away from home. In contrast, toasting marshmallows on a campfire may have been a fun and enjoyable activity that did not lead to fear. Therefore, Alternative A is the most plausible explanation for why the young campers felt scared.
Response:  Alternativ B: He got a concussion.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that my bank account was empty when I wrote the check than that I earned a pay raise. Therefore, the answer is Alternative A: My bank account was empty.
Response:  Alternativ A (He deleted the spam) is more likely to be effective because it addresses the root cause of the problem, which is the excessive amount of spam in his inbox. By deleting the spam, he will no longer have to deal with unnecessary emails cluttering up his inbox and making it difficult to find important messages. In contrast, sending out a mass email may only provide temporary relief by allowing him to communicate with others, but it does not address the underlying issue of too much spam in his inbox.

"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that there was a broken link in the chain (B). This is because the phrase ""the chain came apart"" suggests that the chain was no longer connected and had separated into two or more pieces, which would be consistent with a broken link. In contrast, if the chain was wrapped around a tire (A), it would still be connected and not come apart. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the chain broke."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that they compromised because they grew tired of arguing. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer.
"Response:  Alternativ A is the most likely outcome. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the woman will hire a campaign manager than testify in court. Running for public office typically involves building a campaign and raising funds, which would require hiring staff and professionals to help with these tasks. Testifying in court, on the other hand, is an unrelated event that may or may not occur as part of her decision to run for office."

This is because there is no indication of any specific illness or medical condition that would cause the employee to need a day off. Additionally, the phrase ""he just wanted a day off"" implies that the employee's motivation was not related to their health but rather personal reasons. Therefore, Alternative B is the most plausible explanation for why the employee called in sick."
Response: 1) She jumped off the diving board.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the movie sold out due to high demand (Alternative A). This is because the statement mentions ""the movie tickets sold out,"" which suggests that there were a lot of people interested in seeing the film and that all available tickets were purchased. On the other hand, while Alternative B mentions ""poor reviews,"" this does not necessarily explain why the movie would sell out, as some people may still be interested in watching it despite negative critical reception."
"Response:  Alternativ B: People complimented him. 
The man lost weight, and people complemented him on his new appearance. This is the most likely outcome as it is a positive reinforcement that can motivate someone to continue their weight loss journey."

Response: 1) My friend kept me waiting.

Response:  Alternativ B: The balloon flew away.
Response:  Alternativ B is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a logical conclusion to the sentence. The sentence states that the travelers checked into their hotel room, and going to the airport would not make sense in this context. Unpacking their suitcases is also unlikely as they have already arrived at their destination. Therefore, option B is the most plausible choice.
Response:  Alternativ A (The peach bruised).
Response: 100% av gjenværende spørrsmål har blitt oppfyllet, men ingen av dem kan forklare hva som skjedde med mine hender. Dette tyder på at det ikke finnes noen grunnleggende teori for å forklare situasjonen.

"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative B occurred: ""The customer handed her money."" This is because the text states that the cashier opened the cash register and the customer handed something to the cashier, which suggests that the customer paid with physical currency rather than searching their wallet."
"Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the effect. 
Explanation:  The sentence ""The street musician attracted a crowd"" suggests that the musician's performance was successful in drawing attention from passersby, which led to people giving him change. Therefore, alternative A is more likely to be the cause of the effect."

"Response:  Alternativ B: The leaves accumulated on the ground.

Response:  Alternativ B is more likely.
Response:  Alternativ B is more likely to be the cause of the child's discomfort because it provides a specific reason why the child might have needed to use the restroom, such as drinking too much liquid.

Response: 1) Alternativ B - The fish swam towards the food.
"Response:  Alternativ B: She engaged in a protest. 
The woman's political views changed as she became more involved in activism and protests, leading to her decision to switch her party affiliation."
Response:  Alternative B is more likely to be effective in unclogging a bathroom sink because pouring drain cleaner directly into the sink will help dissolve and break up any blockages, such as hair or soap scum, that may be causing the clog. Turning on the faucet alone may not be enough to clear the clog, especially if it is a stubborn one.
Response:  Alternativ A is the correct answer. The passengers got off the train, which led to the train arriving at the station.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He sealed the envelope shut. 
For this sentence, alternative B is more likely to be the correct answer because it better fits the context and the meaning of the sentence. The man is pressing down on the moist flap of the envelope, which suggests that he is trying to close or seal it. Therefore, alternative B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that they moved to different cities (B). This is because the text states that ""the friends lost touch,"" which suggests that they were no longer in close proximity to each other. Moving to different cities would make it more difficult for them to maintain their friendship, leading to a loss of contact. In contrast, enjoying each other's company does not necessarily imply a change in location or distance between the friends."
"Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the accountant's departure from the company. According to the passage, the accountant ""mismanaged the company's funds,"" which suggests that she made serious mistakes in managing the company's finances. This could potentially lead to disciplinary action or termination of employment. In contrast, going on maternity leave is a temporary absence from work for personal reasons related to childbirth and does not necessarily imply any wrongdoing or poor performance by the employee. Therefore, alternative A is more likely to be the cause of the accountant's departure from the company."

"Response:  Alternativ B: She hit the backspace key.

"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative B (She won a contest) is the correct answer. The text states that the girl ""bragged to her friends,"" which suggests that she was proud of something and wanted to share it with others.

Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (She forgot to set her alarm clock) is the correct answer.

"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the researchers will retract the theory (Alternative A). This is because the text states that ""the researchers proved the theory,"" which implies that they have found evidence to support its validity. However, later in the passage, it is mentioned that ""the researchers were wrong,"" which suggests that their findings may not be accurate and could potentially be retracted. Therefore, Alternative A is the most plausible outcome based on the given information."

"Response:  Alternativ B: He confessed his infidelity to her. 
For this scenario, it is more likely that the husband will confess his infidelity to his wife rather than accusing her of it. This is because admitting one's own wrongdoing can be a way of taking responsibility and showing remorse, which are important qualities in any relationship. Accusing someone else without evidence can lead to misunderstandings and conflict, whereas confessing one's own mistake can help to clear the air and promote healing."
Response:  Alternativ B: I spilled water on the poster.
Response:  Alternativ A: Han hadde en nattmarerid.
Response: 1) Alternativ A: His father sat down at the table.

"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (He was going to college) is the reason why the son moved away from home. This is because the passage states that ""he had been saving up money for years"" and ""had finally saved enough to move out,"" which suggests that he was planning to leave home for a specific purpose such as attending college. In contrast, Alternative A (He was discharged from the military) does not provide any explicit evidence to suggest that the son moved away from home."
"Response:  Alternativ B: An earthquake shook the bookcase. 
For this scenario, it is more likely that an earthquake shook the bookcase than that the shelves were covered with dust. Earthquakes can cause objects to fall off shelves or bookcases, and this is a common occurrence during seismic activity. In contrast, dust on shelves is typically not enough to cause books to fall out of a bookcase without some other external force being applied. Therefore, alternative B is the most plausible explanation for why the books fell out of the bookcase."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the problem. When the electricity in your house shuts off, it's usually due to an issue with the power grid or a problem with one of the electrical appliances in your home. Turning on a light may not necessarily restore power to your house, especially if the issue is with the main electrical panel or the power lines themselves. Resetting the circuit breaker may also not solve the problem, as it only trips when there is an overload or short circuit in the electrical system. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the electricity in your house has shut off.

Response:  Alternativ A, the toilet overflowed.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative A (The owner put a collar on the puppy) is the correct answer. This is because the text states that the puppy ""stayed near its owner,"" which suggests that the owner had some kind of control over the puppy's movements. Putting a collar on the puppy would be one way to exert this control and keep the puppy close by. In contrast, keeping the puppy on a leash implies that the owner was actively holding onto the puppy, which does not fit with the idea of the puppy staying near its owner without any direct intervention from the owner."
Response: 100% av gjenværende spørringer har blitt oppfylt.
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a specific action that was taken in response to missing the phone call, which is calling her back.

In contrast, alternative B does not provide any clear or direct action, making it less likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative B (Expensive jewelry was missing from their home) is the correct answer. This is because the passage states that ""the family searched the neighborhood,"" which suggests that they were looking for something specific and important, rather than just a lost dog. Additionally, the mention of expensive jewelry being missing implies that there may have been a burglary or theft in the home, which could explain why the family was searching the area."
Response: 100% av gjenværende spørgsmål
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the employees formed a union due to poor working conditions (Alternative A). This is because the employees were dissatisfied with their work environment and decided to take collective action to improve their situation.

Response: 100% - Alternativ A
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that she took off her shoes (B) than that she wore high heels (A). This is because taking off one's shoes can provide relief from discomfort or pain caused by wearing them, whereas wearing high heels may have contributed to the woman's difficulty in walking.
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a clear and concise explanation for why steam rose off of the pot of water.

If the sales associate had simply helped the girl find a purse she liked, there would be no reason to accuse her of stealing."

"Response:  Alternativ B: The father kicked his son out of the house.

This is a plausible and realistic reason for why someone might need to use a wheelchair, whereas alternative B does not provide any specific information about how the woman came to be in the hospital."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The country was facing economic hardship.

Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that an earthquake hit the city (Alternative A). This is because an earthquake can cause a building to collapse, whereas crime rates increasing would not necessarily lead to a building's collapse.
Response:  Alternativ B is more likely to be the cause of the man's happiness because it suggests that he was able to move on from the breakup and find new love, rather than simply begging his ex-girlfriend to take him back. This implies that he has been able to learn and grow from the experience of the breakup, which could lead to greater emotional well-being and happiness in the long run.

Response:  Based on the context, it is more likely that they got directions to the theatre (B).
"Response:  Alternativ B: Her coworker covered for her.

In contrast, Alternative A does not provide any specific evidence or details to support the idea that the student answered the question correctly.

On the other hand, editing a draft implies that the writer has already completed some work and is revising or refining it, which may not be the case if they are experiencing writer's block.

"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative B (The father gently rocked the baby) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""the baby fell asleep"" suggests a calming and soothing action, which aligns with the description of gentle rocking. Additionally, there is no mention of changing the baby's diaper in the given text, making Alternative A less plausible."
Response: 100% (B) The boy got soaked.
"Response:  Alternativ B: Everyone in the photos refused to smile. 
The reason is that a forgotten flash can result in underexposed or overexposed images, but it will not cause everyone in the photos to refuse to smile. On the other hand, if the photographer forgets to turn on the flash, the resulting images may be too dark or have unflattering shadows, which could make people appear less cooperative or unwilling to smile. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur than option A."
Response: 1) Alternativ A - I was lonely.
Response: 100%
"Response: 100% av gjesterene valgte Alternativ A, ""It soaked up water""."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The resort was on an island. 
Grunnen til dette er at ""booked"" i sentralen betyr at the resort had been reserved or scheduled, and this implies that it is located somewhere specific, such as an island."
"Response: 100% av respondentene valgte alternativet B, ""She wanted to rebel""."
"Response:  Alternativ B: I called the police. 
For why? Because it is more likely that you would call the police if you saw an unfamiliar car parked outside your house, especially if you live in a safe neighborhood and don't often see strangers around. This choice reflects a more cautious and vigilant attitude towards one's personal safety and property."

"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (She put her son to bed) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""rings under her eyes"" suggests that she has been awake or crying recently, and putting a child to bed can be a common reason why someone might stay up late or have dark circles under their eyes."
"Response:  Alternativ A: The volcano erupted. 
Grunnen til dette er at en vulkanutbrudd er den vanligste årsaken til at lava flows ut av en vulkansk kaldera. Det er derfor mer sannsynlig at det var et vulkanutbrudd som førte til at lava flowet ut av kalderaen i stedet for at kalderaen var dormant (Alternativ B)."

Response: 1. Alternativ A: She let me pass through the tollbooth.
"Response:  Alternativ A is the most likely answer. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the executive sold his company stock than he squandered his fortune. Selling company stock would provide a significant amount of money and be a logical way to pay off debts or invest in other opportunities. On the other hand, squandering one's fortune implies a more reckless and irresponsible behavior, which does not fit with the context of the situation."

"Response:  Alternativ A (The truck sped up) is more likely to be the cause of the accident because it provides a clear explanation for how the collision occurred. It states that the truck accelerated, which could have caused it to collide with the car. This answer choice is supported by evidence from the passage, which mentions that the truck ""collided with"" the car. In contrast, alternative B does not provide a clear explanation for how the collision occurred and is not supported by the passage. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response: 100% (B)

Response: 1) Alternativ A (The visitor tapped the knocker on the door).
"Response:  Alternativ A is the most likely answer, as ""He got it dry-cleaned"" is a more plausible explanation for why the man's suit was stained than ""He hung it in his closet""."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the effect.
"Response:  Alternativ B: Pacifists held a parade. 
The reason is that holding a parade can be seen as a more positive and constructive action than staging a protest, which may be perceived as confrontational or disruptive. By organizing a peaceful parade, pacifists can demonstrate their commitment to nonviolence in a way that is both visible and accessible to a wider audience. This could potentially have a greater impact on public opinion and policy-making than simply staging a protest."

Response: 100% av gjenværende spørgsmål har blitt oppfylt.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He filed for divorce. 
For the given situation, it is more likely that the husband will file for divorce than fire his lawyer. This is because filing for divorce is a common legal response to discovering one's spouse is having an affair, and it allows the husband to formally end their marriage and move on with their life. Firing a lawyer, on the other hand, may not be directly related to the discovery of infidelity or the subsequent decision to seek a divorce."
Response:  Alternativ A (The ball bounced) is more likely to be the effect of dropping a rubber ball than alternative B (The ball glowed).

"Response:  Alternativ B: He bought his girlfriend chocolates. 
For this scenario, it is more likely that the man bought his girlfriend chocolates as a romantic gesture because buying gifts is often associated with romance and affection in many cultures. Additionally, chocolate is a common gift item that people give to their loved ones as a token of appreciation or love. In contrast, meeting an ex-girlfriend for lunch may not necessarily be seen as a romantic gesture, depending on the context and circumstances surrounding the encounter."

"Response:  Alternativ B: He shredded the papers. 
The man shuffled through the papers, his hands trembling as he tried to make sense of the documents in front of him. As he worked, he heard the sound of rustling coming from behind him and turned to see that one of the other men had taken out a small shredder and was busy destroying some of the papers on their desk. The man's eyes widened in alarm as he realized what was happening, but before he could say anything, the other man looked up at him with a smirk on his face and said, ""Don't worry, boss. These are just old copies. We don't need them anymore."" With that, he continued to feed the shredder, reducing the important documents to tiny pieces that would be impossible to read or use."
"Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the effect. 
Explanation: When you use a hammer to pound a nail, it will sink into the wood and hold securely. This is because the force applied by the hammer is sufficient to break through the surface of the wood and create a hole that the nail can fit into. On the other hand, if the nail becomes rusty, it may not hold as well in the wood due to corrosion. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the cause of the effect."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The fisherman recast the line. 
The sentence ""The fish bit the line"" implies that the fish is on the hook, and therefore it makes more sense to say that the fisherman would need to recast the line rather than reeling in the fish."
Response:  Based on the context, it is more likely that Alternative B (She got her braces off) is the correct answer. The passage mentions the teenager being embarrassed about going to school, which could be related to the fact that she recently had her braces removed and wants to show off her new smile.
"Response: 
My face lit up with joy (A) or I lost my temper (B)."

Response:  Alternativ B: Her dimples showed.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative A (The enemy ship blew up) is the correct answer.

Therefore, the most straightforward explanation is that the enemy ship was hit by an explosive device, which resulted in its destruction.

"Response:  Alternativ B: Many people faced unemployment. 
The reason is that the phrase ""the nation's economy declined"" implies a broader and more systemic impact on the country, such as widespread job losses or reduced economic activity. This is more likely to lead to widespread suffering and hardship among the population than just a few individuals getting sick. Therefore, alternative B is the most plausible answer."
Response: 1) Alternativ B - She recognized them from her neighborhood.
Response: 100%
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the problem.

"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B occurred - The mother gave birth to twins. This is because there is no indication in the passage that the family's move was related to the son's graduation from high school. Additionally, the mention of ""a bigger house"" suggests that the family may have needed more space to accommodate additional children, such as twins."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely the reason why the marathoner kept at a slow pace.
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the correct explanation because it provides a clear and logical reason why the machine spat out the change. It also aligns with the context of the story, where the boy kicked the machine, which could have caused the coins to fall out. In contrast, alternative B does not provide a clear explanation for why the bag of chips was stuck, and it goes against the context of the story. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response: 100% (3 stemmer) Alternativ B: I gave him a hug.
"Response:  Alternativ B (He paid with cash). 
Grunnlaget:  It is more likely that the man would pay with cash because he did not have enough money in his account to cover the purchase, and writing an IOU is not a common practice in everyday transactions."

Response: 100% av gjenværende spørgsmål
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of her learning about the solar system because it provides a specific and practical action that she took, such as going to the library, which can lead to gaining knowledge or information. On the other hand, alternative B does not provide any concrete actions that would help her learn about the solar system, making it less likely to be the cause.
Response:  Alternativ A is the most likely explanation because it provides a clear and logical reason why the poster was stuck to the wall, which is that you positioned it there intentionally. Option B does not provide any specific or logical reasoning as to how the poster ended up stuck to the wall, making option A the more plausible choice.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The architect adjusted the plans. 
Grunnlaget for svaret er at ""adjust"" means to make changes or modifications, so it is more likely that the architect made changes to the original plans rather than constructing the building themselves."
Response:  Alternativ B: He licked the spoon.
"Response:  Alternativet som har størst sannsynlighet er Alternativ B, ""The board of directors found his replacement"". This is because the departure of a CEO can have significant consequences for a company, and it is likely that the board of directors would take steps to find a suitable replacement rather than simply dissolving the company."
"Response:  Based on the context, it is more likely that the speaker arrived late and took a seat in the back row (Alternative A). This is because the sentence mentions ""I arrived late"" and ""a seat in the back row,"" which suggests that the speaker was not able to arrive early or approach the podium."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that he was released from jail due to his family paying his bail (Alternative A).
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the family's house caught fire (B) than they sold their house (A).

Response: 2 - Alternativ B: The passengers screamed.
"Response:  Alternativ B: I slammed the door upon leaving the house. 
For this sentence, ""upon"" is a more idiomatic and natural choice than ""check"". The phrase ""slammed the door"" also implies a stronger emotion than simply checking the mailbox. Therefore, option B is the most likely to convey the intended meaning of the original text."
"Response:  Alternativ B: He got up early. 
The man wanted to watch the sunrise, so he got up early to make sure he could see it. This is the most likely explanation for why the man traveled north."
Response: 100%
Response:  Alternative B is more likely to be the cause of the nation's recovery because it provides tangible and immediate assistance, such as food, water, medical supplies, and shelter, which are essential for survival and reconstruction after a natural disaster. In contrast, alternative A may take longer to materialize and may not provide direct support to the affected population.
Response: 1) Alternativ A: Han klatret ut av svømmehallen.
Response: 1) It was due to be returned to the library.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He was convicted of murder.

"Response: 100% av gjesterne valgte alternativet A, ""I turned up the volume""."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative B (The girl pulled it) occurred. This is because the sentence ""The boy's hair was sticking up"" implies that there was already something unusual about his hairstyle, which makes it more plausible that someone intentionally pulled or messed with it rather than simply ruffling it accidentally."
Response:  Alternativ A (I sprayed myself with bug repellent).
Response: 100% av gjenværende spørringer har blitt oppfylt.
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the correct answer because it is a common and practical solution to deal with loud noise coming from a neighbor's house. Asking someone to turn down their music or asking to borrow something they own are both polite ways of approaching the situation, but they may not necessarily solve the problem immediately.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man's family lived in poverty due to a lack of financial resources (B). This is supported by the fact that he was frugal with his earnings and earned below minimum wage, which suggests that he did not have a lot of disposable income to spare. In contrast, alternative A does not provide any specific evidence to suggest that the man's family lived in poverty due to their lifestyle choices or habits.
"Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the effect. 
Explanation:  The student's graduation from the university is the direct cause of him looking for a job. Taking up a hobby does not directly lead to finding employment, so alternative A is more likely to be the cause of the effect."
Response:  Alternativ B: The paint turned green.
Response: 100%
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a positive and warm response, which is consistent with the context of someone being released from the hospital after a long illness. Giving someone the cold shoulder would be an unfriendly and unwelcoming reaction, which does not fit well with the situation described in the prompt.
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the correct answer, as it provides a clear and concise explanation of what happened when the curtain went up.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative A (The kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage) is the correct answer. This is because the text states that the hostage ""submitted to the kidnapper's mandates,"" which suggests that the hostage was coerced or forced into compliance through threats of violence or harm."
Response:  Alternativ B: The musician pounded the drum.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative A (The child awoke screaming from a nightmare) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""rushed to their child's bedroom"" suggests that something urgent and frightening had happened, which aligns with the idea of the child having a nightmare. Additionally, the wording of the sentence implies that the parents were prompted by the child's cries or screams, rather than any other reason."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the woman was born deaf (B). Sign language is a common form of communication used by individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, and it is unlikely that she would have been able to communicate through sign language if she were born premature (A).
"Response:  Alternativ B: The crops perished. 
The drought caused significant damage to the crops, leading to their eventual demise. This is the most likely outcome given the context of the situation."
Response: 1) Alternativ B: The bird caught a worm.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that she moved to a new town (B). This is because the text states that ""she moved to a new town,"" which suggests that there was a significant change in her living situation. In contrast, the other option (A) does not provide any specific reason why school would have let out for the summer. Therefore, based on the given information, alternative B is the most plausible explanation for why the girl's life changed significantly."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The employees went on strike. 
The reason is that going on strike is more likely to lead to an increase in employee wages than appointing a new manager. Strikes are often used as a last resort by workers to demand better working conditions and higher pay, so it is more likely that the owner would be forced to negotiate with the employees and grant their demands if they go on strike rather than simply appointing a new manager."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The extremists assassinated him. 
This is the most likely outcome as it provides a clear and dramatic explanation for the leader's death, and fits with the theme of political violence and extremism in the scenario."
"Response:  Alternativ B: Waves crashed along the shore. 
For this sentence, ""Waves crashed along the shore"" is the most likely outcome because it provides a clear and vivid image of what happened while walking barefoot on the beach. The other option, ""Sand stuck to my feet,"" does not provide as much detail or imagery, making it less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Alternativ A (Jeg putte sweatpants på) har størst sannsynlighet til å gi en effekt, da dette kan føre til at jeg får seg varmere og blir mer komfortabel i kroppen. Dette kan igjen føre til at jeg slipper inn trykk og føle seg bedre nok til å sove igjen.

Response: 100%
Response:  Alternativ B is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The post office expedited the letter. 
For this sentence, ""The post office expedited the letter"" is more likely to be the correct answer because it best fits the context of the situation described in the sentence. The word ""expedited"" means to speed up or hasten something, which aligns with the idea that the letter was sent quickly through the postal service. In contrast, ""The post office delivered the letter"" does not convey a sense of urgency or quick delivery, and therefore seems less likely to be the correct choice."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the outcome.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the winds became stronger (Alternative B) than that the arsonists were apprehended (Alternative A). This is because there is no mention of any arrests or investigations into the cause of the fire in the passage.

Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative A (He discovered rats in the basement) is the correct answer.

Additionally, the mention of ""rats"" in the basement suggests that there may be a significant infestation present."
Response: 100% av stemmene ble gitt til Alternativ B (My houseguest overstayed her welcome).
Response:  Alternativ B is more likely to be the outcome of the situation.
Response:  Alternative B is more likely to be the cause of the effect (the woman quitting her job). This is because working overtime may not provide enough financial relief, especially if the woman has other expenses or debts that she needs to pay. Quitting a job, on the other hand, would result in a significant increase in income and could potentially solve the problem of being short on money for rent.
Response:  Alternativ B: He patted the puppy's head.
Response:  Alternative B is more likely to have an effect because it directly measures customer satisfaction through surveys, providing valuable insights into the customers' needs and preferences.

Response: 100% av gjenværende spørsmål korrigeres.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the statue was struck by lightning (Alternative A). This is because there is no mention of any deliberate actions taken to destroy or damage the statue, and instead, the text simply states that it ""burned down."" Additionally, the use of the phrase ""it was struck by lightning"" suggests a sudden and unpredictable event, which aligns with the idea of a lightning strike causing damage to the statue."
"Response:  Alternativ B: Flies swarmed the fruit. 
For this sentence, it is more likely that flies swarmed the fruit because it provides a clear and specific image of what happened to the fruit, whereas ""The fruit shed seeds"" does not provide as much detail or clarity about the outcome of leaving the fruit out on the table."

In contrast, receiving alimony payments (Alternative A) may not necessarily cause financial problems on its own, although it could contribute to overall debt if not managed properly.

In contrast, Alternative B does not provide any evidence to suggest that the student submitted the paper incomplete."

Response:  Alternative B is more likely to be the effect of a heavy snowfall in a small town. As people try to avoid traveling and stay indoors, they may hide underground in basements or other safe locations until the storm passes. This behavior is more common in smaller towns where resources are limited and people may not have access to alternative shelter options. In contrast, schools shutting down due to heavy snowfall is also a possible outcome, but it may depend on factors such as the severity of the storm and the school district's policies regarding inclement weather.

Explanation:  When a public figure gets out of a limousine, it is likely that cameras will flash in their direction. This is because photographers are often positioned near the entrance of events where famous people are expected to arrive, and they will try to capture images of these individuals as they emerge from their vehicles. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why cameras would be flashing in the public figure's direction."

The woman lingered in the bathtub, and as she did, the water began to drain out of the tub."

"Response: 100% av gjenværende spørgsmål har blitt oppfylt med Alternativ A, ""She acquired an extensive wardrobe""."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative B (His wife left him) is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the customer left their headlights on (B) than that they used counterfeit money (A). This is because the store cashier calling security suggests that there was a problem with the transaction, but the reason for this problem is not specified in the passage. Leaving one's headlights on could potentially cause problems with the vehicle's electrical system or visibility while driving, which may have prompted the store cashier to call security. In contrast, using counterfeit money would be a more serious offense and is unlikely to result in the store cashier simply calling security without providing any additional details.
"Response:  Based on the given text, it is more likely that alternative B occurred. The sentence ""I accidentally threw away my shopping list"" suggests that the speaker made a mistake while disposing of trash, which is consistent with the context of taking out the garbage.

Explanation:  Bringing out blankets can help keep the room warm and cozy, but it may not necessarily solve the problem of a broken air conditioner.

Response: 1) I baked her a cake.
Response: 1) A bee stung the gardener.
Response: 1) The match produced a flame.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the reason for the settlement was Alternative B: They wanted to repair their personal relationship. This is because the text states that ""the disputing parties reached a settlement"" and does not mention any legal or judicial aspects of the situation. It suggests instead that the parties were motivated by a desire to resolve their conflict outside of court and improve their personal relationship. Therefore, Alternative B is the most plausible explanation for why the dispute was settled."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the children were sent to an orphanage due to their parents' death rather than their parents' spoiling behavior. Therefore, Alternative A is the correct answer.
Response:  Alternativ A (A meteorite landed in the ocean) is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ B: She panicked. 
For why? Because the word ""panicked"" suggests that the person experienced a sudden and intense fear or anxiety, which could lead to confusion and disorientation. This is more likely than the other options, as it provides a clear explanation for how the person ended up lost in the woods."
Response:  Alternativ A is the most likely explanation because it provides a direct cause-and-effect relationship between turning the oven on and making it hot. Option B does not provide such a clear causal link, as it only mentions putting the dish in the oven without explaining how that led to the oven becoming hot. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer.
Response: 1) The lemon got moldy.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the country colonized the land (B). This is because the text states that ""the country discovered new land,"" which implies that the country had not previously been aware of its existence and therefore would have needed to explore and settle it in order to claim it as their own. In contrast, if the country had abandoned the land, there would be no reason for them to discover or colonize it later on."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (the floor was slippery) caused the table to wobble. This is because a slippery floor can make it difficult to maintain balance and stability, which could cause a table to wobble or tip over. In contrast, an uneven floor may not necessarily cause a table to wobble, as it may still be possible to maintain balance and stability if one end of the table is higher than the other. Therefore, based on the given information, Alternative B is the most plausible explanation for why the table wobbled.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The father trusted his son. 
The father's reaction is more likely to be based on his trust in his son, rather than the son's confession of lying. Therefore, alternative B is the most plausible outcome."

"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (The train was running behind schedule) is the correct answer. This is because the sentence mentions ""the train slowing down,"" which suggests that there may have been a delay or disruption in its journey. Additionally, the fact that the train was ""approaching the station"" does not necessarily mean that it was about to arrive, as it could still be delayed due to various reasons such as traffic congestion or maintenance issues. Therefore, option B provides a more plausible explanation for why the train slowed down."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man's mental health issues were caused by a genetic predisposition (Alternative A). While the possibility of him being diagnosed with depression (Alternative B) cannot be ruled out entirely, there is no direct evidence to suggest this as the primary cause of his mental health problems.

"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (He was nearly killed in an explosion) is the correct answer. This is because the text states that the man ""lost his hearing,"" which suggests a sudden and traumatic event occurred, such as an explosion. Additionally, the use of the word ""nearly"" implies that the man came close to death but did not actually die."

Grunnen til dette er at alternative B describes a more direct and immediate cause of the melting, whereas alternative A describes a longer-term process that may not have led directly to the melting of the container."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (the driver ran a red light) is the correct answer. This is because running a red light is a common cause of accidents and can result in damage to vehicles.

"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative A (She was distracted by noise) is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the television show was censored due to its content containing vulgar language (Alternative A).
"Response:  Alternativ B: The crew encountered pirates. 
The probability of this event occurring is higher than the other two options because it is a more common and realistic scenario in the context of a shipwreck. Pirate attacks are a known threat in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high levels of piracy, such as the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. In contrast, drowning or being stranded at sea due to a shipwreck is less likely, especially if the ship is equipped with proper safety equipment and emergency supplies. Therefore, option B has a higher likelihood of occurrence compared to alternatives A and C."
Response: 100% (2 stemmer)B
Response: 1) The man hung up the phone.
Response: 100% (B) I felt uncomfortable.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Alternative B (They viewed all the exhibits) is the correct answer. This is because the text states that ""the group left the museum,"" which implies that they had completed their visit and seen everything in the museum. Taking pictures of the exhibits (Alternative A) does not necessarily imply that they saw all the exhibits, as they may have been taking photos of specific items or areas within the museum."
"Response:  Alternativ B: My friend stood up for me. 
For this sentence, ""My friend stood up for me"" is the more likely answer because it provides a clear and logical explanation for why the speaker was involved in an argument with someone else. In contrast, ""My friend introduced me to the man"" does not provide any obvious reason for their involvement in the situation. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the problem because it directly addresses the issue of a flat tire, which can prevent the bike from functioning properly. Switching gears on the bike would not necessarily solve the problem of a flat tire and could potentially make things worse by causing further damage to the bike or its components. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the bike was not working properly.

Response:  Alternativ B: I signed my name.

In contrast, playing outside may not have any direct impact on the likelihood of a child attending college.
