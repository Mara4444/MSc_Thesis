"Response:  Based on the premise ""Imaymanaqa puqpukama plasticowanmi q'ipichakurqan,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Chay imaymanaqa p'akikuqlla karqan"" (Their plastic waste has been accumulating for a long time) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""puqpukama plasticowanmi"" suggests that the plastic waste has been building up over time, rather than being a recent occurrence."
"Response: 
Option A: Huk bollet nisqata tarikurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Wulsilluykunata qasichirqani"" implies that something has been done to cause a change in the situation. Option A, ""Huk bollet nisqata tarikurqani,"" means ""The situation changed suddenly."" Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kuki kurukunaqa wasimanta chinkarqanku) is more likely to occur than option B (Kuki kuruqa wasip kurkunta mikhurqanku). This is because the phrase ""kuki kurukuna"" means ""to be in a state of confusion or disarray,"" while ""chinkarqanku"" means ""your mind is confused."" Therefore, it makes sense that someone who is in a state of confusion would have difficulty concentrating and making decisions. On the other hand, option B does not make as much logical sense, as there is no clear connection between ""kuki kuru"" meaning ""to be in a state of confusion"" and ""mikhurqanku"" meaning ""your mind is made up."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pasaportenkunatam policiaqa qhawarqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""fronteramanmi chayarqanku"" suggests that the speaker is approaching or crossing a border, and the use of the word ""policiaqa"" implies that there are police present at the border. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will be stopped by the police while attempting to cross the border with a fake passport than it is that they will try to smuggle contraband past the police."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Raymichakuy p'unchawmi karqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The premise states that ""Oficinaqa wisq'asqa karqan,"" indicating that there is a problem with the office equipment. Option A suggests that this problem may be caused by a malfunctioning printer, while option B does not provide any specific information about the cause of the problem. Therefore, based on the given premise, it is more likely that the problem is related to the printer rather than some other factor."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa damas nisqata pukllarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Warmaqa mana kallpayuqmi tukurqan"" suggests that there is a problem with the mana, or life force, of the person in question. This could be caused by a variety of factors, including damage to their internal organs or energy centers. Option A implies that this damage has occurred as a result of some external factor, such as an injury or attack. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the problem is related to outside forces rather than something internal like a personal weakness or flaw."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Huk runakunam sinriman haykurqanku) is a more plausible cause for why the dog's tail is curly than option B (Sinrichakusqanmanta payqa lluqsirqan). This is because the premise states that the dog's tail is curly due to its ancestors having been exposed to cold temperatures, which suggests that genetic factors may be at play rather than environmental ones. Option A implies that this genetic predisposition towards curliness in the dog's tail has been passed down through generations, making it a more likely explanation for the observed trait.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Warmaqa baberuchanpi llaysaykacharqan) is a more plausible explanation for why the sky is blue than option B (Warmaqa panlchanpi qhilichakurqan). This is because the premise suggests that the reason the sky appears blue is due to the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere, rather than any inherent property of the sky itself. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Takiyyawn kuchka runakuna taqllay Kurqanku) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""takirqan"" means ""to deceive or cheat,"" and ""kuchka"" means ""a little."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the person will be able to deceive or cheat a little bit. Option B (""Upallallam runakunaqa uyarqanku"") does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to occur."
"Response: 
Option A: Escuela tukukuptinmi warmaqa harkasqa qhipakurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, matemáticas yachachiqnintam warmaqa añanchayta munarqan, which means that mathematics are being taught in a way that is not effective for learning. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the school's teaching methodology is not suitable for students' needs."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Umalliqninku manchay willakuykunata paykunaman willarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""umalliqninku manchay"" means ""we are going to make a big mess,"" indicating that the group of people is planning to create a large amount of trash or debris. This is consistent with the idea of a large number of people camping in an area without proper waste disposal measures, leading to litter and pollution. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa yuyayninpim chinkarikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa umanta t'akarukurqan"" suggests that something has happened to cause a change in the world. Option A, ""Payqa yuyayninpim chinkarikurqan,"" means ""The sky turned dark."" This effect is more likely given the premise, as it implies a sudden and dramatic change in the environment. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bancopi cuenta nisqayqa ch'usaqmi karqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Cheque qillasqayqa mana chaskikurqanchu"" suggests that there may have been a problem with the check, such as it being lost or stolen. In this case, it would make sense for the bank to issue a new account number rather than simply increasing the salary of the person who wrote the check. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Payqa spam nistaqa picharqan) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""nisqanqa spam"" implies that the email is unsolicited or unwanted, and ""picharqan"" means to pay attention or focus on something. Therefore, it is more likely that the recipient will ignore or dismiss the email rather than actively seeking it out. Option B (Payqa achka e-correo nisqatam apachirqan) does not align with this interpretation as it suggests that the recipient would actively seek out the email, which goes against the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Payqa unquymanmi wikchukurqan) is a more plausible cause for why the man in the photo looks so sad. This is because the phrase ""unquymanmi wikchukurqan"" means ""he has no money to buy food,"" which suggests that he may be experiencing financial difficulties and therefore appears sad or dejected. Option B (""Payqa unquymanta qhaliyarqan"") does not provide any specific reason as to why the man might look sad, making it less plausible."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hatun kunkapi rimaspa kikinman yachachikurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""hatun kunkapi"" suggests that a woman or queen may be involved in the situation, and ""rimaspa"" means to warm up or heat something. Therefore, it is possible that a woman is heating up something, such as food or water, using fire. This is supported by the word ""kikinman,"" which refers to cooking or preparing food. Option B (Payqa qillqayta qunqarurqan) does not fit with this interpretation and seems less plausible based on the given information."
"Response: 
Option A: Ch'akiyniytam yakuqa thaniyachirqa. 
Explanation: The premise ""Vasoman yakuta hillpurqani"" suggests that something has been done to a hill or mountain. Option A, ""Ch'akiyniytam yakuqa thaniyachirqa,"" means ""The hill was flattened."" Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Masinpa rimasqanta uyarispa yanapayta munarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""masinpa rimasqanta"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, and ""uyarispa"" implies a sudden and unexpected event occurred to cause this damage. Additionally, the word ""yanapayta"" means ""suddenly,"" further supporting Option A. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the damage was a sudden and unexpected event such as an accident or natural disaster rather than a gradual process like Option B (Masinpa rimasqanpim chanincharqan)."
"Response: 
Option A: Huch'aymanta sunquchakurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Aquyrakiqa huch'aymi karqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a problem or issue. Option A, ""Huch'aymanta sunquchakurqani,"" means ""The one who caused the problem will suffer."" This option is more likely because it aligns with the idea of someone causing harm or trouble for another person."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Waskharqa paskarikurqan,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""paskarikurqan"" means ""to break or shatter into pieces."" Therefore, the most likely cause of a broken vase is that it was dropped or hit something hard, as suggested by the first part of the premise. Option B's suggestion that the vase broke because of a sudden change in temperature is less likely given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kaminakusqankumanta saykusqa karqanku) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""saykusqa karqanku"" suggests that the speaker's grandmother was the one who taught them how to make traditional foods, implying a direct transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. This aligns with the idea of intergenerational transfer of cultural practices and traditions, which is a common theme in many Indigenous cultures. In contrast, option B (""Kaminakuymanta manam rimayta munarqankuchu"") implies a more indirect or distant source of knowledge, such as learning through observation or experience rather than direct instruction from an elder or ancestor."
"Response: 
Option A: Campaña ruwaq umallitam mink'arikurqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that a campaign of propaganda will be effective in changing the public's perception of the issue (Option A). The use of persuasive messaging and emotional appeals can influence people's attitudes and beliefs, leading to a shift in their perception of the issue. In contrast, cutting off funding for the organization may not have as much of an impact on the public's perception, as it does not address the underlying issues or provide any alternative solutions (Option B)."
"Response: 
Option A: Q'ipinpi quñi pistukuq p'achakunatam churarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, illaq qhariqa (there is a lack of) chiri-mit'a (water) in the area. This suggests that there may be a shortage or scarcity of water in the region, making it less likely for payqa (the river) to have enough water to flow. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa makinta huqarirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Yachaqiqa tapukuypa kutichiynintam yacharqan"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up. Option A, ""Payqa makinta huqarirqan,"" means to uncover or reveal something, which aligns with the idea of hiding something in the first place. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response: 
A) Ñut'u allpa ñawinman haykurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qharip ñawinqa wiqiyarqan,"" meaning that something strange or unusual has happened in the village. Option A, ""Ñut'u allpa ñawinman haykurqan,"" translates to ""The people are acting strangely."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it suggests that there may be a collective psychological phenomenon at play rather than an external force causing chaos. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given information."
"Response: 
A) Paypa huk kaq pukllaqninqa ch'awkasqanmanta tumparqan. 
Explanation: The phrase ""pukllaqqa pichqa kutitam"" suggests that something has been done or taken away from a place, implying a change in location. Therefore, option A is more likely to be correct, as it implies that something was moved from one place to another."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa yachaqipa ch’awkasqantam tarirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase “yachaqiqpa exámen” suggests that there has been an examination or testing of something, and the word “tarirqan” implies a negative outcome or failure. Therefore, it is more likely that the examinee did not pass the examination than that they passed it without any issues.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Rimasqaymanta utirqani,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""utirqani"" means ""to be tired."" Therefore, the most likely cause of a person being tired is that they have been working or doing something physically demanding. Option A, ""Kunkaytam chinkarqachini,"" translates to ""I am exhausted from work,"" which aligns with this cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chullusqa mikhuna sut'uryarirqan,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""mikhuna"" means ""microwave"" in Quechua, so it is likely that the speaker is suggesting that the microwave caused the food to become cold. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the food became cold."
"Response: 
Option A: Wiksa nanaywanmi karqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Llamk'aqqa unqusqa hinamanmi tukurqan"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their consent or knowledge. Option A, ""Wiksa nanaywanmi karqan,"" means ""They took it without permission."" This option best fits the given premise, as it implies that something was taken illegally or without proper authorization. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Piscinapa kantunpi phawaykacharqan) is a more plausible cause for why there are no fish in the river than option B (Payqa piscinaman tinkinapaq tablamantam chapukurqan). This is because the first option suggests that the absence of fish may be due to the fact that they have been scooped up by someone or something, while the second option implies that the lack of fish is due to some sort of magical or supernatural force. Given the context of the premise, it seems more likely that the former explanation is correct rather than the latter.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Película nisqaqa chay p'unchawpi riqsichikurqan) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that it is describing a movie that has been watched by many people and has received positive reviews, rather than a movie that is unknown or unpopular. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response: 
Option A: Runaqa manañam payta rimarirqanñachu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qhariqa sinchi wira kasqanmanta llayuyarirqan,"" which means ""The sky is dark because of the lack of light."" This implies that there is a cause for the darkness in the sky, rather than simply being dark due to no reason. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that there is a specific reason or cause for the darkness in the sky."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa maquinapi qillqa apachinata qillqarqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that there are two possible causes for why people in the Andes region have a high incidence of altitude sickness when they travel from low-altitude areas to higher elevations: either their bodies are not adapted to the lower oxygen levels at high altitudes or they are not acclimatized to the rapid change in altitude. Option A suggests that this discrepancy may be due to the body's inability to adapt to the lower oxygen levels, while option B does not provide any specific explanation for the observed phenomenon. Therefore, option A seems like the more plausible answer based on the given information.
"Response: 
A) Hunt'a runakuna kaqqa t'aqllaykurqanku (More likely)."
"Response: 
Option A: Masiyiqi sinchita suyachiwarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""phiñakurqani,"" which means ""the universe is a machine."" This implies that everything in the universe operates according to predetermined laws or rules, without any randomness or unpredictability. Therefore, option A, ""Masiyiqi sinchita suyachiwarqan,"" which translates to ""The universe operates like a clockwork,"" is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa arms nucleares nisqatam ruwayta qallarirqanku) is more likely to occur. The use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic consequences for humanity as a whole, including widespread death and destruction, long-term environmental damage, and a significant impact on global politics and economies. Therefore, it is unlikely that any country or organization would resort to such extreme measures without first exploring all other available options.
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa puñuytam qallarirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qhariqa puñunanpaqmi pastillasta millpurqan,"" meaning that something has been mixed with a sweet substance. Option A, ""Payqa puñuytam qallarirqan,"" means ""It will make your throat dry."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
A) Sofá tiyanap chakinka q'iwiparirkusqa. 
Explanation: The premise ""Sofá tiyanawanmi warmiqa mitk'akurqan"" suggests that there are two possible effects of a certain action: either the sofa will be comfortable or it won't. Option A, ""Sofá tiyanap chakinka q'iwiparirkusqa,"" means that the sofa will become uncomfortable if the action is taken. Therefore, this option is more likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: P'uruqa p'atarurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Irqiqa p'uruta mat'ipayarqan"" suggests that something will happen to the mother-in-law. Option A, ""P'uruqa p'atarurqan,"" means ""The mother-in-law will be angry."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Illaqkunaqa qhurpachana wasipim qhipakurqanku,"" option A is more likely to occur. The word ""qhurpachana"" means ""to eat,"" so it is likely that the person will eat something. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no connection between eating at an airport and being happy. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Añawiqa ñut'ukurqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Durasno añawita khamurqani,"" we can infer that the protagonist will experience a negative emotion (khamurqani) as a result of something they are trying to do or achieve (añawita). Option A suggests that the protagonist will feel overwhelmed by their emotions (añawiqa), which aligns with the given premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Misk'isapa donasta mikhurqani) is a more plausible cause for why Makiyqa rats are not eating their food. This is because ""donasta"" means ""not eaten,"" indicating that the rats have not consumed any of their food. Option B (Misk'iyaqkunataqa munaq karqani) does not make sense in this context as it means ""The rats did not eat anything."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Punkuqa kicharikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Punkuta tanqarirqani"" implies that something has been done to cause a change in the speaker's situation. Option A, ""Punkuqa kicharikurqan,"" means ""My situation has changed."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rantinakunaqa chaniyuq kasqanta mallipachikurqanku) is the more likely cause of the protests. The phrase ""chaniyuq kasqanta"" suggests that the activists are organizing a boycott or strike, which could be motivated by economic factors such as low wages or poor working conditions. In contrast, option B (Rantinakuqa wawakunap llamaqyninkuwanmi yuririchikurqan) does not provide any specific context or evidence to support the claim that the protests are being organized for environmental reasons. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Huk'uchan t'uqunta such'urirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Perforador nisqawan pirqapi t'uquta ruwarqani"" suggests that something has been pierced or perforated, causing damage to its interior. Option A, ""Huk'uchan t'uqunta such'urirqan,"" means ""The hole was dug deeper."" Therefore, option A is more likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ñañanqa kusisqa kawsakurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Warmiqa ñañanmantam ch'ikikurqan,"" meaning ""The weather is getting colder every day."" This suggests that the temperature is gradually decreasing over time, making option A (Ñañanqa kusisqa kawsakurqan) the more likely cause. Option B (Ñañanqa qusanmanta t'aqakurqan) means ""The sun is shining brightly today,"" which does not align with the premise of the passage. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""P'achaypi vinota hich'aykurqani,"" option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Patanmanmi mandil nisqata churakurqani"" suggests that a large stone will fall from the sky and hit someone or something, causing damage. This implies that the impact of the falling stone will be significant enough to cause harm. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Rantiqqa qullqintam maskharqan) is a more plausible cause for the effect of the registrator not working properly. The phrase ""nisqatam kicharqan"" suggests that there may be some sort of obstruction or blockage preventing the registrator from functioning correctly. Option B (Rantiqqa qullqintam haywarirqan) does not provide any specific information about what might be causing the problem with the registrator, making it less likely as a cause. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Runakunaqa qullqiwan yanaparirqanku. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""K'ikllukunapi takiqmanqa runakuna asuyarqanku,"" which means that something has been taken away from us. Option A states that what was taken away will return, which suggests that the opposite of the premise is true - that something has indeed been taken away. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Taytamamanmantam waqakurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Wawaqa niñeramanmi waqayurqan"" suggests that something has been lost or misplaced. Option A, ""Taytamamanmantam waqakurqan,"" means ""I have searched high and low for it."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it implies a thorough search was conducted to find what was lost. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pilotoqa tuyumantam ayqikurqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""radarpi tuyu hamusqanta rikurqan"" suggests that the pilot's actions are causing a disturbance in the radar system, which could potentially lead to confusion or disorientation for the pilot. Option A aligns with this idea by suggesting that the pilot may be experiencing some kind of mental confusion or disorientation due to their own actions."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sach'amanta rhapikuna urmayarqanku,"" option A is more likely. The word ""rhapikuna"" suggests a sudden or unexpected change, while ""pampapi"" implies a gradual or expected change. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa naipes nisqawanmi pananwan pukllayta qallarirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""nisqawanmi pananwan"" suggests that something has been added or mixed with another substance, which could cause a change in its properties. Therefore, it is more likely that the mixture will have an unexpected effect, as suggested by option A. Option B (Payqa panantam chansakuyta qallarirqan) does not provide any context or information that would suggest an unexpected effect."
"Response: 
Option A: Taytanmi upyanata qurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, if Iraq's oil production increases, it will have a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Challwaqa hawamanmi p'itarqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""challwaqa"" means ""to become hot,"" and ""hawamanmi"" means ""I will boil."" Therefore, the sentence implies that the speaker will cause something to become hot by boiling it. Option B (""Challwaqa mikhunamanmi chapullikurqan"") does not make sense in this context, as ""mikhunaman"" means ""to dry up"" or ""to evaporate,"" and ""chapulli"" refers to a type of insect."
"Response: 
Option A: Huk Partido policomanmi masiyachikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise suggests that there are two parties involved in a political conflict - the police and the people. Option A implies that the police will be responsible for maintaining order, which means they will have to take action against those who engage in violence or disruptive behavior. This is more likely to happen than option B, where the people are given the responsibility of maintaining order."
"Response: 
Option A: Piletata kicharqani. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Bañopi maki maqchikunaqa ch'akasqa karqan,"" it is more likely that the person will experience a headache due to the stress of work. The phrase ""maki maqchikunaqa"" means ""to pile up"" or ""to accumulate,"" implying that the person has been under a lot of pressure at work. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Estación nisqamanmi trenqa chayarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Illaqqa trenmanta urayarqan"" suggests that something has been lost or misplaced. Option A, ""Estación nisqamanmi trenqa chayarqan,"" means ""The station where things are lost."" This option best fits the context of the premise and is therefore the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sobre nisqapa wisq'ananpim qhariqa ñit'irqan,"" option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""nisqapa"" means ""over"" or ""above,"" while ""wisq'ananpim"" means ""to stamp."" Therefore, it is likely that something will be placed over or above another thing, rather than being sold separately. Option B does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa hawkam kuskaqa karqanku) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""hawkam kuskaqa"" suggests that the problem is caused by something external or outside forces, rather than internal factors such as a lack of effort or motivation (llagtaqanku). Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa llamk'ananmantam qarquchikurqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the company will go bankrupt due to financial difficulties (Option A). The phrase ""payqa llamk'ananmanta"" means ""to go bankrupt,"" and ""qarquchikurqan"" means ""financial difficulties."" Therefore, Option A is the best answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Relojpa tiktiyasqanta uyarirqani. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Relojta qhawarqani,"" meaning ""The clock has stopped working."" This implies that there is a problem with the clock's mechanism or movement, rather than it being simply broken. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause, as it suggests that the clock's hands are not moving due to an internal issue within the clock itself."
"Response: 
Option A: Ensayo nisqata makillapi qillqarqani. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Makiyi utiawarqan,"" meaning ""The baby will cry."" This implies that the baby is already crying, which supports Option A. Therefore, the most likely cause of the baby crying is that it is hungry or uncomfortable (nisqata makillapi qillqarqani)."
"Response: 
Option A: Huk pernota churarqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Perno nisqaqa mat'irikurqan"" suggests that something has happened to a person or thing, and the cause of this event is unknown. Option A, ""Huk pernota churarqani,"" means ""The person was bitten by an animal,"" which could be a possible cause for the event described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Yanantinqa wasiman astakurqanku) is more likely to occur. This is because ""yanantint"" in Quechua means ""to complement or enhance,"" while ""astakur"" means ""to reduce or diminish."" Therefore, the phrase ""Yanantinqa wasiman astakurqanku"" can be translated as ""He/She complements or enhances what he/she has."" In contrast, Option B (""Wasi mana allin kasqanta llaqta kamachirqan"") does not make sense in this context and appears to be a nonsensical sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa inti haykuytam qhawayta munarqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""payqa inti"" means ""the sun has entered,"" which suggests that the warming of the earth due to the position of the sun may be a factor in the melting of the ice. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa mana wamp'uytaqa yacharqanchu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qhariqa salvavidas"" suggests that something has been saved or protected, while ""p'achatam unupiqa churakurqan"" implies that this protection was done through a specific action or ritual. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the protection is the act of saving or protecting something, rather than simply not wanting to harm anything."
"Response: 
A) Payqa khipu qillqasqantam picharparirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Waqmiqa word nisqapi qillqaspa pantarurqan"" suggests that something has been said or written down, but it does not provide any information about how this was done. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it implies that the thing that was said or written down was done using a quipu (khipu)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa calificaciones nisqanta mana wasaparqanchu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""nisqanta mana"" suggests that the speaker's qualifications are not sufficient or adequate for the job they are applying for, which could be due to a lack of experience or skills. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Tutantinpim param unucharqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Q'achuqa t'uruchasqam kachkarqan,"" meaning ""The sky is darkening due to a storm."" This suggests that the cause of the darkness is a storm. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa qurpachana wasipi puñururqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""warmiqa nishuta puñururqan"" suggests that there is a lack of warmth or heat in the area, which could be causing the ice to melt. Option B (Payqa alarma churakuytam qunqarurqan) does not provide any contextual clues that would suggest it as a possible cause for the melting ice. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa llanthupim tiyakurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qhariqa protectorsolar nisqatam churakurqan"" suggests that there are external forces at work that are causing harm to the land or environment, which aligns with Option A. In contrast, Option B (""Payqa mamaqucha patanmanmi rirqan"") implies that the damage is being caused by internal factors within the community, such as greed or corruption, which may not be supported by the given premise. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
"Response: 
Option A: T'aqwiqkunaqa yachana mana allin kasqanmanta yachachirqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""T'aqwiqkunaqa yachanatam chiqancharqanku"" suggests that something has been done to cause a change in the speaker's perspective or attitude towards something. Option A better captures this idea by suggesting that the speaker's perspective has shifted, making them see things differently now than they did before. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Pukllayqa aswa pachata yapapakuspa pukllakurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Partido pukllakuypi runakuna qaparirqanku,"" which means that a party has been formed with the goal of taking over the country's government. This suggests that the party has a clear political agenda and is actively working towards achieving its goals. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause, as it implies that the party is using illegal means to gain power."
"Response: 
Option A: Wichq'anatam wichq'arqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Wichq'anapi yachasqallay yupanata churarqani"" suggests that something will happen to someone because of their actions or behavior. Option A, ""Wichq'anatam wichq'arqani,"" means ""They will suffer the consequences."" Therefore, option A is a more likely outcome based on the premise provided."
"Response: 
Option A: Taytaqa qullqitam churinman haywarirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Imaymana runa kaqqa achkayarqan"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their consent or knowledge. Option A better fits this context as it implies a forceful taking away of something, whereas option B does not convey such a sense of coercion. Therefore, the most likely outcome based on the premise is Option A: Taytaqa qullqitam churinman haywarirqan."
"Response: 
Option A: Rump'u rit'i ruwanaypaqmi rit'ita huñurqani. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Rit'im ñanta hark'achkarqan,"" which means ""The rituals are ineffective."" Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the rituals will not have any effect."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kayakpi wamp'uqkunaqa t'uyunkunawanmi t'uyurqanku,"" option A is more likely. This is because the word ""wamp'uqkunaqa"" means ""to paddle or row,"" indicating that the action of kayaking will be performed by someone. Therefore, option A, ""Kayak nisqaqa unu patanmami chayarqan,"" which translates to ""The kayaker moves forward with the current,"" makes sense in this context. Option B, ""Kayak nisqaqa aytimanmi suq'akurqan,"" which translates to ""The kayaker moves against the current,"" does not make as much sense in this context since it implies that the kayaker is actively working against the flow of water, which may not be possible or practical in some situations."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa hap'inamantam kacharikurqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""hap'inamantam kacharikurqan"" suggests that something will be broken or damaged, which aligns with the idea of a bike being destroyed in some way. Option B (Payqa k'aspi qinchamanmi bicicletanwan t'akarikurqan) does not convey the same sense of destruction as option A. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Sullakuna ñuqaman chayarirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ventiladorta hap'ichirqani"" suggests that there is a blockage in the lungs or respiratory system, making it difficult to breathe. Option A, ""Sullakuna ñuqaman chayarirqan,"" means ""The lung has collapsed."" This option better fits the given premise and is therefore more likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the mother was attacked by a shark (Option B). The phrase ""surfistakunaqa"" suggests that the event occurred while the mother was in or near the water, and the word ""tiburon"" specifically refers to a shark. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Unuqa bañeramanta qasichikurqan. 
Explanation: The phrase ""banereramanta tapónninta hurqurqani"" suggests that something has been wrapped or covered with a cloth, implying that it has been hidden from view. Therefore, option A is more likely to be correct, as it implies that the thing being described will come out of hiding."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Payqa warmintam hukwan ripusqanmanta tumparqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""huchachakurqan"" suggests that something has been added or mixed into the water, making it unfit for consumption. Therefore, the effect of drinking such water would be harmful rather than beneficial. Option B (Payqa warmintam hukwan ripukusqanta willarqan) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that anything has been added to the water to make it beneficial."
"Response: 
Option A: Limpin ch'akinanta suyarqani. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Posterpilimpi qaunichakurqan,"" which means ""The poster was not cleaned for a long time."" This implies that the cause of the dirtiness is due to neglect or lack of maintenance, rather than an external factor such as someone else spilling something on it. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa llap'i musquywanmi musquyukurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""musquyukurqan"" means ""to make something disappear,"" which suggests that the cause of the disappearance is related to magic or supernatural forces. Option B (Payqa kawitunpi hisp'ayukurqan) does not provide a clear explanation for the disappearance and could be interpreted as meaning anything from a natural disaster to an alien abduction. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Taytanqa hamp'aramanmi tiyakuq hamurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, warmaqa (a powerful magical artifact) can create a portal that leads to another world. This means that taytanqa (the creator of the artifact) has the ability to manipulate reality through their magic. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that taytanqa has created a portal to another world using their magic."
"Response: 
Option A: Sutinmanta waqyarirqani (The cause of the problem is not clear).
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is unclear what caused the problem. The phrase ""umni kutichirqan"" suggests that something unexpected or unforeseen happened, but without additional information, it's impossible to determine the specific cause. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Runakuna hatarirqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Llaqta umalliqkuna runakunata saruncharqanku"" suggests that something has been eroded or worn away over time. Option A, ""Runakuna hatarirqanku,"" means ""The land was eroded."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa qurpachakunanpa wasichata hatarichirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sach'a sach'api chinkarikurqan"" suggests that something is being pulled or stretched in two different directions, which could result in tearing or breaking apart. Option A implies that this tearing or breaking apart will happen as a result of paying too much attention to one thing at the expense of another important aspect of life. Therefore, it is more likely that this scenario will play out than option B (Payqa yanapachikunanpaqmi qaparirqan), which does not provide any context or explanation for why this event might occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa llimpipayta yachaytam munarqan) is the more likely cause of the effect. The phrase ""suyumanmi illarqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a change in the weather, and ""llimpipayta yachaytam munarqan"" implies that this change was caused by someone or something external to the speaker's community. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Llamk'aqmasinqa aswan allin llamk'aypi churachikurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""llamk'aqmasinqa aswan"" suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific person or thing, rather than a general idea or concept. Additionally, the use of the word ""allin"" implies a direct and personal connection between the speaker and the subject of their statement. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is expressing a personal opinion or experience related to this topic."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa muspachkarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tiqsimuyupi hawa"" suggests that there may be a strong emotional or psychological component to the situation, which could lead to impulsive behavior such as paying for something without thinking about it. This aligns with Option A, which implies that the person may have acted on an impulse without fully considering the consequences of their actions."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa lejiata churarkurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qharipa ch'ukchanqa"" suggests that something has been done or caused to happen, while ""p'aquyarparirqan"" implies a negative outcome or consequence. Option A aligns better with this context, as it means ""to pay for something without receiving it,"" which could imply a loss or disappointment. In contrast, option B (Payqa shampuntam churarkurqan) means ""to pay for something in advance,"" which does not fit the given premise as well."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa allin mana allin kasqantaraq qhawapayarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""allin mana"" means ""to eat a lot,"" and ""kasqantaraq"" means ""stomachache."" Therefore, it is likely that the person is experiencing discomfort due to overeating or indigestion. Option B (Payqa kamarinapaq yuyaychakuytam tarirqan) does not fit with the given premise as ""yuyaychakuytam"" means ""to be full of food,"" but there is no indication in the premise that the person has eaten recently."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Waynaqa wasinmantam ripurqan,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""wasinmantam"" in Quechua means ""to eat."" Therefore, the complete sentence would translate to ""He ate something."" Option B does not make sense in this context."
"Response: 
Option A: Pata waqaychanaqa ñut'u allpawan kachkarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, if a person does not have enough money to buy food, they will go hungry. This implies that option A, ""Pata waqaychanaqa ñut'u allpawan kachkarqan,"" is the more likely cause of going hungry, as it suggests that lack of money (pata) is the primary reason for not being able to afford food (waqaychana). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Luzta hap'ichirqani (The light bulb will burn out).
Explanation: The premise states that ""Wasiypi electricidad nisqaqa wañururqan,"" which means ""The power has been cut off."" This implies that there is no electricity available to power the light bulb, making it unlikely for the light bulb to burn out. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Manchaylla qhawakurqan) is the more likely cause of the effect. The phrase ""Montaña rusamanmi wicharqanchik"" suggests that a mountain range has been formed due to some geological process. Option A implies that this formation was caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Mantequilla tam bolsachanman churarqani) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""bolsachap"" which means ""to pop"", so it is possible that the person is trying to explain how they popped their corn using butter or mantequilla. Therefore, option A makes more sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wasikunaqa mana electricidadniyuq karqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Sach'am cable pataman urmarurqan"" suggests that there has been a problem with the electrical cable, which could cause the lights to flicker or go out. Option A aligns better with this scenario as it implies that the issue lies within the electrical system itself rather than an external factor like a storm."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa runakunata amichirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Rimarka mana yuyaytachu"" suggests that something has been added or mixed into the water, which could cause it to become cloudy or murky. This implies that the water will not be clear or transparent anymore, which supports option A. Option B (Payqa runakunata kamiyarqanhina) does not fit with this interpretation as it means ""The water became clear again,"" which would suggest that the water was previously cloudy but then cleared up, rather than becoming cloudy due to an external factor."
"Response: 
Option A: Hump'i sut'u uyaymanta sut'uyarqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Pin nisqachawam wiqurukurqani,"" we can infer that there will be a pin or needle in the way of the person trying to walk forward. Option A suggests that this obstacle will be small enough to easily step over, while Option B suggests that it will be large and difficult to navigate around. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Yarqasqa kachkarqan (The cause of the earthquake was the movement of tectonic plates)."
"Response: 
Option A: Paytaqa chhullu hapirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qharip kunqanta ch'aka uyarikurqan,"" which means ""The old woman's hair was tangled with qharip."" Qharip refers to a type of plant that has sharp thorns or spines, so it is likely that the old woman's hair became entangled in these thorns while she was walking through a field or forest. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for why her hair was tangled."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Akllasqa pisomanmi chayarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""akllasqa"" means ""to eat away"" or ""to consume,"" and ""pisomanmi"" means ""snow."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the cause of the snow melting is due to some entity consuming or eating away at it. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the snow is melting because of a physical obstruction, such as a rock or tree, blocking sunlight from reaching it. This does not align with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Taytamamantam llullakurqan) is a more plausible cause for why Maqtaqa's insights are not being implemented than option B (Taytamamanqa payta wanachirqanku). This is because ""llullakurqan"" means ""to be ineffective or unproductive,"" suggesting that Maqtaqa's insights may not be having the desired impact or effectiveness. In contrast, ""payta wanachirqanku"" means ""I am unable to implement them,"" which implies that there is an external factor preventing implementation rather than any inherent flaw in the insights themselves. Therefore, option A is a more likely explanation for why Maqtaqa's insights are not being implemented."
"Response: 
Option A: Inodoro nisqam puqchiyarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Hisp'ana k'itiqa unu hut'a karqan"" suggests that something has happened to a person or thing in the past tense. Option A, ""Inodoro nisqam puqchiyarqan,"" means ""The bathroom was not cleaned."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it implies that something related to the bathroom had occurred in the past. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Runaqa wallqatam allqumanqa churarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Uña allquqa runanwan kuskallam karqan"" suggests that something has happened to a person's hand or fingers, causing them pain. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation by suggesting that the person may have burned their hand or fingers. This answer choice is therefore more likely than option B, which does not provide an obvious explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa sach'a sikipim qasilla sayarirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""kikin lirpuynintam"" suggests that something has been added to the mixture, causing it to become unstable or volatile. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as contamination or an imbalance in the ingredients. In contrast, option B (Payqa qucha patanpi qasilla sayarirqan) implies that there was already something wrong with the mixture from the start, making it less likely that adding anything new would cause it to explode. Therefore, based on the given information, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the mixture might have caused an explosion."
"Response: 
Option A: Waqyakuyta kutichirqani. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Yanaypa waqyawasqanta mana uyarirqanichu,"" which means ""The sun has risen high in the sky,"" it is more likely that the effect will be Option A: ""Waqyakuyta kutichirqani,"" which means ""It is getting hot."" This is because as the sun rises higher in the sky, it becomes warmer outside."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Allquqa wasimantam chinkarirqan) is a more plausible explanation for why the llama's wool became matted. This is because ""wasimantam"" means to twist or braid something tightly, which could potentially lead to matting of the llama's wool if it were not properly combed or brushed after shearing. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given in the question."
"Response: 
Option A: Pachaqa as chirim karqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the cause of the problem is ""Hawaman samarisqayta rikurqani"" (The hawk has eaten my corn). This is because the phrase ""pachaqa as chirim karqan"" (the hawk ate my corn) is a common idiom used in Quechua to refer to the loss or damage caused by birds such as hawks. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa aswan allin derechuyuq llamk'anankupaqmi maskharqanku) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that Paykunaqa has taken a decision to go ahead with the project without proper planning or consideration of the potential consequences, which could lead to problems in the future. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ismusqamanmi wayk'una wasipi asnayta qhallarirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""wayk'una wasipi"" suggests that something is being done or happening in a specific location, and the word ""asnayta"" implies that it is happening inside or within something else. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa nishu tacoyuq zapatowan purichkarqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""tacoyuq zapatowan"" suggests that the problem is related to a lack of water or moisture, which could be causing the plants to wither and die. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Unu t'impucharqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mankamantam wapsi lluqsichkarqan"" suggests that something has disappeared or been lost. Option A, ""Unu t'impucharqan,"" means ""They didn't find it."" This implies that whatever was lost or missing (lluqsichkarqan) was not found again (unu t'impucharqan), making this option the most likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Ñuqaqa usutawan churakurqani. (More likely)"
"Response: 
Option A: Payman qhatiqkunata chinkarichirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Político rimasqanqa mana yuyayniyuqhina qhawakurqan,"" which means that a politician's reputation can be damaged by his or her own mistakes. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the politician's reputation will be harmed due to their own actions rather than external factors."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wawayuq karqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Yanantin sullullchakusqankumanta mana pipas allintachu chaskirqanchu"" suggests a balance or harmony between two opposing forces, while ""Wawayuq karqanku"" means ""the balance is maintained."" Therefore, it is more likely that the balance will be maintained than that one force will overpower the other."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Qhapaq runaqa edificiothunikunantam munarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""thunikunantam munarqan"" suggests that the building was destroyed by a natural disaster such as an earthquake or landslide, rather than being intentionally demolished by someone. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rantiypi llamak'aqkunaqa rikurqanchus sipas imaymanakuna wayaqanman churisqanta) is a more plausible explanation for why Rantiypi is not able to find his mother. This is because the phrase ""rikurqanchus sipas imaymanakuna"" suggests that Rantiypi may have lost his mother due to a separation or division caused by someone else's actions, rather than simply being unable to locate her physically. Therefore, option A provides a more logical explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Walla wallakunam awqanakuymanqa kacharichikurqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Suyuqa awqanakuymanmi suyumasintaqa waqyarqan"" suggests that something has been done to someone's face, causing it to be swollen or bruised. Option A better fits this context as it implies that the person's face was hit or punched, leading to swelling and pain. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Tribunal wasip punkunpim phiñasqa runakunaqa hatarirqanku. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Tribunalqa sasa chaninchay kamachinatam riqsirachirqan,"" which means that the tribunal has been established for a specific purpose or mission. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the tribunal's establishment was intended to fulfill a particular function or goal."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa p'uyñupim galletasta qunqarurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""sipasqa ima mikhunas"" suggests that something has been taken or stolen, while ""rupharakusqantam muskiyurqan"" implies that it was taken by someone who is skilled in stealth. Option A aligns with this interpretation, as it means ""They took everything from us."" Option B, on the other hand, does not fit with the given premise and would result in a nonsensical sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is option A."
"Response: 
Option A: Tuyuqa astawanmi sinchiyarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Sinchitam parayarqan"" implies that something has been done to make someone feel better or happier. Option A, ""Tuyuqa astawanmi sinchiyarqan,"" means that the person's happiness has increased as a result of what was done to them. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ascensorqa manañam llamk'arqanchu) is the more likely cause of the building collapsing. The phrase ""utqaylla qasichikurqan"" suggests that there was a structural failure in the building, which could have been caused by various factors such as poor construction materials or design flaws. Option B (Nina ruphaymanta alarma qhaparirqan) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the collapse, making it less likely. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Churin machaq-unquywan unqusqanmantam taytaqa phiñayukurqan,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - tantantaqa cerveza nisqatam churinpaqqa rantirqan. This is because the phrase ""churin machaq-unquywan"" suggests a strong desire or craving for something, which in this case is beer. The word ""tantantaqa"" means to drink excessively or to get drunk, and ""nisqatam"" means to become intoxicated. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Secretariam chay p'unchaw mana llamkarqanchu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""chay p'unchaw"" means ""to eat a lot,"" so it suggests that the speaker may have eaten too much food and now feels unwell or nauseous. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Masinqa manam rimananta tukuchirqachu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""masinqa manam rimananta"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, and ""rimananta tukuchirqachu"" implies that it was caused by a sudden impact or shock. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Cajeroqa sencillutam sipasmanqa qupurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Sipasqa qullqitam cajeroman qurqan,"" which means ""The money in my wallet has been stolen."" This implies that someone has taken the money from the speaker's wallet without their permission. Therefore, option A is the most likely effect, as it suggests that the speaker will receive a simple explanation for what happened to their missing money."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Accidente nisqarayku such'uyarqan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ruedayuqmanmi churachikurqan"" suggests that something unexpected or unforeseen has happened, which aligns with the meaning of ""accident."" Option B (""Payqa camillapi hamp'ina wasimanqa chayarqan"") implies a deliberate action or decision made by someone, which does not fit with the context of an accident. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Independence from Spain was not achieved through armed struggle) is the more likely cause of the failure to achieve independence in Peru during the 19th century. The premise suggests that the country's independence was not gained through military means but rather through diplomatic efforts. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaman qhatiqkunaqa sunqu p'akirisqa karqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sunqu p'akirisqa"" suggests that the event will happen suddenly or unexpectedly, which aligns with the idea of a sudden change in weather. Option B (Paykunaman qhatiqkunaqa aswan kallpanchasqa karqanku) does not convey the same sense of surprise or unpredictability."
"Response: 
Option A: Pinqarikurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Masiyqa kiruypi mikhuna kasqanta t'upsiyarqan"" suggests that something is being pulled or drawn towards a specific location. Option A, ""Pinqarikurqani,"" means ""to pull towards oneself,"" making it the most likely option to describe the effect of whatever is happening in the scenario. Therefore, we can conclude that the effect is more likely to be Option A: Pinqarikurqani."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa allintan clasesninta uyarikurqan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""yachananta"" suggests that something has been forgotten or overlooked, and ""clasesninta"" implies a lack of attention or care in teaching. Therefore, it is more likely that the teacher did not pay enough attention to their students' needs and forgot to teach them important concepts, leading to confusion and difficulty in understanding the material."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pachakuyuy llqatata chhapchirirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Chawpi llaqtapi edifcio thuniyarqan"" suggests that there has been some sort of damage to a building, and the word ""pachakuyuyllaqta"" implies that this damage was caused by natural forces such as earthquakes or floods. Option B (""Llaqtapi runa sipiyqa sinchiyarqan"") does not provide any contextual clues related to natural disasters or structural damage, making it less likely as an explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa kutinankupaqmi mañayukurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, if you eat too much sugar, your teeth will rot faster. This means that option A, ""Payqa kutinankupaqmi mañayukurqan,"" or ""Eating too much sugar will cause your teeth to rot faster"" is the more likely effect. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Sinkuqa karuman muyurqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Iskay irqikunam kikin pachapi sinkuta hap'iyta munarqanku,"" it is more likely that the effect of the sentence will be ""Sinkuqa karaman muyurqan"" (The sun will set early). This is because ""hap'iyta"" means ""early"", and ""munarqanku"" means ""sunset"". Therefore, the overall meaning of the sentence suggests that the sun will set earlier than usual. Option B does not make sense in this context as ""umapura"" means ""to rise"" and cannot be used to describe the setting of the sun."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cartonmi qupa ukhupiqa karqan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""Mapacheqa qupa waqaychanata rawirqan,"" indicating that something has happened to the qupa (container). This suggests that the container may have been damaged or broken, leading to the contents spilling out. Option B (""Qupa waqaychanaqa mana kirpanayuq karqan"") implies that the qupa itself is causing the problem, but this does not align with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Pisi chaniyuq karqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Irqiqa lapizta ñawch'iyachirqan,"" which means ""The ice has melted in the mountains."" This suggests that there was once ice in the mountains but it has since disappeared or melted away. Option A, ""Pisi chaniyuq karqan,"" which means ""It started to snow,"" is a more plausible explanation for why the ice would have melted in the first place. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa recibo nisqatam chinkarachirqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Rantisqa p'achata kutichisqanmantaqa Cajeroqa manam qullqintaqa warmimanqa kutichirqanchu,"" which implies that something was received from Cajero but it did not match what was expected or requested. This suggests that there may have been an error in processing or delivery of the item, which could result in a refund being issued. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Utqaylla hampikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qaraypi hallp'iqa ukhum karqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a change in someone or something. Option A, ""Utqaylla hampikurqan,"" means ""The situation has become worse."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pampata qhawachkarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Trenpi wakin illaqkunaqa"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, and ""hukniraqtam qharita"" implies a sense of urgency or importance attached to finding it. Option A aligns better with this context than option B (""Kikillanman rimachkarqan""), which means ""The dog bit my hand."""
"Response: 
Option A: Sisikunam qutqutaqa apakurqanku. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Irqiqa pampapi qutquta wisñirqan,"" it is more likely that the effect of sisikunam (the sun) setting will be seen as a sign of darkness and nightfall, rather than a sign of light and daybreak. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Warmipa ñañanqa makankunatam chakatarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, warmiqa ñañanmanmi papel pañuyluta ayparqan, meaning that warmth can soften or melt things made of paper. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that warmth can make the paper soft and pliable. Option B does not provide a logical explanation for how warmth would affect paper."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Siminmi ch'aki kachkarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qhariqa menta misk'itam ch'unqarqan"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not functioning properly, and the speaker is asking for an explanation or solution to this problem. Option A provides a possible reason for why this might be happening, suggesting that the problem may be due to a lack of knowledge or understanding about how things work. In contrast, option B does not provide a clear explanation for why the problem might be occurring, and instead simply states that the problem is caused by someone's mistake without providing any further details. Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Teatropa kinrayninpi tráfico nisqawan manam tupayta munarqankuchu) is a more plausible cause for the traffic jam in the city center. The phrase ""tráfico nisqawan"" suggests that there are too many cars on the road, causing congestion, while ""munarqankuchu"" implies that the situation has been going on for some time. Therefore, it is more likely that an excessive number of vehicles is the main reason for the traffic jam rather than a sudden increase in the number of people wanting to go to the theater (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Umalliqninmi yupaycharqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""umalliqninmi"" means ""to warm up,"" and ""yupaycharqan"" means ""it will be warmer."" Therefore, it is likely that the temperature will increase as a result of the predicted weather pattern. Option B (""Llamk'aqmasinninmi paymanta llamk'arqan"") does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa activistakunapa llamaqsaskunkupim iñirqan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""Activistakuna mañakusqankuta qhariqa siq'icharqan,"" indicating that there are many activists who are working to expose corruption. This suggests that there may be a collective effort underway to bring attention to these issues, rather than just one individual or group acting alone. Option B (Activistakunaqa waq'achus kanmuman hinataman yuyanchakuspam denunciata churarqan) implies that an individual or small group of individuals is responsible for exposing the corruption, which seems less likely given the context of the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa escenáman lluksinanmantam mancharisqa kachkarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Escenaman manaraq lluqsichkaptin actorpa sunqunqa katatatachkarqan,"" which means that the scene manager has been unable to find an actor for a certain role. This suggests that there may be a lack of actors available in the market, making it difficult for the scene manager to find someone suitable for the role. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Qullqiyta yuparqani (The ice will melt)."
"Response: 
Option A: Mikhurqanku."
"Response: 
Option A: Wakmanta hap'irachirqani (The cause of the problem is not clear).
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is unclear what caused the problem. The word ""waqllirikurqan"" means ""the problem has arisen,"" but it does not provide any information about the cause of the problem. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa psiquiatra nisqamanmi rirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa wasantam nanachikurqan"" suggests that something has been lost or forgotten. Option A, ""Payqa psiquiatra nisqamanmi rirqan,"" means ""The psychiatrist forgot what he had forgotten."" This option is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for why someone would forget something they had previously forgotten."
"Response: 
Option A: Lant'ayqa manañam karqanchu. 
Explanation: The premise ""Kanana patapi ninata hap'ichirqani"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from someone. Option A, ""Lant'ayqa manañam karqanchu,"" means ""They took it away in the morning."" This option better fits the context of the premise and is therefore the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Phawasqanmanta warmiqa utirqan,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""utirqan"" in this context suggests that something has been lost or gone missing, which aligns with the meaning of ""Rikranmi."" Therefore, option A is the best fit for the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Wasimasiyqa wasinman haykuchiwarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Wasimasiypa punkunpi waqyakurqani"" suggests that something has been done to make someone feel uncomfortable or uneasy. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation by suggesting that the person's thoughts are being controlled or manipulated in some way. This option is more likely than Option B, which simply states that the person is feeling uneasy without providing any additional context or explanation."
"Response: 
Option A: Ima llakikusqanmantaqa qusanqa mana allintachu yacharqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Warmiqa phiñarisqam ukhanman samarirqan,"" meaning ""The weather was very cold in the morning."" This implies that it was colder than usual for that time of year, suggesting that the cause of the cold weather could be a natural phenomenon such as a cold front moving through the area. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Yachaqiqa allinta tapuykunamanqa kutichirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""yachaqiqa"" means ""to shake or tremble,"" and ""tapuykunamanqa"" means ""the earth."" Therefore, it is possible that an earthquake caused the ground to shake and tremble. Option B (Tapuykunata kutichinanpaqqa yachaqiqa iskayarqan) does not provide a clear explanation for why the ground would shake and tremble."
"Response: 
Option A: Chakramanmi rirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Runtuta warmi wankunanpaqqa manañam karqanchu"" suggests that something is happening in a specific location at a specific time. Option A, ""Chakramanmi rirqan,"" means ""The sun sets."" This option is more likely to occur based on the given premise as the sun setting would be consistent with the timing provided in the premise. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Huk pakasqa yachayta payman willarqani. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Ñawpa masiywanmi tinkurqani,"" meaning ""The sun sets in the east."" This implies that the sun will set in the west, which is the opposite direction of where it actually sets. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa challwatam hap'irqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""warmiqa manam quchamanqa riyta munarqanchu"" suggests that there is a lack of understanding or communication between two parties, which could lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. Option A implies that one party may be avoiding or neglecting their responsibilities, which could further exacerbate the situation. Therefore, it is more likely that payqa challwatam hap'irqan (avoiding or neglecting one's responsibilities) is the root cause of the problem."
"Response: 
Option A: Achiwanmi p'akirikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Yachaqiqa apillañam clasemanqa chayarqan"" suggests that something has been stolen from a place where it was kept safe. Option A, ""Achiwanmi p'akirikurqan,"" means ""Someone took my bike."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it implies someone taking something valuable (a bike) from a secure location (their own home). Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Runaqa huk'ucha nisqapi ñit'irqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""computadorapi cursor nisqaqa kuyurichkarqan,"" which means that a computer mouse has moved to the right side of the screen. Option A correctly states that this movement was caused by the user clicking on something with the mouse. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hatun ñanpiqa accidente nisqam rikurirqan) is the more likely cause of the conductor's absence from work. The phrase ""accidente nisqam rikurirqan"" suggests that the conductor was involved in an accident, which could have caused them to be unable to attend work. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: P'achaqa ch'akirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Api p'achatam hawa warkunapi warkurarqani"" suggests that there will be a strong wind blowing from the west. Option A, ""P'achaqa ch'akirqan,"" means ""The wind will blow strongly."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Intiqa spayta llpikipichkarqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Warmiqa lentesninta churakurqan"" suggests that there is a lack of clarity or confusion in understanding the issue at hand, while ""Payqa taxitam waqyarqan"" implies that there may be an external factor causing the problem, such as a sudden change in circumstances. Given the context of the situation, it is more likely that the root cause of the problem lies within the team's understanding and communication, rather than an external factor. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ruphay mit'a kanantam munarqan) is a more plausible explanation for why Tutapi Hanaq Pachata Qhari Qhawarirqan. The phrase ""Tutapi Hanaq Pachata"" means ""The Earth is Sick,"" while ""Qhari Qhawarirqan"" means ""It will be cold."" Therefore, Option A provides a logical explanation for why it will be cold by stating that the earth is sick. On the other hand, Option B does not provide any coherent reasoning to explain why it will be cold."
"Response: 
Option A: Ñawpaqtaraq samakuq rirqani. (More likely)"
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa chukchanta wiñachikuchkarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qhariqa chukcha rutuqmanmi rirqan"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their consent or knowledge, which aligns with Option A's meaning of ""Someone took something away from you without your permission."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to a situation where something was taken away from them without their consent rather than simply disappearing or vanishing."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Warmaqa sumaqtam musuq yachaqimasintaqa chaskirqan) is a more plausible cause for why the cat's fur is dirty than option B (Warmaqa mana munarqanchu musuq yachaqimasintaqa). This is because the first option suggests that the cat has been rolling in something dirty, while the second option simply states that the cat's fur is dirty without providing any explanation. Therefore, option A provides a more logical explanation for the observed phenomenon.
"Response: 
A) Misk'i galletasta michkarqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ñuqñu upyayta munarqani"" suggests that something has happened to a person or group of people, causing them to be in a state of distress or disarray. Option A, ""Misk'i galletasta michkarqani,"" implies that this situation may have been caused by external factors such as an attack or invasion, while option B, ""T'antata ruwarqani,"" suggests that it could be due to internal conflicts or power struggles within the group. Therefore, based on the premise provided, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Choferqa karrupa k'anchaykunantam hap'ichirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Parayta qallarirqan,"" meaning that something has happened before in a similar situation. Therefore, it is more likely that Option A, ""Choferqa karrupa k'anchaykunantam hap'ichirqan"" will occur, as it implies that the previous event will repeat itself."
"Response: 
Option A: Karrutaqa ñan patapi utichirqani. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Edificiopa parqueo nisqanqa qasisqa karqan,"" it is more likely that the construction of a new park will increase the number of cars in the neighborhood. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa manam qillqayninta qatipayta atirqanchu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""qillqayninta haywarinanpaqqa"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, and ""payqa"" means to break or damage something intentionally. Therefore, it is more likely that someone deliberately broke or damaged the object in question rather than it simply being a natural occurrence (option B)."
"Response: 
Option A: Umalliqwan rimanaypaq mañakurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Llamk'aqqa waqyasqayta tukurqachipun"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from a place called Tukurqachipun. Option A provides a possible explanation for this situation by stating that ""Umalliqwan rimanaypaq mañakurqani,"" meaning that someone or something must have taken it. This option is more plausible than Option B, as it offers a clear reason for why something might be missing from Tukurqachipun."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kichaqasqa wintanantin wayra haykurqan,"" option A is more likely to occur. The word ""wayra"" in Quechua means ""snow,"" so it is likely that there will be snowfall in the Andes mountains. Option B does not make sense in this context as ""arapakuna"" means ""sun"" in Quechua, and cannot be used to describe a weather event like snowfall."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lamparara enchufemanta qichurqani) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""nisqaqa wasiypi mana karqanchu"" suggests that there may be an issue with the electrical system in the house, such as a short circuit or overheating. Option A implies that this could be due to a faulty outlet or wiring issue, while option B does not provide any specific information about the nature of the problem. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Lirpupi qhawakuspa llapa aychanta k'uytupachirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""pesas nisqakunata huqariqqa qhututuyarqan,"" which means that something has been lost or taken away from someone without their knowledge or consent. Option A suggests that this loss was caused by someone else, specifically ""lirpupi qhawakuspa llapa aychanta k'uytupachirqan,"" which means that they secretly took it away while pretending to be friendly or helpful. This option is more likely because it provides a clear motive for why something would have been taken away without the person's knowledge or consent."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Calculadorata hap'irqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Yachaqiqa llapan cálculo nisqakunata"" suggests that there has been a calculation error, which could result in an incorrect answer. Therefore, it is more likely that the calculator will produce an incorrect result rather than producing nothing at all (option B)."
"Response: 
Option A: Taytanmi musuq pañalta churarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Wawaqa puñurqan,"" which means ""The sky is falling."" This phrase suggests that something catastrophic is happening or about to happen. Option A, ""Taytanmi musuq pañalta churarqan,"" translates to ""The earth is being crushed by a giant hand,"" which is an even more ominous and destructive scenario than the one suggested in option B. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the premise provided."
"Response: 
Option A: Maqtaqa uma unquywanmi hatarirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Unu hunt'ayuq p'urutam pasñaqa maqtaman chaqirqan"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their consent or knowledge. Option A, ""Maqtaqa uma unquywanmi hatarirqan,"" means ""Something was stolen from me."" This option better fits the context of the premise and is therefore more likely to be true."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Fotokunaqa qhusñisqahina lluqsirqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""flashtataqa hap'ichiyta"" suggests that a flash of light has occurred, which could potentially cause a camera to malfunction or produce an unusual image. Option B (Fotopi lluqsiqkunaqa manam asikuyta munarqakuchu) does not make sense in this context, as it implies that the photo was taken with a different camera than the one mentioned in the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sapallaymi karqani) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""mink'awasqankuta mana riyta munarqanichu"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the birthday celebration, and the speaker is blaming it on the fact that they didn't get enough sleep the night before. This implies that the lack of sleep may have affected their ability to enjoy the party and caused them to feel unhappy or disappointed. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the speaker is feeling this way."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kallpayuqhina karqani) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""nisqata"" in the premise suggests that something has been lost or misplaced, which aligns with the meaning of ""kallpayuqhina"". Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Unuta suq'urqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Api esponjata q'apirqani"" suggests that something has been spilled or scattered. Option A, ""Unuta suq'urqan,"" means ""It spreads."" Therefore, it is more likely that the thing that was spilled will spread than to gather together again."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Qurpachanaqa aywaqñam karqan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""chayanakupaqqa"" suggests that something has been blocked or obstructed, which aligns with the meaning of ""aywaqñam"" in Option A. Therefore, it is more plausible that the ferry was unable to move due to an obstruction rather than being stuck in a particular location as suggested by Option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Agujakunataqa payqa manchakurqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""payqa imamaypas hatariytam munarqan"" suggests that there may be a blockage or obstruction in the pipes, which could cause water to leak out. However, the phrase ""agujakunataqa payqa manchakurqan"" implies that the issue may be related to a crack or break in the pipe itself, rather than an obstruction. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Watupakuyta qallarirqani) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""wasiypa punkunpi mana riqsisqa karru utiyarqan"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, and the word ""qallarirqani"" implies a sense of urgency or importance. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will use the phrase ""Watupakuyta qallarirqani"" to indicate that they need to find or recover what was lost as soon as possible."
"Response: 
Option A: Ima kaqpas paytam tumparqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Q'umalliqqa riqsichikurqan"" suggests that something has been done to a group of people, causing them harm or injury. Option A, ""Ima kaqpas paytam tumparqan,"" means ""They did it to us."" This implies that the harmful action was taken by someone else against the group, making option A the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Manaña misk'ikunataqa mikhurqanñachu. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Wirasapa runaqa llañuyayta munarqan,"" which means ""The sun will rise tomorrow morning,"" we can infer that there will be a new day after today. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sipasqa chullunkasqa pampapi ichiyarqan,"" option A (Payqa suchuyarqan) is the most likely outcome. The word ""suchuyarqan"" means ""to be scared or frightened,"" so it suggests that the person will feel afraid or intimidated by something. Option B (Payqa mancharikurqan) means ""to be annoyed or irritated,"" which does not align with the context of the premise as much as option A. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tutantinpi rikch'alla karqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""rikch'alla karqan"" means ""the water is boiling,"" indicating that there may be an issue with the temperature or pressure inside the kettle. This could potentially lead to a leak or other malfunction. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the tea is not steeping properly."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ariqmanta nina lawa lluqsirqan,"" option A is more likely. The word ""nina"" in this context suggests that there are multiple causes for the problem, rather than just one single cause. Therefore, option A, which states ""Ariqqa tuqyayta qallarirqan,"" or ""There are many reasons why we can't find a solution,"" is more plausible."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa raymipi llapan kaqkunatam riqsirqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""warmiqa zapatonta churakurqan"" suggests that there has been a sudden change in temperature, which could potentially cause ice to form inside the pipes. This is supported by the second part of the premise, where it mentions ""llapan kaqkunatam riqsirqan,"" which implies that the ice has formed inside the pipes. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hark'anapi llamk'aqman qullqicharqani,"" option A is more likely to occur. The word ""hark'anapi"" means ""to make someone angry or upset,"" so it is likely that the person will become annoyed or frustrated with the situation. Option B does not fit the context of the premise as well, as ""hark'anapi hark'ariwarqan"" means ""to make something angry or upset."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa compañianta qhaturqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""ejecutivo runaqa"" suggests that someone in a position of authority or leadership is involved in the situation, and ""aquyrakimanmi haykurqan"" implies that they are acting impulsively or without proper consideration. Option A aligns with this interpretation by suggesting that the leader is making decisions without consulting their team or colleagues. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Hamp'iqqa samachkarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa hamp'iqmanmi rirqan"" suggests that something has happened to Qhariqa, causing her to act in a certain way. Option A, ""Hamp'iqqa samachkarqan,"" means that Qhariqa has become agitated or upset, which could be caused by various factors such as stress, anxiety, or trauma. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of Qhariqa's behavior."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wintanantinmi wasiymanta lluxirqani,"" option A is more likely. The word ""lluxirqani"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away, which aligns with the idea of a cause being missing. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa armakuspam unayarqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Wawap rukanankunaqa llulluyarurqan,"" which means ""The baby's head was stuck in the mother's armpit."" This suggests that the baby's body was in an unusual position, with its head located near or inside the mother's armpit. Option A reflects this by stating that the baby's head was ""stuck"" in the mother's armpit, while option B does not accurately convey this information. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ñuqñuqa phusqusqa karqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Ñuqñuta thuqyarqani,"" which means ""The snow has melted."" This implies that there was previously snow on the ground, but it has now melted away. Option A, ""Ñuqñuqa phusqusqa karqan,"" which means ""The snow has disappeared,"" is a more likely cause of this phenomenon than option B, ""Ch'aki simiyur karqani,"" which means ""The sun has risen."" The melting of snow is typically caused by rising temperatures, rather than the direct effect of sunlight. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Llamk'anayman chayanapag temproranaq karqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""temproranaq"" means ""early"" in Quechua, so it suggests that the event will happen sooner rather than later. Option B (Llamk'anayman chayanaypayg tardeña karqan) means ""Busman mana ayparqanichu"", which does not convey a sense of urgency or immediacy. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Camionqa utqaylla richkarqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Camionqa karruwan t'akarukurqan,"" it is more likely that the truck will break down due to a mechanical failure (utqaylla richkarqan) rather than the driver simply getting lost (karruqa llapan ñitikusqa tukurqan)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Atipanakuyta llallinankupaqmi equipo nisqaqa imaymanata ruwarparirqanku,"" option A, ""Paykunaqa llalliparqanku"" is the most likely outcome. This is because the phrase suggests that something will happen to the team's equipment due to an unforeseen event or situation, which could cause it to malfunction or break down. Option B, ""Paykunaqa pukllaymanta lluqsirqanku,"" does not necessarily imply a negative outcome for the team's equipment but rather a change in its appearance or function."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gaseosaqa puqpurayarqan,"" option A is more likely. The word ""puqpurayarqan"" means to spill or pour out, so it suggests that something was poured into a container from a larger quantity. Option A, ""Botellata t'ikrayarqani,"" translates to ""I filled a bottle with gasoline."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa wintanantin haykururqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Hawapi maqta kachkaspa"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, and ""wasi punkun wichq'arikusqa"" implies a desire for it to be returned. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the speaker will try to find a way to recover what was lost. Option B (Payqa wasi patantin haykururqan) does not fit with this interpretation as it means ""I paid for something without getting anything in return."""
"Response: 
Option A: Watukuqqa punkuta t'akarirqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the effect of the first option (Watukuqqa punkuta t'akarirqan) will occur. The phrase ""t'akarirqan"" means ""to make something disappear,"" so it suggests that the object or person in question will vanish or be erased from existence. Option B does not provide a clear indication of what will happen to the object or person, making Option A the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ch'aki maqchiymanmi p'achantaqa aparirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa p'achanta llimpiyarikusqa"" suggests that something has been cleaned or washed away. Option A, ""Ch'aki maqchiymanmi p'achantaqa aparirqan,"" means that something has been erased or removed, which is a more likely outcome given the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Pastaqa allintam lluqsirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Sipasqa kiru muqchikuy pastatam q'apirirqan,"" which means ""The snow-covered mountain peaks are melting."" This implies that the temperature is rising, causing the snow to melt. Therefore, option A, ""Pastaqa allintam lluqsirqan,"" which means ""The snow is melting away,"" is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Mana awqanakuyta munaq runakuna sayarispa rimaykacharqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""awqanakuy"" refers to a person who has been appointed or elected to a position of authority, such as a leader or representative. Therefore, it is more likely that this person would be responsible for making decisions and taking actions related to their role, rather than simply following orders from someone else."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa cintawan churakurqan) is the more likely cause. The sentence ""Sipasqa chukchanmanta cintata hurqurparikurqan"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from someone, and Option A implies that it was taken by force or coercion. Option B (""Cintaqa wawahinatam rikurichirqan"") means ""The one who loves will be separated,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa machuyarqan.

Explanation: The premise ""Chiwchiqa runtumanta lluqsirqan"" suggests that something has been lost or misplaced. Option A, ""Runtuqa p'akirikurqan,"" means ""I have lost it."" This option is a direct response to the premise and is therefore more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa wañurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Watachasqa runa yarqaymanta wañuchkarqan"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up. Option A, ""Payqa wañurqan,"" means ""They will uncover it."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:

Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa wichanapi wayllunkayarqan"" suggests that something will happen to a person's hair due to their actions or behavior. Option A, ""Wichanaman siqarqan,"" means ""Their hair will fall out,"" which is a logical consequence of the given premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Gaseosata upyarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Irqiqa hap'ayarqan"" suggests that something has been done or taken away from a place called ""Irqi"". Option A, ""Gaseosata upyarqan"", means ""Something was removed from there"", which aligns better with the given information than option B, ""Gaseosa latata kicharqan"", which means ""Something was added to there"". Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
A) Sumaqta samakurqani (The cat will get angry).
Explanation: The sentence ""Chiri wayram wintanant Haykurqan"" means ""The cat is looking at something."" Option A, ""Sumaqta samakurqani,"" translates to ""The cat will get angry,"" which is a more likely outcome given the context of the sentence. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Yachaqimasinkunaqa payta yupaycharqanku) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""yachaqimasinkunaqa"" means ""he/she will be tired,"" and ""payta"" means ""will eat."" Therefore, the sentence implies that the person will become tired after eating, which is a common occurrence. Option B (""Allin calificación nisqatam ayparqan"") does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa waynapa wasimasinnmi karqan) is a more plausible explanation for why Sipasqua's people are not coming to the gathering place. This is because ""wasimasinnmi"" in the Hopi language means ""he did not come,"" indicating that Sipasqua did not attend the gathering place due to his absence or non-participation. In contrast, option B (Payqa waynatam munakurqan) translates to ""He did not come because he was sick,"" which does not align with the context of the given premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa kuyapaykuytam manakurqan) is the more likely cause for why Mana imayuq runaqa mikhunata suwakurqan. The phrase ""kuyapaykuytam"" means ""to eat away,"" so it suggests that something is consuming or eating away at Mana's hair, causing it to fall out. Option B (Payqa mana qullqiyuq karqan) does not provide a clear explanation for why Mana's hair would be falling out, and ""qullqiyuq"" can have multiple meanings depending on the context. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Manam piwanpas rimayta munarqanichu) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""rimayta munarqanichu"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, and ""piwanpas"" means to break or shatter. Therefore, it is more likely that the damage was caused by a sudden impact or shock, rather than a gradual wear and tear over time."
"Response: 
Option A: Makiyta haywarirqani (The cat will get wet).
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa makinta haywariwarqan"" implies that something will happen to the cat, specifically getting wet. Option A provides a clear and logical conclusion based on this premise, while Option B does not make sense in this context."
"Response: 
A) Fuegos artificiales nisqam hanaqman t'uqyarirqanku. 
Explanation: The text suggests that the fire was caused by an artificial source, such as a spark or flame, rather than a natural phenomenon like lightning. Option A best fits this description, as it implies that the fire was intentionally started using artificial means."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sipasqa sillunkunata k'utuykachakurqan,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""sillunkunata"" means ""he/she will be cold."" Therefore, the most likely cause for someone to be cold is that they are outside in the winter without proper clothing or shelter (option A). Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of someone being inside when they should be warm."
"Response: 
Option A: Huk ruwanaytam churarqani. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Almanaquepa raphinta t'ikrayarqani,"" it is more likely that the cause of the problem is a lack of planning or foresight (huk ruwanaytam churarqani). This option aligns with the meaning of the words in the premise, as ""raphinta"" means to plan ahead and ""t'ikrayarqani"" means to be careful or cautious. Therefore, Option A is the best answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Payqa amachaqninta qarqurirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""kasqantam qusaqa tarirqan"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up, and ""payqa amachaqninta qarqurirqan"" means to uncover or reveal something that was previously hidden. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will uncover the truth about what happened rather than create a new lie."
"Response: 
Option A: Rump'uqa pinkiyarqan. 
Explanation: The word ""rump'uqa"" in the premise means ""to be angry"", so the most likely effect of someone being angry at you is that they will yell or shout at you (pinkiyarqan). Option B does not make sense in this context as it means ""to be cold""."
"Response: 
Option A: Kutichisqantaqa waturirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Sipasqa examenninpi pantarurqan"" suggests that something has been examined or observed in a particular way. Option A, ""Kutichisqantaqa waturirqan,"" means ""It was found to be true."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Option A: Pukllaqmasinqa rump'uta hap'irparirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Pukllaqqa pukllaqmasintam t'akarparispa harkayarqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a reaction or change in the past.

"Response: 
Option A: Puquña karqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Tumatikunata yuranmanta hurqurqani"" suggests that something has been done to someone without their consent or knowledge. Option A, ""Puquña karqanku,"" means ""They did it to me."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it implies that the action was taken against the person mentioned in the premise.

"Response: 
Option A: Ñawpaq munakuqninwanmi mikhunanpaq huñurikurqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the effect of Option A will occur. The phrase ""munakuqninwanmi mikhunanpaq huñurikurqan"" suggests that something will be added to or mixed with water in a way that makes it taste good. This could refer to adding flavorings or ingredients to food or drinks, or even mixing different liquids together to create a unique taste. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Termometrota urmarachirqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Termometropi mercurio kaqqa wichayarqan"" suggests that there is an abnormal increase in temperature due to a faulty thermometer. Option A, ""Termometrota urmarachirqani,"" means ""The thermometer is broken."" Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the abnormal temperature reading."
"Response: 
Option A: Corte wasipan qhataqa phawarparirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Wayra muyuqqa llaqtaman chayachkarqan,"" which means ""The river flows very fast."" This suggests that there is a lot of water flowing through the river, which could cause erosion or wear down the banks. Option A, ""Corte wasipan qhataqa phawarparirqan,"" which means ""The bank has been worn away by the current,"" is therefore more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Chaninchayninqa aswanmi sumaqyarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Yachaqiqa pusaq yachachiqwan yanapachikurqan"" suggests that something will happen to a group of people who are known for their beauty.

Option A: Pampapi qunqurikurqani. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Sumaqti mayturikurqani"" means that the person has a tendency to get angry quickly. This suggests that they have a short temper. Option A, ""Pampapi qunqurikurqani,"" means that the person gets angry easily or has an explosive temper. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Rumiqa llunk'aykachakurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Rumita qhiturqani"" suggests that something has been done to Rumia, causing her to act in a certain way. Option A, ""Rumiqa llunk'aykachakurqan,"" means ""Rumia is acting strangely."" This option best fits the given information and is therefore the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Cafeqa sinchita q'apayarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Azucartam cafemanqa churarqani"" implies that something sweet (azucartam) has been added to a drink (cafemanqa). This suggests that the drink may have become sweeter as a result. Option A, ""Cafeqa sinchita q'apayarqan,"" means ""The drink became sweeter."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Paypa papilta kuchurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa papilkunata allichayarqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a change in the way things are perceived or experienced. Option A, ""Paypa papilta kuchurqan,"" means ""The image changed color."" This option best fits the given premise as it implies a transformation or alteration of the original image, which aligns with the idea of changing how things are perceived or experienced. Therefore, Option A is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Clavuqa llallapikurqan."
"Response: 
Option A: Challwaqqa challwata aysaykacharqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Challwaqua anzueluman qamsarqan,"" it is more likely that the effect of the spell will be to make the target's eyes turn white (Option A). This is because the word ""challwaqqa"" means ""to whiten"" or ""to brighten,"" and the phrase ""anzueluman qamsarqan"" suggests that the target's eyes are darkened or obscured in some way. Therefore, the most likely outcome of casting this spell would be to lighten or brighten the target's eyes, rather than causing them to disappear (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Muchi uyanpi rikurirqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Escuelaman rinanmanta pasñaqa pinqakurqan"" suggests that there is a lack of organization or structure in the school, leading to confusion and disarray among students and teachers alike. Option A aligns with this idea by suggesting that the root cause of the problem lies within the school itself, rather than external factors such as weather conditions or other unforeseen events. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem stems from internal issues within the school rather than external causes beyond its control."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Uyayqa kusisqa rikurikurqan,"" option A is more likely. The word ""sumaq"" means ""to be tired"" or ""fatigued."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is saying they are feeling fatigued due to lack of rest rather than being angry with someone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tohallam makiyta ch'akichikurqani,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""tohallam"" means ""he/she will fall."" Therefore, the most likely cause of the person falling is due to tripping or slipping, as stated in option A.  "
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Suni tiyanaqa kuyuykacharqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tiyana"" means ""to make something hot,"" and ""kuyuyka"" means ""to boil."" Therefore, it is possible that the sun's heat caused the water to boil, leading to the formation of steam and the eruption of the volcano. Option B (Payqa tiyana patamami llimpita chaqchuyarqan) does not provide a clear explanation for how the sun's heat could have caused the volcano to erupt."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pukllaypi mana llalliparqankuchu) is a more plausible cause for the observed effect than option B (Pusaqninkuqa mana allintachu llamk'achirqanchu). The premise suggests that the cause is related to the word ""paykunapura,"" which means ""sunrise"" in Quechua. Option A translates to ""the sun rises over the mountain,"" which aligns with the given premise. On the other hand, option B does not make sense in this context as it implies that the sun is shining inside a house, which is unlikely. Therefore, based on the information provided, option A is the more likely cause for the observed effect."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pampachayta mañakurqani,"" option A is more likely to be the correct cause: ""Pantasqaymanta yuyaychakurqani."" This is because ""pampachayta"" means ""to increase or augment,"" while ""yuyaychakurqani"" means ""to grow or develop."" Therefore, it makes sense that an increased amount of something would lead to its growth or development. Option B, however, does not make as much logical sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Warmipa tapukuyninta qhariqa kutichirqan) is a more likely cause for the observed effect. The phrase ""tapukuyninta"" means to warm up or heat something, so it suggests that the increase in temperature may be causing the ice to melt. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Paypa uyachanqa pukayarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Sipasqa tumpata asiyukurqan,"" which means ""The sky is falling down."" This implies that something catastrophic is happening, such as a meteorite impact or an asteroid collision. Therefore, option A, ""Paypa uyachanqa pukayarqan,"" which means ""The end of the world has come,"" is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Mina patantintam pasarqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Awqapa wampunqa t'uqyayurqan"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, and ""patantintam"" means to take away or remove. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem was caused by someone taking or removing something important from the person rather than a sudden change in their surroundings."
"Response: 
Option A: T'uruman haykururqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa chakinta turpuyukurqan"" suggests that something has caused a change in the usual or expected state of things. Option A, ""T'uruman haykururqan,"" means ""The change was sudden."" Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa pim sipiq kasqanta tarirqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sipisqanku"" means ""to make something disappear,"" and ""tarirqanku"" means ""to be gone."" Therefore, it is likely that whatever was made to disappear will actually vanish completely. Option B (Paykunaqa armata tarirqanku) does not fit with the context of the premise as ""armata"" means ""not here,"" which would suggest that something is no longer present in a particular location rather than being completely gone."
"Response: 
A) Uch'uy ñannintan ripurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ñanpi sinchi karrukuna kachkarqan"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from a person. Option A, ""Uch'uy ñannintan ripurqani,"" means ""They took everything from me."" This option better fits the context of the premise and is therefore more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Sinchi runakunam unquyarqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Suyupa qullqi hap'iyninqa pisiyarqan"" suggests that something has been done to make someone feel uneasy or uncomfortable. Option A better fits this context as it implies that the person being addressed is feeling uneasy due to something they have done themselves. Therefore, option A is a more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Paykunaqa ña k'ikllumanña haykuytañam munachkarqanku. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the chimpanzee guardians are not able to protect their territory from outsiders due to their small number. This aligns with option A, which suggests that the lack of guards is a factor in the loss of territory."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa chiqaytam willachkarqan) is more likely to be the correct cause for why Masiymanmi qunqaymanta qhawayarqani. This is because the phrase ""Masiymanmi qunqaymanta qhawayarqani"" suggests that something has happened to Masiymanmi's body or physical appearance, which could potentially be caused by an external factor such as a disease or injury rather than an internal factor like aging. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for this situation."
"Response: 
Option A: Karruqa ñampi utiyarparirqan. 
Explanation: The word ""utiyarpak"" in Option A means ""to fill up"", so it's more likely that the speaker will use this phrase to describe the effect of eating too much food. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Wawa paqarirqan (The water will boil)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa ch'ukunqa ch'utikurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qharipa ch'ukunqa phawarparirqan"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, while ""Payqa ch'ukunqa ch'utikurqan"" means to take something away or steal it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Yachaqiqa yachaqimasinpa raymichaykuyninmanmi rirqan,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the word ""yachaqi"" means ""to shake"" or ""to tremble."" Therefore, the sentence can be translated to ""The earthquake shook the mountain."""
"Response: 
Option A: Mamanqa mat'inta llamiyarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Irqipa mat'inqa ruphayachkarqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a reaction or response in someone. Option A, ""Mamanqa mat'inta llamiyarqan,"" means ""The mother-in-law caused a commotion."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the context of the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa tinkuqninwan sumaq qhawachikuyta munarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""churayukurqan"" suggests that something has been done or caused to happen, and the word ""munarqan"" implies a sudden or unexpected event. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the problem is an external factor that occurred suddenly, rather than a gradual build-up over time."
"Response: 
Option A: Linternata maskharqani (The light bulb will glow brighter)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wanwanku escuelanta tukurqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Aylluqa hatun wasiman astarikurqanku"" suggests that someone named Aylluqa has been accused of something, and the speaker is trying to defend her by saying that she is not capable of doing what she has been accused of. Option B (""Mamaqa wispa wawakunata wacharikurqan"") does not fit with this context and seems out of place in the sentence. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa kallpayuqllam kayta munarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""allillamantam pitachkarqan"" suggests that something has been done to provoke or irritate someone, while ""kallpayuqllam kayta munarqan"" implies a stronger reaction, such as hitting or attacking someone. Therefore, it is more likely that the person reacted violently in response to being provoked rather than simply feeling sad or upset."
"Response: 
Option A: Vueltuntam makinaqa aqtuyarqan. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the machine broke down due to wear and tear (Option A) rather than being attacked by a virus (Option B). The phrase ""maquina ranaqtam"" suggests that the machine has been in use for some time and may have accumulated wear and tear over that period, leading to its breakdown."
"Response: 
Option A: Payta qhawarirqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Masiypa allqunqa wañurirqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a problem or issue. Option A, ""Payta qhawarirqani,"" means ""He/She caused the problem."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the context of the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa pagaré nisqatam qillqarqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""nisqata"" means ""to pay back"" or ""to repay,"" so it suggests that the person will have to pay back the debt they owe. Option B (Payqa makipi qullqiwanmi pagota qurqan) does not convey the same meaning, as ""makipi"" means ""to give"" or ""to offer,"" but does not imply a sense of repayment or payment back. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the context of the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Sillunkunata kuchururqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qhariqa ñakapayukurqan,"" which means ""The world will end in fire."" This suggests that a fiery event or disaster of some kind will bring about the end of the world. Option A, ""Sillunkunata kuchururqan,"" translates to ""The sun will swallow the earth,"" which aligns with this idea of a fiery event causing the end of the world. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wawqinqa taytamamankuwanmi k'aminakurqanku) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""wawqinqa"" means ""to wash away,"" and the word ""taytamamankuwanmi"" means ""I will wash away."" This suggests that the speaker may be referring to a physical action of washing something away, such as water or dirt. Option B (Wawqinqa amachaqkuna escuelapim chaskichikurqan) does not make sense in this context and seems to be a non-sequitur. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa bibliotecamanmi rirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Sistema solarmantam warmaqa yachayta munarqan,"" which means ""The solar system has been heating up the Earth's atmosphere."" This suggests that there is a natural phenomenon occurring in the solar system that is causing the Earth's atmosphere to warm up. Therefore, option A, ""Payqa bibliotecamanmi rirqan,"" which means ""The library of books will burn down,"" is less likely as it does not relate to the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Punku hawanpim postertaqa t'akyachirqani) is a more plausible cause for why the poster may have been removed. This is because the phrase ""postertaqa t'akyachirqani"" suggests that the removal of the poster was done intentionally or deliberately, rather than being an accident or natural occurrence. Option B (""Ratanacintatam posterpa qhipanpiqa churarqani"") does not convey this same sense of intentionality, and therefore seems less likely as a cause for the removal of the poster."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ruwasqan"" (allintam) implies that something has been drawn or planned, while ""chaskirikurqan"" suggests a change or modification. Therefore, it is more likely that the architect will modify the existing building design rather than creating a new one from scratch."
"Response: 
Option A: Makinmi katatatachkarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa cucharanta urmayachirqan"" suggests that something has been mixed with water, making it difficult to determine its original form or composition. Option A, ""Makinmi katatatachkarqan,"" means ""to mix something thoroughly,"" which aligns better with the given premise as it implies a thorough mixing of substances, potentially obscuring their original characteristics. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kamariqkunataq empresata utirichirqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""umalliqta maskharqanku"" suggests that there are obstacles or challenges in the way of starting a business, which could make it difficult for an entrepreneur to successfully launch their venture. Therefore, option A is the best answer choice because it implies that the entrepreneur may face difficulties in getting their business off the ground."
"Response: 
Option A: Chayaspaqa qhipapi tiyakurqani. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Huñunakuyman chayanaypaq sinchita unayarqani,"" which means that a person from Huallaga has been accused of stealing something valuable. This implies that the person's reputation is at stake, and they may be in danger of being ostracized or punished by their community. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome, as it suggests that the person will try to clear their name and avoid any negative consequences."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Fianza nisqatam ayllun qullqicharqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""nisqatam ayllun"" suggests that there may be a lack or shortage of something essential, such as resources or support, which could lead to difficulties in completing tasks or achieving goals. This aligns with the idea of feeling overwhelmed or burdened by responsibilities, which is consistent with the definition of ""laluq"". Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa wasinkuta qhatucharqanku) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Aylluqa imayninkunatam chinkarirqanku"" suggests that something has been done to someone or something in a particular place, while ""Paykunaqa wasinkuta qhatucharqanku"" implies that something has been taken away from someone or something. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the situation described in the premise is that something has been taken away from someone or something rather than something being added to them."
"Response: 
Option A: Lataqa wakmanta hap'ichikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Alumino latata sarurqani"" suggests that there is a chemical reaction occurring involving aluminum and sulfuric acid. This reaction would produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct, which could potentially ignite if it comes into contact with an open flame or spark. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa computadora hap'iyta yacharirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Rimanakuymanmi sipasqa huñurikurqan,"" which means ""The man who does not know how to use a computer will be left behind."" This implies that using a computer is necessary for success in today's society, and those who do not know how to use it will be disadvantaged. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Takiyta uyarirqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Imayna kasqayqa allinyarirqan"" suggests that something has been done to someone without their consent or knowledge. Option A, ""Takiyta uyarirqani,"" means ""They did it without my permission."" This option better fits the context of the premise and is therefore the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Paykunaqa mana imayuq runakunatam mikhuchirqanku. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Munasqan qullqitam yanapaq wasiqa huñurirqan,"" it is more likely that the effect of paying for something will be to receive a refund (Option A). This is because the word ""yanapaq"" in Quechua means ""to give back or return."" Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Runakunaqa asiyukurqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Montaña rusapi karruchaqa uraymanmi pasayurqan"" suggests that something is happening to a mountain range, causing it to shake or tremble. This could be due to natural causes such as earthquakes or volcanic activity, or it could be caused by human activities such as mining or construction. Option A, ""Runakunaqa asiyukurqanku,"" means ""The mountain is shaking with fear."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Wasimanta lluqsispa buzonta qhawarqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Phiñasqa kachkarqani"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up. Option A implies that this thing was revealed or uncovered, which is more in line with the meaning of the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa hanaq suyumanmi illarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa pacha paqariytam qhawayta munarqan"" suggests that something has happened to a large area of land, causing it to become uninhabitable. Option A, ""Payqa hanaq suyumanmi illarqan,"" means ""The earth shook violently and became unstable."" This effect is more likely given the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Papilta wakmanta hap'iykacharqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Papilta patarayarqani"" suggests that something has happened to Papilta, causing her to act in a certain way. Option A, ""Papilta wakmanta hap'iykacharqani,"" implies that Papilta has become angry or upset due to this event. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Huk suyukunapa umallinkunaqa masinchakurqanku. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Suyuqa pacha ch'ikiwanmi kachkarqan,"" it is more likely that the effect will be Option A: Huk suyukunapa umallinkunaqa masinchakurqanku. This means that the person will become a master of their own destiny by controlling their thoughts and emotions. The phrase ""umallinkunaqa"" suggests a sense of control or dominance over one's own life, while ""masinchakurqanku"" implies a strong desire to achieve this state. Therefore, Option A best fits the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Irqipa p'achanqa apirikurqan,"" option A is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""payqa piscinamantam"" means ""to pour water,"" so it is unlikely that the cause of the leak would be ""payqa piscinamanmi,"" which means ""to fill with water."" Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bibliotecamanmi kutichinan karqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""libru ñawiriyta"" suggests that a book or library was involved in some way, and ""kutichinan karqan"" means to damage or destroy something. Therefore, it is more likely that the destruction of the books was caused by someone intentionally damaging or destroying them rather than simply forgetting where they put them."
"Response: 
A) Payqa carcelmanmi apachikurqan (The person who caused the problem is the one who will fix it).
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, option A is the most likely answer. The phrase ""Q'umalliq runaqa wañuchikurqan"" suggests that the problem was caused by someone or something, and the sentence ""Payqa carcelmanmi apachikurqan"" implies that the same person or entity responsible for causing the problem will also be the one to fix it. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Arapakunata kichayarqani) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Intip k'anchaynin wintanantinta haykurqan"" suggests that there is a blockage or obstruction in the pipes, which could be caused by a buildup of grease or debris. Option B (Punkuta kichayarqani) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the problem, making it less likely as an explanation."
"Response: 
A) Peluca nisqaqa aysarparikurqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Yanqa runapa chukchanta chutarqani,"" we can infer that there will be an earthquake in the area. The word ""runapa"" means ""earthquake"" or ""shaking,"" and ""chukchanta"" means ""there will be."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Makiwan qillqasqataqa allin ruwasqatam tarirqan) is a more plausible explanation for why the people of Qullasuyu are not able to find their way home. This is because the phrase ""allin ruwasqatam"" suggests that there has been some kind of disruption or obstruction in the normal flow of time, making it difficult for the people of Qullasuyu to navigate through space and time. In contrast, option B (Makiwan qillqasqapiqa mana ch'uya rimayta tarisqan) does not provide any specific reason as to why the people of Qullasuyu cannot find their way home, other than suggesting that they may have lost their sense of direction due to some unknown factor. Therefore, based on the given premise, option A seems like a more logical explanation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tarjeta chinkarusqanmantam yuyaychakurqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""tarjeta chinkarusqanmantam"" suggests that the credit card has been damaged or tampered with, making it unusable for transactions. This is a common issue that can occur when a credit card is lost, stolen, or damaged in some way. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the customer cannot use their credit card to make purchases online."
"Response: 
Option A: Kusqa universidadman rirqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariwan warmiwan munanakurqanku"" suggests that something has been done to cause a change in the speaker's body. Option A, ""Kusqa universidadman rirqanku,"" means ""I have studied at university."" This option is more likely because it better fits the context of the premise and does not involve any physical changes to the body. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Uyarikunanpaq yapayarqani) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Takiyqa sinchi upallalla kaspa mana uyarikurqanchu"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their consent or knowledge, which could result in feelings of loss or deprivation. Option A aligns with this idea by stating that the person's possessions have been taken away, while option B does not provide a clear explanation for why the person would feel this way. Therefore, option A is the best answer choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Pasñam tampayachirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Maqtapa chukchanqa ñaqcharisqa kachkarqan"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from a place where it was previously located.

"Response: 
Option A: Repelente nisqawanmi hichayurqanku. 
Explanation: According to the premise, kuruqa ñit'isqa tukurqan (there are many mosquitoes in this place), which suggests that there is a high concentration of mosquitoes in the area. Option A, repelente nisqawanmi hichayurqanku (a repellent for mosquitoes), is therefore more likely as it implies that there is a way to keep mosquitoes away. Option B, sarurqanku (they bite), does not provide any information about how to deal with the mosquitoes and is therefore less likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Rikch'arirqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ñawiyta kicharqani"" suggests that something has been done to cause a problem or issue. Option A, ""Rikch'arirqani,"" means ""I caused it."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sinchita upallaschinanpaq payta manakurqani) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""taki uyarisqanqa sinchim"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, and ""upallaschinanpaq payta"" means to take something back or retrieve it. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will try to retrieve what was taken away rather than simply listening to a CD (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa pisillatam qullqinta ayllunman qurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""payqa pisillatam"" means ""to pay a fine,"" and ""qullqinta ayllunman"" means ""the community of people."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is suggesting that the community of people will have to pay a fine for some reason. Option B (Paypa llama k'anan piqa psi pagomanta aswan pisitam chaskirqan) does not make sense in this context and appears to be a nonsensical combination of words."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa llama...maskharqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""payqa llama"" means ""to pay for something,"" so it suggests that the person will have to pay money in order to achieve their goal of graduating from university.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Manañam imatapas rimayta atirqanichu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""rimasqanchiktaqa hukniyachirqani"" suggests that something has been taken away or removed from a place, and ""imatapas rimayta atirqanichu"" means to take something out of a container. Therefore, it is more likely that something was taken out of a container rather than being placed inside one."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Turayqa hamp'ina wasimanta lluqsirqan,"" option A is more likely. The word ""wasimanta"" implies a strong desire or craving for something, so it is more likely that the person will try to find a way to satisfy their cravings rather than ignore them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Wallparisqa ruwayqa qallarirqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Escenariopa arapanqa wichayman kichakurqan,"" it is more likely that option A will occur, as the word ""ruway"" means ""to fall"" or ""to drop."" Therefore, the scenario of walls falling is more plausible than the one where walls are running away."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hap'iqqa atisanka runata sipinanpaqmi mancharichirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""atisanka runata"" suggests that the action of running was performed by a person or entity, while ""hap'iqqa"" implies a sudden and unexpected event. Therefore, it is more likely that the runner experienced an unforeseen obstacle or challenge during their run, rather than simply deciding to stop mid-run for no reason."
"Response: 
Option A: Takiqqa huk chakinwanmi tusupachkarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Lliw escenariopi huk tununuyuyta uyarikurqan,"" which means ""The scenario of a person who has never seen the world outside."" This implies that the speaker has not experienced anything beyond their own community or environment, and therefore lacks knowledge about what lies beyond. Option A, ""Takiqqa huk chakinwanmi tusupachkarqan,"" which means ""It is unlikely that they have ever left their home,"" is the most plausible explanation for why this person may not know much about the world outside their community. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wawaqa llap'i musquywan rikch'arispa qaparichkarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""llap'i musquywan"" suggests that the speaker is referring to a person who has been drinking alcohol, which can impair cognitive function and lead to poor decision-making. Therefore, it is more likely that the person in question made a mistake due to their intoxication rather than any other factor."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Warmiqa maki-rimaywanmi rimarqan,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""maki-rimaywanmi"" suggests that something has been made or created, which aligns with the idea of a new cause being introduced. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Yakum qhillichakurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ch'akirayay pachamam suyupiqa rikurirqan"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from a place called Pachamama (Mother Earth).

Explanation: The premise ""Michim urpitaqa qhatirirqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a change in Michim's behavior. Option A, ""Urpiqa phalaspa ripurqan,"" means ""The change was caused by an external factor."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Escuelaqa ruphay mit'a kaptinmi lluqsichirqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""ruphay mit'a"" suggests that there may be a lack of resources or support for the school, leading to difficulties in maintaining it. This could include issues with funding, infrastructure, or teacher training, among other things. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the school might be struggling."
"Response: 
Option A: Fábricayuqqa musuq umalliqta churarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, fábrica means ""to fabricate"" or ""to make,"" and yuqruna means ""to dream."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer because it suggests that the person will fabricate a dream."
"Response: 
Option A: Ima ruwananpaqpas awqanakuqkunam kamachirqanku. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Suyuq umalliqninmi awqanakuqkunaman ñak'arichirqan,"" it is more likely that the speaker will experience a negative emotion such as sadness or grief rather than a positive emotion like happiness. The use of the word ""umalliq"" (sad) in the premise suggests that the speaker may be feeling down or depressed, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the answer is Option A: Ima ruwananpaqpas awqanakuqkunam kamachirqanku."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aqu aqum chakiyman ratarirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Q'ala chakillam mama qucha patanpi purirqani"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone, and the word ""chakiyman"" implies a forceful or violent removal. Therefore, it is more likely that the person had their belongings taken away by someone else rather than giving them away willingly."
"Response: 
A) Quñi warata churakurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Chawpi tutapi chisrisqa rikch'arqani"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up. Option A, ""Quñi warata churakurqani,"" means ""The truth will come out."" Therefore, it is more likely that the truth about what was hidden or covered up will be revealed."
"Response: 
Option A: Wawanqa sumaqta asiyukurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mamitaqa wawanta upallachirqan"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from Mamitaqa. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation by suggesting that Mamitaqa may have lost her wallet or money due to carelessness. This option is more likely than Option B, which implies that Mamitaqa may have lost her identity or sense of self, which seems less relatable and practical in everyday life."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Waraypa cierre nisqanta wisq'arikurqani) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""waraypa cierre"" means to close or shut something down, and ""nisqanta wisq'arikurqani"" means to stop working or malfunctioning. Therefore, it is possible that the issue with the jeans is caused by them being closed or shut tightly, which could be preventing them from functioning properly.  "
"Response: 
Option A: Kirunmi t'uqurukurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Maqt'aqa frenillos nisqatam"" suggests that something has happened to the ferns, making them twisted or distorted. Option A, ""Kirunmi t'uqurukurqan,"" means ""They have become twisted."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."

Option A: Rikch'arispaqa kurkuymi makurkiwarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Gimnasio nisqapi qayna p'unchawqa llamk'arqani"" suggests that there is a gym near the place where the person is currently located. Option A states that the person will be able to see the gym from their current location, which is more likely given the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Wakin yachaqikunataq hamp'araman mikhuq hamurqanku. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person will experience a negative effect ( Option A) as they are exposed to a large amount of noise pollution from construction work. The phrase ""hamp'araman mikhuq hamurqanku"" suggests that their ears may be damaged or affected by the loud noises, leading to hearing loss or other auditory problems."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Payqa kutimanta wikaparirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""patapim irqi urmarqan"" suggests that something has been taken away from Irqis, implying a loss or deprivation. Therefore, it is more likely that Irqis will experience negative emotions such as sadness or disappointment rather than feeling happy or content. Option B (Payqa wikapaspa muyuriyta munarqan) does not align with this interpretation and seems less plausible in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Buzón nisqapi qillqakunata churarqani,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Correo oficinaqa qillqata apachirqan."" This is because the word ""nisqapi"" implies a negative or unpleasant situation, and ""churarqani"" means to be filled with something. Therefore, it is likely that the office mailbox will be filled with unwanted correspondence rather than being empty."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Llapan qullqintam churaykurqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""qullqintam churay"" means ""to make something hot,"" so it suggests that the object will become hotter as a result of some action or process. Option B (""Payqa mana qullqiyuq wasinman kutipurqan"") does not provide any clear indication of what might happen to the object, making option A the more plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wayram aswan sinchita phukuyarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""aswantam mast'arikurqan"" suggests that something has been done hastily or without proper consideration, which could lead to mistakes or errors. Option A implies that the mistake was made while performing a task, whereas option B does not provide any context for why the mistake might have occurred. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Mamanqa cuartonman kacharirqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Irqiqa muquchanta k'irirukurqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a change in the original state of affairs. Option A, ""Mamanqa cuartonman kacharirqan,"" implies that this change was caused by an external factor, such as someone or something else doing something to the original state of affairs. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Testamentonta qillqarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa wañuy unquymanta hatarirqan"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from a place called Qhariqa. Option A, ""Testamentonta qillqarqan,"" means ""The testament of the missing thing."" This option best fits the context of the premise, as it implies that something important or valuable was taken away from Qhariqa, leaving behind only its testimony or remnants. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause for what happened in Qhariqua."
"Response: 
Option A: Qalluyta k'uturukurqani (The ice will melt slowly)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Qillqaqqa mana p'inqayninta churaspam qillqarqan) is a more plausible cause for why the editor quit their job than option B (Qillqaqqa tukukunan p'unchawpim mana tukurqanchu). The reason is that the first option suggests that the editor left due to dissatisfaction with the quality of work being published, while the second option implies that they were unhappy with the amount of work assigned to them. Given the context provided in the premise, it seems more likely that the editor would be motivated to leave if they felt that their work was not up to standard rather than if they felt overworked or undervalued. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response: 
Option A: P'unchawnintin puñurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Saykusqa karqani"" suggests that something has been damaged or affected by a powerful force. Option A, ""P'unchawnintin puñurqani,"" means ""The damage was caused by a strong wind."" Therefore, option A is the most likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Runap uquy rikurichiqkunatam tarirqan) is a more plausible cause for the effect of Hampiqqa runatam qhawayarqan. The phrase ""runap uquy"" means ""to run away,"" and ""rikurichiqkunatam"" means ""from something."" Therefore, Option A implies that Hampiqqa ran away from something, which could be any number of things such as danger, responsibility, or even boredom. On the other hand, Option B (Payqa pastillastam runamanqa qurqan) does not make much sense in this context, as it translates to ""He paid someone to run his errands,"" which has nothing to do with why Hampiqqa might have left his home."
"Response: 
Option A: Hump'iwachkarqan."
"Response: 
Option A: Sinchita phiñarikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa cirugía de emergencia nisqaman haykurirqan"" suggests that there was an urgent surgical procedure performed in a crisis situation. Option A, ""Sinchita phiñarikurqan,"" means ""The patient's life was saved through surgery.""

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Mak'anqa qiwikachaspa mat'iparisqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""qiwikachaspa"" means ""to quickly or suddenly disappear,"" which suggests that the object in question has vanished without a trace. This is supported by the word ""mat'iparisqan,"" which means ""suddenly disappeared."" Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Payqa manchay utichisqaraq kachkarqan) is a more plausible cause for why the dog's barking has stopped. This is because ""utichisqaraq"" means ""to stop or cease,"" indicating that the dog's barking has indeed stopped. Option B (Payqa mana kallpayuqhina kachkarqan), on the other hand, means ""The dog's barking has been silenced,"" which does not necessarily imply that the dog's barking has actually stopped. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context of the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sumaq sunquyuq runa kasqanpim iñirqani) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""sumaq sunquyuq"" means ""the earth is shaking,"" which suggests that a seismic event or natural disaster may be causing the problem. In contrast, option B (""Aswan yachachasqanpi iñirqani"") refers to a person's stomach hurting, which is not related to the earth shaking. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa astawan ejerciciosta ruwarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qhariqa manañam pitarqanñachu,"" meaning ""The earthquake occurred at night."" This implies that it was dark outside during the earthquake, making it less likely for people to see the effects of the earthquake clearly. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Maqaqninqa wañurapurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Waqmiqa maqaqnita saqmarqan,"" meaning that something has been eroded or worn away over time.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Qharip wach'iyayninqa pantasqa kachkarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""wach'iyayninqa"" suggests that the action of cutting down trees has been going on for a long time, indicating a gradual process. Option B (Qhariqa manam llallichkarqanchu) implies a sudden and unexpected event, which does not align with the information given in the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa wasinpa uranpi hatun huk'uchakunata tarirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""huk'uchakunata tarirqan"" suggests that the speaker believes the cause of their pain to be internal or related to their own body, rather than external factors such as an injury or illness. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wayk'unaypaqqa saykusqa kachkarqani) is a more plausible cause for why people are not interested in learning about their ancestry. This is because the phrase ""wayk'unaypaqqa"" means ""they don't want to know"" or ""they are not interested,"" indicating that the lack of interest in learning about one's ancestry is a deliberate choice rather than an external factor. In contrast, option B (Watukuqniyqa nishuta qhipakurqan) suggests that people may be unaware of their ancestry due to various reasons such as lack of access to information or resources, which may not be the primary reason for the observed phenomenon. Therefore, option A is a more likely cause for why people are not interested in learning about their ancestry."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Diarionta ñawichaspam turanta sipasqa tarirqan,"" option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""payqa diarionta"" means ""to pay attention or listen carefully,"" so it suggests that the person will be attentive and listen closely to what is being said. Option B, ""Payqa musuq diariotam,"" means ""To pay attention (carefully) to something,"" but it does not convey the same level of intensity as option A. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa aswan horastam llamk'ayta qallarirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""aswan"" means ""to swell up"" or ""to become inflated,"" and ""horastam"" means ""to burst."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the person will experience a sudden increase in size or inflation, which could potentially lead to an unfortunate outcome such as bursting. Option B (Payqa llamk'ananta saqirqan) does not convey a similar sense of danger or negative consequence."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa ruphay waykunatam llamirqan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""Irqiqa utqaytam maqintaqa hurqurqan,"" indicating that something has happened to the water source, causing it to become polluted. This suggests that the pollution was caused by an external factor, rather than a natural occurrence such as a change in temperature or seasonality. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa descuentutam musuq rantiqkunapaqqa rurqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""musuq rantiqkunapaqqa rurqanku"" suggests that Paykunaqa will receive a discount for purchasing in bulk, which aligns with the idea of offering price reductions for larger quantities purchased. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Warmaqa cojinesta pampaman wikch'urqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Llaqllamanta pampaqa raskasqa karqan"" suggests that something is happening in the Andean highlands, where there are many different types of plants and animals. Option A implies that this event is related to the movement or migration of a large number of birds, while option B does not provide any context for why this might be significant. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given information."
"Response: 
Option A: T'akanakuqmasiyqa sawkayuwachkarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Uyayta pakarikurqani"" suggests that something has happened to the speaker's body, causing them pain or discomfort. Option A, ""T'akanakuqmasiyqa sawkayuwachkarqan,"" better fits this context as it means ""My body is being torn apart."" This phrase conveys a sense of urgency and distress, which aligns with the premise provided. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ancha riqsisqa wankiqa k'anayukurqan,"" option A is the correct answer. The phrase ""illapam ayparqan"" means ""the sun sets slowly."" Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the sun to set slowly.  "
"Response: 
Option A: Añawiqa rururqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Hamp'ara patapi añawita saqirqani,"" it is more likely that the effect of option A will occur, as ""añawiqa"" means to make someone or something disappear or vanish. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa chaki rukanankunatam t'upsirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tusuqpa ank'unqan chutarparikurqan"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, and the word ""rukanankunatam"" implies a sudden and violent movement. Therefore, it is more likely that the damage was caused by a sudden impact or shock rather than a gradual wear and tear."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa watakuyta yacharqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""watakuyta"" means ""to make someone angry,"" so it suggests that the speaker believes that their friend's anger was caused by something they did or said. Option B (Payqa patiopi phawaykacharqan) means ""To make someone happy with one's own hands,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manchay kusisqa librowanqa karqani,"" option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""librotaqa kutirachirqani"" means ""the book will fall apart."" Therefore, it is more likely that the book will deteriorate or fall apart rather than being written by someone else."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Taytamamanqa payta yachachirqanku) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""yachachirqanku"" means ""I will make it happen,"" indicating that the speaker intends to take action to achieve their goal. This suggests that they have agency and control over the situation, making option A the more plausible choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Mana gasolinayuq karqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Karru utinankamaqa allillamanta purirqan"" suggests that something has caused a disturbance in the air or atmosphere. Option A, ""Mana gasolinayuq karqan,"" means ""The wind stirred up the dust."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it explains why there would be a disturbance in the air.

Explanation: The premise ""Wankita p'irqapi warkurqani"" suggests that something has been done to someone without their consent or permission. Option A, ""Mast'akunaqa qhillihina rikukurqanku,"" implies that the person who did the action was not authorized or legitimate, which makes it more likely that they acted without proper authorization. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Umaymi nanawarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Llamk'anaymanta temprano lluqsirqani,"" which means ""The early bird catches the worm."" This phrase suggests that those who act quickly and take advantage of opportunities will be rewarded. Therefore, option A, ""Umaymi nanawarqan,"" which means ""I will get up early,"" is a more likely cause for success than option B, ""Umalliqniyqa huñunakuytam ruwarqan,"" which means ""If I don't hurry, I won't catch it."""
"Response:

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa q'ipinta q'ipirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qhariqa runa chawpipi kaspapas rikurikurqan"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, and Option A implies that this loss was caused by a sudden and unexpected event such as an earthquake. In contrast, Option B (""Payqa neón nisqawan p'achakusqa karqan"") implies that the loss was caused by a gradual process over time, which does not fit with the sudden nature of the premise. Therefore, based on the information given in the premise, it is more likely that the cause of the loss is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa rikusqanta willayta tukurqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Rikuqqa sullullchaypi llullakurqan"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up, and ""Willayta tukurqan"" means to uncover or reveal something. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will uncover the truth rather than fabricate a lie."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa hukniraq qhawakuyta munarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""warmiqa chukchanta lliphichikurqan"" suggests that there has been a significant change in the environment or circumstances of the community, which could be causing the problem.

Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa llamk'anata tarikurqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""hawa suyupi mana papelniyuq runakuna hap'ichikurqanku"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising will happen, and paykunaqa (meaning ""to surprise"") fits well with this idea of an unforeseen event occurring. Option B (""Paykunaqa qarquchikurqanku""), while still possible, does not fit as neatly with the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Runakunaqa asiyukurqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Runakunapa rimaqqa chansayta rimarqan"" suggests that something will happen to the speaker's tongue due to excessive talking.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sasa kuchunam aychaqa karqan,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""kuchunaqa mana ñawch'iyasqa karqan"" means ""the sun has set early."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa mikhunanpaq qullqitawan yanapachikurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Warmi mana qullqiyuq tukusqantam willarqan"" suggests that there are many factors contributing to the problem of lack of food in the community, but the specific cause mentioned in option A is more directly related to the issue at hand. Therefore, it is more likely that the lack of food in the community is due to a shortage of traditional foods rather than debt or other external factors."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Masiypa wasinqa k'ancharisqa karqan,"" option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""watin qanchisqa"" means ""the sun will rise again."" Therefore, it is likely that the speaker is referring to a future event where the sun will rise again after setting. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no connection between paying attention to someone's words and the sun rising again."
"Response: 
Option A: T'ikap panqanqa uymayarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""T'ikata sinqayman asuchikurqani"" suggests that something unexpected or unpredictable will happen to someone. Option A, ""T'ikap panqanqa uymayarqan,"" means ""The unexpected happened."" Therefore, option A is a more likely outcome based on the premise provided."

The phrase ""warmiqa llakisqa tarikurqan"" suggests that there has been a significant change in the environment or circumstances surrounding the problem, which could have caused it to arise. Option B (Payqa wawankunatam qhaparirqan) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the problem and seems less relevant based on the given context. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Yachaqiqa qillqayninpi muyupayarqan,"" option A is more likely to occur. The word ""yachaqi"" in Quechua means ""to eat,"" so the phrase ""yachaqiqa qillqayninpi"" can be translated as ""he/she ate something."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiyuypa wañunanmami chayanay karqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Semana tukuyuyta anchata suyarqani"" suggests that there has been a significant change in the weather patterns over the past week, which could be causing the plants to grow abnormally quickly. This is further supported by the phrase ""chayanay karqan,"" which implies that the growth is happening rapidly or excessively. Therefore, option A is the better choice as it provides a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rikchasqaña kaspapachas musphaspahina karqani) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Ima pachachus kasqanmnataqa chinkasqa karqani"" suggests that something has been done to a person or thing, and the word ""rikchasqaña"" implies a violent or forceful action. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the situation described in the premise is a physical injury or harm caused by someone else's actions."
"Response: 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Ñitichaq impresoraqa mana llimpiyuq karqan) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""ña limpiyuq"" means ""to clean,"" so it suggests that the speaker is trying to clean something with an imprint of their hand or finger. Option B (""Impresoraqa mana raphiyuq karqan"") does not make sense in this context, as there is no clear connection between a printer and cleaning something. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."

The phrase ""Estadiopi himno nacional nisqata takirqanku"" suggests that the national anthem of a country has been modified or altered in some way, which could potentially result in changes to its melody or rhythm. Option A reflects this idea by suggesting that the melody of the national anthem has been changed, while option B does not provide any context for why the melody might have been altered.

Explanation: According to the premise, ""Unuchasqa patapi papel tohalla nisqata churarqani,"" which means that a piece of paper will be torn into two pieces if it is folded too many times.

Explanation: According to the premise, ""Warmi librunta ñawichachkaptin tatichikurqan,"" meaning ""The woman's warm light skin will be seen in the dark night.""

The phrase ""amachasqa"" means ""to shake or tremble,"" and ""kanapaq"" means ""the ground."" Therefore, it can be inferred that a strong earthquake will cause the ground to shake or tremble. Option B (Qhariqa wintanantinta qhawarqan) does not provide any information about an earthquake causing the ground to shake or tremble."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Warmi irqiqa mana paymantaqa uyakurqanchu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qhari irqiqa"" suggests that something has happened to the land or environment, which could be causing the water to become undrinkable. Additionally, the word ""tunpachata"" implies a sudden change or event, rather than a gradual process. Therefore, it is more likely that some external factor such as pollution or contamination caused by human activities has affected the quality of the water, making it unsafe for consumption."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa runa chakintam wanqurqanku) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""paykunaqa runa chakintam"" means ""the prosthesis does not move,"" indicating that the issue is with the prosthetic device itself rather than with the user's movement or technique. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Warmi warmaqa qhari warmap qayllaypi rikranta q'intikurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qhari warma warmi warmaman kukuchunta p'itirqan,"" which means that a person who has been in a cold environment for a long time will have a harder time feeling hot when they return to a warm place. This suggests that their body may not be able to adjust quickly to the sudden change in temperature, leading to discomfort or even illness. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Hamut'ayninta chanincharqani. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Hamut'ayninwan yanapawananpaqmi masiyta tapukurqani,"" it is more likely that the cause of the problem is related to the lack of knowledge or understanding of the situation rather than external factors beyond their control.

Explanation: The premise ""Achka rit'im llaqtapiqa chayarqan"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone or something has been lost. Option A, ""Escuelakuna wichq'arikurqan,"" means ""The school took our land."" This option better fits the context of the premise and is therefore more likely to be true."
"Response:

Explanation: The premise ""Llamk'aqpa mit'a llamk'ayninqa tukurukurqan"" suggests that something has been done to a llama in order to make it act strangely.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wasi pataman sach'a urmarparirqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Sach'aqa wasitam thuniyachirqan"" suggests that something has been taken away from Sach'aqa, and Option A implies that it was taken by someone or something else. Option B (""Wasi qhipatam sach'aqa llanthuyachirqan"") does not provide a clear explanation for what happened to Sach'aqa. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kanana patapi llant'ata tawqarqani) is a more plausible cause for why Kurkuqa iskayman ch'iqtarikurqan. The phrase ""patapi llant'ata"" suggests that there may be an internal conflict or struggle within Kurkuqa, which could lead to his inability to perform his duties as a leader. This explanation aligns better with the context of the premise than option B (Hachawanmi kurkuta t'akarqani), which does not provide any specific reason for why Kurkuqa might be unable to fulfill his responsibilities. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Warmiqhariqa t'aqanakurqanku) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""t'aqana"" means ""to be tired,"" so the sentence can be translated to mean ""I am too tired."" This suggests that the speaker may have been overworking or exerting themselves physically or mentally, leading to fatigue. Option B (Warmiqhariqa wawachayuq tukusqankuta willakurqanku) translates to ""The one who is always working gets tired,"" which implies that the problem is a result of constant effort rather than an individual instance of exhaustion. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa chay waynata munakurqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""munakurqan"" means ""to make something disappear,"" which aligns with the idea of erasing a memory from someone's mind. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker is suggesting using this method to remove a negative memory from their partner's mind rather than simply making them forget about it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Masiypa rimasqanmantaqa umayta k'umuchirqani,"" option A is more likely. The word ""rimasqanmanta"" means ""to break or shatter into pieces."" Therefore, the most likely cause of the broken glasses is that they were dropped or hit something hard, causing them to shatter."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paykunaqa sullullchayta munarqanku) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""sullullchayta"" means to be filled or stuffed, indicating that something has been added to the potion, making it more likely that the effect will occur. Option B (Paykunaqa paqtachayta munarqanku), on the other hand, means to be emptied or drained, suggesting that something has been removed from the potion, making it less likely that the effect will occur. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Qhariqa refrigeradoramanmi imaymana churayta qallarirqa. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Honornopi yupana kaq tukukurqan,"" it is more likely that a refrigerator will break down than a pizza oven. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Warmiqa ruwayninta tukunanpaqpuni takyachikurqan,"" option A is more likely to occur because it implies that something will happen in response to a specific action or event (ruwayninta). Therefore, payqa qillarikurqan (something will be done) is a more logical choice than payqa aswantam llamaqrqan (something will be given), which does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship."
"Response: 
Option A: Legal puriymanmi churinqan urmarirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qhapaq qhariqa machuyaymanta wañurqan,"" which means ""The old man's dream was coming true."" This suggests that something from the past is being brought back or revived.

Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Nina hatariqqa wañururqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Nina hatariqmanmi warmiqa sarupayarqan,"" it is more likely that Nina will be affected by the cold weather.

Option A accurately reflects this meaning of the premise."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Karru purichinanpaq licencia nisqanmi qulluchikurqan) is a more plausible explanation for why the car ran into the wall than option B (Karrunqa accidente nisqapim karqan). This is because it provides a specific reason for why the driver may have lost control of the vehicle, such as a license issue or distraction, rather than simply stating that an accident occurred without providing any context or explanation. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response: 
A) Chikch'aspataq manaña unu t'impuytapas ruwarqaniñachu. 
Explanation: The premise ""Alarma kachkaptinpas ñuqaqa puñurqarisqani"" suggests that something unexpected or alarming has happened. Option A, ""Chikch'aspataq manaña unu t'impuytapas ruwarqaniñachu,"" means ""The cat jumped onto my lap unexpectedly."" This option better fits the context of the premise as it implies an unexpected event occurred. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
A) Camarografo nisqakunaqa paykama qhawapayarqanku. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Llaqta riqsisqa runqaa limosinamanta urayurqan,"" which means ""The area of land that was once a lake has been turned into a luxury resort."" This implies that something significant has changed in the area, such as the transformation of a body of water into a resort. Therefore, option A, ""Camarografo nisqakunaqa paykama qhawapayarqanku,"" which means ""The photographer captured the before-and-after images,"" is more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Yakuqa chiriyayta qallarirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, bañerapi (hot water) will have a warming effect on the body. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Fraternidad huñunakuqmanmi haykurqan) is more likely to occur.

This aligns with the idea of a group working together towards a common goal, as mentioned in the premise. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given information."
"Response: 
Option A: Monedas qullqitam maskhachkarqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Sofá tiyanapi sawnachakunata llampuyachirqani"" suggests that something has been placed on top of a sofa, but it does not provide any information about what that thing might be. Option A, ""Monedas qullqitam maskhachkarqani,"" provides a possible explanation for why something might have been placed on top of the sofa, as it means ""Coins fell from above."" Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Maqt'aqa phawaspa ayqikurqan. 
Explanation: The word ""maqt'aqa"" in the premise means ""to eat"", so the most likely effect of eating something is that it will be digested. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Option A: Awqa-tinkuypaqmi apachikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Wamink'aqa wiqru chakintin purirqan"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from a place where it was previously located.

Explanation: Based on the premise ""Q'umalliqqa policíamanta phawarurqan,"" it is more likely that the police will be involved in a chase. The word ""arpana"" means ""chase"" or ""pursuit,"" and ""yanaparirqan"" means ""will be."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Urmarachirqani) is the more likely cause of the laptop not turning on. This is because the word ""hap'ichikurqanchu"" suggests that something has happened to the laptop, implying a sudden or unexpected event. In contrast, option B (Baterianta hunt'achirqani) implies that the battery may have run out, which could be a gradual process rather than an unexpected one. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa sinchitam p'achataqa rantirukurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""p'achataqa rantirukurqan"" suggests that the hunters are actively searching for something, implying a deliberate effort to find it. This is in contrast to option B (Payqa p'achanta p'atarayarqan), which implies a more passive approach to finding something. Therefore, based on the given premise, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Warmin wachakurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qhariqa sunqun qhasusqa kachkarqan"" suggests that something has been taken away from a place or location, implying a physical removal or disappearance. Option A aligns with this interpretation by suggesting that something was removed or taken away, while option B implies that something was added or placed somewhere else. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."

Option A: Payqa munasqan llamk'aymanmi aypayta atirurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Académico grado nisqatam qhariqa ayparqan,"" which means ""The academic degree of low quality will be abolished."" This implies that the institution will no longer offer or recognize degrees of poor quality, which could lead to a decrease in the number of students enrolled in such programs. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa runakunata napayukurqan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""Qharip kunkanqa hinantin auditoriopi uyarikurqan,"" indicating that there are sounds coming from outside the room where the speaker is located. This suggests that the noise may be coming from a nearby location rather than being produced by the microphone itself. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for the phenomenon described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Monedaqa ukhukama urmarqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ruvasqapi moneda"" suggests that something has been added or inserted into the money, making it less valuable.

"Response: 
Option A: Rantikuqqa yanqa qullqiwan rantiyta munarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Cajeroqa wachimanta waqyarqan,"" which means ""The cashier was angry at work."" This implies that the cause of their anger is related to their job or workplace. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the cashier's anger is caused by something specific they experienced at work, such as a difficult customer or long hours. Option B does not provide any context or clues about what might have caused the cashier's anger, making it less plausible."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Qupaqa wayk'una k'ititam asnarachirqan) is the more likely cause. This is because the phrase ""wayk'una"" means ""he/she was angry,"" and ""asnarachirqan"" means ""he/she hit."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the person who caused the damage to the car was angry beforehand. Option B (Rantisqaymanta recibo nisqatam qupapi chinkarachirqani) does not provide a clear explanation for why the person damaged the car."
"Response: 
Option A: Wawakunaqa wichq'asqa uywakunamanta yacharqanku. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Aylluqa Zoo nisqaman rirqanku,"" it is more likely that the zookeeper will be affected by the animal's gaze rather than the other way around. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wasa rurunmi mana allinchu kachkarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qharip samayninqa sinchim karqan"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual has happened, and the word ""rurunmi"" in Option A implies a sudden or unforeseen event. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the unexpected occurrence is related to an external factor rather than an internal one (as suggested by Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Imayna chayanapaq masiyta tapurqani) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""huk boleto puchuwarqan"" suggests that there is a possibility of something being lost or misplaced, which aligns with Option A's description of something being hidden or concealed. Therefore, it is more likely that the object will be found in a place where it was previously hidden rather than in a location far away from its original position."
"Response: 
Option A: Qatakunata hurqurqani (The air conditioner will break down).
Explanation: The sentence ""Wasip aire acondicionado nisqan p'akirikusqa"" implies that the air conditioner has been working for some time, but now it has stopped functioning properly. Option A suggests that the air conditioner will break down completely, which is a more plausible outcome given the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Warmapa wasanmi nanarqan,"" option A is more likely. The word ""wasanmi"" means ""war map,"" so it suggests that the situation described in the premise is related to warfare or conflict. Option A, ""Mochilanmi kicharayarqan,"" translates to ""The war map is spreading."" This implies that the conflict is expanding or growing, which aligns with the context of a war scenario. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Pastelta paypaq ruwarqani. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Mamaypaq suñata rantirqani,"" it is more likely that option A is correct because ""pastelta"" means ""to make something disappear."" Therefore, the sentence ""Mamaypaq suñata rantirqani"" can be translated to ""He made something disappear."" This fits with the context of a magician making things disappear during his performance. Option B does not fit as well since ""Paqarisqan p'unchawnimmi karqan"" means ""The magician made many things appear in front of him,"" which does not match the context of the original sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Muyu allichaq runata wanquyru k'uturqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""muyu allichaq"" means ""he/she is very narcissistic,"" which suggests that the person's excessive pride and self-obsession are causing them to ignore or dismiss others' feelings and opinions. This aligns with the premise given in the question, where the person is described as being so focused on their own problems that they neglect to listen to others. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Ninaqa wañururqan (The light will be extinguished).
Explanation: The premise ""Fosforota hap'irachirqani"" implies that a light source has been turned off or extinguished. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome, as it suggests that the light will indeed be extinguished."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Manam tribunalman riyta munarqankuchu) is a more plausible cause for why Sasachakuqkunaqa paykunapuralla rimayman chayarqanku.

This explanation aligns with the context provided in the question, where it is mentioned that Sasachakuqkunaqua was punished by the Manam tribe. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Taytamamanku wañukapurqanku) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""wawakunaqa wakcha"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, and ""wanukapurqanku"" means to break or damage something intentionally. Therefore, it is more likely that someone intentionally broke or damaged the object in question rather than a natural disaster like a flood (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mama quchaman meteorito nisqa urmarisqa,"" it is more likely that a tsunami (Option A) will occur rather than a chikchi (Option B). This is because a meteorite impact would cause massive destruction and flooding, leading to a tsunami-like wave. The word ""nisqa"" in the premise suggests something large or powerful, which fits better with the idea of a tsunami than a small creature like a chikchi."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa ch'akisqa karqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Puriqqa mach'aqwanwan tarirukurqan"" suggests that something will happen to a group of people who are gathered together. Option A, ""Payqa ch'akisqa karqan,"" means ""They will be scattered."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Hornota hap'ichirqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Hornoqa ruphayña karqan"" suggests that something has been damaged or harmed. Option A, ""Hornota hap'ichirqani,"" means ""The damage was caused by a sudden impact."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it implies a sudden and unexpected event that led to the damage. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Limonqa qurwayasqa karqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Q'allu limonta q'apirqani"" implies that something has been done to someone or something in order to make it disappear or become less visible. Option A, ""Limonqa qurwayasqa karqan,"" means ""The light disappeared."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given information."
"Response: 
Option A: Suyuqa manam allpakunata imanarqanpaschu. 
Explanation: The premise ""Suyuqa musuq allpakunata riqsirqan"" implies that something has been taken away from someone or something. Option A suggests that something was taken away from the person, making it a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vaso hamp'aramanta urmaykamurqan,"" option A is more likely to occur. The word ""hamp'aramanta"" means ""to become hotter,"" so it suggests that the temperature inside the vessel will increase. Option A states that the pot will boil over, which is a common consequence of an increased temperature inside a vessel. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Pampaqa manam p'altapunichu karqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Hamp'ara kuyuykachakurqan"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from a place. Option A, ""Pampaqa manam p'altapunichu karqan,"" means ""The snow was carried away by the wind."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it explains how something (the snow) could be removed from a location (the place). Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Churinmi ima chiqan kasqanta willakurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Churinpa llullakusqantam taytanqa tarirqan"" suggests that something will happen to the taytan (demons) because of churinpa (the moon). Option A states that this event will occur when the moon shines brightly, which aligns with the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Uhupaq hamp'itam upyayarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qharipa umanqa nanaymanta t'ipuykacharqan,"" which means ""The person who eats too much will have a stomachache."" This suggests that overeating can cause discomfort in the stomach, leading to a stomachache. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trenqua allillamanta puriyarqan,"" option A, ""Estaciónmanmi asuyarqan"" (The station manager caused the accident) is a more plausible explanation for why the train derailed. This is because the word ""allillamanta"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual happened, which could be attributed to human error or negligence rather than natural causes like weather conditions. In contrast, option B, ""Chayananmantam unayarqan"" (The driver was distracted), does not provide an equally compelling reason for why the train derailed."
"Response: 
Option A: Ayllunpiqa umamanta unquywanmi karqanku. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qhariqa terpapiamanmi rirqan,"" which means ""The world is in chaos."" This suggests that there are many factors contributing to the current state of affairs, rather than a single cause. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it implies that multiple causes are at play."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa mikhunantam millpurqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""warmiqa kunkantam hap'ikurqan"" suggests that there is a blockage or obstruction in the pipe, which could be caused by debris or sediment accumulation. Option A implies that this blockage is causing the water to flow backward into the pipe, rather than forward through it. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Rimayninqa ch'aka uyarikurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Warmiqa kunka nanaywanmi karqan,"" meaning ""The weather is getting colder every day."" This suggests that the temperature is gradually decreasing over time, making option A (Rimayninqa ch'aka uyarikurqan) more likely. Option B (Payqa hukniraqtam rimarqan) means ""The snow is melting rapidly,"" which implies a sudden change in temperature rather than a gradual decrease, making it less likely given the context of the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Llawsayachkarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Allquqa hamp'ara patapi aychatam qhawarqan"" suggests that something has been added to or mixed with the original substance, causing it to change in some way. Option A, ""Llawsayachkarqan,"" means ""It will become hotter."" Therefore, the effect of adding something to the original substance is likely to make it hotter, rather than cooler (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paypaq llamk'aqkunatam qarqurqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""warmip negocionqa"" suggests that negotiations are taking place, and ""llmk'aqkunatam"" means ""to pay"". Therefore, it is possible that the parties involved in the negotiations will reach an agreement and make a payment. Option B (Payqa qhapaqyarqan) does not fit with the context of the premise as there is no indication of any payment being made."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Campanam uyarikurqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""uyari"" in Quechua means ""to break or shatter,"" so it suggests that something has been broken or damaged. Option B (Yachachiqmi wasinpi llama k'anankupaq kurqan) translates to ""The pot is broken because I didn't put it back properly."" This does not fit with the context of the premise given, as there is no indication that the pot was actually broken. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why the yachaqikunaqa aulamanta lluqsirqanku."
"Response: 
Option A: Riqsiqmasinkunaqa manam iñirqankuchu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Manchachiqta qhawasqanmantam warmiqa rimarirqan,"" meaning that something has been done in a certain way before. Option A, ""Riqsiqmasinkunaqa manam iñirqankuchu,"" means that it was done intentionally or deliberately. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa yaqalla mama-quchapi hiq'iparirqan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""mama-quchapi"" means ""the mother has given birth,"" indicating that a newborn baby is involved. This suggests that the problem may be related to childbirth or the aftermath of giving birth, rather than an explosion caused by a bomb. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: P'uruqa chhasarikurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Irqiqa p'urunpa q'aytunta chacharirqan"" suggests that something has been done to cause a change in the situation. Option A, ""P'uruqa chhasarikurqan,"" means ""The change was gradual."" Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Derrame cerebral) is more likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. The phrase ""rimayninta chinkarachirqan"" suggests that there is a problem with the brain or nervous system, which aligns with derrame cerebral being a possible cause of neurological symptoms such as headaches and dizziness. Option B (Payqa ukhumanmi samarirqan) does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to be the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Cementopi rakra t'uqu karqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, veredapim warmi mitk'arikurqan, meaning that warm weather can damage crops. Option A suggests that cementopi rakra t'uqu karqan, or strong winds can also damage crops, making it a plausible cause of crop failure in warm weather. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Salvavidas runaqa qhipanpi chapurparikurqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""runaqa qhipanpi"" means ""to save a person from drowning,"" so it suggests that someone is in danger of drowning and needs rescue. Option B (""Salvavidasmanmi yakuwan chhallpurirqan"") does not convey the same sense of urgency or danger, and therefore is less likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Infección nisqayqa thaniyarqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, atibióticos nisqata millpurqani, meaning that there are no symptoms of infection. Therefore, option A is the correct answer, as infección nisqayqa thaniyarqan (there is no infection) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Choferqa feno nisqaqa ñitirqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, there are two cars approaching an intersection from different directions. One of them has a brake failure, and the other one applies its brakes. In this situation, it is more likely that the car with the brake failure will collide with the other car because it cannot stop in time due to its faulty brakes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Ruphayaq yakuta plástico nisqaman hicharqani. (More likely)"
"Response: 
Option A: Poste nisqawanmi karruqa tak'arukurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Karruqa q'apñurukurqan,"" meaning ""The snow has melted."" This implies that there was previously snow on the ground, but it has now melted away. Option A, ""Poste nisqawanmi karruqa tak'arukurqan,"" means ""The sun has melted the snow."" Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the melting of the snow."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Maqtaqa tutantinkama yachananta yacharirqan,"" option A is more likely to occur. The word ""yachananta"" means ""to be in a state of confusion or disarray,"" while ""yacharirqan"" means ""to become confused."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person will become confused rather than not experience any confusion at all."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa wamp'uy yachaytam manchakurqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""payqa wamp'uy"" means ""the water is boiling,"" indicating that the reason for the steam is due to hot water from a nearby source, such as a river or lake. Option B (Salvavidas nisqaqa llank'ayninpim karqan) does not make sense in this context, as it implies that someone is trying to save something from being destroyed by fire, which is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Suyquy katatataqnintam uyarqani. 
Explanation: The word ""suyquy"" in Yupik means ""to be cold,"" so the phrase ""suyquy katatataqnintam uyarqani"" can be translated to ""It's getting colder."" This option is more likely because it matches the context of the sentence and the meaning of the words used."
"Response: 
Option A: Oficinayqa hunt'a runalla karqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Oficinaypa kinranpi edifice hatarichikuchkarqan"" suggests that something has happened to an office building, causing it to collapse or fall apart. Option A better fits this scenario as it implies that debris from the collapsed building has been scattered around the area, making it difficult for people to navigate through. Option B does not fit well with the given premise as it only mentions a ""sinchitam ruqyayarqan,"" which could refer to any number of things but does not specifically mention a collapsed building. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the provided information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aylluqa wasimasinkunawan mikhunankupaq mink'arikurqan) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""musuq wasimasinkunata"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, while ""munarqan"" implies a sense of urgency or importance. Therefore, it is more likely that Aylluqa will be searching for something that he has lost rather than simply being absent-minded."
"Response: 
Option A: Wamp'uqmi piscinaman chapukurqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Piscinamanta yaku chaqchururqan,"" it is more likely that the cause of the problem is related to the water in the pool rather than the pool itself. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Pantaruspa rurunta millpurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Huk q'allu sandíata mikhurqani"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up. Option A, ""Pantaruspa rurunta millpurqani,"" means ""The earth will open up and swallow them whole."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it implies a sudden and dramatic event that could potentially reveal what was previously hidden. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Casa nisqanmi k'ichasqa karqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""irqiqa mitk'arqan"" suggests that there are multiple causes for a problem, but the word ""nisqanmi"" in option A implies that one specific cause is being referred to. Additionally, the phrase ""k'ichasqa karqan"" means ""to break something,"" which aligns with the idea of a single cause breaking something. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paywa ruqyaywanmi umanta muyuchikuchkarqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""umanta muyuchikuchkarqan"" suggests that the speaker believes there are many factors contributing to their current situation, rather than a single cause. This implies that the situation is complex and multifaceted, making it less likely that there is a simple solution or cause. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Llapam yakuytam upyarurqani) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""yaku botellayta"" suggests that there may be a leak in the bottle, which could cause the liquid inside to spill or drip out. This is consistent with the idea that the liquid has been leaking from the bottle and onto the table. Option B (Refrigeratorapi waqaycharqani) does not make as much sense in this context, as it implies that the refrigerator is causing the problem rather than the bottle itself."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Q'illi simikunawan rimaq karqanku) is the more likely cause for why Telvisión stopped airing its program. This is because the phrase ""Telvisión pi programa qa qullucharqakun"" suggests that there was a problem with the television station's programming schedule, which could have been caused by various factors such as technical issues or conflicts with other shows. On the other hand, option B (Sasa willayniyuq karqan) does not provide any specific context or reason for why Telvisión stopped airing its program, making it less plausible."
"Response: 
Option A: Wanp'uqkunaqa hiq'iparqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Wamp'unata mama-qucha millpurqan"" suggests that something has been poured into a container, but it does not provide enough information to determine what was poured or how much was poured. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer because it implies that something (wanp'uqkunaqa) was poured into the container without providing any additional details."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Waynaqa musyaymanta tunkiyarqan,"" option A is more likely. The word ""musyaymanta"" means ""to be in a state of confusion or disarray,"" so it is likely that the person will become even more confused if they are exposed to loud noises. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Qhariqa teléfonota qulluchirqan. 
Explanation: The word ""qulluchirqan"" means to hang up or disconnect a phone call. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
A) Ñuqataq makallirqani (The ice will melt)."
"Response: 
Option A: Huñu runaqa museomanta lluqsirqanku. 
This option is more likely because it suggests that the museum is responsible for creating a new exhibit or display related to the huñu culture. The phrase ""huñu runaqa"" means ""huñu knowledge"" in Quechua, and ""museomanta"" means ""museum."" Therefore, this option implies that the museum is actively engaging with and promoting the huñu culture through its exhibits."
"Response: 
Option A: Masiyiqi qharitaqa riqsichiwarqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa ñuqawan kaminakuyta qhallarirqan"" suggests that something has been done to a group of people in order to make them forget their past or history. This could be due to various reasons such as trauma, brainwashing, or manipulation. Therefore, option A, which states ""Masiyiqi qharitaqa riqsichiwarqan,"" is more likely. It implies that the people have forgotten their past or history, which aligns with the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Llantanta punkiyachirqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Bicicletaypa llantanqa chhasayarusqa"" suggests that something has happened to a bicycle's tire, causing it to lose air pressure. Option A, ""Llantanta punkiyachirqani,"" means ""The tire deflated."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response: 
Option A: Lapizwan qillqarqani (The butterfly flapped its wings)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa manukusqaraqmi karqan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Qharimanqa manam qullqitaqa manurqankuchu"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away, and the response ""Payqa manukusqaraqmi karqan"" means ""I will make it up to you."" This implies that the speaker intends to compensate for what was lost or taken away, rather than negotiating a deal. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa varicela unquywanmi karqan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""warmaqa manam escuelaman rirqanchu"" suggests that something has gone wrong in school, and the speaker is trying to find a solution. Option A provides a possible explanation for what could have caused this problem, while option B does not seem to fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response: 
Option A: Contenedorman qhasiyachinapaqmi aparqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qupa churana plasticoqa hunt'am kachkarqan"" suggests that something is being thrown or hurled at a specific target. Option A implies that the contents of a container are being scattered or spilled, which is more in line with the action implied by the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Tiyaqmasiyi mast'ata picharqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Aspiradorawan mast'ata picharqani"" suggests that something has been sucked up by an aspirator. Option A, ""Tiyaqmasiyi mast'ata picharqani,"" means ""The baby spit up on the aspirator."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Computadoranmi wañururqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa waq'ayarparirqan"" suggests that something unexpected or unpredictable has happened. Option A, ""Computadoranmi wañururqan,"" means ""The computer crashed."" This option is more likely to occur given the context of the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Kallmaqa kanarirqan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Warmaqa huch'uy kallmata ninaman wikchurqan,"" it is more likely that the effect of the spell will be to make the target weak or vulnerable rather than strong or powerful. The word ""kallmata"" in Quechua means ""to weaken"" or ""to become weak,"" so option A is the most plausible choice given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Duchamanta qhariqa lluqsirqan,"" option A is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""quñi yakuqa tukurukusqa"" means ""the earth was shaking violently."" Therefore, it is more likely that a seismic event caused by geological activity is the reason for the damage rather than a sudden change in temperature or humidity."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Matriculanankupaq qullqitam waqaycharqanku) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Mamataytaqa wawankuna"" suggests that the speaker's mother has passed away, and the rest of the sentence reinforces this idea by using words like ""munarqanku,"" meaning ""dead."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will matriculate at a university after their mother's death than for them to be alive and enroll in a university with their father."
"Response: 
Option A: Zapatukunaqa wayayachikurqanku. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa zapatonta paskarikurqan"" suggests that something has been done to a group of people in order to make them forget their past or history. Option A, ""Zapatukunaqa wayayachikurqanku,"" means ""They have erased our memories."" This option better fits the context of the premise and is therefore more likely to be true."
"Response: 
Option A: Puchusqantaqa refrigeradorapi waqaychakurqan. 
Explanation: The premise ""Qhariqa wakin mikhunallatam mikhurqan"" suggests that something has been mixed with water, making it difficult to determine its original form or composition. Option A, ""Puchusqantaqa refrigeradorapi waqaychakurqan,"" means ""The mixture was placed in a refrigerator and frozen solid."" This option better fits the given premise as freezing would make it even harder to determine what the original substance was. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option A: Chullunkuwan churakurqani. 
Explanation: The premise ""Chaki muquy p'unkisqa kachkarqan"" suggests that something has been done to a person's hair, making it difficult for them to move their head.

The phrase ""suyanaymi karqan sinripi"" suggests that something has been added or mixed into a substance, which could potentially cause it to become unstable or break down. This aligns with the idea of tiyarikurqani, which means ""to dissolve or disintegrate."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Ch'uspip unyayninqa uyarikurqanraq. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Qhariqa ch'uspita sipirqan,"" meaning that something has been taken away from a place called Qhariqa. The word ""ch'uspita"" means ""to take away."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer because it implies that something was taken away from Qhariqua. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of anything being added or brought into Qhariqua."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Qhariqa testamento nisqata qillqarqan,"" option A is more likely. The word ""nisqata"" in this context means ""to break or destroy."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person's will was broken or destroyed rather than simply not being found."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Payqa phaway atipanakuyta saqirqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""atipanakuyta"" means ""to be in a state of confusion or disarray,"" so it suggests that the person's thoughts are jumbled and difficult to organize. This implies that they may have trouble concentrating or making decisions, leading to a sense of being lost or uncertain about what to do next. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Hukkunapa yachayninkuta mañakurqani. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Sasakaymanta hamut'arqani,"" it is more likely that option A will occur, as ""hukkunapa"" means ""to eat away"" or ""to consume."" Therefore, the sentence ""Hukkunapa yachayninkuta mañakurqani"" translates to ""Eating away the brain cells."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payqa mancharikurqan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""illaq runaqa warkurayaq"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up, and the word ""chakamani"" implies a sense of secrecy or mystery surrounding it.

Therefore, option A is the best answer choice for this question."
"Response: 
Option A: Payqa masinkunawanmi Partido Qhawanapaq Huñunakurqan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Qhariqa ña yacharirqanña equipo llallipananmantaqa (Qhariqa's team will play against a strong opponent).
