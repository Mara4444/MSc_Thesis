Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Získala som lístok) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Termity zmizli z domu) is a more likely outcome than option B (Termity sa prežrali drevom v dome). This is because ""zmizli"" means ""disappeared"" in English, indicating that Termity has vanished without a trace from the house, whereas ""prežrali"" means ""ate through"", which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Strážnik im skontroloval pasy) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""skontroloval"" in this context means ""controlled"", so it suggests that the border guard controlled the passages, rather than accusing someone of smuggling. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kancelária bola zatvorená"", option A (Bolo to sviatky) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hrála šachy) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Dievčaťu došla energie"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual happened to a young girl, and playing chess is an uncommon activity for a child. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what might have caused her energy to increase."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (more people entered the room) is a more likely cause than option B (she got out of the crowd). The premise states that she lost her place in the crowd, indicating that there were other people around her who could have caused this to happen. It is less likely that she would simply get out of the crowd without any explanation as to why she left. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dievča si uštiplo nos) is a more plausible explanation for why the girl's nose was bleeding than option B (Dieťa ji zašpinilo plienku). This is because ""uštiplo"" means to sneeze or blow one's nose forcefully, which could potentially cause injury or bleeding in the nasal passages. In contrast, ""zašpinilo"" means to dirty or soil something, and does not provide a clear explanation for how the girl's nose became bloody. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Diváci tlieskali spolu s hudbou) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dievča zostalo po škole kvôli zadržavaní) is more likely. The word ""zadržavaní"" in Slovak means to detain or hold back, so it's possible that the girl was kept after school for some reason. Option B (Dievča prinieslo učiteľce jablko) doesn't fit with the premise as there is no mention of a gift being given to the teacher."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ich táborový poradca im povedal príbeh o duchovi) is more likely as it suggests that a camp counselor told a story about a ghost, which could be a creepy or eerie experience for young campers. Option B (Pri táborovom ohni si pražili marshmallows) does not provide any context or clues to suggest why the campers are upset, so it is less likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Zabudol sa v myšlinkách) will occur. The phrase ""zabudol sa"" means to get lost in thought or daydreaming, which could cause someone to forget their surroundings and accidentally hit their head on something.

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Vymazal spam) will occur. The passage states that Jeho e-mailová schránka bola plná spamu, indicating that there was a large amount of spam in his email box. Therefore, it makes sense that he would want to delete the spam emails rather than sending mass emails.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ten námorník bol v karanténe,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Bol vystavený chorobě"" (Was exposed to a disease) is true. The word ""karanténa"" typically refers to a quarantine or isolation period, indicating that the person was in close proximity to someone who had fallen ill with a contagious disease. Therefore, it is more probable that they were exposed to the disease rather than having recovered from it."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Recited it herself) is a more plausible explanation for why the girl forgot her code. It's unlikely that she would forget something she wrote down herself.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Voda mi uhasila smád) is more likely to occur as it suggests that water has been poured into a cup, which can be observed and verified. On the other hand, option B (Pohár sa naplnil) does not provide any specific information about what happened to the cup after it was filled with water, making it less likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chcel ponúknuť priateľovi podporu) is more likely. The man wants to offer support to his friend who has ended their relationship, rather than thinking about what his friend said (option B).
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Nehoda bola moja vina,"" option A ""Cítil som sa vinný"" (I felt guilty) is a more likely outcome than option B ""Vydala som žalobu"" (I filed a lawsuit). This is because the word ""vina"" in the premise implies guilt or responsibility, rather than legal action. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker feels guilty about the situation rather than taking legal action against someone else."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the tire was punctured (Option B). The phrase ""reťaz se rozpadla"" means ""the tire burst,"" indicating that the tire was damaged or punctured rather than being wrapped around something else. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They are not interested in compromising) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Najala manažéra kampane) is more likely to be effective in achieving the woman's goal of running for public office. Hiring a manager can provide valuable expertise and resources to help manage a successful campaign, such as developing a campaign strategy, building a strong team, and raising funds. In contrast, suing someone may not directly address the issue of running for public office and could potentially distract from the main goal.

"Response: 

Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the student raised his hand (Option A) than he blushed (Option B). The reason being that raising one's hand is a common response to an question or request for attention, while blushing is a less obvious reaction. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vstúpil mu prach do očí) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's eyes were filled with tears. The other option, option B (Dal si na oči ochranné okuliare), means to put protective eyewear on one's eyes, which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Jeho superju obvinil z podvodu) is more likely to be the correct answer as it implies that his opponent accused him of cheating, which could have led to a loss of confidence in his abilities.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chytil študenta, ako podvádza) is more likely as it implies that the teacher deliberately failed the student's test to punish them for cheating. This is a more plausible explanation given the context of the situation than Option B (Odpovede študenta boli nesprávne), which simply means that the student gave an incorrect answer without any further explanation or motivation.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Stratil som hlas) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker was unable to speak. This is because ""zastavil"" in this context means ""stopped,"" implying that something or someone prevented the speaker from speaking. In contrast, ""zostalo mi dych"" means ""I lost my breath,"" which would not necessarily explain why the speaker was unable to speak. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Dal som ho do mikrovlnnej rúry) caused the dish to become overcooked. This is because microwaving can heat food quickly and unevenly, leading to overcooking or undercooking. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the dish became mrazené jedlo sa roztopil.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mal kŕčežálúdka) is the cause of Zamestnanec's illness. This is because the phrase ""mal kŕče"" means ""bad stomach,"" which suggests that Zamestnanec may be experiencing digestive problems or discomfort. Option B (Chcel deň volna) does not provide any clues about the possible cause of Zamestnanec's illness."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The day of the movie's premiere) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A (People isolated him). 
Explanation: The premise states that ten men will fall ill, implying a widespread outbreak or epidemic. Given this context, it is more likely that people would isolate themselves from the sick individuals rather than complimenting them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Vylezla na lano) is a more plausible explanation for why Ruky diedievča's face turned red because it suggests that she got angry or upset enough to jump off a cliff, leading to her death. Option A (Napísala list) does not provide any logical reason as to why Ruky's face would turn red in this scenario. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Akrobat sa prehodil z trapezu) is more likely. The premise suggests that the performer was juggling while driving a unicycle, which implies a high level of skill and balance required to maintain control over both the vehicle and the objects being juggled. It is less likely that the audience would be amazed by someone simply standing on one leg without any additional acrobatic feats.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Môj priateľ ma nechal čakať"" (My friend left me waiting), option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Vyvinuli jadrové zbrane) is more likely to be the correct answer as it suggests that they used military force to achieve their goal of uniting the country under one government. This aligns with the idea of ""might makes right"" and the use of force to assert dominance over others."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Začal sa mu dávať spánok) is more likely to occur. The reason being that when someone takes a sleeping pill, they are likely to fall asleep rather than experience a headache.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Noha pohovky sa uvolnila) is more likely to occur than option B (Zrala si koleno). This is because the word ""narazila"" implies a sudden or unexpected impact, which would be less likely to cause injury to someone's knee than a gradual release of tension in their back. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chlapcek stlačil balon,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Balón sa praskol"" (The ball burst) will occur. "
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Rozbalili si kufre) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja som sa do toho zahryzol,"" option A (Breskňa je poškodená) is more likely. The word ""poškodená"" suggests that something has been damaged or harmed, which aligns with the idea of a fire causing damage. Option B (""Vylial sa z nieho džús"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""He jumped out of him juice."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moje ruky sa mi zľavnili,"" it is more likely that option A (Zjedla som šišku) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""moje ruky"" means ""my hands,"" and the word ""zľavnili"" means ""fell off."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that something happened to the speaker's hands, which could be caused by eating a hard or sticky object like a walnut (šiška in Slovak). Option B (""Mal som sladký zub"") means ""I had a sweet tooth,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Zatlačil som dvere"", it is more likely that option A: ""Dvere sa otvorili"". This is because the verb ""zatlači"" means to push or press, which implies a forceful action that could potentially open the door."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Výrobky boli vyrobené pomocou detskej práce) is the more likely cause. The activists are boycotting products made with child labor, indicating that the product was produced using unethical means. Option A (Výrobky boli testované na zabezpečenie kvality) does not provide any information about the production methods used, so it cannot be determined if the product was made ethically or not.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jej sestra bola šťastná) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Dala som si zásteru) will occur. The word ""záster"" means a headache or a migraine in Slovak, so if someone has taken too much alcohol, they might experience a headache as a result. Option B (Zmenil som si košeľu) does not make sense in this context, as changing one's wine cellar would not cause a headache. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zákazník mu prehľadel peňaženku) is more likely as it implies that the customer searched through the cashier's purse without permission. Option B (Zákazník ji dal peniaze) means that the customer gave money to the cashier, which doesn't align with the given premise.
"Response:  Option A (Ľudia mu dávali drobné).
Explanation: According to the premise, the musician was able to attract a crowd with his playing. People in the crowd were giving him small amounts of money as tips or donations, which suggests that they were enjoying his performance and wanted to show their appreciation financially. This is more likely than option B, where the crowd would have been so impressed by the musician's skills that they would have given him larger sums of money without being asked."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that his parents are not around (Option A). The phrase ""chlapec plakal na swoju opatrovateľku"" suggests that the child is crying for his caregiver, who may be a parent or guardian. Without any additional context, it seems unlikely that the child would be hungry (Option B) as there is no indication of time passing or any other factors that might suggest he has been away from home for an extended period. Therefore, Option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Radar pilot caught a burka,"" option A (Pilot was thrown off) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Strom strhol listy,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Listy sa zmenili na farby"" (The clouds changed color). This is a common phenomenon in weather conditions where clouds can change their appearance due to various factors such as temperature changes or humidity levels. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The sentence ""Rozhodol se hrať na svoju sestru"" means ""He decided to play against his sister"", indicating that he will be playing a game with his sister as an opponent. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dieťa posypalo do nádrže rybiek,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Ryby vyskočili z nádrže,"" is correct. The word ""posypalo"" means ""to pour"" or ""to dump,"" indicating that something was put into the tank, rather than something coming out of it. Therefore, it is unlikely that the fish jumped out of the tank."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Zmenila svoju politickú príslušnosť) is a more likely outcome than option B (Zapojil sa do protestu). This is because changing one's political affiliation requires a significant shift in beliefs and values, whereas participating in a protest is a more immediate and public act that may not necessarily indicate a long-term change in political views.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Zapol som kohútik) will occur. The word ""kohútik"" means ""dirty"", so it suggests that the floor in the bathroom was dirty. Therefore, option A is a plausible explanation for why the floor in the bathroom was wet."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vlak prišel na stanici) is more likely. The train arrived at the station, indicating that it had reached its destination. Zazvonit (to ring) does not align with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dal pečiatku na obálku) is more likely to occur because it implies that the man pressed something soft onto the wet surface of the envelope, rather than breaking or damaging it as suggested by option B (Zavrel obálku).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They used to have contact) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (She was distracted from her work) is the correct answer. The phrase ""zle spravoval"" means ""distracted from"" or ""not paying attention to"", which suggests that she was not focused on her work and may have been preoccupied with something else."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Počul som tikať hodiny) is a more plausible cause than option B (Chcel som sa pozrieť na čas). The sentence ""Pozrel som sa na hodiny"" means ""I looked at the clock,"" so it suggests that the speaker was actively looking at the clock rather than simply wanting to be late. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Moja žena a ja sme sa držali za ruky) is more likely as it provides additional context that supports the idea of holding hands. Option A (Tú esej som napísal ručne) does not provide any additional information to support this inference. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vymenil som šroub) is a more plausible explanation for why the key won't turn in the lock. This is because ""šroub"" means ""lock"" in Slovak, so it suggests that there may be an issue with the lock itself rather than the key. Option B (Otočil som kľúč) implies that the key has been damaged or worn down, which could also prevent it from turning in the lock, but this is not as directly related to the problem described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The couple was evicted from their apartment) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chcela vidieť západ slnka) is more likely as it suggests that the woman wants to see the sunset, which is a common activity for people to enjoy during their free time. The second option (Myslela si, что vidí blesk) means ""She thought she saw a flash"" and does not provide any context or reason why the woman would want to see a flash of light. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nevedel plávať) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ten men were unable to swim, indicating that they lacked the necessary skill or ability to swim in water. This suggests that the water was not particularly calm or easy to navigate, making it less likely that the water was simply ""plywood"" and more likely that the men were unable to swim due to a lack of skill or experience."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A - ""Vymazala ten document"" occurred. The woman made a mistake in her computer's text editor by deleting the document instead of pressing Backspace to correct the error."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dievča sa chválilo pred svojimi priateľmi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""chválilo"" means ""to boast,"" so it's possible that the girl was bragging about her accomplishments in front of her friends, leading them to give her a bad reputation. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trávnik bol bahnitý,"" option A (Pršalo cez noc) is the more likely cause. The word ""bahnitý"" means wet or damp in Slovak, so it is likely that the garden was wet overnight due to rain rather than being full of bugs."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that she overslept (Option A) than that she forgot to set her alarm clock (Option B). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sedel v tieni) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the man sat in a chair or sofa, rather than going outside to the beach.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Výskumníci túto teóriu stiahli) is more likely. The sentence implies that researchers have successfully proven this theory, indicating a positive outcome. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the game started before the referee's signal) is more likely as the reason for the goal not being counted. This is because in football, the referee must give a clear signal to start play before the ball can be played, and if the signal is given before the ball has been kicked or touched by a player, then the goal will not be counted. Therefore, it is possible that the referee gave the signal too early, resulting in the goal not being counted.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zatvoril som zámok) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Vložil som kombináciu na zámok,"" which means he put a combination on the lock. This implies that the lock was already locked, so it's unlikely that the lock would open by itself. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Otec dal synovi najake peniaze) is a more likely outcome than option B (Otec chytil syna za ruku). This is because the word ""dal"" in Czech means ""gave"", while ""chytil"" means ""grabbed"". Therefore, it is more likely that the father gave his son some money rather than grabbing him by the hand."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (zhromaždila som sneh do snežnej gule) is more likely to occur as it suggests that she has packed snow into a hole, which could potentially block the path. Option B (odstrálil som sneh) means ""I cleared the snow"" and does not suggest any action that would block the path. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kajakisti veslili veslá,"" option A is more likely. The word ""veslili"" means to row in Czech, so it's likely that the speaker is referring to the kayaker being blown by the wind rather than hitting a wave."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Narazila do plotu) is more likely to occur as it implies a physical collision with an obstacle, whereas option A (Pustila rukoväť) only suggests losing control of the bike without any external cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Na kožu mi prštila voda) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the speaker felt something cool on their skin, which suggests that water may have been splashed onto them. Option B (Cítil som, ako mi prechádza chladný vzduch) does not provide any specific details or clues about what the speaker might have experienced.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the beachgoers were filled with sand) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""surfers returned to the beach"" suggests that they had been away from the beach for some time, and the fact that they are now returning implies that they have been filled with sand during their absence. There is no mention of a shark sighting in the premise, so option B (they saw a shark) is less likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Voda vyšla z vane) is more likely. The word ""vyšla"" means ""came out"", so it suggests that water came out of the hole, rather than spreading or flowing onto the floor. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he accused her of infidelity (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Čakal som, kým sa atramentvyschne) is a more plausible explanation for why the ink has spread unevenly on the paper than option B (Na plagát som vylial vodu). This is because the word ""čakal"" means to dry or evaporate, which suggests that the ink may have dried unevenly due to lack of even distribution of moisture. In contrast, option B implies that the ink was applied too heavily onto the paper, which could result in an uneven spread. Therefore, option A is the better answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dieťa sa zobudilo a kričelo,"" option A, ""Mal nočnú moru"" (The child woke up crying) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that his father sat down at the table (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kričala som jeho meno) is a more likely cause than option B (Mahol som rukami). The phrase ""moj priateľ sa otočil smerom ku mne"" suggests that my friend turned towards me, which could be interpreted as an act of attention or interest. Therefore, it is more likely that I called out his name in excitement or surprise rather than waving at him with my hands."
Response:  Option A: Občania sa vzbúrili.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he cried for help (Option B). The phrase ""chlapec sa stratil v lese"" suggests that a young boy has fallen into a forest, which could be a dangerous situation. It is natural to assume that he would cry out for help in this scenario rather than simply posting a stand."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Chcela sa dozvedieť o iných cultúrach) is more likely. The woman's desire to learn about other cultures suggests that she may be interested in exploring new ideas and experiences beyond her own cultural background. This aligns with the definition of ""cultural curiosity"" as a motivation for traveling abroad."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his spolupracovník received a promotion) is more likely as the reason for his irritability.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mal had hallucinations) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Ten muž bol svedkom mimozemšťanov"" suggests that something unusual or supernatural occurred, which aligns with the idea of hallucinations. Additionally, there is no mention of meditation in the premise, which further supports Option A as the most likely explanation."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Dal dido toho bielidlo) caused the men's hair to turn green. This is because ""mužovi sa zafarbili vlasy"" means ""the men dyed their hair,"" indicating that they intentionally changed its color. In contrast, ""dal do toho bielidlo"" means ""he added something to it,"" which could refer to an accidental or unintentional change in color. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the men's hair turned green."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (criticized her previous work) is more likely to be the correct answer. The text states that Umelkyňa created new works, implying that she was feeling inspired or motivated to create something new. However, the phrase ""vytvorila nové deli"" could also imply that she was building upon or improving upon existing works, rather than creating entirely new ones. Therefore, it is more likely that she criticized her previous work rather than felt inspired by it."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Syn was discharged from the army) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (políčky boli pokryté prachom) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Políčky boli pokryté prachom"" suggests that the books were covered in dust, which could have caused them to be removed from the library. Option B (""Zemtrasyne otriaslo knižnu poličku"") does not provide any evidence or context to support the idea that the books were removed from the library. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zapol som svetlo) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the light will turn on when the electricity goes out in my home. This implies a causal relationship between the two events, with the loss of power leading to the activation of the light. Option B (Zresetoval som vypínač), on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as it means ""The reset button has turned off the switch."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jazdil som na horských dráhach,"" option A (Vyzeralo to desivé) is more likely. The word ""desivé"" means ""difficult"" or ""steep"" in English, which aligns with the idea of traveling on mountainous roads. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker encountered difficult conditions while driving on those roads."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (I poured oil into the popcorn) caused the mess. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (V suspended tree fell an electric line) is a more likely explanation for why the power went out than option B (Strong winds caused the power to go out). This is because the falling of a tree onto an electrical line would directly cause the loss of power in that area, whereas strong winds may not necessarily affect the power grid directly.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the speaker nudged (Option A) rather than offended (Option B) the audience. The term ""politically incorrect"" suggests that the speaker made comments that were not in line with current political correctness standards, but did not necessarily intend to harm or offend anyone. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given scenario."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Z tváre mi kapalo trochu potu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""z tváre"" means ""from the face,"" and ""kapalo"" means ""sweat."" So, it suggests that the speaker is experiencing sweating from their face, which is a common symptom of anxiety or stress. Option B (""Na mojom prste sa vytvorila kvapka krvi"") means ""On my finger appeared a drop of blood,"" which is less likely based on the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ryby plály na povrchu nádrže"", it is more likely that option A - ""Balo hladné"" (It was cold) - is the correct answer. The word ""hladné"" suggests a low temperature, which could explain why the fish are swimming near the surface of the tank."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mal nádchu) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's voice has become hoarse. This means that he may have had a cold or some other respiratory infection that caused his vocal cords to become inflamed and produce less sound than usual. Option B (Prestal fajčiť) does not make as much sense in this context, as it implies that something inside the man's throat has been damaged or blocked, causing his voice to change.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Výťah prišel na určené poschodie) is more likely. The word ""určené"" in the premise suggests that there was a specific floor or level where the noise came from, which aligns with Option A. Option B does not provide any information about the location of the noise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - Klamal svojim rodičom - is the correct answer. The phrase ""vykradol z domu"" (stole from home) suggests that something valuable or important has been taken away without permission, which could be interpreted as a lie or deception to cover up the true circumstances of the missing item(s). Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's parents might think they are responsible for losing their valuables."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Kúpeľňapreplavila) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Kúpeľňa bola zaplavená"" implies that water has flooded or covered something, which supports option A. Option B does not provide any context to explain why the water would have flooded the area, making it less likely as an explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Majiteľ dal šteniatku obojok) is more likely. The word ""obojok"" in this context suggests that the owner gave the cat to someone else, rather than holding it on a leash. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muž zachytil svůj odraz,"" it is more likely that he was standing under a large tree (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zavolal som jej späť) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker called back their friend's number, which aligns with the context of the situation. Option B (Stretol som sa s ní na večeri) does not make sense in this scenario as there is no indication that the speaker had plans with her friend for the evening.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Z ich domu zmizli draché šperky) is more likely as it provides a specific example of something that could have happened while Rodina was away from home. The other option (Ich pes utiekol z domu) does not provide any context or evidence to suggest why Rodina might be looking around outside her house.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Videl som svoj dych, keď som vydychaval,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""chladné"" means cold, so it is likely that the speaker felt cold when they were vomiting."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Zamestnanci založili odbor) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the phrase ""založili odbor"" implies a collective action taken by employees to address their working conditions, rather than an individual decision made by one's employer to increase salary. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (V kuchyni sa rozlievala teplá vôňa) is more likely. The sentence suggests that a pleasant smell was filling the kitchen, rather than an unpleasant one like in Option A (V kuchyni zapáchal hnilobný zápach).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mala vysoké podpátky) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman was having trouble walking. This is because high heels are known to be uncomfortable and can make it difficult to walk properly, especially if one is not used to wearing them. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zhrnca s vodou vystupovala,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Voda sa zohriala"" (The water boiled) is the correct answer. The word ""zohriala"" means ""boiled"", which suggests that the water in the kettle has reached its boiling point."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Všetky moje ponožky boli v práčovne,"" it is more likely that Option A (Mal som sandál) is correct. The word ""sandál"" means ""shoe"" in English, so if all of one's shoes are hurting in the trash can, it is likely that they are experiencing foot pain or discomfort."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Stratila podporu voličov) is more likely. The argument that politics is absurd implies that the politician's actions are not based on rational thinking or logic, but rather on other factors such as personal gain or popularity. Therefore, it is more likely that they would manipulate public opinion to gain support rather than being accused of corruption.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the couple will have a baby (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Milionár chcel, aby budovu zrútili) is more likely. The fact that a millionaire would want to demolish a building suggests that he may have had personal reasons for doing so, such as wanting to build something new in its place or simply not liking the existing structure. It's less likely that he would provide financial support for the construction of the building without any ulterior motive.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Obchodný zástupca videl dievča, ako si dával tovar do kabelky) is more likely. The phrase ""obchodný zástupca"" suggests that the person in question is an employee of a store or business, and the fact that they saw the girl taking something from the store implies that they witnessed her stealing. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the merchant accused the girl of shoplifting."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vojaci boli poslaní do boja) is more likely. The premise states that Krajina has declared war on its neighboring territory, indicating that there will be fighting involved. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Súd potvrdil kontroverzný rozsudok) suggests that there was a controversial verdict delivered by the court, leading to unrest among the public. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dievča cítilo niečo horiace,"" option A is more likely. The word ""horiace"" suggests something unpleasant or disturbing, so it's more likely that the girl took something from her bag to calm herself down rather than leaving food uneaten in her room."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Búrka sa zhoršila) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""pršalo"" in the premise suggests that something has become worse or deteriorated, which aligns with the meaning of ""zhoršila"". Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option B: Zvonil požiarny alarm caused the building to be evacuated. The mention of a fire alarm suggests that there was an emergency situation that required immediate action, such as evacuating the building to prevent injury or damage. Therefore, Option B is the most likely cause for why the building was evacuated.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B: Otec vyhodil syna z domu will occur. The father is angry with his son because of the latter's alcoholism, which suggests a strong negative emotion towards him. As a result, it is more plausible that the father would want to distance himself from his son or even kick him out of the house rather than buying him beer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sekretářka odišla domov) is a more plausible explanation for why the lawyer's secretary left her office than option B (Výťah bol mimo prevádzky). The phrase ""odišla schodmi"" suggests that she walked out of the office, whereas ""mimo prevádzky"" means outside or beyond the passageway. Therefore, it is more likely that she simply left the office through the main door rather than going around the back."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jeho priateľ ho prerušil) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the man got angry at his friend. The other option does not provide any plausible reason for the man's anger.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dievča odovzdalo svoje peniaze pokladnici) suggests that the girl gave her money to the treasurer. Therefore, option A is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (She was paralyzed in an accident) is a more likely cause for why a woman might be placed in a wheelchair than option B (She went to the hospital on a stretcher). This is because being paralyzed in an accident would typically result in long-term mobility issues that would require the use of a wheelchair, whereas going to the hospital on a stretcher could indicate a temporary injury or illness that may not necessarily lead to permanent disability.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Krajina si pripomínala svoju nezávislost) is the more likely cause for why people took down their national flags from their homes. This is because the passage states that ""people had taken down their national flags from their homes"" as a way of remembering their independence. Therefore, it is more likely that the reason for taking down the flags was to commemorate and honor their country's independence rather than due to economic hardships."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sklamali svojich fanúšikov) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the band's poor performance caused their fans to be disappointed or disillusioned with them, rather than inspiring them.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker felt uncomfortable (Option A). The phrase ""mám jedlo uviazané v zuboch"" means ""I have food stuck in my teeth,"" which would be a source of discomfort or embarrassment for the speaker. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option A (V triede dál pozor) is a more plausible explanation for why Chlapci zlyhal na skúške z histórie than option B (Zabudol se učit). This is because the passage states that Chlapci were unable to learn from history, indicating that they lacked attention or focus rather than being uninterested in learning. Therefore, it is more likely that they failed their exams due to distraction or lack of concentration rather than simply not trying hard enough.
Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option A (Zematrasenie zasiahlo mesto) is a more plausible explanation for why there are fewer crimes committed in the city center than before. This is because the construction of the new building has created a physical barrier that separates the city center from the rest of the town, making it more difficult for criminals to access the area. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she will take him back (Option A).
Response:  Option A - Lopta sa odvalila.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (V odpadkovém koši bola lepenka) is true. The fact that there was a stench coming from the trash can suggests that something rotting or decaying was inside it, which aligns with Option A. On the other hand, Option B does not provide any specific details to support the idea that something was inside the trash can. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for the smell coming from the trash can.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the boy will get a stick (bolo) than he will get a penny (lacné). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Stratila svoju potvrdenie) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Pokladnička odmietla vrátiť peniaze"" implies that she refused to return the money, so it makes sense that she would have to provide some sort of explanation or justification for her actions. Therefore, option A is a more plausible choice."
Response:  Option A (Rychlo sa to uzdravilo)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Díval sa na zemi) occurred. The text states ""mužovi sa v vlaku divne pozerali,"" indicating that they were looking at something in the train, and then specifies what they saw (""pozerali cestujúcy""). There is no indication in the premise that the man was talking to himself, so option B (Hovoril sám so sebou) is less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mravce sa plazili po drobkach) is more likely. The word ""drobná"" in the premise suggests small objects or particles, which could be easily navigated by insects like ants. Therefore, it's more probable that ants are moving around the small objects rather than a child putting them aside."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sestra též sklánala ruky) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is describing a common action of sisters showing affection towards each other by holding hands.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mal roztrhnuté pery) is a more plausible cause for why ten men took the mint. This is because ""roztrhnuté pery"" means ""broken legs,"" which could be interpreted as a physical limitation that would prevent someone from taking something like a mint. Therefore, it is more likely that the men were unable to take the mint due to their broken legs than them being afraid of getting bad luck."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Pred vídali premáku okolo divadla) is a more likely cause for why they are standing outside the theatre. It makes sense that they might have expected the performance to start around the time they arrived, rather than having a specific destination in mind like going into the theatre directly (option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Jej spolupracovník ju kryl) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that her colleague is trying to cover up for her mistake rather than praising her.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mal strach z javiska) is more likely to be the cause of the player's heart breaking apart before their execution. This is because the phrase ""pred his vystúpením"" suggests that the event occurred before the player's execution, implying that it happened earlier in time. The fear of being executed could have caused the player's heart to break apart at some point prior to the actual execution. Option B (Naučil sa svoje repliky naspamäť) does not fit with this interpretation as it implies that the player learned how to remember their responses after the fact, rather than beforehand."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Spočítala som si peniaze) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Bolo to zjesené) will occur. The phrase ""Zrelé ovocie sa na slnku zdržiavalo"" suggests that the eggs were exposed to sunlight for a long time, which could cause them to become overripe or rotten. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (Zapol som to) is the more likely cause of the car's sudden acceleration. The phrase ""Auto sa pokazilo"" suggests that the car's computer system has detected a problem with the engine or transmission, leading to unintended acceleration. This is consistent with the idea that there was an electrical failure or malfunction within the car's systems, rather than a mechanical issue with the motor itself. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he was at a psychiatrist (Option A). The reason for this is that the phrase ""u blížil se k psychiatrovi"" suggests that he went to see a psychiatrist, implying that he may have been experiencing mental health issues or seeking help for them. On the other hand, Option B does not provide any specific explanation for why he might have been lying in bed for several days, leaving it open to interpretation. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, option A (Nemal som drevo na oheň) is more likely to be the correct answer as it mentions ""nemal"" which means ""did not light"" indicating that the fire did not start by itself, while option B (V dome bola zima) simply states that there was winter in the house without providing any context or evidence to suggest that this caused the fire."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Má kŕče v boku) is the correct answer. The phrase ""presta bežať"" suggests that something has stopped or ceased to happen, which could indicate that the woman's running has come to an end. Having a baby in one's body would be a significant reason for this to occur. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Moj sused ma pozval dnu) is true. The sentence structure and word choice suggest a sense of urgency or importance, which aligns with the idea of someone knocking on one's door. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Her husband did not understand her problems) is more likely to be the cause of her frustration. The sentence ""Vzala se s frustrácií"" suggests that she is feeling frustrated, and the phrase ""s nimi nepochopil"" implies that her husband did not understand or empathize with her problems. Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Študent správne odpovedal na otázku) is more likely as it suggests that the student gave a correct answer to the question, which aligns with the teacher's praise.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she went to the farm (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Odhalila som mu tajomstvo) is more likely. The word ""odhalila"" means to reveal or uncover something, so it suggests that the speaker discovered a secret about their old friend. Option B (Objala som ho) means to attack someone, so it doesn't fit with the context of discovering a secret."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chytila rybu) is more likely. The premise suggests that the woman was avoiding going into the lake, but then she caught a fish, indicating that she did eventually go in. Option B (Vyzeralo to kontaminované) does not fit with this interpretation as it implies that something went wrong or contaminated the water, rather than the woman actually entering it.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mal rozbitý dáždnik) is a more likely cause for why a student came to school wet than option B (Ukradli mu bicykel). This is because it is unlikely that someone would steal a bicycle from a student without any explanation as to how they got there, especially if the student is already wet. It is much more plausible that the student accidentally spilled something or fell in a puddle while walking to school. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option B (the user moved the mouse) is a more likely cause for why the image on the screen changed. Therefore, the answer is Option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Na hlavnej ceste sa stala nehoda) is more likely. The sentence ""On the main road, an accident occurred"" suggests that there was a sudden event or incident that caused the truck to crash, rather than something that happened gradually over time, such as following another vehicle."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the plášť (dish towel) has dried out (Option A). The word ""vyschla"" in Czech means ""dried up"". Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Slnečné svetlo bolo jasné) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman's eyesight improved after she put in contact lenses. The other option (Zavolala si taxík) does not provide any logical explanation for how the woman's eyesight improved.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muž sa pozrel na nočnú oblohu,"" option A is more likely. The man wished it were summer rather than thinking that was beautiful."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Išla som spať skoro) is a more likely answer as it implies that the speaker was feeling tired and wanted to sleep soon after being awake for a long time.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muž šiel k holičovi,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""Jeho vlasy sa mu predĺžili"" means ""His hair got tangled."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chlapec privítal nového spolužiaka) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker will peel off the potatoes (Option B). The word ""pecal"" in Czech means to peel or skin something, so this option makes sense in the context of the sentence. Option A does not make as much sense, as ""jedol"" means to boil or cook something, but it doesn't necessarily imply that the speaker will eat the potatoes."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Začalo pršať"", option A is more likely. The word ""pršať"" means to start raining, so it's likely that the driver will encounter wet roads ahead. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A - ""Mala spisovateľskú blokádu"" (She forgot to submit her proposal) is the correct answer. The text states that the authoress missed the deadline for submitting her proposal, indicating a forgetfulness or lack of organization rather than actively editing or revising the proposal."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Chcela som hovoriť s nadriadeným) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""chcela som hovoriť"" suggests that the speaker wanted to talk to someone specific, in this case, a supervisor or manager. Option B does not provide any context for why the speaker would give their identification number to someone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vánok fúkal cez otvorené okno,"" option A (Zvonil zvonček) is more likely to occur because it implies a sudden noise that could startle someone looking out of an open window."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the light bulb blew) caused the power to go out in my house. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zmäkol sa pred zrkadlom) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Zvyšovač váh zavrčal"" suggests that something heavy was lifted or moved upwards, which could potentially cause someone's head to bounce off a ceiling or other hard surface. Option B (Zdvihol tyč nad hlavu) does not make sense in this context as it implies that someone's head would be stuck under a stick or other object, which is unlikely given the information provided. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened based on the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Zmýlil sa) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The student tried to do a calculation in his head but ended up making a mistake, which is a common occurrence when trying to perform complex mental math calculations without proper training or practice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Otec zmenil bábетку plienku) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""zmenil"" in Czech means ""changed,"" so it suggests that the father changed the baby's diaper rather than simply waking up the child."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Chlapec mal otras mozgu) is more likely to occur because it implies that the boy will get hurt or injured by the ball. The phrase ""mal otras mozgu"" means ""hurt others,"" so it suggests a negative outcome for the boy. Option B (Chlapec sa namočil) does not convey any specific meaning related to injury or harm, so it is less likely to occur based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (photos were blurry) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Odmietla som pozvanie na nacional'nú oslavu,"" it is more likely that the speaker was invited to a national celebration. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cvičil som sa,"" option A is more likely. The correct answer is: Cítil som sa energický."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vypchala vodu) is more likely to occur because it suggests that water will come out of the sponge, rather than the sponge absorbing water from somewhere else.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the hotel was exhausted) is the correct answer. The phrase ""dostali na trajekt"" suggests that the guests arrived at a port or harbor, which implies that they were traveling by boat. This makes it unlikely that they were staying on an island, as there would be no need to take a boat to get to an island where their accommodation was located. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Mala strach z ihly) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""mala strach"" means ""little fear,"" which suggests that the person may have a minor or slight fear of getting tattooed. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why someone might be hesitant about getting a tattoo."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Started to have a look) is more likely. The speaker seems to be curious about the unknown car parked in front of their house and wants to take a closer look. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dôkazy ho do toho zaplietli) is more likely. The phrase ""sa sám vzdala"" suggests that the criminal has confessed to the crime, implying that there are already evidence or proof of their guilt. Therefore, it is less likely that they would be acquitted without any evidence against them."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zrušil sladkosti) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the man has stopped consuming sweet foods or drinks, which could potentially lead to weight loss.

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Zostávala hore celú noc) is the correct answer. The phrase ""pod očami krúžky"" suggests that someone was watching her closely, implying that she was being followed or spied upon. This could have caused her to be exhausted from being awake all night. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the woman might have been tired."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Vulkan vybuchol) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Z sopky prúdila láva"" suggests that there was an eruption of a volcano, which would result in lava flowing out of it. This is consistent with the idea of a volcanic eruption causing damage to nearby areas. Option B (""Vulkan bol v spaní"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""The volcano was sleeping"", which contradicts the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A ( Poznala všetkého na té party) is more likely. The woman recognized everyone at the party, indicating that she was familiar with the people there.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ne let her go through the ticket gate) is more likely to happen. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is describing an action that is being taken or about to be taken, rather than something that has already happened. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will allow someone to pass through the ticket gate rather than holding them back.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Predal akcie svojej spoločnosti) is the correct answer. The phrase ""riaditeľ zbankrotoval"" suggests that the CEO of a company has failed or lost his job due to the bankruptcy of the company. This implies that he may have sold his shares in the company as a way to raise funds or pay off debts. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Doctor was on vacation (Option A). The reason for this is that there are no other clues or hints in the premise to suggest otherwise. Therefore, Option A is the best answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Dom horel) is correct. The sentence ""Vystúpil som z mojej spálne cez okno"" implies that something came out of my broken window, which suggests that there was an object or person that left through the window after it broke. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dlhý čas sa sprchoval) is a more plausible explanation for why the boy's hands were covered in mud than option B (Opláchol si ruky mydlom). The phrase ""sprchoval"" suggests that something was poured or splashed onto the boy's hands, rather than him intentionally covering them with mud. Therefore, option A is the better choice."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vplížil sa cez otvorené okno) is more likely. The fact that the child is locked out of his home suggests that he entered through an open window, rather than climbing up to the roof from outside. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Návštevník zaklopal na dvere) is more likely. The word ""zaklopal"" means to knock or bang, so it's likely that a visitor actually knocked on the door rather than just looking at it through the window."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Let him wash himself) will occur. The reason being that the context of the situation suggests that the person in question may not have had time or opportunity to clean themselves properly beforehand, so they would need to take care of their personal hygiene after getting dirty. Option B (Obesil him into a shroud) doesn't make much sense in this scenario as it implies wrapping someone in a cloth without any logical explanation, which goes against the flow of the story.
Response:  Option A - Zubna pasta vyšla z trubice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Pacifists had a leader) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""počet civilních obětí vo vojne vzrostol,"" indicating an increase in civilian deaths during war, which suggests a larger-scale conflict with multiple casualties. Having a leader among pacifists would suggest that they were organized and had a clear direction or goal, rather than simply being a disorganized group of individuals protesting without a unified purpose."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ona zaviazala stuhu) is more likely as it implies that she intentionally removed the thread from her hair. Option B (Na stužce to vyzeralo ako dieťa) does not make sense in this context as it suggests that something resembling a child grew out of the thread, which is absurd. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zostarol) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ten men are having a plastic surgery procedure, which implies that they are undergoing some form of transformation or change. This could potentially result in them looking older, but it's also possible that they may look younger after the surgery. However, given the context of the premise, it seems more likely that they will appear older as a result of the plastic surgery.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Z vajíčka vyšlo kurčiatko,"" option A (Vajíčko sa vyliahlo) is the more likely cause. This is because the word ""vyšlo"" in Czech means ""came out"" or ""emerged"", which implies that something has already happened to the egg. Option B (""Rozbil som vajce"") means ""I broke the eggs,"" which suggests that the event occurred before the egg came out of the nest. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Option A: Zomrel.

The wording of the premise suggests that something has happened to the man's balance on the seesaw, implying that he may have fallen off. Option A (Vystúpil po rebríku) does not convey this same sense of imbalance or fall. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dal si pohárik sody) is a more likely cause than option B (Otvoril plechovku s limonádou). This is because the word ""vyvrelo"" suggests that something has come out or been spilled, which is more consistent with the idea of drinking from a bottle than opening a can of soda."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Uvoľnil som sa) is correct. The word ""chladný"" in the premise means cold, so it is possible that something cold entered through a window. Option B (""Trasila som sa"") does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeju spolužiaci ju rešpektovali) is more likely as it suggests that the student's peers respected him/her for receiving a scholarship, whereas option B (Mala dobré známky) means ""Good grades"" in English, which doesn't necessarily imply any special recognition or respect from peers."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She was next to him) is a more likely cause than option B (She was in love with him).

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Podnecoval k súcitu) is a more likely cause for why the hungry thief stole food. The phrase ""podnecoval k súcitu"" means to become angry or irritated, suggesting that the thief may have been motivated by hunger rather than lack of money. Therefore, option A is the better choice."

The phrase ""Zavolal som priateľovi"" suggests that someone called a friend, implying a social interaction or connection.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Potriasol som mu rukou) is more likely to be the correct response. The word ""potriasol"" means ""to hold someone's hand"" in Icelandic, so this option suggests that the speaker might be holding the other person's hand. Option B (""Udrel som ho"") does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to be the correct response."

Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option B (Bol to začiatok nového mesiaca) is a more likely cause for why there are no entries in the calendar. This is because it states that it was the beginning of a new month, indicating that the person may have started a new calendar for this month rather than continuing an existing one.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kľakol som na zem) is a more plausible explanation for why the cat is sitting comfortably than option B (Zabalila som sa do deky). The phrase ""Cítil som sa pohodlne"" suggests that the cat feels comfortable or relaxed, which could be due to its position on the ground rather than being in a high place like a deck. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vyleštel som kameň"" (I threw a stone), option A is more likely. The sentence structure and verb tense suggest that the action of throwing a stone was completed in the past, making it less likely for the effect to be ""Stalo sa to lesklým"" (It became flat).

Therefore, it is more likely that the hřebík would sink into the wood rather than splitting it open."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Rybár sa Zamotál V Rybu) is more likely. The verb ""zamotat"" means ""to swallow"", so it suggests that the fisherman will actually eat the fish he catches.

This is because the word ""chyba"" (mistake) suggests that there was an error or failure on the part of the speaker, rather than simply achieving their goal. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker did not get what they wanted due to their own mistake or fault, rather than having achieved their goal through some other means."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She started talking about herself) is more likely. 
Explanation: The premise states that the woman started talking about herself, indicating that she was the one who brought up the topic of herself rather than her partner. Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given information."

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (The ship exploded above the bay) occurred.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vkročil do kaluže) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""nohu"" in Czech means ""foot"", so it's possible that one of the men stepped into a puddle or something similar. Option B (""Šlápl na rozbité sklo"") doesn't make as much sense in this context, as it would mean ""He fell onto broken glass""."
"Response:  Option A - Zistili identitu vraha.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that detectives will identify the killer rather than find the weapon used in the crime.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Došiel mi benzín,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""sa ocitol na ceste"" means ""he ran into a road.""

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dieťa bolo na svete) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Dieťa bolo na svete"" means ""The child was born,"" indicating that a baby has been born. This is a common and expected outcome for a woman who becomes pregnant. Option B (""Žena mala rannú nevoľnosť"") does not provide any information about the likelihood of a baby being born and could refer to various other situations involving a woman's freedom or lack thereof. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the provided premise."

Therefore, option A is the better choice.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that his mother measured his temperature (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ten men were sentenced to death row) suggests that the speaker's partner was involved in a serious crime, such as murder or treason, for which they received the death penalty.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""V dome sa vypne elektrina,"" Option A (Hľadal som baterku) is more likely. The word ""hľadal"" means ""to search for"" or ""to look for,"" indicating that the speaker was actively searching for a battery. In contrast, ""Zobral"" means ""to find"" or ""to discover,"" which implies a more passive action. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the context of the sentence."

"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""there was a small child who had been left in the car"" suggests that the child may have been forgotten or left unattended in the vehicle, which could lead to heatstroke if the car is parked in direct sunlight for an extended period of time. This is supported by the mention of the child being ""zaseknutý,"" which means ""overheated"" or ""hot."" Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for why the child's body temperature rose rapidly."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Prevral som naňho oci) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""prevral som naňho oci"" means ""I turned her eyes towards me,"" indicating that the speaker caused the other person's attention to shift towards them.

This suggests that the business owner has an outstanding debt with the creditor, which they are unable to pay back. Writing off the debt as bad debt is a common practice for businesses in this situation, so option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ten muž prekliatý,"" option A (Podresal si nechty) is the more likely cause. The word ""prekliatý"" means ""angry"" or ""irritated"", so it suggests that one of the men was feeling annoyed or upset.

Therefore, option A is the better choice."

The phrase ""generálny riaditeľ spoločnosti odstúpil"" suggests that the CEO of a company has resigned or retired, which could lead to the dissolution of the company by its board of directors. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Prišel som k pódiu) is more likely. The word ""pódium"" suggests a stage or platform, implying that the speaker has already arrived at the location where they are supposed to give their presentation.

The premise states that the girl has become involved in a debate, indicating that she has gained knowledge or skills related to communication or argumentation. While it's possible that she may have also learned how to communicate better through this experience, the focus of the premise is on her acquiring computer literacy, given the context of participating in an online debate.

In this case, ""po odchode"" means ""after leaving"", so it makes sense that the speaker would check the mailbox after exiting the house. Option B (""Keď som vychádzal z domu,zatlačil som dvere"") does not match the word order of the original sentence and sounds less natural in English."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muž chcel vidieť východ slnka,"" Option A (Cestoval na sever) is more likely. The word ""sever"" means ""north"", so it suggests that the man wanted to see the sunrise in the north."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zložil som papier,"" option A (Zrecykloval som papier) is more likely. The word ""zrecykloval"" means ""to recycle,"" so it suggests that the paper was recycled after being used once. Option B (""Papir sa zvrhol"") does not make sense in this context, as it would mean ""The paper turned into a hole."""

The phrase ""bol odsúdený"" suggests that the criminal has been sentenced or punished for their wrongdoing, which aligns with the idea of justice being served. In contrast, Option A does not provide any indication of punishment or consequences for the criminal's actions. Therefore, Option B is the more likely explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Izzy opened the windows (Option A). The sentence ""Do izby vstúpilo slnečné svetlo"" means ""The sunlight entered the rooms,"" indicating that something inside the room allowed the sunlight to enter.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Zvyšoval som hlasitosť) will have a positive impact on the quality of the music. This is because increasing the volume can make the music sound better in terms of clarity and overall audibility. On the other hand, Option B (Skladal som si vlastnú pieseň) may not necessarily improve the quality of the music as it only involves writing one's own song, without any reference to the volume or audio quality. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the girl broke it) is the correct answer. The phrase ""chlapac mal vlasy"" suggests a young boy, and the action of ""roztrhlo"" implies breaking or damaging something.

Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Únosca pohrozil, že rukojemníkovi ublíži) is the more likely cause. The fact that the abductor threatened to harm the hostage if he didn't come along suggests that the abduction was not a random act of violence but rather a deliberate action taken by the abductor to get what they wanted. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why the hostage was left alone.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Na pódiu sa ozval výbuch,"" option A (Hudobník zaklepal nohou) is the more likely cause of the explosion. The word ""zaklepal"" means to kick or strike with one's feet, suggesting that the musician may have accidentally kicked something hard enough to cause an explosion.

Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the parents were called in to their child's room."

The fact that she communicated through sign language suggests that she may have had difficulty hearing or speaking, which could be caused by a variety of factors including birth defects or illnesses during pregnancy. While it is possible for a woman to give birth prematurely (Option A), there is no direct evidence to suggest this as the cause of Woman's condition. Therefore, Option B is the more likely answer.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Voda sa znečistila) is a more likely outcome than option B (Úroda zahynula).

The text states that the owner of the factory has refused to increase wages for employees, which suggests a conflict or disagreement between management and workers.

Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Extremists have influenced him) is more likely. The text does not provide any evidence to suggest that the man was actively working against extremism or that he was in danger from extremists before his disappearance.

Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man disappeared.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she drank a cup of tea (Option A). The phrase ""sa chladno"" means ""cold"", indicating that something cold was consumed. Drinking a hot beverage like tea would provide warmth rather than relieve coldness, making Option A the more plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Her son smiled) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""utišila svojho syna"" suggests that the mother has smothered or overprotected her son to the point where he has become weak or ineffective. This could lead him to smile as a coping mechanism, rather than being angry or resentful. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zaprelo som džínsy) is a more plausible explanation for why I have no money than option B (Spadol som na chodník). This is because having no money can be caused by various factors such as overspending, job loss, or unexpected expenses, but being hit by a truck is unlikely to result in losing one's savings.

Option B (Rozhoda sa, že sa pokúsi urobiť otočenie) does not align with this interpretation as it implies the child made a decision to turn around, which would be unlikely given their current situation.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Pošta doručila list) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Stavil všetky svoje peniaze) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the character's personality trait of being reckless and impulsive. The character may be prone to making rash decisions without considering the consequences, which could lead them to spend all their money on something unnecessary or foolish. On the other hand, option B (Odišiel domov na mizine) does not fit as well with the character's personality, as it implies a sense of responsibility and self-awareness that contradicts the character's reckless nature.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Vietor sa zosilnil) caused the fire to spread. The phrase ""Lesný požiar sa rozširial"" suggests that the fire was spreading through a forest or woodland area, which could be attributed to the wind carrying embers or sparks from one location to another. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the fire started and continued to spread."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Jeho matka naviazala ranu) is more likely to occur as it implies that his mother applied a bandage or dressing to the wound, indicating that she took some action to treat her son's injured knee. Option A (Jeho matka ho poslala do izby) does not provide any information about how his mother reacted to his injury.
"Response:  Option B: Dostal transplantáciu orgánov.  
Explanation: The premise states that ten men survived a deadly disease. This implies that they had severe illnesses that required medical intervention to save their lives. Transplantation of organs is one such medical intervention that can be used to treat serious diseases. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that these men received organ transplants to survive their deadly diseases."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chutnal som zo špekajúcej kávy,"" it is more likely that the speaker spilled coffee on their language (Option B). The phrase ""chutnal"" means ""spill"" or ""splash"", and ""zo špekajúcej kávy"" means ""on the speaking language"". Therefore, the sentence implies that the speaker accidentally spilled coffee on their language, rather than simply forgetting how to speak."
"Response:  Option A: Autorka sa vo svojich príbehochvyhýbal zaujatost.  
Explanation: The premise states that the editor fired the author, suggesting that there was a problem with the author's work. Option A is more likely because it implies that the author was avoiding important issues in their writing, rather than simply making a mistake with a deadline."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Spal som celý deň) is a more plausible cause for feeling exhausted than option B (Učil som sa celý deň). The phrase ""Cítil som sa vyčerpaný"" suggests that the speaker feels drained or fatigued, which could be due to lack of rest or sleep rather than intense learning throughout the day. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given context."
Response:  Option A - Identifikovala pacientove príznaky.
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Poškriabala som sa."" (I washed myself), option A ""Bola to potená"" (It was dirty) is a more likely cause. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Stratil nervy) is the correct answer. The phrase ""muž podstúpil núdzovú operáciu"" suggests that a man has undergone a serious surgical procedure, such as a heart bypass operation or brain surgery. This would likely have significant effects on his nervous system, including numbness or weakness in his limbs. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the symptoms described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zviazal ruky) is the more likely cause of the man's hands swelling up with muscles. This is because the word ""vybočili"" in Czech means to bulge out or protrude, which suggests that the muscles are growing outside of their normal position. Therefore, it is more likely that the man's muscles have grown and pushed his skin outwards, causing his hands to appear larger than usual. Option B (Tril si ruky) does not make sense in this context as it means to twist one's hands, which would not result in the desired effect of the man's hands swelling with muscle growth."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muž zdvihol obočie,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""prekvapený"" means surprised or taken aback, which aligns with the context of a man raising his eyebrows in surprise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ospravedlnil som chybu môjho kolegu,"" option A is more likely. The speaker believes that their intentions were good, indicating a sense of self-justification or excuse-making for their mistake."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Začal viac cvičiť) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Telo útočníka bolo bez života) is more likely to occur. The fact that the woman shot the attacker in the nose suggests that she was trying to defend herself or others from an immediate threat, rather than causing long-term harm to her attacker. Therefore, it is more likely that the attacker died as a result of the gunshot wound rather than bleeding extensively.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Ten muž nemal správne zacílenie) is the correct answer. The phrase ""šipka minula cieľ"" means ""the arrow missed the target,"" indicating that the person's aim was off. This suggests that the person did not have the right focus or concentration while playing the game, rather than simply reloading the game. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person missed the target."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (V suteréne objavil potkany) is a more likely cause for why the homeowner wanted an exterminator to come to his house. The phrase ""objavil potkany"" means ""published an ad,"" suggesting that the homeowner put up a notice or advertisement seeking an exterminator's services. This implies that he had a pest problem in his house that needed attention. Option B (V izbe mal mravcovú farmu), on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as it means ""In the basement, there was a mouse farm."" There is no indication in the premise that there were mice in the basement, let alone a farm of them. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Bola som príliš unavená, aby som niečo pripravila) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker was too tired to prepare anything for the evening.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she will start hiding her diary (Option A). The fact that she has been keeping a diary for some time suggests that she values its contents and may be concerned about someone finding out what she has written. Therefore, when faced with the situation of having to choose between revealing her diary or continuing to keep it hidden, she would likely opt to hide it further rather than risk exposing its contents.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (worked overtime) is more likely to be the cause of her financial difficulties.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dotkol sa horúceho sporák) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ruka rychlo sa stiahola"" suggests that something happened quickly, and ""horúceho sporák"" means a sudden or unexpected event. This implies that the person's hand was suddenly caught in something, such as a sprain or strain, which could happen due to an accident or injury. Option B (Potľapal psíčku po hlave) does not fit with this context and seems less plausible."
Response:  Option A (Offering a discount to new customers) is more likely to increase customer satisfaction because it provides an immediate benefit to the customer. By offering a discount, the company can attract new customers and make them feel valued, leading to increased loyalty and repeat business. On the other hand, option B (Conducting market research) may not provide an immediate benefit to the customer and could be seen as intrusive or unnecessary by some customers, potentially leading to decreased satisfaction.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the boy kicked the table leg) is a more likely cause than option B (the boy threw a plate on the floor). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the action was deliberate and targeted at a specific object (the table leg), rather than being an accidental or careless act like throwing a plate on the floor.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (My friend smiled at me) is a more likely cause than option B (My friend kicked my ass). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Udelil ho blesk) is more likely to be the cause of the statue's destruction. The phrase ""spálila"" in the premise suggests that the statue was damaged or destroyed, and ""blesk"" means lightning, which could have struck the statue and caused it to collapse or break apart. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the statue might have been destroyed."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Nechal som ovocie na stole,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ovocie vylieva semena"" (The egg lays eggs) will occur. This is because the word ""ovocie"" in Czech means both ""egg"" and ""eggs"", so it could be interpreted as meaning that the egg itself lays eggs rather than just containing them. Therefore, option A is a more logical conclusion based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ukazala prstami) is a more plausible cause for why Balerina's veins are visible through her skin than option B (Zmäkla si členok). This is because there is no logical connection between stretching one's fingers and causing someone's veins to become visible through their skin. However, it is possible that exposure to cold weather or certain medical conditions could cause a person's veins to become more prominent in their skin.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Naučil sa ich viazať) is more likely. The sentence ""Dieťa si rozviazalo šnúrky"" implies that the child was able to untangle the knots by themselves, suggesting that they had learned how to do so. Option B (""Býval na irxiku"") does not provide any information about the child's ability to untangle the knots and could simply mean that they were present at a place where people were playing with knots. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Vrátil som knihu) is a more likely outcome as it suggests that the speaker has returned the book to its rightful owner, implying that they have fulfilled their responsibility towards the book. Option B (Stratil som pojem o čase) does not provide any context or indication of what action the speaker might take with regards to the book, making option A a more plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that his parents had an influence on him rather than rejecting him. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option B (the driver fell asleep) caused the car to stop moving. The passage states that ""Auto postupne spomalilo a zastavilo se,"" indicating that the car slowed down and stopped on its own, suggesting that the driver may have fallen asleep or lost consciousness while driving. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option A - Zmrzlina stratila chuť (The ice cream lost its flavor).
Explanation: The premise states that ten men ate ice cream on the sun, which is not possible in reality as ice cream would melt immediately. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome, where the ice cream loses its flavor due to the extreme heat."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""V izbe som vyvesila umelecké diela,"" option A is more likely. The word ""vyzesil"" in this context means to clean or tidy up, so it's unlikely that the walls were dirty (option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (My boss has a headache) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Môj šéf mal stretnutie"" can be translated as ""My boss has a headache,"" which aligns with the context of the situation provided in the question. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Majiteľvyčíňal šteniatka) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ospravedlnil som sa priateľovi,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ospravedlnil"" means to forgive or pardon someone, so it suggests that the speaker's friend has forgiven them for something. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mal na sebe batoh) is more likely. The word ""batoh"" means backpack in English, so it's unlikely that the person would have a neon-colored backpack. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Svedec klamal pod prísahou,"" option B (Bol obvinený z falošnej prísahy) is more likely. The word ""klamál"" in this context implies that someone has lied or deceived under oath, which could lead to a charge of perjury. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chcela nový vzhľad) is more likely. The woman wants to change her look by dyeing her hair a new color, indicating that she is seeking a different appearance.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Boli deportovaní) is more likely to occur. The premise states that immigrants are illegal in the country and have been living there without proper documentation. Deportation is a common consequence of being an undocumented immigrant in many countries, so it is more likely that this will happen than for them to find a job legally.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Diváci sa smiali) is more likely. The word ""smiali"" in this context means to be amused or pleased, so it's likely that the audience was enjoying the comedian's performance."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Slnko ma oslepilo) is more likely to occur. The word ""oslepilo"" means ""to blur,"" so it suggests that the sun has become less bright or has lost its intensity. This effect is more plausible than option B (Slnko mi opálilo pleť), which means ""The sun has tanned my skin."" While it's possible for excessive exposure to sunlight to cause a tan, it doesn't align with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cítil som sa nudný,"" option A (Šňupal som) is a more likely response because it means ""I felt tired."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the knife was dull) is more likely to be the cause of the steak being difficult to cut. This is because a dull knife would not have been able to effectively slice through the meat, resulting in a harder-than-usual cutting experience. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dostala výživné) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zaujímalo by ma, čí je vonku) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker is curious about whether their friend's lights are on or off, indicating that they may be concerned about their friend's well-being. Option B (Rozhodol som sa ho navštíviť) does not align with this interpretation as it implies that the speaker has already decided to visit their friend, rather than being curious about their whereabouts.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dala som si kvet pod nos"" (I smelled a flower), option B is more likely. The correct answer is: Kvetinové lístky sa odlúčili (The petals fell off)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Narazila na kamarátku z detstva) is a more plausible explanation for why a woman might feel nostalgia than Option B (Kričala na svoje deti). The word ""kamarátka"" suggests a childhood friend, while ""detstvo"" means ""childhood,"" so it's possible that the woman has been reminiscing about her friendship with someone from her youth rather than crying over her own children."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Predložil prácu skôr) is more likely to happen.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Išla som do obchoďáku) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Moje auto sa pokazilo"" suggests that something unexpected happened to the speaker's car, and going to a garage (obchod) is a common place to take one's car for repairs or maintenance. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Bolo to anonymné) is more likely. The word ""anonymný"" means ""anonymous"", so it's likely that the speaker wants to keep their identity hidden for some reason. Option B (""bolo to nečitateľné"") doesn't make sense in this context, as there is no such word in Slovak."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kladie vajcia) is more likely to occur as ""Vták"" means ""raven"" in Czech, and ""mával"" means ""with"", so the phrase ""Vták mával krídelmi"" can be translated to ""The raven with wings"". Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the garage was open) caused the car to be parked on the arrival path. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Obete zdvihol ruky) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""namieril zbraň"" implies that the perpetrator had a weapon in mind or planned to use one, but it does not necessarily mean that they actually used one. Therefore, option B, where the victim raised their hands, is a more plausible outcome as it suggests that the victim may have tried to defend themselves without the perpetrator using a weapon."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Chcel som sa zúčastniť pohrebu môjho strýka) is the correct answer. The phrase ""pohrebu môjho strýka"" means ""funeral of my uncle,"" indicating that the speaker wants to attend a funeral."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Snival som) is a more plausible explanation for why it's always winter in the land of Stratil. This is because ""snival"" means snowfall or blizzard in English, suggesting that there may be frequent snowstorms in this fictional land. In contrast, ""bolo mi zle"" doesn't have any clear meaning in English, making it less likely as an explanation for the perpetual winter in Stratil."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tlačiarne dochádzal atrament) is more likely as it suggests that the document was pressed or compressed, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as overuse or damage to the printing press. On the other hand, option B (Vydanie bolo bez papiera) implies that the document was not printed with paper, which is unlikely given the context of the sentence. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Fanúšikovia sa obrátili k vlajke) is more likely. The phrase ""sa obrátili k vlajke"" means ""they turned towards the flag"", indicating that they faced or looked at the flag. This suggests that the fans are paying attention to something related to their national identity, such as a flag waving in the wind. Option B (""Fanúšikovia sa ponáhľali na ihrisko"") means ""the fans were looking at the stadium"", which does not fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ja som to podal) is correct. The sentence ""Ten zával bol necitlivý"" means ""The wall was not sensitive"", and ""podal"" means ""gave"". Therefore, the complete sentence would be ""I gave the wall sensitivity."" Option B (""Dal som do toho soľ"") does not make sense in this context."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Uterák absorbed liquid) is more likely.
Response:  Option B: Prečítala si knihu znova.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Muž sa pozrel z okna) is more likely to occur as it implies that the man fell out of a window, which is a more dramatic and unexpected event than him simply walking away from the situation (option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that dievča ignored him (Option A). The word ""chlap"" in Czech means a boy or young man, so it can be inferred that the speaker is referring to a male person who was ignored by a girl."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Amputated his leg) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Lekári pacientovi dali umelú končatinu"" suggests that a surgeon performed an amputation on the patient's leg, rather than simply monitoring their vital functions."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zdvihla na neho plecia) is a more likely outcome than option B (Odttrhla mu ruku). This is because the phrase ""Chlapci štipol dievčinu do lakću"" implies that the boy is trying to hug or touch the girl inappropriately, which could cause her to push him away or resist his advances. It's less likely that she would simply pull his hand off without any resistance."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cenil som si jeho názor) is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""sa svojho priateľa na radu"" suggests that the speaker is considering their friend's opinion, implying a willingness to listen and consider others' views. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker values their friendship and wants to understand their friend's perspective rather than simply asserting their own viewpoint without consideration for others."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Bláz je na jeho topánkach) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""chlapci stoupil do bahna"" suggests that a boy climbed up a mountain, while ""bláz je na jeho topánkach"" means ""he's red-faced from exertion."" This implies that the boy may have been exercising or working hard, leading to blushing due to exertion rather than being hit in the face."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that schools are closed (Option A). The reason being that snowfall of a few centimeters is not usually enough to warrant people burrowing underground for safety (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Na deň odišiel domov) is a more likely outcome than option B (Vyhrážal sa, that dá výpoveď). This is because the context of the situation suggests that Zamestnanec has already left work, implying that he will not be able to attend the meeting scheduled for the next day. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Strom spadol na strechu) is a more likely cause of damage to the roof than option B (Strom stenial záhradu). This is because falling branches are more likely to come into contact with the roof than a tree leaning against it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nahradila som drevo do krbu) caused the tree to fall. The sentence ""Drevo sa rozpadlo na polovicu"" suggests that the tree was already damaged or weakened before it fell, which aligns with Option A's explanation of replacing the tree with a new one in the bucket. On the other hand, Option B's explanation of stopping a saw into the forest does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that a saw was involved in the tree's falling. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the couple announced their divorce) is the correct cause for the congratulations. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Páčil sa jej) is a more likely cause for why dievča sent a valentínka to chlapcvi. This is because ""páčil"" means ""to please"" or ""to delight"", so it suggests that she sent the gift as an act of kindness or affection towards him. Option B (""Ona ho pobozkala"") means ""She yelled at him"", which does not fit with the tone of the sentence and implies a negative interaction between them. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kývla som hlavou pri výpovedi môjho priateľa,"" option A is more likely. The word ""zmätená"" means ""confused"" or ""dazed"", so it suggests that the speaker was not in control of their actions when they agreed with their friend's proposal. Option B does not convey this meaning, as ""súhlasila"" simply means ""agreed"". Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They wanted to find a compromise) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""V kuchyni sa spustil časovač,"" Option A is more likely. The man put food in the fridge, indicating that he is preparing to store it for later use. This is a common activity people engage in when they want to preserve food for future meals or events."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tvrdo trabajó) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that she worked hard.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Jeho syn mal právne problémy) is more likely to happen as it suggests that the man's son has legal problems, which could be a consequence of his death. Option B (Jeho syn zdedil jeho majetok) means that the man's son inherited his property, which does not necessarily imply any legal issues.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the woman slapped the flames (Option A). The phrase ""plamene sa zhasili"" means ""flames were extinguished,"" indicating that the woman's action had a positive outcome. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Jeho vodičský preukaz bol odňatý) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman's car was towed away. It suggests that the driver may have lost their license or driving privileges due to an accident or other traffic violation, rather than simply having an automobile accident. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Spal som cez budík,"" it is more likely that she made rańajky (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Kamery sa zameriavali na nieho) will occur. The use of the word ""vystúpila"" suggests a deliberate action taken by the person in question, rather than their family members being involved in some way. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that water in the bathroom became humid (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (He joined a fraternity) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the provided premise that he wanted to stretch out other students at university. Joining a fraternity would provide an opportunity for him to interact with and influence his peers within that organization. Option B (He studied engineering) does not directly relate to the premise or provide any insight into how he might have achieved his goal of influencing others at university.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hľadal som drobné) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's stomach hurts. The word ""drobné"" means ""small,"" so it suggests that the speaker may have eaten something small or insignificant that did not agree with their stomach. Option B (Zmenila som usporiadanie obývačky) does not provide any specific reason as to why the speaker's stomach might hurt. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the boy picked a flower (option B). The phrase ""ocha letela k chlapcu"" means ""the bee flew to the boy,"" indicating that the boy was in close proximity to nature and could have easily picked a flower."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Polícia prenasledovala zločincov) is a more likely outcome than option A (Polícia sa postarala o obeť). This is because the word ""prenasledovala"" implies that the police are actively pursuing the criminal, rather than simply mourning the victim."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Spadol mi) is a more plausible explanation for why ten laptops were not delivered to someone. It suggests that the person may have forgotten or misplaced their order, rather than intentionally neglecting to deliver them. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Získala si rozsiahly šatník) is a more plausible cause for why a woman has little space in her small bag than Option B (Složila svoje prádlo). This is because the word ""rozsiahly"" means ""to expand or enlarge,"" suggesting that the woman may have added more items to her bag rather than removing some of them."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (his wife gave birth) is the more likely cause of his broken heart. The premise states that he has a broken heart, which suggests that something significant has happened to him emotionally or psychologically. Giving birth is a life-changing event that can have a profound impact on a person's emotional well-being, especially for women. Therefore, it is more likely that his wife giving birth rather than leaving him is the reason for his broken heart.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hodil som mincu do fontanny"" (Threw a coin into the fountain), option A is more likely. The word ""rozpadla"" (broke) in Option B does not fit with the context of throwing something into water. Therefore, it is more probable that the coin will sink to the bottom rather than breaking into half."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Lopta sa dostala do diery) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she coughed (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A - Zákazník použil falošné peniaze - is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the word ""falošné"" in Czech means counterfeit or fake, indicating that the customer used false money to pay for the goods. This is a common type of fraudulent activity in retail stores, where criminals use fake currency to make purchases without getting caught. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the provided information."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Kvôli odpadkom kuchyňa smrdí) is a more plausible explanation for why the kitchen smells bad than option B (Nešťastnou náhodou som vyhodila svoy nákupný zoznam). This is because the word ""odpadok"" specifically refers to food waste, suggesting that the unpleasant smell in the kitchen may be due to spoiled or rotting food rather than simply misplacing a shopping list."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that children were admiring animals (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that his face is swollen (Option A). The phrase ""dychoval hlasno"" suggests that he is making a loud noise, which could be due to various reasons such as shouting or crying. However, if his face is swollen, it would be difficult for him to make any sound at all, let alone a loud one. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Spýtal som sa priateľa, where se to koná) is more likely. This is because the sentence structure suggests that the speaker is already at a concert with their friend, rather than considering going to a concert with them. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Priniesol som ti deky) is more likely to be the correct answer as it suggests that the temperature in the house has increased due to the sun shining through the windows. This is a common occurrence during the summer months when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. Option B (Otvoril som okna) means ""He opened the windows,"" which would not have any impact on the temperature inside the house."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chlapce bolí chrbát,"" it is more likely that option A is correct - his backpack was open."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Upiekla som jej koláč) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""upiekla"" means ""to bake"", so it suggests that the speaker is more likely to have baked something for their mother's birthday rather than making her national dishes."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zahradníkho byla bodlána včela) is more likely to be the cause of the destroyed flowers in the garden. This is because včelami (bees) are known to sting and can damage plants, while veri (rabbits) do not typically have the ability or motivation to dig up entire gardens. Therefore, it is more plausible that a bee was responsible for damaging the flowers in this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Plamene vyhasli) is more likely. The word ""vyhasli"" means ""have gone out"", so it suggests that the flames have extinguished or disappeared. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Chceli obnoviť ich osobný vzťah) is more likely. The fact that they have reached an agreement suggests that there has been a change in their personal relationship, rather than simply avoiding each other's company.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Deti boli poslané do sirotčiny"", option A (Ich rodičia zomrelí) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""zomrelí"" means ""died"". Therefore, it suggests that the speaker's parents have passed away."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a tsunami occurred) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that a large wave or tidal bore has entered the ocean from an external source, which aligns with the definition of a tsunami. Option B (the earth began to crack) does not fit this description as it implies localized ground deformation rather than a massive water wave entering the ocean.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bola dehydrovaná) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""dehydrované"" means ""removed water"", which suggests that something has been dried out or removed from its original state. This fits with the idea of a cobra shedding its skin, as snakes do not have the ability to remove their own skins. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened to the cobra in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pec sa zohrieva,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""zohrieva"" means ""to boil."" Therefore, the correct response would be ""Zapol som rúru,"" which translates to ""I will boil water."" Option B does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Citron caught fire) is more likely to occur than option B (Citron's juice). The premise states that ""Stlačil som citrónový klin,"" which means he squeezed a lemon into a glass, implying that the citron was in contact with heat or flame, increasing the likelihood of it catching fire. Option B does not provide any such explanation for why the citron would release its juice. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Krajina colonized the land) is more likely. The text states that Krajina ""published"" new territories, implying a deliberate action of expanding its territory through colonization rather than simply leaving or abandoning it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Roztrhal sa po celej podlahe) is more likely. The phrase ""Sklo spadlo zo stola"" suggests that something fell or broke into pieces, and ""po celej podlahe"" means ""on the floor"". Therefore, it is more likely that the object fell onto the floor rather than being placed there intentionally."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Stôl sa chválil,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Podlaha bola nerovná"" (The floor was uneven) caused the man to stumble. Therefore, you should choose Option A as your answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Jeho syn priznal pravdu) is true. The word ""chytil"" in Czech means to laugh or smile, so it's possible that the father laughed at his son's mistake. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he took aspirin (Option B) than sirup for a headache (Option A). Aspirin is commonly used to treat mild to moderate headaches, while sirup may not be effective in relieving pain.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vlak spomalil,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""spomalil"" means ""slowed down,"" so it's likely that the train actually slowed down rather than the speaker making a mistake."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (mental illness ran in his family) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""ten men"" underwent therapy, but does not provide any specific details about their mental health issues beyond the fact that they had some kind of psychological problem. It is possible that these individuals may have inherited a predisposition to mental illness from their families, rather than having developed depression as an adult. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prehltla jedlo) is more likely. The word ""prehlt"" in Croatian means to grab or hold something tightly, so it's possible that the woman grabbed her hair tightly with both hands. Option B (Zdrdla sa jedlom) doesn't make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between holding someone's head tightly and eating food."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Her voice is hoarse) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the woman has a bad cough, which could cause her voice to become hoarse or rough. Option B (She spoke with a stutter) does not align with the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Slinilo sa) will occur. The word ""pes"" means ""dog"" in Czech, and the phrase ""pes sa pozrel na šťavnatý steak"" can be translated as ""the dog licked a juicy steak"". Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the dog's reaction would be to lick the steak rather than simply placing it down."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Vyhodila svojich zamestnancov) is true. The phrase ""uspešný ženský biznis"" suggests that the businesswoman in question has achieved success, but the use of the word ""vyhodila"" implies that she may have done so at the expense of her employees. This contrasts with Option B, where the focus is solely on the woman's wealth gain without any mention of harm to others."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Zvonil zvon) caused the students to leave their desks. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she has a known mental illness (Option A). The passage states that ""she claimed to have seen a ghost,"" indicating that her perception of reality may be distorted due to a psychological issue rather than an actual supernatural encounter."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he drowned in the ocean (Option A). The reason being that there is no mention of an explosion occurring anywhere near him, let alone one that could have caused his death. Additionally, the phrase ""Ten muž stratil sluch"" suggests a sudden and unexpected event, such as drowning, rather than a violent or traumatic death from an explosion."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dieťa pustilo šnúru balóna,"" it is more likely that the balloon will rise into the air (Option B)."
"Response: 
Option A: Mal mŕtvicu (He lost his speech)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (V betóne bola trhlina) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Žena sa potkla na chodníku"" suggests that a woman was hit by something while walking, and ""trhlina"" means a hole or dent. Therefore, it is more plausible that there was an object that caused a hole in the ground rather than someone calling out to her."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ten man poured water into the basin) is more likely to happen because it implies a deliberate action taken by one person to cause an outcome that results in someone else getting wet. Option A (The rescuer jumped after him) does not imply any intentional actions that would result in someone getting wet.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that your infection has spread (Option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the driver pressed the brake (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Vložila som nádobku do teplej vody) caused the plastic bottle to melt because exposure to hot water can cause plastics to soften or melt. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Auto sa rozbočilo,"" option A is more likely. The word ""telefon"" suggests that a phone pole or other obstacle was hit, rather than the car simply rolling over."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Prešiel skúškou) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the boy learned to swim) is a more plausible explanation for why he was able to stay afloat in the pool. Therefore, this answer choice is correct.
"Response: 
Option A: Cítil som svoje srdce biť."
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Moja kancelária bola preplnená) is true. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker's office was already full, rather than being noisy. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Rodina pozvala susedov na večeru) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the family wants to get to know their neighbors better by inviting them over for a dinner party. This implies a friendly and social atmosphere, which is consistent with the idea of wanting to build relationships with new neighbors.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Voda sa šplhala z bazéna,"" it is more likely that option A (the swimmer jumped into the pool) occurred."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nešťastie som prehltol semeno) is more likely. The word ""prehltol"" means to spill or drop something accidentally, so it's more likely that the speaker accidentally dropped their melon seeds than they intentionally broke them."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Jeho bunda bola odzipovaná) is a more plausible explanation for why he can't find his mommy. This is because ""odzipovaná"" means ""divorced"" in Czech, indicating that the boy's mother may have left or separated from her husband, rather than being physically absent or lost. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the boy's confusion and search for his mother."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Rozptyľovala ju hluk) is more likely as it suggests that the woman's loud crying caused her to lose her hearing. This is a plausible explanation for how someone could suddenly become deaf in one ear without any prior medical conditions or injuries. In contrast, Option B (Máprepichnuté uši) does not make sense in this context as there is no evidence to suggest that the woman has pre-existing hearing loss or damage to her ears.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vypil som všetku vodu) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the given information that ""Naplnil som si fľašu s vodou."" This means he filled a bottle with water, which would require him to drink all of the water in the bottle. Option B (Nechal som ho v chladničke) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of placing anything in a freezer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the TV show was censored due to containing vulgar language (Option A). The mention of a ""complicated story"" does not provide enough information to determine whether the show was censored for this reason or any other. Additionally, the fact that the show was censored suggests that there may have been content in the show that was considered objectionable or offensive, which is more consistent with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Loď se zrútila,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Posádka sa utopila,"" is correct. The word ""zrútila"" implies a catastrophic event, such as a shipwreck or crash, which would likely result in the death of everyone on board. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Rozlúštil tú hádanku) is more likely. The word ""rozlúštil"" means to calm or soothe someone, which fits with the idea of trying to help someone who is upset or worried. Option B (""Žiadal o náznak"") means to think about something carefully, which doesn't fit as well with the context of helping someone who is upset."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Muž zavesil telefón) is more likely to occur. The word ""zavesil"" in Czech means ""called"", so it suggests that a man called the phone, rather than throwing or moving it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Obhal som ju) is a more likely response as it implies that the speaker saw or noticed something. The other option (Cítil som sa nepríjemne) does not fit with the context of the sentence and suggests an unrelated emotion.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Fotografovali exponáty) is more likely. The sentence ""Skupina opustila múzeum"" implies that they left the museum, and photographing exhibits would be a common activity for someone leaving a museum. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the girlfriend knows him) is more likely. The reason being that the premise mentions ""ten men"" who are trying to find her, implying a group of strangers rather than someone she knows personally. Therefore, it's more likely that she doesn't know any of them, including the one who has been following her."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Vypumpala som vzduch do pneumatiky) caused the air to go out of the tire than Option B (Zmenila som prevodovku na bicykli). This is because changing the gear on a bike would not directly affect the air pressure in the tires.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Jej otec ji čítal príbeh) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""vyzeralo"" in the first sentence suggests that something has happened or is happening, and the fact that it is bledé (bleak) implies a negative outcome. Therefore, it is more likely that the girl's father read her a story as a way of comforting her rather than hitting her on the head."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she used a pencil (A). The word ""ceruzka"" in Czech means ""pencil"", so this option is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (the man was overwhelmed) is the correct answer. The passage states that the man ""odmietli"" or refused to take out a loan, indicating that he may have been feeling overwhelmed by his financial situation. This is supported by the phrase ""bol zadleny,"" which means ""he was burdened."" Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for why the man did not want to take out a loan."
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mala kiahne) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Dievča zostalo doma od školy"" implies that the girl came home from school, which could be a reason for her to feel tired or unhappy. Option B (Rada sa učila matematiku) does not provide any evidence to suggest that the girl is feeling tired or unhappy, only that she enjoys learning mathematics. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the provided information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vrece na odpadky bolo plné,"" option A (Took it to a dumpster) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Moj spolubývajúci rozlil punč) is the correct answer. The word ""rozlil"" means to spread or scatter, so it makes sense that the speaker's hair might be scattered around their body after a shower. Option B (Môj pes stráca vlasy) means ""My dog eats my hair,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Hodil stoličku cez miestnosť) is more likely to cause a man to lose his nerve than option A (Vypnul svoj počítač). This is because throwing up in public can be embarrassing and humiliating, leading to feelings of anxiety or self-consciousness that could potentially ""lose one's nerve."" On the other hand, breaking one's computer may not have the same emotional impact, although it could still cause frustration or inconvenience."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dievča hodila vetvičku do ohňa) means ""The girl threw a thread into the fire."" Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the fire will be lit, so Option B (Oheň sa zhasol) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Horúca voda bola preč.) is a more plausible explanation for why the man did not come out of the spring. This is because ""horúca"" means ""boiling"" in Czech, indicating that the water in the spring was too hot or boiling to allow the man to emerge from it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vybrali si na školné úsporný fond) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""chybeli si"" means ""to save money,"" so it's likely that the parents are trying to find ways to save money for their children's education rather than encouraging them to play video games."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muž si rozviazal šnúrky,"" option A is more likely. The word ""rozviazal"" means to untie or loosen, so it's likely that the man released the knots in the ropes rather than using them up."
"Response:  Option A: Chladil zvyšky (Cool down the mixture).
Explanation: The premise states that ten men ate half of a main course, indicating that there was enough food to go around. However, the punchline ""cooled it"" suggests that they did something unexpected with the leftovers, such as putting them in the fridge or freezer to cool down. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dal som na to ľad) is more likely. The word ""dal"" means ""to put"", so it makes sense that the speaker would have put something on top of the ice cream. Option B (Vymetal som na to krém) does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no verb ""vymetat"" meaning ""to put"" or ""to place"". Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I could hear their conversation on the corridor) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sadol som si) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Musel som čakať"" means ""I was waiting for something,"" so the speaker is indicating that they were expecting something to happen or someone to arrive. Option B (""Prezeral som časopis"") means ""I read a magazine,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Mucha sa rozbehla. (The fly got away)"
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Zomieral) is the correct answer. The word ""zomieral"" means to become a zombie, which fits with the context of the sentence. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zrýchlil svoj krok) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I was thinking about it) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the speaker was lost in thought or contemplating something, rather than actively seeking a solution. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Option A - Bol vydesený (He was terrified).
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Stretol sa s priateľmi, aby pozrel zápas) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that he will win the game by cheating with his friends. Option B (Svojim priateľom sa stavil) means ""He stood up to his friend"" which doesn't fit the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he set an alarm clock (Option A). The reason being that a person would not typically calculate sheep while trying to fall asleep.
