Response:  Option A - See oli õrn (It was a big storm).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ma leidsin pileti tüki) will happen. Here's why: The phrase ""Ma tühjendasin oma taskud"" means ""I have no idea what to do."" This implies a lack of understanding or knowledge about something, which could lead to making mistakes or taking wrong actions. Option A suggests that the person might make things worse by trying to fix something they don't understand, while option B doesn't provide any context for how the person might be able to help. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Termiidid sõid läbi majas oleva puidu"" means ""Termites ate through the walls of their own house."" This implies that the termites were inside their own home when they started eating through the walls.
Option A, ""Termiidid kadusid majast,"" means ""Termites destroyed their own nest."" This would suggest that the termites were outside their home when they destroyed it, rather than inside their own house.
Therefore, based on the given information, option B is more likely to happen."
"Response:  Option B - Piirikontroll süüdis (The district administrator manages the pass).
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the district administrator will manage the pass rather than the police controlling it. The phrase ""piirikontroll süüdis"" suggests that the district administrator has authority over the pass, indicating that they are responsible for its management. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Option A - Oli puhkus.
"Response:  Option B - Ta hüppas hüppenööriga. 
Explanation: The word ""hüppas"" in this context means ""to jump"", so option B is the correct answer. According to the premise, Tüdrukul has energy and wants to jump, which makes sense given that he's a bird. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for why Tüdrukul is feeling energized."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta astus järjekorrast välja) is a more plausible explanation for why people might be confused about what to do with their lives. The phrase ""ta astus"" means ""to take a break,"" so it suggests that people are feeling overwhelmed or burnt out from trying to make decisions all the time. This could lead them to feel uncertain about how to proceed, especially if they have been relying heavily on their own judgment and intuition without taking breaks to reflect and recharge. Therefore, option B is a more likely explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option B - Beebi tegi oma mähkme täis. 
Explanation: The premise ""Tüdruk hoidis oma nina kinni"" suggests that someone (Beebi) has taken something belonging to another person (nina). Based on this information, it is more likely that option B is correct, as it implies that Beebi took something of value from nina."
"Response:  Option B - Publik kuulas vaikuses. 
Explanation: The word ""kuulas"" means ""to hear"". So, in this context, it's more likely that the audience will hear the music rather than see it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Tüdruk tõi õpetajale õuna. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Tüdruk has a math teacher who teaches him. This means that Tüdruk is receiving instruction from his teacher, which suggests that he is learning something new. Therefore, option B is more likely, as Tüdruk is gaining knowledge from his teacher."
"Response:  Option B - Nad grillisid lõkkel vahukomme. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Väikesed matkajad olid hirmul"" suggests that something big and heavy has fallen from the sky. The word ""hirmul"" means ""big"" or ""heavy"", but it can also be used to describe an object that has fallen from the sky. Therefore, option B is more likely as it implies that a large object has fallen from the sky, rather than a person being injured in a car accident."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sai peapõrutuse. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mees lõi pea ära"" implies that something has been added to the air, making it difficult for Meese to breathe. This could be due to pollution or some other harmful substance in the atmosphere. Therefore, option B - ""Ta sai peapõrutuse"" (You got a headache) is the most likely outcome as it suggests that Meese is experiencing discomfort or pain due to the unpleasant air quality."
"Response:  Option B - Ma sai palgatusu. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Tšekk, mille kirjutasin, ei läinud läbi"" suggests that someone wrote something down but didn't read it carefully enough to notice a mistake. This implies that they were in a hurry or distracted while writing, rather than being lazy. Therefore, option B - Ma sai palgatusu (I made a mistake) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Ta saatis laiali massimeili. 
Explanation: The premise states that the email was a spam message. Spam messages are often unsolicited and unwanted, so it's unlikely that the recipient would want to keep them or save them for later use. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Ta paranes haigusest. 
Explanation: The word ""paranes"" means ""to be sickly"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it suggests that the speaker's voice is weak or sickly due to some reason."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta luges seda endale ette) is a more plausible explanation for why Tüdruk might be unhappy with his job. This is because ""luges"" means ""to carry"" in Estonian, so it's possible that Tüdruk is feeling overworked or burdened by his responsibilities at work. In contrast, option B (Ta unustas selle üles kirjutada) doesn't make as much sense in this context, as ""unustas"" means ""to write off"" in Estonian, and there isn't any obvious reason why Tüdruk would want to write something off related to his job. Therefore, option A seems like a more likely explanation for Tüdruk's unhappiness."
"Response:  Option B: Klaas sai täis. 
Explanation: The word ""klaas"" in Estonian means ""ice"". So, if water freezes, it will form ice. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta mõtles oma sõbra sõnadele) is the most likely cause. This is because the sentence structure suggests that the speaker is trying to find a way to express their thoughts, rather than simply accepting defeat. Additionally, the use of the word ""mõtles"" (to think) implies a more active and deliberate process of considering one's options, rather than passively accepting defeat. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the language used in the premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ma esitasin süüdisse.
Explanation: The premise ""Õnnetus oli minu süü"" means that something was my destiny or fate. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer as it suggests that I had a predetermined role to play in the situation."
"Response:  Option A - Kett oli kummi ümber mässitud. 
Explanation: The premise ""Kett lagunes tükkideks"" suggests that something happened to Kett's legs, making it difficult for him to move around. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation, stating that Kett was hit by something or someone, causing injury to his legs. This is a more likely scenario than option B, which implies that Kett's legs were simply cut off without any prior incident. Therefore, we can conclude that Option A is the more likely cause of Kett's inability to walk."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Nad väsisid vaidlemisest) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence ""Paarike otsustas kompromissile minna"" suggests that there is a conflict or disagreement between two parties, and Option A implies that one party is not willing to compromise. This aligns with the context provided in the question, where it is mentioned that there is a problem that needs to be solved. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tunnistas kohtus. 
Explanation: The phrase ""ta tunnistas kohtus"" means ""you will become famous."" This option is more likely to happen based on the premise because becoming famous is a common goal for many people, especially those who are interested in politics or want to make a positive impact on society. It's also a more straightforward and achievable outcome compared to becoming a campaign manager, which may require specific skills and experience."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta reisis suure kohvriga) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""tuleb külm ilm"" means ""will become clear"" or ""will be revealed,"" indicating that something hidden will come to light. In this context, it's more likely that the speaker will reveal their true intentions rather than hiding them. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Viilis.
Explanation: According to the premise, we are given two options for how someone might react when they find out that their favorite restaurant has closed down unexpectedly. The first option is ""Ta tõstis oma käe,"" which means ""You get angry."" This suggests that the person may feel frustrated or upset about the closure of their favorite restaurant. However, the second option is ""Ta viilis,"" which means ""You become sad."" This implies that the person may feel a deeper emotional impact from the closure, such as feeling sadness or disappointment. Based on these options, it is more likely that the person will choose option B - Viilis."
"Response:  Option B - Ta pani kaitseprillid oma silmadele. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta pani kaitseprillid oma silmadele"" means ""To take care of one's own eyes."" This option is more likely because it aligns with the given premise that the person wants to protect their own eyes. Option A, ""Talle läks tolm silma,"" means ""Take a look at your eyes,"" which doesn't make sense in this context."
"Response:  Option B - Vastasel oli temast kahju. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the person who was supposed to play chess with him didn't show up. This means that he had no one to play against, which led to his boredom. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B - Õpilase vastused olid valed. 
Explanation: The premise states that the teacher gave an exam to a group of students, but the results were unexpected. This suggests that the students did not perform well on the exam, which is consistent with option B. It is less likely that the teacher would give an exam to a group of students who are already excellent in their studies (option A). Therefore, based on the given information, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Mul sai õhk otsa. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma tegin pausi, et rääkimine lõpetada"" suggests that something has caused a pause or interruption in the process of making something. Option B, ""Mul sai õhk otsa,"" implies that there was an obstacle or challenge that prevented the process from continuing smoothly. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Ma katsin selle plastik kilega. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ma katsin selle plastik kilega"" means ""I threw away that plastic bag."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer because it matches the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tahtis vaba päeva. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta tahtis vaba päeva"" means ""He wanted to take a day off"". This option is more likely based on the given premise because it aligns with the idea of someone wanting to relax or have some personal time without any work-related stress. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Ta jooksis basseini tekil. 
Explanation: The premise ""Tüdruk maandus basseinis"" suggests that something has happened to make the speaker's month unsuccessful or unhappy. Option A, ""Ta jooksis basseini tekil,"" means ""You have ruined your month with bad luck."" This option better fits the given information than Option B, ""Ta hüppas hüppelaualt alla,"" which means ""You have made a big mess everywhere."" While it's possible for someone to make a mess in their month, it doesn't necessarily explain why they would feel unhappy or unsuccessful. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Option B - Film sai kehvad arvustused. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Film sai kehvad arvustused"" means that the film received positive reviews, which suggests that it was well-received by audiences. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Inimesed tegid talle komplimente. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees võttis kaalust alla"" suggests that someone has fallen into a difficult situation or predicament. The word ""kaalust"" means trouble or difficulty in Estonian. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer because it implies that the person's situation has become even worse due to their own actions or decisions."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ronis köit mööda üles. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ta ronis köit mööda üles"" means ""To make a mess of something"". This option is more likely to be the correct answer because it fits better with the context of the premise provided. Making a mess of something aligns well with the idea of causing chaos or confusion, which is what the premise suggests. Therefore, option B is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Option B - Akrobat kiikus trapetsil. 
Reasoning: The word ""kiikus"" in Estonian means acrobatics or gymnastics, so this option suggests that the artist will perform acrobatic stunts using a trapeze. This fits with the idea of an aerial performance, which could involve flying through the air using various equipment such as a trapeze or a silk. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Option B - Mu sõber saabus õigeaegselt. 
Explanation: The premise states that there are two possible causes for why a person may not have any children: either they do not want them or they cannot have them. Since the text does not provide any information about the speaker's personal desires or circumstances, it is more likely that the reason they do not have children is due to biological factors beyond their control (Option B). Therefore, the answer is Option B - Mu sõber saabus õigeaegselt."
"Response:  Option B - Nad rääkisid lepingu osas läbi. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Sõdivad riigid tahtsid rahu"" suggests that a powerful force or energy has taken over the world. This could be interpreted as a catastrophic event such as an asteroid impact, a massive solar flare, or some other cataclysmic occurrence. In this scenario, it's unlikely that people would simply continue with their daily lives without any noticeable changes. Instead, they might experience disruptions in their routines, communication networks, and infrastructure due to the extreme nature of the event. Therefore, option B - Nad rääkisid lepingu osas läbi - is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Tal tõusis palavik. 
Explanation: The word ""tal"" means ""to talk"" in Estonian, so option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sai põlvele sinika. 
Explanation: According to the premise, naine kõndis diivanile otsa, which means that she took a bath in the ocean. This implies that she was immersed in water for an extended period of time, which could cause her skin to become dry and itchy. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Option B - Õhupall lendas ära. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Poiss pigistas õhupalli"" suggests that something unexpected or unpredictable has happened. In this context, it's more likely that the situation will escalate and become worse (Option B). Therefore, we can expect that the problem will continue to grow and have a negative impact on the person or thing involved."
Response:  Based on the given information, Option B (Nad läksid lennujaama) is more likely to happen because it implies that the person will not be able to book a hotel room due to lack of availability or high prices, which can make them feel frustrated and disappointed.
"Response:  Option B - Mahl purskas välja. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ma võtsin virsikust ampsu"" means ""I saw a bird flying away"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it implies that the bird flew away with great speed or velocity, which aligns with the meaning of the sentence."
"Response:  Option B - Ma olin maiasmokk. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mu käed hakkasid kleepuma"" suggests that something has been taken away from me without my consent or knowledge. Based on this information, it is more likely that I was drugged (maiasmokk in Estonian) than that I sold something (sõin sõõrikut). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Uks oli lukus. 
Explanation: The word ""lukus"" means ""to be hidden"". Based on the premise ""Ma lükkasin ust"", we can infer that something has been hidden from us. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur as it suggests that something has been concealed or kept secret."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B seems more plausible as a cause for why activists are boycotting a particular brand of soap. The phrase ""tooted olid valmistatud lapstööjõudu kasutades"" suggests that the activists are protesting against the use of harmful chemicals in the production of the soap. This could be due to concerns about environmental pollution or health risks associated with these chemicals. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the activists' boycott."
"Response:  Option B - Tolm lendas August välja. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma puurisin seina augu"" implies that something is being hidden or kept secret from us. Option B, ""Tolm lendas August välja,"" suggests that someone (August) has knowledge of this secret. Therefore, it is more likely that August knows about the secret than anyone else."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta õde oli õnnelik) is a more plausible explanation for why the farmer's horse ran away. The phrase ""ta õde oli õnnelik"" means that something happened suddenly or unexpectedly, without any apparent reason. In this case, it suggests that the horse simply bolted without any obvious trigger, such as being startled by something or feeling scared. This makes sense since horses can sometimes run away without any clear provocation. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B - Ma vahetasin särki - is more likely to happen. The word ""vahetas"" means ""to grind"", so it suggests that the speaker will grind something into a fine powder. This fits with the idea of making something smaller or finer, as suggested in the question. Option A - Ma panin põlle ette - does not make sense in this context, as ""panin"" means ""bread"" and ""põlle"" means ""hole"". So, the sentence would mean ""I am eating bread through a hole"", which doesn't make any logical sense. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ostja ulatas talle raha. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ostja ulatas talle raha"" means ""The owner empties the cash register."" This implies that someone has taken money from the cash register without permission, which is a common cause of lost revenue for businesses. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Ta saatis rahva laiali. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta saatis rahva laiali"" means ""The people's voice will be heard."" This option suggests that the public will have a greater say in decision-making processes, which could lead to more accountability and transparency in government. Given the context of the premise, it is more likely that this option will occur."
"Response:  Option B - Oli snäkiaeg. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Väike poiss nuttis"" means ""Little pea has no luck,"" implying that something unfortunate or negative has happened to the little pea. The word ""oli"" in this context suggests a sense of hopelessness or despair, which aligns with the idea of being stuck in a difficult situation. Therefore, option B - Oli snäkiaeg (There was nothing good) is the most likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B - Piloot sõitis läbi tormi is the most likely outcome. The word ""tormi"" in Estonian means a storm or hurricane, so it's possible that the pilot will navigate through the storm rather than avoiding it. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Option B - Lehed kogunesid maha. 
Explanation: The phrase ""puu heitis oma lehed"" means ""the earth spins around its axis"". This implies that the Earth's rotation causes day and night. However, the word ""kogunesid"" in option B means ""to turn"", which suggests that the Earth's rotation will cause a change in direction or orientation of something. Therefore, option B is more likely to be correct."
"Response:  Option B - Ta otsustas oma õele vingerpussi mängida. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Poiss oli üleannetus tujus"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual happened to someone's body. Option B, ""Ta otsustas oma õele vingerpussi mängida,"" means ""You started feeling your own heartbeat."" This option better fits the given information as it implies a physical sensation in the chest area, which could be caused by an irregular heartbeat or other cardiovascular issues. Therefore, we can conclude that Option B is more likely based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ta isa peatas bensiinijaamas auto. 
Explanation: The premise ""Laps kaebas, et ta peab tualettruumi minema"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their consent or permission. In this case, the thing taken away is a toilet, which implies that the person no longer has access to a bathroom. This could be due to various reasons such as construction, renovation, or even vandalism. Therefore, option B - Ta isa peatas bensiinijaamas auto is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Kalad hüppasid akvaariumist välja."" This is because the word ""hüppa"" means ""bubble"" in Estonian, and ""välja"" means ""to burst"". So, the sentence suggests that the bubbles in the aquarium will burst, leading to a messy situation."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta osales protestis) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the person will take action against the government's decision, which aligns with their political beliefs. The phrase ""osales protestis"" implies a sense of urgency and determination to act upon one's convictions. In contrast, Option A (""Ta vahetas oma erakondlikku kuuluvust"") may indicate a more passive response, such as accepting or tolerating the situation without taking any further action."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Ma keerasin kraani lahti."" This is because the phrase ""umbes"" suggests a state of confusion or disorientation, which could lead to accidentally knocking over something fragile like a vase. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
"Response:  Option A - Rong saabus jaama (The driver was drunk)
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the driver was drunk rather than being under the influence of any other substance or feeling tired. The phrase ""rong saabus jaama"" specifically implies that the driver had consumed alcohol to the point where their judgment and reaction time were impaired, making them a danger on the road. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the driver caused the accident."
"Response:  Option B - Ta pitseeris ümbriku kinni. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Mees has a small brain, so it's unlikely that he will be able to understand complex ideas or concepts. Therefore, option B is more likely, as ""Ta pitseeris ümbriku kinni"" means ""To make a simple-minded person happy,"" which aligns with Mees' limited cognitive abilities."
"Response:  Option B - Nad kolisid eri linnadesse. 
Explanation: The premise states that there are two causes of chaos in the world: one being that people don't understand each other, and the other being that they collide with each other. Since the second option mentions ""kolisid,"" or collision, it is more likely that this is the correct answer. Therefore, we should choose Option B."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta läks emapuhkusele) is more likely to happen because it implies that the employee will be laid off due to poor performance or lack of work. This is a common reason for layoffs in companies, especially when they are facing financial difficulties. Option A (Ta Vallandati oma töökohalt) means ""You will find another job,"" which suggests that the employee may be able to find new employment elsewhere, but it does not necessarily mean that they will be laid off from their current job."
"Response:  Option B - Ma thatsin keelaaega kontrollida. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma vaatasin kella"" suggests that something was heard or noticed by someone (Ma). Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation as it implies that Ma has control over something (keelaaega kontrollida), rather than simply hearing or listening to something (kuulsin kella) as suggested in option A."
"Response:  Option B - Mu naine ja mina hoidsime käest kinni. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Mul läks käsi krampi"" suggests that someone has a cramp in their hand. Option B provides a more plausible explanation for this situation as it implies that the person's partner or spouse helped them to massage the cramp away. It is unlikely that the person would write an essay about their own cramp without any external help. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Ma vahetasin poldi välja (I will make a big hole in the ground).
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the character will create a large hole in the ground rather than making small holes in various places. The phrase ""vahetasin"" (making) suggests a larger action compared to ""poörasin,"" which means ""to make small."" Additionally, the word ""poldi"" specifically refers to a deep hole or pit, further supporting option A."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Linn tunnistas korteri kõlbmatuks) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The phrase ""korteri kõlbmatuks"" suggests that something has happened inside the room or space where the book was kept. The word ""kõlbmatuks"" means ""to collapse"" or ""to fall apart,"" so it implies that the room itself has been damaged in some way.

On the other hand, option A (""Paar kolis korterisse sisse"") doesn't make sense in this context. It would be unusual for someone to enter a collapsed room without any explanation as to how it collapsed.

Therefore, based on the given information, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Ta arvas, et nägi äikest. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta arvas, et nägi äikest"" means ""You can see the future."" This option is more likely based on the given premise because it aligns with the idea of being able to predict something that will happen in the future. In contrast, ""Ta tahtis päikeseloojangut vaadata"" means ""You want to know everything,"" which does not fit as well with the premise. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Vesi oli madal. 
Explanation: The word ""madal"" in Estonian means ""cold"". Therefore, based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the reason for the water being still is because it was cold outside."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta vajutas tagasisammuklahvi) is more likely to be the correct answer because it means ""To take a bribe."""
"Response:  Option B - Ta võitis võistluse. 
Explanation: The premise states that Tüdruk has a headache because of something he did or didn't do. This implies that the cause of his headache is internal, related to his own actions or decisions. Option B suggests that Tüdruk might have overworked himself, which could be an internal cause for a headache. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B - See oli umbrohtu täis. 
Explanation: The word ""umbrohtu"" in Estonian means ""to be buried"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it implies that See was buried, which could have caused her to disappear without a trace."
"Response:  Option B - Ta unustas äratuskella panna. 
Explanation: The phrase ""ta unustas"" means to get angry or annoyed in Estonian, and ""äratuskella"" means to burst or explode. So, the sentence ""Ta unustas äratuskella panna"" can be translated as ""To get so angry that you burst/explode"". This option is more likely based on the given premise because it implies a sudden and intense anger that could potentially lead to an explosive reaction."
"Response:  Option A - Ta istus varjus. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees pani päikesekreemi peale"" suggests that something has happened to a person's stomach or digestive system, causing discomfort or pain. The word ""varjus"" in option A means ""inflamed,"" which fits well with this idea of a stomach problem. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the given premise."
"Response:  Option A - Teadlased võitisd teooria tagasi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the theory has been rejected due to its limitations. This means that the theory was not able to fully explain or predict certain phenomena, leading to its rejection. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Mäng läks lisaajale) is a more plausible explanation for why Fanny might be unhappy with her job as an event planner. The phrase ""mäng läks lisaajale"" translates to ""the workload is too heavy,"" indicating that Fanny may feel overwhelmed or burdened by her responsibilities at work. This makes sense, as planning events can be a demanding task that requires a lot of time, effort, and attention to detail. In contrast, option B (Kohtunik tegi halva otsuse) does not provide any clear indication of why Fanny might be unhappy with her job. Therefore, based on the provided information, option A seems like a more reasonable explanation for Fanny's dissatisfaction."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Lukk avanes) is more likely to occur. Here's why:
The phrase ""Ma sisestasin oma luku kombinatsiooni"" suggests that the speaker has combined their sister's number with something else. Option B, ""Lukk avanes,"" means ""to combine."" Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would choose this option as the most likely outcome.
So, the answer is option B – Lukk avanes."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Isa andis pojale natuke raha) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The phrase ""Rahvas intensiivistus"" suggests that something intense or strong is happening in the world of plants. The word ""intensiivistus"" implies a high level of concentration or focus, which could indicate a significant event or phenomenon occurring within plant life.

In this context, it's unlikely that a human would be able to simply pick up a tree (option B). While humans are capable of moving objects with their strength, trees are massive structures made of dense wood and have deep roots that anchor them firmly in the ground. It would require an enormous amount of force and effort to lift even a small tree, let alone a large one.

Therefore, based on the information provided, option A (Isa andis pojale natuke raha) is the most plausible outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Ma kühveldasin lume tee pealt ära. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Lumi blokeeris sissesõiduteed"" suggests that something has happened to the light, making it dim or weak. The word ""blokeeris"" means ""to darken,"" so we can infer that the light has been obscured in some way.
The second part of the sentence, ""Ma kühveldasin lume tee pealt ära,"" implies that someone (presumably the speaker) has caused this darkness to occur. The verb ""kühvelda"" means ""to cover over"" or ""to conceal,"" so it's possible that the speaker intentionally blocked or covered up the light.
Given these clues, option B is the most likely explanation for what happened to the light."
"Response:  Option B - Kajakk sõitis tabas lainet.
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it's more likely that the kayak will sink than float. The word ""aerute"" in Estonian means ""to drown,"" so it suggests that the kayak will not be able to stay afloat for long. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sõitis aeda sisse. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Tüdruk wants to gain control over his own life. The option that aligns with this goal is ""Ta sõitis aeda sisse,"" which means ""To take control of one's own life."" This option suggests that Tüdruk will focus on taking charge of his own destiny rather than blaming others or external circumstances for his problems."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ma tundsin, kuidas könm õhk minust üle läks) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""tundsin"" means ""to worry,"" and ""kuidas könm õhk minust üle läks"" means ""how can I get rid of it."" Therefore, it suggests that the person is worried about something and wants to find a way to deal with it. Option A (""Mu nahale pritsis vett"") does not provide any context or clues that suggest the person is worried about anything."
"Response:  Option B - Nad nägid haid. 
Explanation: The premise ""Surfarid naasesid randa"" suggests that something has happened to Farid's body, causing him to lose his sense of direction. Option B, ""Nad nägid haid,"" is a more plausible explanation for this situation as it implies that Farid may have suffered a head injury or trauma, leading to confusion and disorientation."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Vesi voolas vannist ära) will occur. Here's why:
The phrase ""Ma tõmbasin vanni äravoolukorki"" suggests that something has been put into a pot of water, causing it to boil or bubble up. This implies that there is already liquid in the pot, which means that the water level has increased rather than decreased. Therefore, option A is the correct answer because it states that the water level has risen.
On the other hand, option B (Vesi pritsis põrandale) suggests that the water level has decreased, which goes against the information provided in the premise. So, option B is not a feasible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tunnistas oma truudusetust talle. 
Explanation: According to the premise, after drinking too much alcohol, Mees' brain will start to shrink. This means that his cognitive abilities will be affected, making it harder for him to understand complex concepts or make rational decisions. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that Mees' brain will shrink to a point where he can no longer comprehend simple instructions like following a recipe."
"Response:  Option B - Ma ajasin vett postri peale. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the water in the pot boiled because of the heat from the stove rather than the sunlight. The phrase ""kuivab"" suggests that the water was heated, which aligns with the option B. Therefore, the answer is Option B - Ma ajasin vett postri peale."
"Response:  Option B - Take a deep breath and relax. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it's unlikely that Laps would be able to overcome his fear of failure by simply taking a nap or getting angry. Instead, he may benefit from taking a deep breath and relaxing, allowing himself to calmly assess the situation and come up with a solution. This option provides a more constructive approach to dealing with fear and anxiety than either of the other two choices."
"Response:  Option A - Ta isa istus laua taha maha. 
Explanation: The premise ""Poiss pani oma jalad lauale"" suggests that something has been added to the mother's milk, making it unsuitable for consumption. This could be due to various reasons such as contamination or adulteration. Therefore, option A - ""Ta isa istus laua taha maha"" is a more likely outcome, as it implies that the mother's milk has become harmful to the child due to an external factor."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ma hõikasin ta nime) is the correct answer. Here's why:
The sentence ""Mu sõber pööras pea minu poole"" implies that something is happening to my pool. The word ""pool"" suggests a body of water, so it's unlikely that I would be thinking about naming my hand. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what might be causing this situation."
"Response:  Option B - Kodanikud registreerisid hääletama. 
Explanation: According to the premise, valitsus surus oma kodanikke alla means that something has been registered in a database or system related to the government. This implies that there is some kind of official record or documentation involved, which suggests that option B is more likely. Option A does not provide any specific details about how the information would be collected or stored, so it seems less plausible."
"Response:  Option B - Ta hüüdis abi järele. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta hüüdis abi järele"" means ""The forest was burning."" This option is more likely because it matches the given premise of a fire in the forest."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta tahtis joonistama õppida) is the most likely cause of why Naine reisis välismaale. This is because the phrase ""ta tahtis"" means ""to want to,"" indicating that Naine has a strong desire or motivation to learn something new. The word ""joonistama"" specifically refers to learning or studying, so it's likely that Naine wants to study something in particular. Therefore, Option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta töökaaslane edutati) is the most likely cause of the problem. This is because ""edutati"" means to educate or teach in Estonian, suggesting that the speaker may have been trying to learn how to use a computer but was not successful. Therefore, it is more likely that they were unable to complete their work due to a lack of knowledge or skills rather than being distracted by something else."
"Response:  Option B - Ta mediteeris.
Explanation: The sentence ""Mees nägi tulnukaid"" means ""I saw a light"". This suggests that something bright or shining was visible to the speaker. The phrase ""ta mediteeris"" means ""you are meditating"", which implies that the person being addressed is in a state of deep concentration or inner peace. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the speaker's experience is meditation rather than taking any kind of drug."
"Response:  Option B - Ta pani neisse shampooni. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mehe juuksed muutusid blondiks"" suggests that something has happened to the person's hair, causing it to change color from its original brown to blonde. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as dyeing or bleaching, but it is unlikely that the person simply grew their hair out and it naturally turned blonde. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tundis inspiratsioonihoogu. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Kunstnik lõi uue töö"" suggests that the artist is creating something new, which implies a sense of creativity and inspiration. Therefore, option B - Ta tundis inspiratsioonihoogu (To be inspired) is the most likely cause for the artist's productivity."
"Response:  Option B - Ta läks kõrgkooli. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Poeg kolis kodust ära"" suggests that something has caused a problem or issue in the speaker's home. Based on this information, it is more likely that the cause of the problem is related to something inside the home rather than something outside of it. Therefore, option B - Ta läks kõrgkooli (To clean the big school) is the most likely answer as it implies that the problem is related to dirt or mess inside the home, which could be causing issues for the speaker."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Maavärin raputas raamaturiiulit) is the more likely cause. Here's why:

The phrase ""Raamatud kukkusid raamaturiilust välja"" suggests that something has happened to the eggs in the nest. The word ""raamatud"" means ""eggs,"" and ""kukkusid"" means ""nest."" So, we can infer that the eggs in the nest have been affected or damaged somehow.

Now, let's consider Option A (""Riiulid olid tolmuga kaetud""). This option implies that someone or something has taken the eggs from the nest. However, based on the context provided, it seems unlikely that someone would take the eggs without any explanation or reason. Moreover, there is no indication of anyone entering the nest or taking the eggs away.

On the other hand, Option B (""Maavärin raputas raamaturiiulit"") provides a more plausible explanation for what might have happened to the eggs. ""Maavärin"" means ""worm,"" and ""raputas"" means ""eaten through."" So, this option suggests that worms may have eaten through the eggs in the nest. This is a common occurrence in nature, especially when it comes to bird nests. Birds often lay their eggs in vulnerable locations, such as inside hollow trees or under bushes, where predators like worms can easily access them. Therefore, Option B is the more likely cause of what happened to the eggs in the nest."
"Response:  Option B - Ma lähtestasin automaatkorgi. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mu kodus läks elekter ära"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual has happened in my home. Option B, ""Ma lähtestasin automaatkorgi,"" is a more plausible explanation for this situation as it implies that something electrical in the house malfunctioned, such as an appliance breaking down or short-circuiting. This could cause problems like smoke filling the house or sparks flying, which would be noticeable to me and potentially dangerous. In contrast, Option A, ""Ma panin lambi põlema,"" is less likely given the context of the premise, as it simply means ""My oven broke down,"" which might not necessarily result in any visible effects or danger."
"Response:  Option B - See tundus lõbus. 
Explanation: The premise ""Me sõitsime Ameerika mägedel"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual has happened in America. Option B, ""See tundus lõbus,"" implies a sudden and dramatic change, such as an earthquake or a massive storm, which could be the cause of the unexpected event in America. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ma kuumutasin seda mikrolaineahjus) is a more plausible cause for why I can't get rid of these pesky popcorn kernels in my kitchen. Here's why:

The premise states that there are ""praksuma"" or kernels left over after cooking popcorn. This suggests that the issue is not with the initial popping process but rather with the leftover kernels that refuse to disappear.

Option A (""Ma kallsin võid kotti"") implies that I simply need to clean up the area where the popcorn was cooked. However, this doesn't address the root cause of the problem - the remaining kernels themselves. If I had just spilled some popcorn, I would have already cleaned it up. But since I'm still dealing with stray kernels days later, it's unlikely that the issue is as simple as a messy surface.

On the other hand, Option B provides a more logical explanation for why the kernels won't go away. Kuumutas means ""I heated"" in Estonian, suggesting that perhaps the kernels were exposed to heat at some point during the cooking process. This could have caused them to become stuck to surfaces or difficult to remove through normal cleaning methods.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, Option B is the more likely cause for why those pesky popcorn kernels persist in your kitchen."
"Response:  Option B - Ilmateade ennustas tugevaid tuuli. 
Explanation: The phrase ""ilmateade ennustas tugevaid tuuli"" means ""the weather forecast predicts strong winds"". This option is more likely because the word ""tuule"" (wind) appears in the premise, indicating that the effect will be related to the weather. Additionally, the phrase ""tugevaid tuuli"" specifically implies a strong or gusty wind, which aligns with the meaning of the word ""tuule"" in this context. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta solvas publikut. 
Explanation: The phrase ""ebakorrektseid kommentaare"" suggests that the person has made incorrect comments or statements about politics. This implies that they have expressed opinions that are not accurate or informed, possibly due to a lack of knowledge or understanding of political issues. Therefore, it is more likely that their comments will be met with criticism or ridicule from others rather than being taken seriously or gaining widespread support."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will happen - ""Mu Näöltilkus Higipiisk"". This is because the word ""Näöltilkus"" means ""to make something bigger"", while ""Higipiisk"" means ""to grow"". So, the sentence suggests that the thing being grown (the plant) will become even bigger. Option B, however, does not convey this meaning as ""Sõrmel"" means ""to bend"" and ""Moodustus"" means ""to break"". Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta was hungry) is a more plausible explanation for why the fish died in the aquarium. The phrase ""Kala hulpis akvaariumi pinnal"" suggests that the fish died suddenly or unexpectedly, which aligns with Option A. Additionally, the fact that the fish was not eating (näljane) supports this explanation further. Therefore, we can conclude that Option A is the most likely cause of death for the fish in the aquarium."
"Response:  Option B - Ta jättis suitsetamise maha. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ta jättis suitsetamise maha"" means ""He left his suitcase behind"". This option is more likely because it fits better with the context of the sentence. The speaker mentions that the man left something behind, which makes sense if he was in a hurry or forgot to bring his suitcase. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Lift jäi korruste vahel kinni) is the most likely cause. Here's why:

The phrase ""lift jäi korruste vahel kinni"" suggests that something has lifted or raised the corrugated cardboard box, causing it to become disconnected from its original position. This could be due to various reasons such as a strong gust of wind, a sudden movement, or even an accidental knock.

On the other hand, option A (Lift jõudis määratud korrusele) implies that someone intentionally lifted the corrugated cardboard box using some kind of tool or device. However, there is no context provided in the question to suggest that anyone was involved in lifting the box. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta vanemad panid ta koduaresti) is the most likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

The phrase ""Teismeline hiilis majast välja"" suggests that there is a gap or hole in the wall. This could be caused by various factors such as wear and tear, damage from an impact, or poor construction.

Option A, ""Ta valetas oma vanematele,"" means to take one's own valuables with them. While this could potentially be related to the problem if the person is trying to move their belongings through the gap in the wall, it seems less likely as the main cause of the issue.

On the other hand, Option B, ""Ta vanemad panid ta koduaresti,"" implies that someone has intentionally made a hole in the wall. This could be for various reasons such as to create a secret passageway, to access something on the other side of the wall, or simply out of mischief. Given the context of the situation, this option seems more plausible as the cause of the problem."
"Response:  Option B: Boiler läks katki. 
Explanation: The word ""katki"" in Estonian means ""explosion"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it suggests that the boiler exploded, causing damage to the surrounding area."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Omanik pani kutsikale kaelarihma) is the more likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

The sentence ""Kutsikas püsis omaniku lähedal"" suggests that something has happened to the speaker's stomach, causing discomfort or pain. The word ""püsis"" means ""stomachache,"" and ""lähedal"" means ""problem.""

Option A states that the speaker's stomach hurts because they ate too much food. This makes sense in light of the context provided earlier, as the speaker mentions feeling unwell after eating. It's possible that overeating could cause a stomachache or other digestive issues.

On the other hand, Option B doesn't quite fit with the context provided. While it's true that some people may experience constipation due to various reasons, including dietary changes or stress, it seems less likely that this would be the primary cause of the speaker's discomfort.

Therefore, based on the available information, option A is the more likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta seisis laialivalguva puu all) is a more plausible explanation for why Mees would want to keep his own pee bottle. This is because ""laialivalgu"" in Estonian means ""to save money"", so it makes sense that Mees would want to keep his own pee bottle to avoid buying new ones every time he needs to urinate. On the other hand, option B (Ta seisis rahuliku järve ääres) does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no clear reason why Mees would want to keep his own pee bottle for someone else's use."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will happen - ""Ma helistasin talle tagasi"" (I lost my phone). This is because the phrase ""tudruksõbra telefonikõne"" suggests that the speaker's phone has been stolen or misplaced, which could lead to them feeling anxious or worried about their personal information being accessed without their permission. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Option B - Kallid ehted olid nende kodust kadunud. 
Explanation: The premise states that there are two possible causes for the damage to the bridge: either it was hit by a car or it collapsed due to natural reasons. Since the word ""kallid"" (meaning ""collapsed"") appears in the premise, we can infer that option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Mul oli rinnus kitsas) is a more plausible explanation for why I had to sneeze so much. The phrase ""Rinnus kitsas"" means ""Sinus pressure"" in Estonian, indicating that my sinuses were probably causing me to feel uncomfortable and leading to frequent sneezing. Therefore, option B is the better choice among the two options provided."
"Response:  Option B - Nende tööandja tõstis nende palku. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the employees' motivation has decreased due to their manager's poor leadership style. This suggests that the cause of the decrease in productivity is not related to the employees themselves but rather to external factors such as their manager's behavior. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Soe aroom täitis köögi. 
Explanation: The word ""soe"" in Estonian means ""too"", so the sentence can be translated as ""Too much salt is added to the dish"". This option better fits the given premise, as it implies that too much of something (salt) has been added, rather than just a small amount."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B is a more plausible explanation for why Naisel was so successful in his career. The fact that he worked hard and took risks suggests that he was proactive and willing to put in effort to achieve his goals. This aligns with the idea of taking calculated risks, which can lead to greater success. In contrast, option A does not provide any specific details about how Naisel's personality or behavior contributed to his success. Therefore, based on the provided information, option B seems like a more reasonable explanation for Naisel's achievements.
"Response:  Option B - Ma katsin poti. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ma katsin poti"" means ""My cat ate it,"" which suggests that the speaker's pet animal may have eaten something they wanted to keep safe. This option is more plausible than ""Vesi kees,"" which means ""Water keys,"" as there is no logical connection between water and keeping things safe. Therefore, we can conclude that the most likely explanation for why the speaker's thing is gone is that their cat ate it."
"Response:  Option B - Ma kandsin saapaid.
Explanation: The premise ""Kõik mu sokid olid pesus"" means that all of us are tired. This implies that everyone's energy levels are low, including the speaker's. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will say they feel sleepy (saapaid) than they will start dancing (sandaale)."
"Response:  Option B - Teda süüdistati korruptsioonis (There will be a significant increase in corruption).
Explanation: The premise suggests that politicians are arguing for absurd policies, implying that they are not acting in good faith or with the best interests of society at heart. This could lead to a situation where politicians prioritize their own selfish interests over those of the public, resulting in increased corruption. In this scenario, option B is more likely as it implies that there will be an increase in corruption due to the politicians' motivations rather than any external factors."
"Response:  Option B - Paar põgenes.
Explanation: According to the premise, all parents are tired of their children's crying. This implies that the children are crying frequently, which means they are producing a lot of tears. Therefore, option B, ""Paar põgenes,"" or ""The children produce many tears,"" is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Miljonär panustas selle ehitamiseks. 
Explanation: The phrase ""miljonär panustas"" means ""millionaire invests"". This suggests that the millionaire is actively investing their money in something, rather than simply spending it or letting it accumulate without any purpose. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Müüja aitas tüdrukul leida käekotti, mis talle meeldis. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Müüja ate too much food and got a stomachache because she did not chew her food well enough before swallowing. This option aligns with the information provided in the premise, as it mentions that Müüja had eaten too much food without properly chewing it first. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of Müüja's stomachache."
"Response:  Option B - Sõdurid taasühinesid oma peredega. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the soldiers will retreat back to their own territory rather than attacking again. This is because they have already suffered losses in the previous battle and may not want to risk another defeat. Additionally, the phrase ""taasühinesid oma peredega"" suggests that the soldiers are returning to their own land, implying a sense of retreat or withdrawal."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Paarike vahetas kohtuhoone ees vandeid) is more likely. Here's why:

1. The phrase ""Kohus toetas vastuoluliset kohtuotsust"" suggests that something unexpected or unforeseen has happened.
2. The word ""vahetas"" in Option B implies a stronger and more sudden impact than the word ""puhkes"" in Option A.
3. The phrase ""kohtuhoone ees vandeid"" indicates that the impact was so strong that it caused damage to the entire building.

Therefore, based on the language used in the premise, Option B is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta võttis küpsisted purgist välja) is the most likely cause for why Tüdruk has a stomachache. This is because ""purgist"" means to forcefully evacuate something from one's body, such as food or liquid, through vomiting or diarrhea. Therefore, it is possible that Tüdruk may have forced himself to vomit or have loose bowel movements, leading to his stomach discomfort. Option B (Ta jättis küpsised ahju), on the other hand, does not make sense in this context since ""ahju"" does not refer to any known medical condition or symptom."
"Response:  Option B - Ma tormasin, et sisse jõuda. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ma tormasin, et sisse jõuda"" means ""I will make it happen, I will find a way"". This option suggests that the speaker is determined to achieve their goal, no matter what obstacles they may face. Therefore, this option is more likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Tulekahjualarm läks tööle. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Hoone evakueeriti"" suggests that there has been an emergency or disaster in a home, leading to people being evacuated. In this situation, it is more likely that the cause of the problem is related to the home itself, such as a fire or flood, rather than something external like a lift malfunctioning. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Isa will drink alcohol excessively (Option A). The phrase ""Isa pani poja alkoholismi pahaks"" suggests that Isa has a problem with alcohol consumption, implying that they may be prone to overdrinking or binge drinking. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Option B: Lift oli katki. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Kohtunik läks trepist üles oma kontorisse"" implies that something has happened to the elevator, making it impossible for people to use it. Therefore, option B, ""Lift oli katki,"" is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the grandmother's socks disappeared. The phrase ""tall lõuna"" (big hole) suggests that the socks were eaten away by something large, such as a rodent or other animal. This is a common occurrence in homes where food is stored, especially if there are pets or other animals present. On the other hand, option A (""ta sõber katkestas teda"") does not provide any logical explanation for why the socks would disappear. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kassapidaja andis tüdrukule vahetusraha) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The phrase ""tüdrukule vahetusraha"" suggests that something is being added or mixed into the drink of a person named Tüdruk. This implies that Tüdruk is consuming something, which could be harmful or beneficial depending on the context.

In this case, since the sentence starts with ""Tüdruk andis,"" it's likely that Tüdruk is the one who will experience the effects of whatever is being added to their drink. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.

On the other hand, option B (""Kassapidaja unustas tüdrukule tšeki anda"") doesn't make sense in the context provided. The word ""unustas"" means ""to take away"" in Estonian, but there's no indication that anything is being taken away from Tüdruk. Additionally, the phrase ""tšeki anda"" doesn't form a complete or coherent thought. So, option B is not a viable answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sisenes haiglasse kanderaamil. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta sisenes haiglasse kanderaamil"" suggests that the person has been acting in a way that is not expected or usual for them. This could be due to various reasons such as stress, anxiety, or even a medical condition. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Riik tähistas oma iseseisvust) is the more likely cause. Here's why:

The phrase ""Kodanikud heiskasid oma kodudel riigilipu"" suggests that something has happened to the people of a certain region or country. This implies that there has been some kind of disaster or crisis in that area.

Option A states that the reason for this situation is that the government has not taken care of its own citizens. This could be due to various reasons such as corruption, mismanagement, or lack of resources. It is possible that the government has failed to provide basic necessities like food, shelter, and security to its people, leading to their suffering.

On the other hand, Option B does not provide any specific reason for the people's suffering. It simply mentions that the government has created economic problems, but it doesn't explain how or why these problems occurred. Without further context or evidence, it is difficult to assume that the government was responsible for causing these economic issues.

Therefore, based on the given information, option A seems more plausible as the cause of the people's suffering."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Tiim kaotas turniiri"" suggests that something chaotic or disruptive has happened. In this context, it's unlikely that someone would suddenly become inspired by their own thoughts. Instead, they might feel overwhelmed or confused by the sudden change in their environment. Therefore, option B is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ma tundsin piinlikkust) will occur. The phrase ""toit hammaste vahel"" suggests that something negative or harmful has happened to me, and ""piinlikkust"" means ""worried"". Therefore, it makes sense that I would be worried about what has happened to me. Option B (""Ma tundsin uhkust"") does not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as ""uhkust"" means ""afraid"", which does not necessarily convey the same level of worry as ""piinlikkust""."
"Response:  Option B - Ta unustas õppida. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Poiss kukkus oma ajaloo eksami läbi"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising has happened to someone's grandmother during an examination. Option B, ""Ta unustas õppida,"" means ""To study hard."" Based on the context of the sentence, it is more likely that the person is studying hard for their examination rather than taking a break to relax. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Linna tabas maavärin) is the most likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

* The sentence ""Kesklinna hoone varises kokku"" indicates that there is a problem with the kitchen in the central building.
* Option A suggests that the problem may be caused by a leaky pipe or water damage to the kitchen. This makes sense since a leaky pipe could potentially cause water damage to the kitchen area.
* Option B does not provide any specific details about what might be causing the problem, making it less likely as an answer choice.

Therefore, based on the information provided, option A is the most likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta tutvustas teda oma vanematele) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Mehe tüdruksõber jättis ta maha,"" which means ""He left his home."" This implies that the person in question has already departed from their original location.
Now, if they were to return, it would be logical for them to go back to where they came from, rather than somewhere new. Therefore, Option B is a more plausible outcome.
So, what do you think? Did you agree with my reasoning? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!"
"Response:  Option B - Nad lõid pead kokku. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Nad lõid pead kokku"" means ""They didn't even have time to cry"". This option suggests that the situation was so sudden and unexpected that there wasn't enough time for the people involved to process their emotions or react properly. Given the context of a disaster like a building collapse, this option seems more plausible than the other choice."
"Response:  Option B - Prügikastil oli kaas pealt ära. 
Explanation: The word ""prügikasti"" in the premise suggests that something was thrown or hurled at someone. The phrase ""pealt ära"" means ""thrown away"" or ""discarded,"" so it's possible that whatever was thrown at the person caused them to fall or tumble. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the person fell."
"Response:  Option B: See oli nüri. 
Explanation: The premise ""Poiss teritas pliiatsit"" suggests that something has been broken or damaged. The word ""nüri"" means ""broken"" in Latin, so it is the most likely cause for what happened. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Kleit ei istunud talle. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Kassapidaja has a lot of money but no one wants to work for him because he's always yelling at people. This suggests that his behavior is causing problems in his personal and professional life, rather than any inherent flaw in himself as a person. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - See jättis armi. 
Explanation: The word ""jättis"" in this context means ""giant's"", so the correct answer is option B - See jättis armi. This makes sense given the premise of a giant attacking a small village, as giants are often depicted as powerful and formidable creatures."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta vaatas maha) is a more plausible explanation for why the person's head hurts. This is because ""maha"" means ""hurt"" or ""pain,"" so it suggests that the person may have injured their head in some way. In contrast, ""rääkis endaga"" does not directly imply any specific cause for the pain, but rather refers to the idea of something being stuck inside the person's head. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the provided information."
"Response:  Option B - Laps pani leiva ära. 
Explanation: The premise ""Laps jättis puru põrandale"" implies that something has happened to the child's stomach, making it difficult for them to digest food. The phrase ""pani leiva ära"" means ""the child ate nothing,"" indicating that the child is not hungry or interested in eating. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Naise õde pani käed risti) is the most likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

The phrase ""oma õele salvrätiku"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the person's internal organs, specifically their stomach or digestive system. The word ""salvrätiku"" implies a blockage or obstruction in the digestive tract.

Option A, ""Naise õde pani käed risti,"" means ""the stomach is blocked."" This fits well with the context of the situation, as it suggests that there may be an obstruction in the digestive tract preventing food from passing through.

Option B, ""Naise õde hakkas nutma,"" means ""the stomach is inflamed."" While this could also be a possible cause of the problem, it doesn't quite fit with the information provided in the premise. There is no mention of inflammation in the original statement.

Therefore, based on the available information, option A is the most likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Option B - Ta muretses halva hingeõhu pärast. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Mees võttis münti (Mees lost his money). This means that Mees had something valuable that he lost, such as cash or a valuable item. The phrase ""ta muretses halva hingeõhu"" suggests that Mees' loss was significant and unexpected, implying that he did not simply misplace his belongings but rather lost them in an unfortunate manner. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of Mees' situation."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B seems to be a more plausible explanation for why people go to the theatre. People are drawn to the theatre because they want to experience something new and exciting, not just to watch a play or musical performance. They may enjoy the atmosphere of being in a darkened room with strangers, feeling a sense of community and shared experience. Additionally, attending a live performance can provide an escape from their daily routine and offer a chance to relax and unwind. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response:  Option B - Ta töökaaslane võttis tema vahetuse üle. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta töökaaslane võttis tema vahetuse üle"" means ""To make someone's life worse"". This option is a more likely outcome based on the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta toetas nende üritust) is more likely as it suggests that the activist will take action against something specific, in this case, the government's decision. It implies a sense of urgency and direct action, whereas option B (Ta tembeldas nad hulluks) does not convey any specific or tangible actions. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response:  Option A - Tal oli lavahirm. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Näitleja süda peksis enne etendust"" means ""The teacher gave a test to the students."" In this context, it's unlikely that the teacher would give a test to themselves, so option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ma voltisin kaardi lahti. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ma voltisin kaardi lahti"" means ""I will turn into a cardboard box."" This option is more likely because it makes sense in the context of the premise provided. Turning into a cardboard box would allow someone to hide or disguise themselves, which could be useful for various reasons such as avoiding danger or sneaking past security checkpoints. In contrast, turning into one's own shadow does not provide any practical benefits or advantages that would make it a more plausible choice based on the given premise. Therefore, Option B is the better answer."
"Response:  Option B - See tõmbus krimpsu (The crimp will break).
Explanation: The sentence ""Küps puuvili rippus päikse käes"" means ""The cup of coffee will spill on the table"". As we know that a cup of coffee cannot spill itself, it must be someone or something that causes the spill. Therefore, option B - ""See tõmbus krimpsu"" (The crimp will break) is the most likely answer as it implies that the person holding the cup might drop it due to a broken crimp, causing the coffee to spill."
Response:  Option B - Mootor kuumenes üle (The engine overheated).
"Response:  Option B - Ta jäi mõneks päevaks voodisse. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Mees has been feeling sad for a long time. The phrase ""voodisse"" means ""for a long time"", so it's likely that Mees will continue to feel sad for an extended period of time. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option B - Majas oli külm (Maja's oil spill).
"Response:  Option B - Ta sai uue jõupuhangu. 
Explanation: The premise states that Naine has been feeling tired all day long, which suggests that she might have overworked herself or not gotten enough sleep. However, the option that is more likely to be the cause of her fatigue is ""Ta sai uue jõupuhangu"" (You have a new job). This is because starting a new job can be physically and mentally demanding, especially if it requires long hours or a lot of effort. It's less likely that Naine would feel tired just from sitting at her desk for an extended period of time without any other factors contributing to her exhaustion."
"Response:  Option B - Mu naaberläks kodust ära. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mu naaberläks kodust ära"" means ""My dreams are made of code."" This option is a play on words, combining the idea of dreams with coding. It's a creative and unexpected twist that fits well with the theme of the prompt. Therefore, it's the most likely answer among the two options provided."
"Response:  Option B - Ta abikaasa suudles teda hüvastijätuks. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta abikaasa"" means ""You are frustrated,"" and ""suudles"" means ""to burst."" So, option B is the correct answer because it implies that you are so frustrated that you might burst into tears or have a breakdown. This fits with the emotional tone of the premise, where someone is feeling overwhelmed and unable to cope with their problems."
"Response:  Option B - Õpilane kahtles, kas küsimusele vastata. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the teacher asks a question to the student, but the student doesn't answer it correctly. Therefore, option B is more likely, as the student hesitates or doesn't want to answer the question at all."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
Naisel said ""munad otsa,"" which means ""I will go."" This implies that Naisel has already made up their mind to do something.
The second part of the sentence, ""Ta läks supermarketisse,"" means ""You can go to the supermarket."" This suggests that someone else (not Naisel) is being invited or encouraged to go to the supermarket.
Therefore, based on the context provided, it is more likely that Option B is correct - someone else is being invited to go to the supermarket, rather than Naisel themselves going there."
"Response:  Option B - Ma tegin talle kalli. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Ma will gain weight than lose weight. The phrase ""tallel"" (meaning ""fat"") suggests that Ma has already gained some weight, and adding the word ""kalli"" (meaning ""more"") makes it even more likely that she will continue to gain weight. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - See nägi saastunud välja. 
Explanation: The phrase ""see nägi saastunud välja"" suggests that the speaker has seen something strange or unusual in their dream. It could be a symbolic representation of something that is happening in real life, such as a problem or challenge that needs to be addressed. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the speaker's unease."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ratas oli ära varastatud. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta ratas oli ära varastatud"" means ""The cat was stolen."" This option is more likely because it fits better with the context of the sentence. The word ""õpilane"" (boy) suggests that a young person has lost something valuable, and the phrase ""ilmus klassi läbimärjana"" (in the most important lesson) implies that this loss is significant. Given these clues, it's more likely that the speaker is talking about a stolen cat rather than a dead one."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the user clicks on a link) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the text mentions that the user clicked on a link, indicating that they took an action to navigate to another website. Option B (the user likes a post) does not necessarily imply that the user navigated to another website, as it could simply mean that they liked or shared something on the current platform. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for how the user ended up on the other website.
"Response:  Option B - Ta järgnes tema ees sõitvale veokile. 
Explanation: The premise suggests that there was a problem with the construction of the building, which caused it to collapse. Therefore, option B is more likely as it implies that the collapse was due to a structural issue rather than external factors like an earthquake or storm."
"Response:  Option B - Linad määrdusid (The line was damaged).
Explanation: Based on the premise, it's more likely that the line was damaged than that it was not there. The word ""märjad"" in Estonian means ""damaged"", so option B is a better fit for the given context."
Response:  Option A: Päike oli ere. 
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta soovis, et oleks suvi) is a more plausible explanation for why the cat is not hungry. The phrase ""soovis"" means ""hungry,"" while ""suvi"" means ""full."" Therefore, it makes sense that if the cat has already eaten something, it would not be hungry anymore. Option B (Ta arvas, et see oli ilus) does not make as much logical sense in this context, as there is no clear reason why the cat would not be hungry just because it saw food."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma läksin varakult voodisse) is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:
The sentence ""Ma tundsin end rampväsinult"" means ""I don't feel like doing anything."" The word ""tundsin"" in this context implies a lack of motivation or energy, which could lead to procrastination.
Option A suggests that Ma might have lost interest in something they used to enjoy, such as playing video games. This fits with the idea of feeling unmotivated or disconnected from their usual activities.
Option B, on the other hand, doesn't quite fit with the context provided. While it's possible for someone to feel healthy and energetic despite not wanting to do anything, it's less likely given the negative connotations of the phrase ""don't feel like doing anything.""
Therefore, based on the given information, option A seems more plausible."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Mees läks juuksuri juurde"" means ""My dog learns quickly."" This implies that the speaker's dog is able to learn new things rapidly, which supports Option B. Therefore, we can conclude that it is more likely that the speaker's dog has grown quickly rather than the speaker themselves."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Poiss tervitas oma uut klassikaaslast) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The sentence ""Poiss tegi oma uuele klassikaasla"" implies that Poiss has created a new classic. This means that Poiss has taken an existing classic and made it into something new and original.

On the other hand, option B (Poisile ei meeldinud uus klassikaaslane) suggests that Pois has not created anything new or original. Instead, he has simply found an old classic and presented it in a new way.

Given this context, it seems more likely that Poiss has created a new classic rather than just presenting an old one in a new form. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ma küpsetasin leiba) is a more plausible cause than Option A (Ma sõin küpsiseid). Here's why: The word ""leiba"" in Estonian means ""ice"". So, if someone says ""Ma küpsetasin leiba"", it implies that they have broken or damaged something made of ice. Given the context of the sentence, it is unlikely that the speaker would be referring to their own skin, as there is no logical connection between breaking one's own skin and making ice. Therefore, option B is a more reasonable interpretation of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Juht pani tagurpidikäigu sisse) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The phrase ""Hakkas sadama"" suggests that there is a lot of water in the area, which could lead to flooding or other issues with drainage. The word ""tagurpidikäigu"" means ""to overflow,"" so it's possible that the water is already starting to overflow and cause problems.

In this scenario, Option B makes more sense because it implies that the water is already overflowing and causing damage inside the building. This would be consistent with the idea of a flooded basement or other areas of the building being affected by the excess water.

Option A, on the other hand, doesn't necessarily imply that the water is overflowing inside the building. While ""pani esituled põlema"" does mean ""the water is rising rapidly,"" it could also refer to the water level outside the building increasing due to heavy rainfall or another factor. Without more context, it's difficult to say for sure which option is more likely to occur based solely on the premise provided."
"Response:  Option B - Ma parkisin sissepääsu juude. 
Explanation: The premise ""Hoone parkimisplats oli tühi"" implies that there was a lack of space in the home. Option B suggests that the character will try to find another place to sleep, which is a logical solution to this problem. Therefore, option B is more likely to happen based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ta redigeeris mustandit. 
Explanation: The premise states that Kirjanik ei pidanud mustandi esitamise tähtajast kinni, indicating that something prevented Kirjanik from creating a star chart. Option B provides a plausible reason for this situation, as it suggests that Kirjanik was unable to create the star chart due to their lack of expertise in astronomy or navigation. In contrast, Option A does not provide any logical explanation for why Kirjanik could not create the star chart, making it less likely."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma tahtsin ülevaatajaga rääkida) is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:

The sentence ""Partner katkestas mu kõne"" suggests that there are two parties involved in a conflict or disagreement. The word ""partner"" implies that one of these parties is a close associate or colleague.

The phrase ""ülevaatajaga rääkida"" means ""to take revenge."" This suggests that one party is seeking retribution against the other for some perceived wrongdoing.

Therefore, based on the context provided, it seems more likely that Option A (Ma tahtsin ülevaatajaga rääkida) is the correct answer."
Response:  Option B - Kardinad liikusid (The cat will start to move)
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma võtsin lambi seinast välja) is the most likely cause for the situation described in the premise. This is because the phrase ""lambi seinast välja"" means ""I lit a candle to see better,"" indicating that the speaker was trying to improve their visibility or understanding of something through lighting a candle. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's attempt to see better led to them knocking over an object, rather than simply being careless or clumsy without any intention to do so."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tõstis kangi oma pea kohale. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta tõstis kangi oma pea kohale"" means ""You are taking care of your own business."" This option is more likely based on the given premise because it aligns with the idea of someone being responsible for their own affairs rather than relying on others."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sattus segadusse. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the person has been working in a data room for a long time, indicating that they have become accustomed to the work environment and tasks involved. This suggests that their productivity may not be significantly affected by the new software, as they are already familiar with the job requirements and workflow. Therefore, option B - Ta sattus segadusse (You will get used to it) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Isa vahetas tita mähkmeid) is the more likely cause of Tita's situation. Here's why:

1. The phrase ""Tita jäi magama"" suggests that Tita has been left behind or abandoned, which aligns with Option A.
2. The word ""vahetas"" in Option A means ""to leave,"" which fits the context of Tita being left behind.
3. The phrase ""tita mähkmeid"" refers to Tita's mother, who is no longer present. This further supports Option A as the most plausible explanation for Tita's situation.
4. Option B (""Isa kiigutas titat tasakesi"") does not fit the context as well, as it implies that Isa is causing trouble for Tita rather than leaving her behind.

Therefore, based on the provided information, Option A is the more likely cause of Tita's situation."
"Response:  Option B: Poiss sai läbimärjaks. 
Explanation: The word ""poiss"" in Estonian means ""to boil"". Therefore, based on the given premise, it is more likely that the liquid will be heated to a boiling point (läbimärjaks) rather than becoming frothy (peapõrutuse)."
"Response:  Option B - All pictures will be deleted. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it's more likely that all pictures will be deleted rather than some of them being viewed. The phrase ""kõik keeldusid pildil naeratamast"" implies that every single picture in the camera will be deleted, without any exceptions. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ma olin linnast väljas. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ma olin linnast väljas"" means ""I was in a good mood"". This fits with the premise of the question, as being in a good mood could make someone more likely to share their thoughts or opinions openly. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Ma tegin trenni. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma tegin trenni"" suggests that something is being trained or taught. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause as it implies that the person is learning or training something new."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Vesi nõrgus sellest välja) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The premise ""Ma pigistasin niisket svammi"" implies that something has been accumulated or stored in a swamp. The word ""niisket"" means ""much"" or ""a lot,"" so we can infer that there is a significant amount of something in the swamp.
Now, let's consider Option B: ""Vesi nõrgus sellest välja."" This option suggests that water is flowing out of the swamp. Since the premise mentions a ""swamp,"" it's likely that the water is coming from within the swamp itself rather than entering it from outside. Therefore, Option B is more plausible."
"Response:  Option A - Puhkekeskus oli broneeritud. 
Explanation: The word ""puhkekeskus"" means ""wastewater treatment plant"". Therefore, option A is more likely as it implies that the wastewater treatment plant was already built or constructed beforehand. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no evidence to suggest that a new wastewater treatment plant was built on the island."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta tahtis mässata) is the most likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""ta tahtis mässata"" means ""you have a lot to learn,"" which suggests that the person may not be as knowledgeable or experienced in their field as they claim to be. This could lead to them making mistakes or overestimating their abilities, which would result in the problems described in the premise. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Ma kutsusin politsei. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person will call the police rather than move their car to a different parking spot. The reason for this is that the person is concerned about their safety and security in the current situation, and calling the police may provide them with additional support and protection. On the other hand, moving their car to a different location may not necessarily address the issue of being threatened or harassed, and could potentially put the person in danger if they are unable to quickly return to their vehicle. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice based on the provided information."
"Response:  Option B - Tema vastu ei olnud tõendeid. 
Explanation: The passage states that ""Kurjategija andis end üles,"" indicating that there was a sudden increase in demand for Kurjategija's products. This suggests that an external factor, such as a marketing campaign or a change in consumer preferences, caused the increased demand rather than any internal factors within Kurjategija itself. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Ta vältis kofeiini. 
Explanation: According to the premise, taking a pill can make you feel better immediately. Kofeiini (coffee) is a stimulant that can provide an immediate energy boost, but it may not be the best solution for long-term relief from fatigue. On the other hand, magusa söömise (massage therapy) is a form of manual therapy that can help relax muscles, improve circulation, and reduce stress, all of which can contribute to feeling better overall. Therefore, option B is more likely to have a positive impact on reducing fatigue."
Response:  Option A - Ta libises.
"Response:  Option B - Ta pani oma poja magama. 
Explanation: The premise ""Naisel olid rõngad silmade all"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the food supply chain, causing a shortage of food. This could be due to various reasons such as crop failure, transportation issues, or even an attack on the food storage facilities. Given this scenario, it is more likely that people are resorting to eating whatever they can find, including their own garbage, rather than starving to death. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Option A - Vulkaan purskas. 
Explanation: The premise states that lava flows from a volcano. This means that there must be some sort of eruption or activity occurring at the volcano in order for lava to flow out of it. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause, as it suggests that the volcano is actively erupting and producing lava. In contrast, option B does not provide any explanation for how the lava got into the volcano, so it is less plausible."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tahtis peolt lahkuda. 
Explanation: The premise ""Naine pani kingad jalga"" suggests that something has caused discomfort or pain to someone's stomach. Option B, ""Ta tahtis peolt lahkuda,"" means ""You took a pill for your stomach."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person took a pill to alleviate their stomach discomfort rather than trying to eat everything in sight."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta pidas mind tolliputkas kinni) is more likely. The word ""kinni"" means ""face"" in Estonian, so it's possible that the speaker wants to say something like ""You will make a face at me."" Therefore, Option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Ta raiskas oma varanduse. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Juhataja läks pankrot"" suggests that something has caused a problem or issue for the person in question. Based on this information, it is more likely that the person's home (varanduse) has been damaged or affected in some way rather than their own business (firm). Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option A - Arst oli puhkusel. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mees läks arsti juurde"" implies that there is a problem with the tree's roots. If the roots are damaged or diseased, it can cause the tree to lean or fall over. Therefore, option A - ""Arst oli puhkusel"" (The root was rotten) is the more likely cause of the tree falling over."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Maja põles) is a more plausible explanation for why Magamistoast did not get along with his colleagues at work. The phrase ""põles"" means ""to be bored"" in Estonian, so it's possible that Magamistoast was feeling uninterested or disengaged from his job, leading to conflicts with his coworkers. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Ta määris oma käsi seebiga. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta määris oma käsi seebiga"" means ""You have your own hand in this game."" This suggests that you are actively involved in causing the situation, rather than just being a passive observer. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Option A - Piim maitses hapu (The rain washed away the mud).
Explanation: The premise states that there is a puddle of mud in front of the house, but after it rains, the puddle is gone. This suggests that the rain must have washed the mud away, rather than the sun drying it up. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B - Ma jäin tööle hiljaks is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""Ma jäin höökle"" means ""I stayed at work late,"" indicating that the speaker remained at work beyond their scheduled hours. This implies that they were busy with tasks or projects, making it unlikely for them to have gone home early. Therefore, Option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Option B - Auto purunes.
Explanation: The word ""purunes"" means to clean or wash something thoroughly, so it's likely that if someone wants to get rid of a smell in their car, they would use a strong cleaner like bleach to purune (clean) the interior of the vehicle. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Nad langesid välja. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the two friends are trying to make each other laugh. If they were successful in making each other laugh, it would be more likely that one of them would have won the bet. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma pöörasin pudeli ümber) is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:

1. Word order: In Estonian, the word order is typically Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Therefore, ""Ma pöörasin"" should come before ""pudeli"".
2. Tense agreement: The verb ""poorastan"" in the premise is in the present tense, indicating that the action of pouring is happening now or at some point in the future. To maintain tense consistency, we need to use a present-tense form of ""ma"", which is ""maa"". Therefore, ""Maa pöörasin"" makes more sense than ""Ma pöörasin"".
3. Meaning: When you translate ""Sooda pudel sisises"" into English, it means ""The dog eats poop"". However, when you break down each word individually, ""sooda"" doesn't quite fit with the meaning of ""eat"". Instead, ""sooda"" can mean ""dirt"" or ""mud"", which aligns better with the idea of a dog consuming something dirty or unpleasant. Given this context, option A is more plausible because it involves using the word ""ümber"", which means ""dirt"" or ""mud"".
In conclusion, based on the premise provided, Option A (Ma pöörasin pudeli ümber) is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ronis üles katusele. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Poiss oli oma majast välja lukustatud"" suggests that the person had their own way of thinking or doing things. This implies that they were independent and self-sufficient, rather than being influenced by others. Therefore, option B - ""Ta ronis üles katusele"" (To climb up to the roof) is a more likely outcome, as it represents an action taken independently without relying on anyone else."
"Response:  Option B - Naine piilus läbi ukse võtmeaugu. 
Explanation: The phrase ""uksekell helises"" suggests that something has happened to the person's face, possibly causing it to swell or become discolored. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as an injury, infection, or allergic reaction.
The second part of the sentence ""naine piilus läbi ukse võtmeaugu"" implies that there is some kind of liquid or substance coming out of the person's nose. This could be caused by a cold, allergy, or sinus infection.
Therefore, based on the information provided, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta riputas selle oma kappi) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker will take something from their mother's house without her permission. This action is not in line with the expected behavior of a respectful child towards their parent, and therefore seems less plausible than option A (Ta lasi selle keemiliselt puhastada), which means ""to take care of someone"" or ""to look after someone""."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Hambapasta purskas joana tuubist välja"". This is because the phrase ""pursgas joana"" means ""to eat a lot"", indicating that the person in question has consumed a large amount of food, including the hamburger pasta. Therefore, it is plausible that they have gained weight as a result."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - Protesters will be corralled. The word ""surmad"" in the premise implies a sense of control or containment, suggesting that the authorities will try to restrict the movement of the protesters. This aligns with Option A, where the protesters are corralled rather than allowed to freely express themselves."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta sidus paela) is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:
The phrase ""tüdruk tõmbas äkitselt paela"" suggests that someone has been hit or struck unexpectedly. The word ""tüdruk"" means ""struck,"" and ""tõmbas"" means ""unexpectedly."" Therefore, the sentence implies that something sudden and unforeseen happened to the person.
Now, let's consider the two options:
Option A: Ta sidus paela - This translates to ""He/She took a star."" In this context, it doesn't make sense for someone to take a star, as stars are celestial bodies that cannot be physically taken. Therefore, Option A is unlikely to be the correct answer.
Option B: Pael númer lapsik välja - This translates to ""He/She gave a number of children a slap."" While it's possible that someone could give a child a slap, the use of the word ""pael"" (slap) in this context seems out of place. It would be more common to say ""lapsi väljas"" (child slapped), rather than using the verb ""pael.""
Given these observations, we can conclude that Option A is more likely to be the correct answer: Ta sidus paela."
Response:  Option B - Ta nägi noorem välja (To see a smaller version).
"Response:  Option B - Ma lõin muna katki. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Munast tuli beebikana välja,"" meaning that something has come out of the egg. Therefore, option B, ""Ma lõin muna katki,"" which means ""The chicken hatched from the egg"" is the most likely cause."
Response:  Option A - Ta suri.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta kukkus redelilt alla) is more likely to happen. The word ""kukkus"" means ""to boil"", so it suggests that something will be heated up or cooked thoroughly. In this context, it's more likely that the speaker will say ""Ta kukkus redelilt alla"" than ""Ta ronis redelist üles"", as the former implies a more intense action."
"Response:  Option B - Ta avas soodapurgi. 
Explanation: The word ""soodapurgi"" means a soap bubble in Estonian. Based on the premise ""Laps krooksus,"" which translates to ""The child cried,"" we can infer that the cause of the crying is something related to a soap bubble. Since ""avas"" means ""to open"" or ""to uncover,"" option B is more likely as it suggests opening or uncovering a soap bubble, which could be the cause of the child's crying."
"Response:  Option B - Ma värisesin (My fear increases).
Explanation: The premise ""Külm tuuletõmbus tuli aknast sisse"" implies that something frightening or threatening has come closer to me. In this situation, it is more likely for my fear to increase rather than for me to become calm and relaxed. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sai häid hindeid. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Õpilane sai kolledžisse minemiseks stipendiumi"" implies that the person received a scholarship for their studies abroad. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the person got financial aid to study abroad."
"Response:  Option B - Ta oli temasse armunud. 
Explanation: The premise ""Tüdruk viskas poisi üle nalja"" suggests that something has happened to Tüdruk's drink, causing it to overflow. This could be due to various reasons such as a spill or an accident. However, among the two options provided, option B - ""Ta oli temasse armunud"" is more likely as it implies that the drink was overfilled intentionally, rather than just being spilled or having an accident. Therefore, based on the given information, option B is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option B - Tal ei olnud raha. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Näljane hulkur"" refers to a situation where people are struggling to make ends meet or survive financially. In this context, it is more likely that option B - Tal ei olnud raha (There isn't enough money) is the correct answer. This is because financial difficulties can lead to food insecurity and malnutrition, which is what the word ""hulkur"" implies. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ma tundsin üksindust) is a more plausible cause for why my head hurts. The word ""üksindust"" means ""headache,"" so it's possible that the speaker has a headache due to some reason related to their work or daily activities. Therefore, option B is the better choice among the two options provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ma andsin talle kõrvakiilu) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Mees ulatas mulle oma käe"" suggests that someone has taken something from another person without permission. The word ""ulaatas"" means ""to take away,"" and ""omakäe"" means ""ownership."" Therefore, it implies that someone has stolen something belonging to someone else.
Now, let's consider Option B: ""Ma andsin talle kõrvakiilu."" This phrase translates to ""My heart is aching."" It doesn't make sense in this context because there's no indication of any physical harm or injury. However, the phrase does convey a feeling of sadness or longing, which could be related to the loss or theft of something valuable.
Therefore, based on the given premise and the meanings of the phrases, Option B is more likely to occur – the speaker may be experiencing emotional distress due to the loss of something important."
Response:  Option A - Ilutulestik lasti õhku (The cat scratched the sofa).
"Response:  Option B - Ta oli üllatunud (To have been eaten).
Explanation: The word ""Ta"" in Estonian means ""to eat"", so the sentence ""Ta oli üllatunud"" can be translated to English as ""He/She has been eaten"". This option is more likely based on the given premise because it fits better with the context of a person being missing or lost."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:
The sentence ""Ma pöörasin kalendris lehte"" means ""My calendar is full."" This implies that there are many events scheduled in a short period of time, making it difficult for the speaker to keep track of everything.
On the other hand, Option A suggests that the speaker has too much work or responsibilities, but doesn't provide any specific details about how their schedule is filled. It could mean anything from having too many tasks to complete to feeling overwhelmed with personal obligations.
Option B, however, provides a clear reason for the speaker's busy schedule - a new moon. The phrase ""Oli uue kuu algus"" translates to ""There was a new moon beginning,"" which indicates that the speaker has a lot of activities planned around this event. This fits well with the idea of a calendar being full, as the speaker would need to plan and schedule various events around the new moon.
In conclusion, based on the provided information, Option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why: The sentence ""Ta andis lahutuse sisse"" means ""You are going inside."" This implies that the person is moving from one place (the outside) to another (the inside). On the other hand, ""Ta lasi oma advokaadi lahti"" means ""You drank your own lawyer's lake."" This phrase doesn't make sense in any context, so it's unlikely to be a correct solution. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Option B - Pall helendas (The cat will be scared).
Explanation: The premise ""Tüdruk viskas kummipalli maha"" implies that something unexpected and frightening has happened to the cat. Option B, ""Pall helendas,"" better fits this scenario as it means ""the cat will be scared."" Therefore, we can conclude that the effect of the situation described in the premise is more likely to occur if the cat is indeed scared."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Ta kustutas oma vastuse"" means ""You are likely to forget your own words."" This implies that the person's memory is not reliable or strong enough to remember their own thoughts or ideas, which could lead to confusion or mistakes in communication.
On the other hand, ""Ta aimas vastust"" means ""You are likely to resist."" This suggests a stronger sense of determination or resistance to something, rather than a lack of ability to remember one's own thoughts.
Therefore, based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person will resist or oppose an idea rather than forgetting their own words. So, the correct answer is Option B: Ta kustutas oma vastuse."
"Response:  Option B - Ta vastane kukkus maha. 
Explanation: The phrase ""ta vastane kukkus maha"" means ""to make a big mess."" Based on the premise provided, it's more likely that the person will create a big mess while trying to fix something than they will successfully fix it without making any mistakes. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ma kastsin neid. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma noppisin taime könjest tomateid"" suggests that something has caused a delay or obstruction in the process of making tomato sauce. Option B, ""Ma kastsin neid,"" means ""My hands are full,"" which could be the reason for the delay. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ostis oma tüdrukule šokolaadikomme. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ta ostis oma tüdrukule šokolaadikomme"" means ""You bought your own chocolate bar"". This option is more likely because it aligns with the context of a person buying something for themselves, which fits the theme of self-indulgence in the prompt."
"Response:  Option B - Ilm läks soojemaks. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ilm läks soojemaks"" means ""The ice melts slowly"". This option is a plausible explanation for why the temperature might be rising gradually over time, as opposed to suddenly or rapidly increasing. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B - Maantee muutus ohtlikult jäiseks (The storm will bring a lot of snow) is the more likely option. Here's why:

1. The word ""liikus"" in the premise means ""a lot."" This implies that the storm will be intense and bring significant amounts of snow.
2. The phrase ""linna katus puhuti pealt"" means ""the castle walls are cracking."" This suggests that the storm is strong enough to cause damage to the castle walls, indicating heavy snowfall.
3. The word ""ohtlikult"" in Option B means ""a lot."" This reinforces the idea that the storm will bring a large amount of snow.
4. Finally, the phrase ""jäiseks"" in Option B means ""to freeze."" This implies that not only will there be a lot of snow, but it will also be cold enough to freeze.
Overall, based on the language used in the premise, Option B is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Option B - Ta spikerdas eksamil. 
Explanation: The word ""spikerdas"" in Estonian means to make someone angry or upset. In this context, it's more likely that the person will become angry or upset if they are constantly being criticized or judged harshly, rather than simply feeling hopeless or helpless. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ma keerasin end teki sisse) is a more plausible explanation for why my mom doesn't drink milk. The phrase ""keerasti end teki sisse"" means ""to boil and stew,"" suggesting that she might have cooked or prepared something in advance. This could be a logical reason why there isn't any milk left in the fridge, as it may have been used in another dish or meal. Option A (""ma põlvatisin maas"") does not provide a clear explanation for why there isn't any milk left, and it seems less likely based on the context provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (See muutus säravaks) is more likely to occur. Here's why:

The phrase ""Ma poleerisin kivi"" means ""I will move a stone."" The word ""poleerisin"" is in the first person singular form, indicating that the speaker is referring to themselves moving something.

In this context, the word ""kivi"" could refer to any heavy object or obstacle that needs to be moved. However, since we are considering the possibility of seeing an effect, it's more likely that the object being referred to is small enough to be seen or perceived.

Therefore, option B (""See muutus säravaks"") is more likely to occur because it refers to seeing an effect or change caused by the movement of something small enough to be seen."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Kohv lõhnas tugevalt) will occur. Here's why:
The phrase ""Ma lisasin kohvile suhkrut"" suggests that something has been added to coffee, making it sweeter. The word ""lõhnas"" in Option A implies a negative reaction to this addition, indicating that the person finds it unpleasant or overpowering. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta rebis paberid ribadeks) is more likely to happen because it uses a verb that means ""to spread"" or ""to disperse,"" whereas option A (Ta sai paberi lõikehaava) uses a verb that means ""to say"" or ""to tell."" Therefore, option B suggests that the speaker will spread or disperse something, rather than simply saying or telling something."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Naelläks rooste) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Ma lõin haamriga naela"" suggests that something heavy or unpleasant is happening inside the person. The word ""rooste"" means ""to be sad"" or ""to be depressed,"" so it makes sense that the person might feel down about what's going on inside them. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome based on the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kalamees vinnas kala välja) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Kalamees vinnas"" means ""Kalamees will win,"" indicating that Kalamees has an advantage or edge over something/someone. The word ""vinnas"" in this context implies a competitive situation where one party is favored to emerge victorious.
On the other hand, Option B (""Kalamees viskas"") suggests that Kalamees is giving or offering something, but without any indication of an advantage or edge. This makes it less likely for Kalamees to win or come out on top.
Therefore, based on the given premise, Option A is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B - Tal võetti breketid ära is a more plausible cause for why Teismelisel oli piinlik kooli minna. The phrase ""Tal võetti breketid ära"" means ""Tal had a lot of work to do"". This suggests that Tal was busy with his tasks and didn't have time to attend school regularly, which could be the reason why Teismelisel found it difficult to focus in class. Therefore, Option B is a more likely explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ma kaotasin oma kannatuse) is the most likely cause for why I can't find my keys. This is because the phrase ""Mu kaotasin oma kannatuse"" means ""I messed up my own case,"" suggesting that the speaker may have accidentally misplaced their keys themselves rather than having someone else take them. Therefore, option B is the best answer choice."
"Response:  Option A - Rätik oli märg (Rat was hungry).
Explanation: The premise ""Ma pühkisin oma käed rätikuga"" implies that something happened to Rat's stomach, causing him to feel hungry. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that Rat was feeling hungry due to his empty stomach."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Mees kaotas taburetil tasakaalu,"" which means ""My head is spinning from too much work."" This implies that there is a lot of pressure or stress involved in the person's work, causing their head to spin. Option B, ""Ta kukutas taburetile válvi,"" translates to ""I feel like I'm going crazy from all this work,"" which further reinforces the idea that the person is feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:
The premise states that there are two teams competing against each other in a game. This implies that there is a competition or rivalry between the two teams. The phrase ""kaelatud mängu"" (lost game) further reinforces this idea, as it suggests that one team has lost to the other.
Given these details, it is more likely that option B - ""Nende treener jättis treeningu ära"" (The coach gave up the training area) - is the correct answer. This choice aligns with the scenario of a competition or rivalry between two teams, where one team may have won and the other team's coach may have given up the training area as a result.
In contrast, option A - ""Nad kaotasid mängu"" (Nothing was broken) - does not fit as well with the given information. It does not provide any insight into the context of a competition or rivalry between two teams, and instead seems to suggest something unrelated to the topic at hand."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma kahetsesin oma viga) is the more likely cause. Here's why:
The sentence ""Ma palusin adestust"" means ""My dream came true."" This implies that something positive happened to the speaker, which aligns with Option A.
On the other hand, Option B (""Ma saavutasin oma eesmärgi"") means ""I reached my goal."" While this could also be a positive outcome, it doesn't necessarily fit with the context of the sentence as well as Option A does.
Therefore, based on the provided information, we can conclude that the most likely cause for the speaker's happiness is that their dream came true, which is Option A."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta küsis tema kohta küsimusi) is the most likely cause. This is because the text states that Naisel has been thinking about his own situation, indicating that he may be experiencing some personal difficulties or challenges that are causing him to reflect on his life. It does not seem likely that he would suddenly start talking about other people's situations without any clear reason or motivation. Therefore, option A is the best choice.
"Response:  Option B - Ta naerulohud ilmusid nähtavale. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta naerulohud ilmusid nähtavale"" means ""To make a mess of something visible"". This option suggests that the person will make a mess of something in a way that can be seen or noticed by others. Therefore, this option is more likely to happen based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - See seilas sadamasse. 
Explanation: The phrase ""see seilas sadamasse"" means to see something floating in the sea. This option is more likely based on the premise provided because it implies that something is being seen in the water, which could be a ship or an object. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ta kõndis lompi) is the correct answer. Here's why:
The premise states ""Mees torkas oma jalga,"" which means ""My grandmother has a cat."" This implies that the speaker is referring to their own grandmother and her pet cat.
Option A, ""Ta kõndis lompi,"" translates to ""You hit the dog,"" which does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a dog. Therefore, Option A is the most likely answer based on the information provided."
"Response:  Option B - They led a detective to reveal the truth. 
Explanation: The passage states that the two men ""led a detective to reveal the truth,"" indicating that they were successful in their plan. This suggests that option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The premise states that Maanteel was a thick liquid. This implies that it had a high viscosity or resistance to flowing. When you try to pour something with a lot of viscosity, it can be difficult to get it to flow smoothly and evenly. It may also create a mess or spill over, especially if the container is not large enough to hold all of the liquid. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur - Ma palusin, et mind ära visataks (Ma tried to pour it, but most of it stayed in the cup)."
"Response:  Option B - Paljud inimesed seisid silmitsi töötusega. 
Explanation: According to the premise, if there are many companies operating in a specific field, it is more likely that some of them will go bankrupt. This means that the number of insolvencies (bankruptcies) will increase, which supports option B. In contrast, option A suggests that fewer companies will be liquidated, which may not necessarily lead to an increase in insolvencies. Therefore, based on the given information, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tundis neid oma naabruskonnast ära. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why the bear's fur is wet is that he has been swimming in a lake. This suggests that option B is the correct answer, as bears are not known for their ability to fly or walk on water. Therefore, it is more likely that the bear was swimming in the lake rather than being affected by some other factor such as bad weather."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta tegi sarkastilise märkuse) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ta tegi"" means ""to make fun of,"" so it suggests that the speaker is more likely to use a sarcastic remark in response to being asked to look at something closely. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Juht võttis hääletaja peale. 
Explanation: The premise states that autol sai bensiin otsa, implying that there was a leak in the car's fuel tank. Option B provides the most logical explanation for this situation as it suggests that the owner of the car, Juht, tightened the cap of the fuel tank, effectively stopping the leak. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Naisel oli hommikune iiveldus) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The premise states that Naine has a habit of overthinking things. This suggests that Naine tends to dwell on thoughts and ideas excessively, often to the point of obsessing over them.
In this context, it's more likely that Naine would become fixated on the idea of Tita sündis (Tita's secret) rather than simply dismissing it as nothing important. The fact that Naine finds himself thinking about it repeatedly indicates that he's invested in uncovering the truth behind Tita's mysterious statement.
Therefore, option B (Naisel oli hommikune iiveldus) is the more plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta võttis oma mütsi ära) is the most likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

The sentence ""Mehe müts puhuti ära"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the engine, causing it to make a strange noise. The phrase ""puhuti ära"" specifically implies that there is an issue with the engine's performance or functioning.

Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation. It suggests that the engine may have overheated, which could cause unusual noises and potentially damage the engine. This is a common problem in vehicles, especially during hot weather or when the air conditioner is running.

On the other hand, Option B (""Õues oli tuuline"") does not provide any logical explanation for the problem. ""Tuuline"" means ""cold,"" but it doesn't make sense in this context. There is no indication that the temperature outside is particularly cold, nor would it affect the engine's performance inside the vehicle. Therefore, Option B seems less likely as the cause of the problem."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta sai kutse) is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:

* The sentence starts with ""Tüdruk käis,"" which means ""He/She ate."" This implies that someone has already eaten something.
* The word ""klassikaaslase"" refers to a classic dish or food item.
* The phrase ""sünnipäevapeol"" means ""on a special occasion.""
* Option A (""Ta sai kutse"") makes sense in this context because it suggests that he/she ate something special or luxurious for the occasion.

On the other hand, option B (""Ta ostis kingituse"") doesn't make as much sense in this context. While ""kingituse"" does refer to a type of cake, there's no indication in the sentence that he/she bought or acquired it specifically for the occasion. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the provided information."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ema viis ta parki. 
Explanation: The premise ""Poisi otsmik oli kuum"" implies that something is hot. Option B provides a suitable explanation for this situation as it means ""The mother was visible to the park."" This option better fits the given information than Option A, which means ""The father was angry with the teacher."" Therefore, we should choose Option B as the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta tahtis oma kohtingukaaslasele muljet avaldada) is the more likely cause. Here's why:

The phrase ""Mees pihustas end odekolonna"" suggests that something has happened to the person's head or brain, causing them to feel dizzy or disoriented. The word ""pihustas"" means ""to spin"" or ""to whirl,"" which could indicate a loss of balance or vertigo.

In this context, it makes more sense for the person to experience a sudden change in their mental state due to some external factor rather than simply eating too much sugar. Option A implies that there may be an underlying medical condition or injury that is causing the person's symptoms, while Option B does not provide any explanation for the person's dizziness. Therefore, based on the given information, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Ma võtsin labida kätte. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Maja's electrical appliances are broken"" implies that there has been some kind of failure or malfunction in the devices themselves, rather than just a simple lack of power. This suggests that the likelihood of Maja's lamp breaking down is higher compared to her not using it at all (Option A). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ema sünnitas kaksikud. 
Explanation: The premise states that Pere has a large mass, indicating that he is overweight or obese. This suggests that his weight gain is due to an excessive intake of food, rather than lack of exercise. Therefore, option B, ""Ema sünnitas kaksikud,"" which means ""Mother eats too much,"" is the more likely cause for Pere's weight gain."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta nägi finišijoont) is the most likely cause for why marathon runners experience a decrease in their running speed towards the end of the race. This is because fatigue sets in as they continue to run, causing them to tire out and lose energy. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A (Müügiautomaat sülitas ta vahetusraha välja) is the correct answer. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Poiss lõi müügiautomaati jalaga,"" indicating that something has happened to a car. The word ""jalaga"" means ""happened to.""
Option A suggests that the car's engine was damaged, which could have caused the car to stop working. This seems like a plausible explanation for what might happen to a car.
On the other hand, Option B does not provide any logical explanation for why the car stopped working. It simply states that ""Krõpsukott oli kinni,"" which means ""The cat was sleeping."" This does not relate to the situation described in the premise at all. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Ma tegin talle kalli. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ma tegin talle kalli"" means ""I will make a lot of money"". Based on the premise ""Mu sõbra koer suri"", it is more likely that the speaker will make a lot of money than to become famous. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta maksis sularahas. 
Explanation: The phrase ""lükati tagasi"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, which could be a valuable item like money or a credit card. Given this context, it's more likely that the person will try to recover their stolen property rather than simply writing off the loss. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option A - Ta lõikas oma küüsi (To lose one's mind).
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees vandus"" means ""He lost his mind,"" indicating that the person in question has become mentally unstable or insane. This is a common idiom used to describe someone who has gone crazy or is experiencing mental health issues. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta vend sai õigusteduskonda sisse) is the most likely cause of why Mees tundis oma vene üle uhkust. This is because the sentence suggests that Mees' mother has taken something from her without her knowledge or consent, which could be a violation of trust and privacy. Therefore, it is more likely that Mees feels upset or angry about this situation rather than being happy about receiving something new.
"Response:  Option B - Ta vaatas tähti. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta vaatas tähti"" means ""You will reach the stars,"" which suggests that the person's potential for success or greatness is limitless. This option is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies a positive and optimistic outcome, rather than a limited or constrained one."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma paigutasin postri ukse kohale) is a more plausible explanation for why the poster remained stuck to the wall. This is because ""paigutas"" means ""stuck"" or ""glued,"" indicating that the poster was attached to the wall in some way and did not come off easily. In contrast, option B (""Ma panin kleeplinti postri tagaküljele"") does not provide any clear evidence as to why the poster would remain stuck to the wall. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Arhitekt kohandas plaane.
Explanation: The premise states that a client has hired an architect to design a house. This implies that the architect will create a plan for the house. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Option B - Ta limpsis lusikat. 
Explanation: The word ""limpsis"" in Latin means ""limping"", so it's more likely that the speaker has a limp due to an injury or illness rather than being unable to walk properly because of old age. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Juhatus leidis talle asenduse) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Firma tegevdirector astus tagasi"" suggests that the director of a company has returned home after being away for some time. This implies that the director has been traveling or working outside of their home country, possibly for an extended period.
When someone returns home after a long absence, they may feel disconnected from their work and colleagues. In this scenario, it's possible that the director will struggle to get back into the swing of things at the office, especially if they have been out of touch with their team for an extended period.
Therefore, option B (Juhatus leidis talle asenduse) is more likely to occur, as the director may need time to adjust to their new role and responsibilities upon returning home."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B - Ma Hähenesin Pooldiumile (Ma has been hiding in the pool) is a more likely outcome than Option A - Ma Istusin Tagaritta (Ma has been sleeping all day). This is because the word ""pooldiumile"" suggests that she may have gone to hide or conceal herself in the pool, rather than simply sleeping all day."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ründas kaasvangi. 
Explanation: The word ""kaasvangi"" means ""to be in a state of confusion or disarray"". Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person's mind is in a state of confusion rather than being completely blank. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Maja läks põlema. 
Explanation: According to the premise, if there are too many people in a small space, it can lead to chaos and disorder. This suggests that option B, where the house gets messy, is the more likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Option B - Purk litsuti laiaks. 
Explanation: The word ""litsuti"" means ""to melt"", so option B suggests that the aluminum will melt when exposed to the acid. This is a more plausible explanation given the properties of aluminum and sulfuric acid."
"Response:  Option B - Ta õppis suhtlusoskusi. 
Explanation: The word ""suhtlusoskus"" means ""brainwashing"" in Estonian. Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person will be subjected to brainwashing rather than simply being taught to use a new technology. Brainwashing involves using coercive techniques to alter someone's beliefs or behavior, often for political or ideological purposes. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ma pesin nõud) is a more plausible cause for why someone might not be able to hear music. The word ""pesin"" means ""to block"" or ""to muffle,"" so it's possible that if someone has something blocking their ears, they won't be able to hear music as well. On the other hand, option A (Ma kuulasin muusikat) doesn't make sense in this context, as ""kuula"" means ""to listen,"" but there's no indication that the person can't hear music at all."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Nad korraldasid oksjoni) is more likely. The phrase ""Heategevusorganisatsioon"" suggests that there is a large organization involved in this situation, which means they have the resources and manpower to carry out such an operation. Additionally, the word ""oksjoni"" implies a significant impact or change, which further supports Option B. Therefore, it is more likely that the organization will successfully implement their plan and achieve their desired outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Reisijad karjusid (They will probably get angry). 
Explanation: The premise ""Ameerika mägede rong sööstis järsust langusest alla"" implies that something unexpected or surprising has happened to all Americans. When people are surprised or caught off guard, they may react with anger or frustration. Therefore, option B - Reisijad karjusid (They will probably get angry) is a more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will happen - ""Ma kontrollisin majast lahkudes postkasti."" The reason for this is that the phrase ""ma kontrollisin"" implies a sense of control or agency over one's own actions, while ""ma lõin"" suggests a lack of control or influence over external events. In this case, since the speaker has control over their own actions (by controlling their posts), it is more likely that they will be able to avoid getting in trouble with their boss."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tõusis vara. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees tahtis päikesetõusu"" means ""He wanted to make a big mistake"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it implies that he made a bigger mistake than expected."
"Response:  Option B - Paber kortsus. 
Explanation: The word ""paber"" in Estonian means paper, so the phrase ""paber kortsus"" can be translated to ""the paper gets stuck"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Teiste riikide juhid saatsid hädaabi. 
Explanation: The phrase ""riik elas looduskatastroofi"" suggests that a major disaster has occurred in one or multiple countries. This implies that there will be significant damage to infrastructure, economy, and human life. Therefore, option B - ""Teiste riikide juhid saatsid hädaabi"" (Many countries' economies have been severely affected) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Ta kukkus basseini. 
Explanation: The word ""kukkus"" in Estonian means ""mushroom"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it suggests that mushrooms are the most likely cause of a bad smell in a room."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta laenas selle sõbralt) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. Here's why: The phrase ""See tuli raamatukokku tagasi viia"" suggests that there is a pile of books in front of the door, preventing it from closing properly. This could be caused by someone leaving a stack of books near the door without realizing or intending for them to block the way. On the other hand, ""Ta laenas selle sõbralt"" means ""You took something from there,"" suggesting that someone might have taken something from the area where the books are located, causing the obstruction. Therefore, option B is more plausible based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ta pani toime mõrva. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta pani toime mõrva"" means ""You are taking too much time."" This option is a more plausible explanation for why someone might be late because they are spending too much time doing something else instead of focusing on getting ready or leaving on time. Therefore, this answer choice is the correct one."
"Response:  Option B - Ma tegi ukse lukust lahti. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the person has a cardiac arrest while swimming in the sea. This suggests that they may have overexerted themselves or gotten exhausted due to the physical activity of swimming. Therefore, option B - Ma tegi ukse lukust lahti (I had a heart attack) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will happen - ""Ta parukas tuli ära"". This is because the phrase ""Ma sikutasid petise juukseid"" implies that something bad or unpleasant has happened to the person, and ""Ta parukas tuli ära"" means ""Your hair turned gray"". So, it makes sense that if something bad has happened to the person, their hair might turn gray as a result."
"Response:  Option B - Ta pidas lauset ebaselgeks. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ta pidas lauset ebaselgeks"" means ""You are making a mess with your words."" This option is more likely to be the correct cause of the problem because it suggests that the person's language skills or communication abilities are causing the issue, rather than simply their ability to understand written text."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (the card was declined) is the correct answer. Here's why: The sentence ""Naine pani oma krediitkaardi konto kinni"" means ""My mother has a credit card account with us."" This implies that the speaker has a personal relationship with the bank or financial institution, suggesting that they are familiar with the process of using their own credit cards. If the speaker had forgotten their PIN number, they would be unlikely to use language like ""my mother has a credit card account with us,"" as this would imply that they are speaking about someone else's account. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the context provided in the question."
"Response:  Option B - Nad abiellusid. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees ja naine armusid"" means ""The man and his wife were angry"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it implies that the couple did not get along or had a disagreement, which is consistent with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Option B - Ma komponeerisin oma enda laulu. 
Explanation: The premise states that music was too loud to hear, indicating that there may have been some discomfort or disturbance caused by it. In this scenario, it's unlikely that the speaker would try to increase the volume of the music by adjusting the volume knob themselves, as they might not be able to hear it properly. Instead, they are more likely to try to find a way to reduce the volume or move away from the source of the noise. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Tüdruk tõmbas neid. 
Explanation: The premise ""Poisi juuksed hoidsid püsti"" suggests that something has caused a problem or issue in the past. Option B, ""Tüdruk tõmbas neid,"" implies that the cause of the problem was an action taken by someone (tüdruk), specifically to solve the problem. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma pihustasin endale putukatörjevahendit peale) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman's breasts are sagging than option B (Ma astusin putukale peale). Here's why:
The phrase ""putukas lömastati"" suggests that something heavy or unnatural has been placed on top of the woman's breasts, causing them to droop. Option A implies that this heavy object has been placed inside her bra, while option B simply states that she has been carrying something heavy. Given the context of the sentence, it seems more likely that the heaviness is coming from within rather than outside of the woman's body. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Ma lõõgastusin. 
Explanation: The word ""lõõgastus"" means to be confused or perplexed in Estonian. Based on the context of the sentence, it's more likely that the speaker is experiencing confusion or perplexity rather than anger. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will happen - ""Ma palusin tal see vaiksemaks panna."" The reason being that if there was a sudden increase in demand for music streaming services, it would be more practical to simply increase the price of existing subscriptions rather than creating new ones. Additionally, offering discounted prices for students or seniors could help attract more customers within those demographics without significantly affecting revenue. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided."
"Response:  Option B - Ta teenis alla miinimumpalga. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mehe pere elas vaesuses"" suggests that something has happened to make the speaker's father angry or upset. Option B provides a plausible reason for this anger, as it implies that the speaker's father may have found out about his wife's infidelity. This could be a significant enough event to make anyone angry, especially if it involves betrayal of trust or a breach of commitment. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
Response:  Option B - Ta alustas hobiga (You will start a business).
"Response:  Option B - Värv muutus roheliseks (The color will change to a darker shade).
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Kunstnik segas kollase ja sinise värvi,"" we know that the artist has mixed black and blue paint together. The word ""kollase"" means ""black"" in Estonian, while ""sinise"" means ""blue."" When you mix these two colors together, you get a darker shade of blue, not black. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Vestlus muutus pingeliseks) is a more plausible explanation for why Ma's hair turned white overnight. The phrase ""pingeliseks"" means ""overnight,"" so it suggests that Ma's hair changed color suddenly and unexpectedly. Option A (""Mul said otsa asjad"") does not provide any context or evidence to support the idea of Ma's hair turning white overnight. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ma kohtlesin teda külmalt) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Mu vend sai haiglast välja,"" which means ""My friend said he saw a ghost."" This implies that my friend had an experience or observation that they want to share with me.
In this context, it's unlikely that my friend would make up a story about seeing a ghost just for fun. They might be sharing something they genuinely experienced or witnessed, even if it seems unbelievable.
Therefore, option B (Ma kohtlesin teda könlalt) is more plausible because it suggests that my friend actually encountered something strange or unusual."
"Response:  Option B - Näidendi näitlejad lahkusid lavalt. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker's voice will be amplified through a loudspeaker system, making it more likely that their voice will reach a larger audience in a public space like a park or square. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Inimröévija ähvardas pantvangile haiget teha) is a more plausible explanation for why Pantvang might be struggling to get his work done. This is because it suggests that Pantvang's mind is elsewhere, distracted by something else, rather than simply being lazy or unmotivated. The phrase ""inimröévija"" specifically implies that Pantvang's thoughts are elsewhere, perhaps occupied with another task or activity. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Muusik lõi tagus trummi. 
Explanation: The word ""lõi"" in Estonian means to hit or strike something, so it's likely that the musician struck a drum with their instrument rather than put it on top of something. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Laps ärkas õudusunenäo pealt karjudes üles) is the more likely cause. Here's why:

The phrase ""Vanemad kiirustasid oma lapse magamistuppa"" suggests that the child's parents are responsible for their happiness. The word ""kiirustasid"" means ""to take care of,"" implying a sense of responsibility or duty towards one's child.

In contrast, Option B (""Laps kartis oma voodi alla vaadata"") implies that the child themselves has control over their own happiness. The word ""kartis"" means ""own will,"" suggesting that the child has agency in determining their own emotional state.

Given the context of the sentence, it seems more plausible that the child's happiness is dependent on their parents' actions rather than their own free will. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta sündis enneaegselt) is the more likely cause. Here's why:
The word ""viipekeeles"" in the premise suggests that something has gone wrong or is not functioning properly. The phrase ""enneaegselt"" means to fix or repair something, so it makes sense that the speaker might suggest fixing whatever is broken rather than simply getting rid of it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what the speaker might mean."
"Response:  Option B - Saak hävis. 
Explanation: According to the premise, piirkonna's water supply has been contaminated with a deadly virus that causes rapid brain damage and death within hours of exposure. This means that if someone drinks the water, they will most likely die from the virus, making option B the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Lind püüdis ussikese kinni. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Lind püüdis ussikese kinni"" means ""The wind blew away the sand."" This option is more likely because it matches the given premise of ""Kass jahtis lindu,"" which means ""There was a strong wind."" Therefore, the sentence ""Lind püüdis ussikese kinni"" makes sense in this context."
"Response:  Option A - Koolist oli suveks vabadus. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Tüdruk vahetas kooli"" means ""The teacher teaches the class."" In this case, the subject of the sentence is ""Tüdruk,"" who is performing the action of teaching. Therefore, option A is the correct answer because it suggests that the reason for the teacher's happiness is that he or she has freedom to teach."
"Response:  Option B - Töötajad streikisid. 
Explanation: The premise suggests that there are two opposing groups with conflicting interests, and both sides have a strong desire to achieve their goals. In this scenario, it's more likely that the workers will go on strike rather than naming a new leader for the protest movement. Going on strike is a common form of collective action used by workers to pressure employers or governments to address their demands, so it aligns better with the given information."
"Response:  Option B - Ekstramistid mörvasid ta. 
Explanation: The premise states that extremists have taken over their own country. This implies that they have gained control of their government or political system, which means they are in a position to make decisions and take actions that affect their society. Therefore, it is more likely that they would be able to implement policies that align with their ideologies rather than opposing them."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The sentence ""Ma kõndisin paljajalu rannal"" means ""I threw a stone into the sea."" This implies that something was thrown from land into water, which suggests that the action took place on dry ground or near the shore.
Now, let's consider Option A: ""Liiv jäi mu jalgade könge."" This translates to ""Lived remained on the sandy beach."" However, since we know that something was thrown into the sea, it's unlikely that anything remained on the beach afterward. Therefore, this option is less plausible.
On the other hand, Option B: ""Laened laksusid mööda kallast"" means ""Waves covered the stones."" This makes sense in the context of throwing something into the sea, as waves would eventually cover any objects that were thrown in. So, based on the given information, Option B seems more likely to occur."
"Response:  Option B - Ma jõin klaasi vett. 
Explanation: The word ""jõin"" in Estonian means ""to pour"", so the sentence ""Ma jõin klaasi vett"" can be translated to English as ""She poured water into the bucket"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Ta poeg irvitas. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ema vaigistas oma poega"" suggests that something happened to Ema's mother (oma). Therefore, option A is more likely, as it implies that Ema's mother passed away (irvitas). Option B does not make sense in this context, as there is no indication of Vingus being a person or thing related to Ema's mother."
"Response:  Option A (Ma panin oma pükste luku kinni) is the most likely cause based on the given premise. Here's why:

The premise mentions ""mu pükstesse rebenes auk,"" which means ""my stomach hurts."" This suggests that the speaker is experiencing abdominal pain or discomfort.

Option A, ""Ma panin oma pükste luku kinni,"" translates to ""My grandmother's bread stuck in my throat."" This implies that the speaker has accidentally swallowed something hard or large, like a piece of bread, which could potentially get stuck in their throat and cause discomfort or pain.

On the other hand, Option B, ""Ma kukkusin asfaltil pikali,"" translates to ""My head is spinning from too much sugar."" While it's possible to experience dizziness or lightheadedness after consuming too much sugar, this doesn't seem to be directly related to the abdominal pain mentioned in the premise.

Therefore, based on the information provided, Option A is the most likely cause for the speaker's discomfort."
"Response:  Option B - Ta hambad muutusid sirgeks. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Poiss kandis breketeid,"" which means ""The cat's paws are broken."" This implies that the cat has been injured or harmed in some way. The phrase ""Ta hambad muutusid sirgeks"" suggests that the cat's paws have been broken or damaged, which would make it difficult for the cat to walk or perform any physical actions. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Maärkasin täna üles valusakurguga. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker will get hurt while trying to climb a mountain than while trying to climb a wall. The word ""kurguga"" (mountain) implies a much higher level of difficulty and danger compared to the word ""valusakurguga"" (wall), which is shorter and less challenging. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Teised õpilased lõunalauas tundsid end kõrvalejäetult. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the students are from different countries. This means that they have different cultures, beliefs, and values. When they come together for a study trip, their differences can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Option B - Ta otsustas saltod proovida. 
Explanation: The premise ""Laps maandus batuudile"" suggests that something has been accumulating or building up over time. Therefore, it is more likely that the effect will be a result of this buildup rather than an immediate change. In this case, option B - ""Ta otsustas saltod proovida"" (You will burst out crying) aligns better with the premise as it implies a sudden release of emotions after a period of build-up."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Postkontor toimetas kirja kohale"". This is because the phrase ""toimetas"" means ""to handle"" or ""to manage"", indicating that the post office will take care of the book delivery. Additionally, the word ""kohale"" implies a physical location where the book will be delivered, such as a mailbox or a specific address. Therefore, it is more likely that the post office will deliver the book directly to its intended recipient rather than sending it through the postal service."
"Response:  Option B - Ta läks koju pankrotis. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ta läks koju pankrotis"" means ""Take a look at that cake."" It's a common phrase used to express admiration or appreciation for something delicious-looking. Given the context of the premise, it's more likely that the speaker would use this phrase than ""Ta vedas kihla kogu oma raha peale,"" which means ""Take your time to enjoy your own money."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B (Süütajad tabati) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. Here's why:

The phrase ""Metsatulekahju levis"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the engine or motor of the vehicle. The word ""levis"" means ""broken"" in Estonian, so it's clear that there's a mechanical issue.

Option A, ""Tuuled muutusid tugevamaks,"" doesn't make much sense in this context. While ""tuuled"" does mean ""to change,"" the word ""muutusid"" specifically refers to changes made intentionally or deliberately, not unintentional ones caused by a malfunctioning engine. Additionally, ""tugevamaks"" isn't a valid Estonian word.

On the other hand, Option B, ""Süütajad tabati,"" makes perfect sense given the situation. ""Süütaja"" means ""engine"" in Estonian, and ""tabati"" means ""overheats."" So, it's possible that the engine overheated due to some issue, causing the car to break down.

Therefore, based on the provided information, Option B is the most likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Lapsel tuli põlve pealtnahk maha."" This means that something (the egg) has fallen into a deep hole.
Option A suggests that the mother will catch the egg. However, since we are dealing with a deep hole, it is unlikely that the mother would be able to reach the egg even if she tries. Therefore, Option B is more likely to happen - the mother will have to find another way to get the egg out of the hole."
"Response:  Option B - Talle siirdati elund. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees elas surmava haiguse üle"" suggests that there was a suspicion or an assumption made about something being above. In this case, it's more likely that the person assumed that there was something hidden or secretive about their neighbor's behavior rather than assuming they were sick. Therefore, option B - Talle siirdati elund (To hide something) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ma hammustasin keelde) will occur. The phrase ""hammustasin keelde"" means ""I drank the whole bottle,"" indicating that the speaker consumed a large amount of alcohol in one go. This could lead to various negative effects such as intoxication or even poisoning, depending on the quantity and type of alcohol consumed. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Kirjanik vältis oma lugudes eelarvamusi) is a more plausible cause for why the toimekrager did not finish the book. This is because the phrase ""oma lugudes eelarvamusi"" suggests that the toimekrager had personal reasons or motivations for not finishing the book, rather than simply being unable to do so due to external factors. Therefore, option A is a more likely explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma magasin terve päeva) is a more plausible explanation for why Ma doesn't understand anything. This is because ""magasin"" means ""storehouse"" in Estonian, so it suggests that Ma may not have access to the necessary resources or knowledge to comprehend what is being said. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option A - Ta tuvastas patsiendi sümptomid. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the patient has not been diagnosed with any disease yet. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the patient's symptoms have not been properly evaluated or diagnosed."
"Response:  Option B - See sügeles. 
Explanation: The word ""sügeles"" means ""a lot of work"". Based on the premise ""Ma kratsisin oma nahka"", we can infer that the speaker has a lot of work to do. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option A - Ta kaotas kannatuse (Cause chaos). 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the group created a distraction to disrupt the operation rather than creating an entirely new identity for themselves. The phrase ""ta kaotas kannatuse"" suggests causing chaos or confusion, which aligns with the idea of creating a diversion to interfere with the operation. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta painutas oma käsi) is the most likely cause. Here's why:

The sentence ""Mehe käelihased olid punnis"" means ""My hands were itchy."" This suggests that there was some kind of discomfort or irritation in the speaker's hands.

Option A states that the speaker scratched their own hand, which could potentially relieve the itchiness. It makes sense that someone might try to scratch their own hand if they are experiencing discomfort or irritation there.

On the other hand, Option B does not make as much logical sense. If the speaker had a dog with an itchy spot, it would be unlikely for them to say that they scratched their own hand instead of the dog's itchy spot.

Therefore, based on the given information, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Option A - Ta oli üllatunud (It was already broken).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to be the cause of Ma's headache. The premise states that Ma has been working too much lately, which could lead to physical strain or fatigue, causing a headache. This is more plausible than option A, as there is no logical connection between Ma's colleagues being annoying and Ma experiencing a headache. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta hakkas varem árkama) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The phrase ""Mees jättis suitsetamine maha"" suggests that something big or significant has happened to the speaker. The use of the word ""jättis"" implies a grand or impressive scale.
In this context, it's unlikely that the speaker would suddenly start talking about their small or insignificant problems ( Option A - Ta hakkas rohkem trenni tegema). Instead, they are more likely to focus on the bigger issue at hand (Option B - Ta hakkas varem árkama), as it aligns with the magnitude of the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ründaja hakkas veritsema. 
Explanation: According to the premise, naine lõi oma ründajale vastu nina. This means that Naine has taken responsibility for her own life. As a result, she is more likely to take control of her situation and make decisions that align with her values and goals, rather than blaming others or feeling helpless. Therefore, option B - Ründaja hakkas veritsema is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Mehe sihtimine oli mööda) is a more plausible explanation for why the man was late to work than option B (Mees kaotas mängu). Here's why:
The phrase ""mehe sihtimine oli mööda"" suggests that there was something wrong with the man's sight or vision, which could have caused him to be late to work. This could include things like poor eyesight, a head injury, or even a temporary blindness.
On the other hand, option B (""Mees kaotas mängu"") doesn't provide any specific reason as to why the man might be late to work. It simply means ""You messed up,"" without providing any context or explanation. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems more likely that the man was late due to an issue with his sight rather than some other unspecified problem."
"Response:  Option B - Ta pidas oma toas sipelgafarmi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the cause of the problem is that the farmer has too much manure in his field. This suggests that the excess manure is causing the weeds to grow out of control, rather than the farmer not having enough manure to fertilize the crops. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B seems to be a more plausible explanation for why my neighbor's dog barks at me every night. The sentence ""Mu külaline jäi lubatuks kauemaks minu juurde"" suggests that there might be some kind of conflict or tension between your neighbor and their dog, which could lead to the dog barking excessively when it sees you. This is supported by the fact that the word ""lubatuks"" means ""hate"" in Estonian, implying that the dog has negative feelings towards you. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the dog's behavior."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ostis omale uue päeviku. 
Explanation: According to the premise, if you want to avoid having a boring day, you should buy a new book. This suggests that buying a new book will have a positive impact on your day and make it less boring. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The sentence ""Naisel jäi üürirahast puudu"" means that Naissel was left in a difficult situation or predicament. The word ""puudu"" has a negative connotation, implying that something undesirable happened to Naissel.

In this context, it makes sense that Naissel would want to find a way out of the problem. Option B, ""Ta tuli töölt ära,"" suggests that Naissel tried to find a solution to his problem. This option implies that Naissel took action to address the issue he was facing.

Therefore, based on the given information, option B is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Option B - Ta patsutas kutsika pead. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta patsutas kutsika pead"" means ""You are hitting your head against a wall."" This option is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the given premise of ""Laps tõmbas käe kähku tagasi,"" which translates to ""The baby is crying nonstop."" Hitting one's head against a wall could be a possible reason for prolonged crying in a baby, making this option the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Option B - Nad saatsid klientidele küsimustiku laiali. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the company's clients are dissatisfied with their current service provider. This suggests that they are experiencing problems or issues with their current provider, such as poor communication, unresponsiveness, or lack of expertise. Therefore, it is more likely that the company will lose its clients to a competitor who can offer better services or solutions."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Poiss vedas tooli mööda põrandat) is more likely. The word ""tooli"" in this context means ""to eat"", so it suggests that the reason why puppies are not born with teeth is because they don't need them for eating. This makes sense since puppies rely on their mother's milk for nutrition rather than solid food. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Mu vaenlane ajas rusika püsti. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma varjasin oma nägu"" means ""I saw my own shadow"". This suggests that the speaker has seen something themselves, rather than someone or something else causing it. Therefore, option B - ""Mu vaenlane ajas rusika püsti"" (My shadow moved away) is a more likely cause for what the speaker saw."
"Response:  Option B - Inimesed tulid seda austama. 
Explanation: The premise ""Kuulus kuju põles maha"" suggests that something has caused a great disturbance or disruption in the world. Option B provides a plausible explanation for this disturbance, stating that it was caused by people's thoughts and desires. This option aligns with the idea of the power of thought and intention in Estonian mythology, where the actions and intentions of individuals can have significant effects on the world around them. Therefore, based on the given premise, Option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Kärbsed kihasid puuvilja ümber.
Explanation: The word ""kihas"" in Estonian means to grind or crush something into small pieces. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the corn will be ground into smaller pieces before being used for animal feed."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta sirutas oma varbad välja) is the most likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

The phrase ""Baleriin tõmbas sideme ära"" suggests that there is a conflict or issue between two parties, and one party wants to take action against the other. The word ""tõmbas"" means ""to take sides,"" so it implies that one party is taking sides in the conflict.

In this context, Option A makes sense because it suggests that the person is trying to take their own side in the conflict. This could mean they are trying to defend themselves or protect their interests in the face of opposition from the other party.

On the other hand, Option B does not fit as well with the given information. The phrase ""ta väänas oma hüppeliigese välja"" means ""to take someone else's property without permission."" It does not make sense in the context of the conflict described earlier, where one party is trying to take sides against another. Therefore, Option B is less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta jooksis mänguvaljakul ringi) is a more plausible cause for why people are not using their vacation days. This is because it highlights a specific reason why people might be hesitant to use their vacation time, such as feeling overwhelmed with work or having too much on their plate. It also implies that there may be a sense of obligation or pressure to keep working rather than taking breaks, which could be a common experience for many individuals. In contrast, Option A (Ta õppis, kuidas neid siduda) does not provide a clear explanation for why people are not using their vacation days and seems less relevant to the situation.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B - ""Ma kaotasin ajataju"" (I confused my thoughts) is a more likely outcome than option A - ""Ma viisin raamatu tagasi"" (My thoughts are clear). This is because confusion often leads to disorientation and difficulty in thinking clearly, making it harder to focus one's attention."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta vanemad mõjutasid teda) is the more likely cause. Here's why:
The sentence ""Mees uskus sarnastesse asjadesse nagu tema vanemad"" suggests that something unexpected has happened to someone, and the speaker is trying to make sense of it. The phrase ""teda mõjutasid"" implies a sudden or unexpected change in circumstances, which aligns with Option A.
On the other hand, Option B (""Ta vanemad tõukasid ta ära"") doesn't quite fit the context. While it's possible that someone might become famous overnight due to their talents or achievements, the sentence doesn't provide enough information to support this idea. Therefore, we can rule out Option B as the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option A - Sel sai bensiin otsa. 
Explanation: The premise ""Auto aeglustas tasapisi kuni peatumiseni"" suggests that there was an accident involving a car, which caused damage to the tires. Option A, ""Sel sai bensiin otsa,"" means ""The driver had a flat tire."" Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option B - Jäätis tilkus koonuse otsast. 
Explanation: According to the premise, if Mees says something that sounds like a joke but isn't actually funny, it will be perceived as annoying or frustrating rather than amusing. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as it suggests that people are more likely to find Mees' statement annoying than entertaining."
"Response:  Option A - Vaip nägi must välja (We can see the musty smell).
Explanation: The premise ""Ma riputasin kunsti tuppa"" suggests that there is a strong odor coming from the art studio. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation by stating that we can see the musty smell. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Mu ülemus korraldas koosoleku. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Mul oli peavalu"" means that something was easy for him/her to do. However, the phrase ""korraldas koosoleku"" suggests that there are obstacles or difficulties in the way of achieving something. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Omanik andis kutsikale maiust. 
Explanation: The word ""kutsikas"" means ""to be angry"", so the sentence ""Kutsikas tegi vaiba täis"" can be translated to ""He/She was angry"". In this case, option B is the correct answer because it implies that the person's anger will increase, which makes sense in the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Mu sõber läks marru) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Ma vabandasin oma sõbra ees,"" which means ""My mother has a big head."" This implies that the speaker's mother has an unusual or abnormal feature, in this case, a large head.
Now, consider Option A: ""Mu sõber andestas mulle."" This translates to ""My head fits inside my mother's."" While it may seem amusing at first, it doesn't make logical sense when you think about it. How could someone's head fit inside their mother's head, especially if their mother has a large head as stated in the premise? It would be physically impossible.
On the other hand, Option B provides a more plausible explanation: ""Mu sõber läks marru."" This translates to ""My head looks small compared to my mother's."" Given the context of the premise, it makes sense that the speaker's head might appear smaller next to their mother's larger-than-average head. So, based on the information provided, Option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that people will invest in a sustainable future (Option B). The phrase ""rahva hulgast silma"" translates to ""the common good of the environment,"" indicating that individuals are prioritizing environmental sustainability over personal gain. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Teda süüdistati valetunnistuse andmises. 
Explanation: The phrase ""tunnel vision"" implies a narrow focus or concentration on one particular aspect of something, often to the exclusion of other important details. This can lead to a biased or limited perspective that may not accurately reflect the full complexity of the situation. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur as it suggests a deliberate attempt to limit oneself to only considering one side of an issue, rather than taking a broader view."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta tahtis sisse sulanduda) is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:
The phrase ""Naine värvis oma juuksed ära"" means ""Her eyes are her own reward."" This suggests that the speaker believes the woman in question values her own dignity or self-respect above all else.
In this context, Option B makes more sense because it implies that the woman has chosen to prioritize her own well-being over any potential romantic relationship with the speaker. By saying ""Ta tahtis sisse sulanduda,"" the speaker acknowledges that they cannot force the woman to feel a certain way or act in a particular manner. Instead, they must respect her boundaries and allow her to make her own decisions about how she wants to handle things.
Option A, on the other hand, does not necessarily convey this same level of respect for the woman's autonomy. While it may suggest that the speaker is willing to wait for the woman to come around, it also implies that they have some degree of control over the situation, which goes against the idea of valuing the woman's dignity above all else."
"Response:  Option B - Nad saadeti riigist välja (Not to get along with the government)
Explanation: The premise suggests that immigrants face difficulties in finding a job and settling down in Estonia. Given this context, it is more likely that they will have a negative interaction with the government, such as facing challenges in obtaining residence permits or experiencing discrimination. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Option B - Publik tõusis püsti. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Avalik esineja viskas nalja"" suggests that something big and important has happened or is about to happen. In this context, it's more likely that a major event will occur rather than nothing happening at all. Therefore, option B - Publik tõusis püsti (Publik will be surprised) is the better choice as it implies that there will be an unexpected turn of events."
"Response:  Option B - Päike päevitas mu nahka. 
Explanation: The phrase ""päike päevitas mu nahka"" means ""the earth will be covered in darkness"". This option suggests that the earth will be completely darkened due to the destruction caused by the meteorite impact. It's a more dramatic and catastrophic outcome compared to the other option, where only part of the planet might be affected. Therefore, we can conclude that Option B is more likely based on the given premise."
Response:  Option A - Ma mühatasin.
"Response:  Option B - Steil oli toores. 
Explanation: The word ""toores"" means ""troublesome"" or ""bothersome"". Based on the context of the sentence, it's more likely that Steil was causing trouble for Nuga rather than being in a difficult situation himself. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B - Tal oli hiigelsuur võlg (Tal was very hungry) is the most likely cause for Naine's stomachache.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Mu sõbra korteris põlesid tuled."" This implies that something (the wind) has caused the branches of a tree to bend or lean towards each other.
Now, let's consider option A: ""Ma tundsin huvi, et kas ta on väljas."" This translates to ""I feel like there is something heavy hanging over me."" While this could be interpreted as a feeling of sadness or depression, it doesn't necessarily relate to the situation described in the premise.
On the other hand, option B: ""Ma otsustasin talle külla minna"" means ""My ears are ringing with a loud noise."" This could potentially be related to the situation described in the premise, as a loud noise might cause the branches of a tree to bend or lean towards each other. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Lille kroonlehed tulid ära) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The phrase ""Ma panin lille oma nina alla"" means ""My little grandmother has gone crazy."" This implies that something unexpected or unusual has happened to the speaker's grandmother.

In this context, the word ""tulid"" (meaning ""went"") suggests a sudden change in the grandmother's behavior or state of mind. The use of the word ""kroonlehed"" (meaning ""crazy"") further reinforces the idea that something unusual has occurred.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Lille kroonlehed tulid ära) will occur than Option B (Ma tundsid lillelõhna)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ta kohtas lapsepõlvesõpra) is more likely to be the cause of Naine's nostalgia. Here's why:

The phrase ""Naine tundis end nostalgiliselt"" suggests that Naine has been feeling a strong sense of nostalgia lately. The word ""tundis"" means ""to long for something,"" so it implies that Naine misses something from their past.

Option A states that Naine's nostalgia might be caused by them thinking about their childhood home. This fits with the idea of Naine missing something from their past, as they may have fond memories of their childhood home.

On the other hand, Option B does not provide any specific reason for Naine's nostalgia. It simply says that Naine's nostalgia might be caused by them finding an old photograph or memento from their past. While this could certainly trigger nostalgia in some people, it doesn't necessarily explain why Naine feels particularly nostalgic at this moment.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, Option A seems like the more likely cause of Naine's nostalgia."
"Response:  Option B - Ta esitas poolelioleva kirjatöö.
Explanation: The phrase ""kirjatöö"" means book in Estonian, so it's unlikely that someone would write a book about books themselves. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ma helistasin mehaanikule.
Explanation: The sentence ""Mu auto läks katki"" means ""My car broke down."" In this context, it's more likely that the speaker will need to call a mechanic (mehanik) to fix the problem rather than go back to school (kaubanduskeskus). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - See oli illegaalne. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma heitsin märkuse kõrvale"" implies that something has happened to a mark (a brand or product) that was previously known for its quality. This could be due to various reasons such as poor manufacturing practices, use of low-quality materials, or even illegal activities like counterfeiting. Therefore, option B - See oli illegaalne (It was illegal) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tõusis ülespoole. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Lind laksutas oma tiibu"" suggests that someone has a lot of money or assets invested in something, but the wording is vague enough to leave room for interpretation. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine whether this person will make a profit or lose money. However, given the choice between two possible outcomes, option B seems more likely because it implies a greater increase in value. If the person's investment grows significantly, they may experience a substantial gain, leading to a higher probability of choosing option B."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Garaaž oli lahti) is a more plausible explanation for why there are no birds in the forest. The word ""lahti"" means ""bay"" or ""gulf"" in Estonian, indicating that the forest may be located near a body of water. This could explain why there are no birds in the area, as many bird species rely on coastal areas for food and shelter. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - Kurjategija pani relva maha (Kurjategija suunas oma relva ohvri peale). This is because the phrase ""suunas oma relva"" means ""own strength"", which implies that Kurjategija has control over its own abilities and can use them to overcome obstacles. Therefore, it is more likely that Kurjategija will be able to overcome the obstacle of the river and cross it successfully."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is a more likely cause for why Mul was planning to take his own life. The phrase ""plaanis oma sõbra pulma minna"" suggests that Mul had made up his mind to commit suicide, which aligns with Option B. Therefore, the answer is (B) Mul oli plaanis oma sõbra pulma minna."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Mul iiveldas) is the most likely cause. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Ma kaotasin ajataju,"" which means ""My head hurts."" This suggests that there might be some discomfort or pain in the person's head.
Option A (""Ma unistasin"") implies that the person has a headache, which could be caused by various factors such as stress, fatigue, or illness. However, it does not provide any specific information about the nature of the headache.
On the other hand, Option B (""Mul iiveldas"") specifically mentions ""iiveldas,"" which means ""dizziness"" or ""vertigo."" This suggests that the person may be experiencing a spinning sensation or feeling lightheaded, which could be caused by a variety of factors including inner ear problems, medication side effects, or even a concussion.
Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, Option B is the most likely cause for the person's symptoms."
"Response:  Option A (Printeris oli vähe tinti) is the most likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

The phrase ""printis loetamatult"" suggests that the printer is not printing properly or at all. The word ""loeta"" means ""to print,"" so the sentence can be translated to English as ""the printer is not printing.""

Option A, ""Printeris oli vähe tinti,"" implies that there is something wrong with the printer itself, such as it being clogged or damaged. This option does not suggest any external factors that could be causing the issue, like a paper jam or low ink levels. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is more likely that the printer simply stopped working due to an internal problem.

On the other hand, Option B, ""Printeris oli paber otsas,"" suggests that there is a problem with the paper being fed into the printer. This option implies that the paper is somehow stuck or blocked, preventing the printer from functioning correctly. While this could certainly cause printing issues, it seems less likely given the context of the sentence.

In conclusion, based on the premise provided, Option A is the most likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Option B - Fännid tormasid väljakule. 
Explanation: The word ""tormas"" means to storm or to attack violently in Estonian. Given the context of the sentence, it's more likely that the speaker will use this option as they are describing a violent act. Option A, ""Fännid pöörasid lipu poole"", means to fan out and spread something, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B."
"Response:  Option B - Ma panin soola juurde. 
Explanation: The phrase ""ma panin soola juurde"" means ""my bread is in the oven,"" which implies that the speaker's bread is being baked or cooked inside an oven. This suggests that the speaker has control over the situation and can influence the outcome, making option B the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. Here's why:
The phrase ""ma haläinud vedelik"" means ""the big wave"". The word ""vedelik"" refers to a large or enormous thing, so it implies that the wave is also huge. Additionally, the phrase ""jättis kleepuva jälje"" means ""leaves a great trail behind"", which suggests that the wave left a significant mark or impression somewhere. Given these phrases, it seems more likely that the wave would leave a noticeable trace rather than simply disappear into nothingness (option A). Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta luges raamatu uuesti) is more likely to happen because it means ""You are digging your own grave."" This phrase suggests that someone is taking actions that will ultimately lead to their downfall or demise, which aligns with the theme of being trapped in a situation from which there is no escape. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Mees vaatas aknast välja) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The premise states that Lennuk is in a turbulent situation. This implies that there are external factors causing chaos or disorder around him. In such a scenario, it is unlikely for Lennuk to have complete control over his actions and decisions. Instead, he may be forced to make quick choices based on instinct or survival instincts.

Option B suggests that Mees (Lennuk) will choose to take action, implying that he has agency and can make decisions despite the turbulence. This aligns with the idea of Lennuk having limited control over his surroundings but still being able to act upon them.

In contrast, Option A implies that Mees panics and relies on someone else for help. This goes against the idea of Lennuk taking action and shows a lack of agency, which contradicts the premise.

Therefore, based on the given premise, Option B is more likely to occur – Mees takes action to navigate the turbulent situation."
"Response:  Option B - Tüdruk torkas teda. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Poiss võpatas,"" which means ""The cat is sleeping."" This implies that the cat is in a state of relaxation or lethargy, which suggests that it may be less inclined to move around or engage in physical activity. Therefore, option B, ""Tüdruk torkas teda,"" which means ""The cat is lazy,"" is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Nad jälgisid tema elutähtsaid organeid. 
Explanation: The premise states that Arstid and Sid are experiencing strange symptoms, including a feeling of being watched and difficulty breathing. Given these symptoms, it is more likely that their organs have been affected rather than an arm or leg being amputated. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta tõmbas oma käe tema juurest ära) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Poiss näpistas tüdruku õlga"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their consent or knowledge. The word ""tudruk"" means ""to take away,"" and ""õlga"" means ""something that belongs to someone."" Therefore, it implies that something valuable or important has been stolen from the person.
Now, let's consider Option A: ""Ta kehitas tema suunas õlgu."" This translates to ""To create a problem for someone."" While this could potentially cause trouble for the person in question, it doesn't necessarily imply that something valuable or important has been taken away from them.
On the other hand, Option B (""Ta tõmbas oma käe tema juurest ära"") directly implies that something of value has been taken away from the person. Since the phrase uses the word ""tõmba,"" which means ""to steal,"" it's more likely that the speaker is referring to a literal theft rather than creating a problem for someone.
Therefore, based on the given premise, Option B is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Option B - Ma teadsin, et tal on õigus. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ma teadsin, et tal on õigus"" means ""I think that he is guilty."" This option is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker might say ""Mulle hindasin tema arvamust,"" as it implies that the speaker has evidence or reason to believe that the other person is guilty of something. In contrast, Option A (""Mulle hindasin tema arvamust"") does not provide any clear indication of what the speaker might be thinking or feeling, making it less likely as an explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Option A - Muda astus mutta. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Muda astus mutta"" means ""The cat is at home but"". This implies that the cat (Muda) is present in one place (home), but it is not doing anything or producing any effects. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Inimesed peitsid end maa alla) is more likely. Here's why:
The phrase ""Linnas sadas mõned tollid"" suggests that something has been accumulated or stored up over time. The word ""tollid"" carries a connotation of abundance or excess. Therefore, it makes sense that whatever has been collected would eventually cause problems or become too much to handle.
On the other hand, Option A (""Koolid sulgesid"") doesn't quite fit with the context provided. While ""koolid"" does mean ""to burst,"" it wouldn't make sense in this particular scenario since there isn't any indication that anything is going to suddenly expand or explode. Instead, the focus seems to be on the buildup of something over time.
So, based on the information provided, Option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ähvardas oma töölt lahkuda. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta ähvardas oma töölt lahkuda"" means ""You will take your work home"". This option suggests that the person's workload will increase, as they will be taking their work home with them. Therefore, this option is more likely to happen based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option A - Puu kukkus katusele. 
Explanation: The word ""puu"" means tree in Estonian, so the phrase ""puu kukkus katusele"" literally translates to ""the tree is growing towards the sky"". This makes sense as trees tend to grow upwards towards sunlight, rather than sideways or downwards. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ma lõin kirve puusse. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ma lõin kirve puusse"" means ""I hit a tree with an axe."" This option is more likely because it makes sense in the context of the premise. If someone hits something with an axe, it would be more likely to damage or break that thing than if they simply knocked on it with their fist. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:
The premise states that ""paarikest õnnitles paarikest."" This implies that something happens to pairs, making them unable to pair up. Option B accurately reflects this idea by stating that ""Paarike teatas, et nad saavad lapse,"" meaning that pairs cannot find each other. On the other hand, option A suggests that pairs are not able to meet, but it doesn't explain why they can't meet. Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, option B is a better fit."
"Response:  Option B - Ta suudles teda. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ta suudles teda"" means ""You will be sad."" Based on the premise ""Tüdruk saatis poisile sõbrapäeva kaardi,"" which translates to ""Your heart will break into a thousand pieces,"" it is more likely that you will be sad if your heart breaks into a thousand pieces. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ma nõustusin temaga) is the most likely cause for why I didn't finish my homework. This is because ""temaga"" means ""lazy,"" so it suggests that the speaker may have been too lazy to complete their homework. Option A (""Ma olin segaduses"") doesn't provide any specific reason for not finishing the homework, making it less likely as a cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why: The phrase ""Sõbrad viskasid kulli ja kirja"" suggests that there are two conflicting desires or goals, and the speaker wants to find a compromise between them. Option B implies that the speaker will try to make a decision that benefits both parties, rather than simply choosing one side over the other (which would be the case in Option A). Therefore, Option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Mees võttis pitsa ahjust välja. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Mees võttis pitsa ahjust välja"" means ""Mees dug a hole in the ground with his teeth"". This is a highly unlikely scenario as it is not biologically possible for a human to dig a hole with their teeth. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta tegi kõvasti tööd) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""seadis ambitsioonika eesmärgi"" suggests that the person has a big dream or goal in mind. This implies that they are motivated and driven to achieve something significant.
Option A (""Ta logeles"") means ""To be lazy,"" which contradicts the idea of having a big dream or goal. If someone is lazy, they are unlikely to put in much effort or energy into achieving their goals.
Therefore, based on the information provided, it is more likely that the person will choose Option B and work hard to achieve their big dream or goal."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta poeg päris ta varanduse) is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The phrase ""Jõukas mees suri vanadusse"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising has happened to a man. The word ""sur"" means ""unexpected,"" so we can infer that whatever happened was not expected or anticipated.
Now, let's consider Option A: ""Ta poeg sattus juriidilistesse problemaedisse."" This translates to ""Your son got into legal trouble."" However, this option does not fit with the context of the sentence as a whole. It would be unusual for someone to get into legal trouble without any warning or indication of potential problems earlier in the conversation.
On the other hand, Option B (""Ta poeg päris ta varanduse"") makes more sense in the context of the sentence. ""Paris"" means ""problems,"" so it implies that the speaker's son has encountered some difficulties or challenges. This fits well with the idea of an unexpected event happening to him.
Therefore, based on the given premise, Option B is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Option B - Leekidest tõusis suitsu. 
Explanation: The word ""leekidest"" in Estonian means to make someone or something look silly or ridiculous. Based on the given premise, it's more likely that the person will be made to look silly rather than their suit being stolen. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sattus autoõnnetusse. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ta sattus autoõnnetusse"" means ""You are responsible for the damage to your own car."" This option is more likely because it aligns with the given premise of Naise auto oli töökojas (meaning he/she was driving his/her own car). Therefore, it makes sense that he/she would be responsible for any damages to their own vehicle."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. Here's why:
The sentence ""Ma ei kuulnud oma äratuskella"" means ""Mother didn't hear her own heartbeat."" This implies that Mother was not paying attention or listening to her own body, which could lead to a missed heart attack or other health issues. Option B, ""Ma magasin hommikusöögi maha,"" means ""Mother stored up anger in her chest."" This suggests that Mother has been holding onto anger or resentment for a long time, which can have negative effects on one's physical and mental well-being. Therefore, based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen."
"Response:  Option B - Ta pere osales pressikonverentsil. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person will become a public speaker rather than a camera operator. The phrase ""tuli limusiinist välja"" suggests that the person has gained popularity or recognition, which could lead to opportunities for public speaking engagements. Additionally, the mention of ""pressikonverentsil"" specifically refers to events where the person would be speaking in front of an audience, further supporting this option."
"Response:  Option B - Vannivesi voolas vannist välja. 
Explanation: The premise ""Naine logeles vannis"" means that people are talking about something. The word ""voolas"" in option B indicates that the conversation is becoming louder, which suggests that the second part of the sentence is more likely to happen. Therefore, we should choose option B as the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Nad võtsid inseneeria põhiaineks. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Nad võtsid inseneeria põhiaineks"" suggests that they are planning to cause harm or damage to the school building using their engineering skills. This option is more likely because it aligns with the theme of sabotage and destruction in the prompt."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B - Ma paigutasin elutuba ümber seems to be a more plausible explanation for why she might not have enough money. Elutuba (Ümber in Estonian) means ""pocket money"" or ""allowance"", so it's possible that she doesn't have enough money because her parents don't give her enough pocket money. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Poiss jooksis ära) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

1. The phrase ""poiss jooksis"" means ""her ilaene lenda pooli"" in English, which translates to ""their legendary pool of water.""
2. The word ""pooli"" can be translated as ""water,"" so it makes sense that the next word would be related to water as well.
3. Option A suggests that the water will become a source of joy or happiness for someone, which aligns with the idea of a legendary pool of water being a place of wonder and magic.
4. Option B suggests that the water will be corrected or improved, which doesn't quite fit with the idea of a legendary pool of water being a magical place.
Therefore, based on the context and the words used, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Ta määrati surma (Ta will kill someone)
Explanation: The premise states that Naine has been wronged, implying that something bad has happened to him/her. In this situation, it is more likely that Naine will take drastic action, such as killing someone, rather than simply tolerating the injustice or seeking help from others. This choice aligns with the darker tone of the prompt and fits with the idea of a character who feels they have no other option but to resort to violent means to address their grievances."
"Response:  Option B - Suhkur sulas. 
Explanation: From the given premise, we can infer that there is something hot inside the box. The word ""suhktur"" means ""hot"" in Estonian, so it's likely that the thing inside the box is also hot. Therefore, option B - Suhkur sulas (Hot things) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta oli lahingus vigastada saanud. 
Explanation: The phrase ""lahingus vigastada saanud"" suggests that the veteran lonka was not only old but also had a lot of experience in battle. This implies that he has seen many battles and has been through a lot, which could have caused him to become weak or frail over time. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause for the veteran lonka's condition."
"Response:  Option B - Politsei jälitas kurjategijat. 
Explanation: The word ""politsei"" in the premise means ""police"", so it's more likely that they will try to find or track down the person who has been reported to them (option B). Option A doesn't make sense in this context because there's no indication of the police being able to hide something from someone else."
"Response:  Option B - Ma laadisin seda. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Ma kukutasin selle maha"" means ""I will eat that cake"", indicating that the speaker intends to consume something sweet. On the other hand, ""Ma laadisin seda"" means ""I will bake a cake"", suggesting that the speaker plans to create something sweet for someone else. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta soetas laialdase riidevaliku) is the most likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Naisel sai kapis ruum otsa"" suggests that something has gone wrong with Naissel's room, and the sentence ""Ta soetas laialdase riidevaliku"" implies that there may be a leak or flooding in the room. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is caused by a leak or flooding rather than an absence of light."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta naine sünnitas) is the most likely cause of why South Africa is hot. The word ""murtud"" in the premise suggests that something has happened to make South Africa hot, and ""sünnitas"" means ""hot"". Therefore, it makes sense that the cause of South Africa being hot is because it was hit by a massive heat wave or some other natural disaster. Option B (Ta naine jättis ta maha) does not fit with the context of the problem as there is no indication that anything significant happened to South Africa to make it hot."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta tööpakkumine tühistati) is more likely to happen because it implies that the person will be unable to complete their work due to being too tired. This suggests that they may not have enough energy or motivation to do their job properly, which could lead to a decrease in productivity and quality of work. On the other hand, option A (Ta muutus kvalifitseerituks töö jaoks, mida ta tahtis) does not necessarily imply that the person will be unable to complete their work, but rather that they will change their priorities and focus on something else instead.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta tervitas publikut) is the most likely cause for why the speaker cannot be heard over the audience. This is because ""tervitas"" means ""to shout"" or ""to yell,"" indicating that the speaker may not have been able to project their voice effectively due to the loudness of the audience. Option B (Ta rääkis mikrofoni) does not provide any contextual clues that would suggest a reason why the speaker could not be heard. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Option B - Münt läks pooleks. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma viskasin mündi purskkaevu"" suggests that something is being pulled or sucked towards a specific location. In this case, it's likely that whatever is being pulled will end up in the hole (pooleks). Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Pall tõmbus tagasi mängija juurde.
Explanation: According to the premise, the mängija (a person) has been digging a hole in the ground for a long time. This means that they have already dug quite deep into the earth's surface. Now, if they continue digging, it is more likely that they will reach the other side of the earth than that the earth will collapse beneath them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ma aevastasin. 
Explanation: The word ""aevastasin"" means ""to be jealous"". Based on the premise, it's more likely that the person is feeling jealous than luxurious. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Klient jättis esituled sisse) is the most likely cause. Here's why:

1. The client has already left their phone number, indicating that they are interested in receiving a call from the salesperson.
2. The client has provided their email address, which suggests that they may be open to receiving follow-up communications via email as well.
3. The phrase ""jättis esituled sisse"" implies that the client took the initiative to provide their contact information, rather than waiting for the salesperson to reach out to them. This suggests that the client is proactive and willing to engage with the salesperson.
4. The fact that the client has already left their phone number and email address indicates that they have shown interest in the product or service being offered, making it more likely that they will respond positively to a follow-up message.
Overall, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that the client will respond positively to a follow-up message than if they had not provided any contact information. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Ma viskasin kogemata oma poenimekirja ära. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma viisin pruegi välja"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising has happened to the speaker's neighbor. Option B provides a more plausible explanation for this situation, as it implies that the speaker's neighbor has lost their important documents, such as their passport or identification card, which could be a significant problem for them. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Lapsed ajasid loomi taga. 
Explanation: The word ""ajasid"" means ""to fall asleep"", so the phrase ""lapsed ajasid loomi"" means ""fell asleep"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta neerud ütlesid üles) is a more plausible explanation for why Mehe hingamine oli vali. This is because the phrase ""neerud ütlesid"" suggests that something was poured or added to the mixture, which could have caused it to become cloudy or opaque. In contrast, option B (Ta kopsud olid ummistunud) does not provide any specific reason as to why the mixture became cloudy or opaque, making it less likely as an explanation. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The sentence ""Ma küsisin oma sõbralt"" indicates that the speaker will do something to their own hair, so it's unlikely they would be thinking about someone else's hair. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B will happen - ""Ma avasin aknad"". This is because the word ""avasin"" means ""opened"", which implies that something was already closed or locked beforehand, making it more likely for the speaker to have opened it rather than created it from nothing."
"Response:  Option B - Ta seljakott oli raske. 
Explanation: The premise ""Poisi selg valutas"" implies that something has happened to the wallet, making it unlikely that the owner would say ""Ta seljakott oli lahti"". Instead, they might say ""Ta seljakott oli raske"", indicating that the wallet was damaged or ruined. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Oli tema sünnipäev (It was a sunny day).
Explanation: The sentence ""Ma ostsin oma emale kingituse"" means ""I bought my own mother's grave."" This is an illogical statement, as it is not possible to buy one's own mother's grave. Therefore, option B - ""Oli tema sünnipäev"" (It was a sunny day) is the most likely cause for this sentence to be true."
"Response:  Option B - Oravad kaevasid sibulad üles. 
Explanation: The premise ""Nartsissid aias hävitati"" suggests that something has been destroyed or damaged. Option B provides a possible explanation for this situation, as it implies that the destruction was caused by an earthquake. Earthquakes can indeed cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, making option B a more plausible cause than option A, which simply states that someone dug without permission. Therefore, based on the given information, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Tikk tekitas leegi. 
Explanation: The premise ""Ma süütasin tiku"" implies that something has been added to a pot of soup or broth, making it too salty. This could be due to adding too much salt or any other seasoning. Therefore, option B - ""Tikk tekitas leegi"" (meaning ""too salty"") is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to be the correct answer. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Vaidlevad osapooled jõudsid lahenduseni."" This means that something has happened to the person's brain or mind, causing them to act in a way that is not normal for them.
Option A suggests that nothing happened to the person's brain or mind, implying that they simply didn't want to do anything. However, this doesn't align with the premise, as it implies that there was no external factor affecting their behavior.
On the other hand, Option B provides a possible explanation for the situation. It suggests that the person may have been under some kind of influence or pressure that caused them to behave differently than usual. This could include things like drugs, alcohol, or even psychological manipulation.
Therefore, based on the information provided, Option B seems more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Nende vanemad hellitasid nad Ära. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the lapsed sadness has turned into a habit of not feeling anything anymore. This suggests that the person has become numb or desensitized to their emotions, which could be due to various reasons such as past traumas, stress, or social pressures. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the person's current state of mind."
"Response:  Option A - Tekkis Tsunaami (Massive Tsunami)
Explanation: Based on the given premise, a massive tsunami is more likely to occur due to the earthquake happening beneath the ocean. The term ""tsunami"" refers specifically to a series of large waves caused by the displacement of water, usually as a result of an underwater earthquake or volcanic eruption. In this case, the earthquake occurring beneath the ocean would displace a large amount of water, resulting in a massive tsunami wave that could potentially affect coastal areas nearby. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Ta muutus dehüdreerituks"". This is because the word ""dehüdreerituks"" means ""to dry out"", which suggests that something will be lost or reduced in amount. In this case, since we are talking about a person's strength, it is more likely that their strength will decrease rather than increase. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma panin ahju tööle) is a more plausible explanation for why the person might be sweating profusely. This is because ""ahju"" means ""work"" in Estonian, so it suggests that the person may be working hard or exerting themselves physically, causing them to sweat. Option B (Ma panin roa ahju), on the other hand, does not make as much sense in this context, as ""roa"" means ""cool"" or ""cold"" in Estonian, and would not provide an obvious reason for why someone might be sweating. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Sidrun pritsis. 
Explanation: The word ""pritsis"" means to be in a state of confusion or disarray, which aligns with the idea that Sidrun's mind might be affected by the strange occurrences happening around him. This option seems more plausible given the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Option B - Riik colonizes the new land. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Riik avastas uue maa-ala"" means ""Riik has discovered a new land."" This suggests that Riik has found a previously unexplored area of land that they want to settle or colonize. Option B, ""Riik colonizes the new land,"" is therefore the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (See maandus riidekuhja) is more likely to happen. Here's why:

The phrase ""Klaas kukkus laualt maha"" suggests that something big or significant is happening. The word ""maha"" can have different meanings depending on the context, but in this case, it could imply a major event or transformation.

Option A (""See purunes kildudeks üle kogu põranda"") doesn't make sense in this context. ""Purunes"" means ""to see,"" but there's no clear subject for the verb. Additionally, ""kildudeks"" is not a recognizable Estonian word. Therefore, this option is less likely to be correct.

On the other hand, Option B (""See maandus riidekuhja"") makes more sense based on the given premise. ""Maandus"" means ""month,"" so ""riidekuhja"" would translate to ""a big month."" This could refer to various things, such as a full moon, a lunar eclipse, or simply an unusually large or notable month in some way. Given the vague nature of the premise, any of these possibilities could be the intended meaning."
"Response:  Option A - Põrand oli ebatasane (Põrand was angry). 
Explanation: Based on the premise, we can infer that Põrand was angry because he had been waiting for a long time. This fits with the meaning of ""ebatasane,"" which means to be angry or annoyed. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Isa usaldas oma poega. 
Explanation: The premise ""Isa tabas oma poja valetamas"" implies that something has been taken away from Isa's possession. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that Isa will experience a loss or absence of something they previously had."
"Response:  Option B - Ta võttis aspirini. 
Explanation: Aspirin is a common medication used to treat headaches and other pain-related conditions. It works by blocking the production of prostaglandins in the body, which are chemical messengers that cause pain and inflammation. Therefore, taking aspirin would be more likely to reduce the severity of a headache caused by sinus pressure than taking Köhler's pills (option A), which do not have any direct action on pain or inflammation."
"Response:  Option B - Ta oli graafikust maas. 
Explanation: The premise ""Rong aeglustas"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not functioning properly. The phrase ""Ta oli graafikust maas"" means ""Your graphic design is bad,"" which could be the cause of the problem. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B - Tal diagnoositi depressioon. 
Explanation: The premise states that Mees has been experiencing therapy for a long time, indicating that they have been seeking help for their mental health issues. Depression is a common mental health disorder that can be treated with therapy, and it's possible that Mees has been diagnosed with depression based on their symptoms and medical history. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta neelas oma toidu alla) is the most likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

The phrase ""Naine haaras oma kõrist"" means ""Her grandmother's hair is falling out."" This suggests that the person's grandmother has experienced some kind of hair loss or balding.

In this context, it makes more sense for the person to say ""Ta neelas oma toidu alla"" than ""Ta lämbus oma toidu käes"". The former implies that the person wants to take their grandmother's hair away from her, while the latter implies that they want to put something into her hair. Given the situation described in the premise, it seems more likely that the person would want to remove their grandmother's hair rather than add something to it. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta rääkis aktsendiga. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta rääkis aktsendiga"" means ""You are making a big mistake."" This option is more likely because it aligns with the given premise of Naisel being cursed. Making a big mistake could be one of the consequences of being cursed, especially if Naisel's actions are not in line with the curse's intentions. Therefore, this option is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided."
"Response:  Option B - Ta heitis pikali. 
Explanation: According to the premise, koer silmitses laual olevat mahlast steiki means that something has been added to the mixture of milk and sugar. This implies that there will be a change in the taste or consistency of the mixture, making it less sweet or thicker than usual. Therefore, option B - Ta heitis pikali (meaning to make it thicker) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sai jõukaks. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta sai jõukaks"" means ""To have a headache"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, Option B - Õpetaja andis kodutööd (The teacher creates a classroom) is the more likely cause. Here's why:

* The phrase ""Õpetaja andis kodutööd"" suggests that the teacher created something in the classroom, implying agency and action.
* The word ""lahkusid"" means ""created,"" indicating that the teacher had control over the process of making or building something.
* There is no indication in the premise that other factors might have influenced the creation of the classroom, such as external forces like natural disasters or internal factors like student behavior.

Therefore, based on the language used in the premise, it seems more likely that the teacher actively created the classroom rather than waiting for something to happen (Option A)."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tuttavad seostasid end temaga. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta tuttavad seostasid end temaga"" means ""To take something for granted without considering its true nature"". This option is more likely because it aligns with the idea of taking something (the truth) for granted without properly evaluating or questioning it."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta peaaegu uppus okeanis) is the most likely cause of the problem. Here's why:

The phrase ""Mees kaotas oma kuulmise"" suggests that there is a conflict or issue within the person's own mind or thoughts. The word ""kaotas"" means ""chaos,"" so it implies that the person's thoughts are disorganized or confused.

The second part of the sentence, ""ta peaaegu uppus okeanis,"" further supports this interpretation. ""Uppus"" means ""up,"" and ""okeanis"" means ""sea."" So, the sentence can be translated as ""you have gone up to the sea."" This could refer to the person's thoughts rising up to the surface, indicating a sense of turmoil or confusion.

Therefore, based on the language and structure of the sentence, it seems more likely that the cause of the problem is internal, related to the person's own mental state rather than an external factor like another person or situation. Option A best fits this interpretation, as it suggests that the person has become lost in their own thoughts."
"Response:  Option B - Õhupall tõusis õhku.
Explanation: According to the premise, if a person's head hits something hard, they are likely to experience pain. This means that option B, where the person's head hits something hard, is more likely to occur than option A, where the person's head does not hit anything. Therefore, we should choose option B as the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta hingas sügavalt sisse. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees kaotas kõnevõime"" translates to ""Your brain is broken."" This is an insult, indicating that someone's intelligence or cognitive abilities are impaired. Therefore, option A - Tal oli insult is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ta kuulis oma nime hüütavat. 
Explanation: The premise states that the person's name was changed without their knowledge or consent. This implies that they were not aware of the change and did not have any say in it. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause, as it suggests that someone else made the decision to change the person's name without their permission."
"Response:  Option B - Mees kastis vetelpäästja läbimärjaks.
Explanation: The sentence ""Mees kastis vetelpäästja läbimärjaks"" means ""The mouse threw the cheese to the cat."" in English. Based on the given premise, it's more likely that the mouse will throw the cheese away from itself rather than towards the cat. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Mu infektsioon taandus (The bacterial infection subsides)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Ma võtsin antibiootikume,"" we know that the person took antibiotics. Antibiotics are effective against bacterial infections, so it's more likely that the bacterial infection will subside rather than persist or spread. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Juht lasi signaali. 
Explanation: Based on the premise, we know that valgusfoor (the main character) has a special ability to sense when someone is lying. This means that they can detect changes in people's body language or behavior that indicate deception. Therefore, it is more likely that juht (the person being questioned) would be detected as lying through their body language rather than through any verbal cues."
"Response:  Option B - Ma panin nõu kuumale pliidile. 
Explanation: The premise ""Plastnõu sulas"" suggests that something has happened to make plastic soft or malleable. This could be due to a number of factors, such as exposure to heat or chemicals. Therefore, option B - ""Ma panin nõu kuumale pliidile"" (My pan heated up) is the most likely cause for why plastic became soft."
"Response:  Option B - Juht sõitis punase tule alt läbi. 
Explanation: The premise states that the juht (lawyer) has been summoned to a foreign country for a trial. This implies that the lawyer will be traveling abroad for the trial, which means they will have to go through customs and immigration at the airport. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause as it mentions the lawyer having to go through customs and immigration."
"Response:  Option B - Ta sai eksamist läbi. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Poiss õppis terve öö"" means ""He studied hard for the exam"". This implies that he put in effort to prepare for the exam, which increases his chances of doing well. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that he will get a good grade on the exam."
"Response:  Option B - Vetelpäästja oli tööl. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Vetelpäästja oli tööl"" means ""The dog was barking loudly"". This option is a plausible explanation for why the person might be annoyed or frustrated, as barking dogs can be disruptive and disturbing to some people. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Mu pulss kiirenes. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mu pulss kiirenes"" means ""My heart beats fast"". This option is more likely based on the given premise as it aligns with the idea of a person's heart racing due to excitement or nervousness."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A - ""Mu kontor oli ülerahvastatud"" (My office was overcrowded) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""oli ehitamisel"" (was built) implies that the office was designed or constructed with a specific purpose in mind, such as to accommodate a large number of people. Therefore, it is unlikely that the office would be noisy if it was intentionally designed to be crowded."
"Response:  Option B - Nad lehvitasid naabritele oma aiast. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Nad lehvitasid naabritele oma aiast"" means ""They did not learn to read their own minds."" This option is more likely because it contrasts with the idea of learning a new skill or subject, which is the main focus of the premise. Therefore, it is more likely that the person in question did not learn to read their own mind than they learned a new language."
"Response:  Option A - Ujuja sukeldus basseini (The water level in the reservoir has risen).
Explanation: The premise states that the water level in the reservoir has risen, indicating that there is an increase in the amount of water stored in the reservoir. This could be caused by various factors such as heavy rainfall or snowmelt, but it is unlikely to be caused by a decrease in the number of boats using the reservoir. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ma neelasin kogemata seemne alla) will occur. Here's why:
The phrase ""Ma neelasin kogemata seemne alla"" means ""My mother did not like to eat meat."" This implies that the speaker's mother had a preference or an aversion towards eating meat. It does not necessarily mean that she never ate meat, but rather that she had a personal dislike for it. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Option B (Ta kingapaelad olid lahti) is the correct answer based on the given premise. Here's why:
The premise states that ""Poiss komistas"" (someone's money). This implies that there is a specific person who owns the money.
Option A (""Ta jope oli eest lahti"") means ""Joe had been saving."" This suggests that Joe is the owner of the money, but it doesn't necessarily imply that he has lost it.
On the other hand, Option B (""Ta kingapaelad olid lahti"") means ""They had been stealing."" This implies that someone else (not just Joe) has taken the money without permission.
Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that someone else stole the money rather than Joe losing it. So, the correct answer is Option B."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta tegi omale kõrvaaugud) is the most likely cause. Here's why:

The premise states that ""Naine pani kõrvatropid kõrva,"" indicating that someone has been causing trouble for another person. This suggests that there may be a conflict or problem between two individuals.

Option A (""Teda segas lärm"") implies that the noise caused by the first person might have distracted or annoyed the second person, leading to their reaction. However, this does not necessarily imply that the second person was actively causing trouble for the first person.

On the other hand, Option B (""Ta tegi omale kõrvaaugud"") suggests that the second person took active steps to cause trouble for the first person. This aligns better with the premise, as it implies a deliberate action taken by one person towards another. Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, Option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's mother made her own vegetable soup instead of buying it from the store. The sentence ""Ma hoidsin seda könmikus"" means ""My mother took care of that deliciousness,"" suggesting that she put effort into preparing the soup herself. In contrast, option A implies that the speaker's mother simply bought all the ingredients needed for the soup without any additional effort. Therefore, option B is a more logical choice as the reason why the speaker's mother made her own vegetable soup."
"Response:  Option B - Sellel oli keeruline süžee. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Sellel oli keeruline süžee"" means ""There was a clear sky."" This option is more likely because it matches the context of the premise, which mentions that telesaade oli tsenseeritud (there was a clear sky). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Meeskond will experience a negative outcome (Option A). The phrase ""Laev hukkus"" suggests that something unpleasant or difficult has happened to Meeskond, and the addition of ""uppus"" further emphasizes this idea. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Option B - Ta palus vihjet. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the person was hesitant about something. Given that they were hesitant, it's more likely that they will choose option B - Take a break from thinking. The idea of taking a break suggests that the person wants to escape or avoid their thoughts for a while, rather than confronting them head-on."
"Response:  Option B - Mees võttis telefoni vastu. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees võttis telefoni vastu"" means ""You lost your phone."" This option is more likely because it aligns with the given premise of losing a phone. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Mees võttis telefoni vastu."
"Response:  Option B - Ma tundsin ebamugavust. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Naine jõllitas mind"" suggests that someone has been thinking deeply or intensely about something. The word ""tunda"" means to understand or comprehend, so it's possible that the person has come to a deeper understanding of their thoughts or feelings after contemplating them for a long time. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Nad tegin eksponaatidest pilti) is the more likely cause. Here's why:
The sentence ""Grupp lahkus muuseumist"" suggests that a group of people are visiting a museum. The word ""lahkus"" means ""to visit,"" so it implies that they are there for an extended period.
The phrase ""näd tegin eksponaatidest pilti"" means ""they stole all the exhibits."" This implies that something has been taken from the museum without permission.
Since the group visited the museum, it's unlikely that they would steal everything in sight. It makes more sense that they might have accidentally damaged or misplaced some items during their visit. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. The sentence ""Mu sõber astus minu kaitseks välja"" means ""My heart beats faster when I see you."" This suggests that the speaker's heart races when they see the person they are addressing, indicating romantic or sexual attraction. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ma vahetasin rattal käike. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mu rattakumm oli tühi"" implies that something is wrong with my car's engine. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that I will fix the problem by cleaning the rat from the engine."
"Response:  Option B - Ta ise katsus ta otsmikku. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta ise katsus ta otsmikku"" means ""He took a look at his watch."" Based on the given premise, it's more likely that the person looked at their watch to check the time, rather than carrying a bag of coffee beans around with them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Ma allkirjastasin oma nime. 
Explanation: The premise ""Pastaks sai tühjaks"" implies that something has been taken away from someone or something. In this case, it's likely that the person in question had their name taken away or lost their identity. Therefore, option B - Ma allkirjastasin oma nime (I wrote my own name) is the most likely answer as it suggests that the person is trying to reclaim or restore their identity."
"Response:  Option B - Ta alustas äri. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mehele ei antud laenu"" suggests that something has been lost or taken away from someone without their consent. Option B, ""Ta alustas äri,"" means ""You took it away."" This option better fits the context of the premise, as it implies that someone intentionally removed or stole something from another person. Therefore, we can conclude that Option B is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option A - Tal olid tuulerõuged (The weather was bad). 
Explanation: The sentence ""Tüdruk jäi koolist koju"" suggests that something happened to someone's school, but the reason for this event is not provided directly in the premise. However, based on the context of the sentence, it seems more likely that the cause of the problem is related to the weather rather than math education. Therefore, option A - Tal olid tuulerõuged (The weather was bad) is a more plausible explanation for why the person's school was affected."
"Response:  Option B - Ma viskasin selle kraanikausist alla. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Prügikott oli täis"" means ""The pug was tired"". The word ""prügikott"" refers to a breed of dog known as a Pug. The sentence structure in Estonian is similar to English, with the subject followed by the verb and any additional information. In this case, the subject is ""pug"", and the verb is ""was tired"".

Now, let's analyze the two options:

Option A: ""Ma viisin selle prügikonteinerisse."" This translates to ""I saw that pug's dream"". The word order in this option is different from the original sentence, and it doesn't make sense in the context of the given premise. Therefore, we can eliminate Option A.

Option B: ""Ma viskasin selle kraanikausist alla."" This translates to ""I drank that coffee underneath the tree"". The word order in this option is closer to the original sentence, but there are some differences in vocabulary and grammar. However, based on the context provided, it seems more plausible that the speaker would say ""drank"" rather than ""saw"" or ""visited"". So, our answer is Option B: Ma viskasin selle kraanikausist alla."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Mu toakaaslane ajas punši maha) is a more plausible explanation for why Ma tõmbasin vaiba tolmuimejaga üle. The phrase ""toakaaslane ajas"" means ""to eat away,"" so it suggests that something is consuming or eating away at Ma's brain, causing her inability to speak. This could be due to various reasons such as an illness, injury, or even a supernatural force. On the other hand, option B (""Mu koer ajas karva"") doesn't make much sense in this context, as there is no clear indication of what ""koer"" means or how it would affect Ma's ability to speak. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Ta viskas tooli toa teise otsa. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta viskas tooli toa teise otsa"" means ""You are wasting your time with too much work."" This option is more likely because it aligns better with the idea of someone feeling overwhelmed or burnt out from working too much. It also implies that they may not be able to keep up their current pace without suffering negative consequences."
"Response:  Option B - Tuli kustus. 
Explanation: The word ""tuli"" means ""to burn"", so option B is the correct answer. According to the premise, if Tüdruk's hair is exposed to oxygen, it will burn, resulting in a charred appearance. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A - Kuum vesi oli otsas. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Mees tuli duši alt ära"" suggests that something unexpected happened to the speaker's soul. The word ""alt"" in this context could mean either ""higher"" or ""otherworldly,"" implying a supernatural occurrence. The phrase ""kuum vesi oli otsas"" means ""hot water was poured over it,"" which could be interpreted as a metaphor for some kind of spiritual cleansing or transformation. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Nad julgustasid lapsi õues mängima. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the parents of these children are not willing or able to pay for their education. This suggests that they may have financial difficulties, which could lead them to prioritize other basic needs such as food and shelter over their children's education. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Option B - Ta kingad muutusid läbikantuks. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mees sidus oma kingapaelad lahti"" implies that something has entered or invaded Meese's stomach. Since Meese is a creature from Estonian folklore known for being able to digest anything, it is unlikely that something would enter its stomach without causing some kind of reaction or discomfort. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta pani jäägid könkmakki) is a more likely outcome than option B (Ta salvestas retsepti). Here's why:
The phrase ""Mees sõi poole eelroast"" suggests that someone has made a statement or observation about something being delicious. The word ""poole"" in this context could refer to food, especially if it's something savory or sweet.
On the other hand, ""könkmakki"" is an Estonian word for a dish similar to a casserole or a stew. It's possible that the speaker is suggesting that they have created a new recipe or variation of a traditional dish using the ingredients mentioned earlier.
Therefore, option A is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for what the speaker might be referring to when they say ""poole eelroast."" Option B doesn't make as much sense in this context since ""retsepti"" means ""recipe"" in Estonian, but there's no indication that the speaker wants to share a recipe with the listener."
"Response:  Option B - Ma määrisin sellele kreemi peale. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Mu hüppeliiges oli paistes"" means ""My heart was beating fast"". In this context, the word ""määrisin"" (meaning ""I would make"") suggests that something is being done to the speaker's heart, causing it to beat faster. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The reason being that “kuulsi” means “heard” in Estonian, whereas “rääkisin” means “I would reckon”. So, it is more likely that the speaker heard something rather than thinking or guessing about it. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B - Ma sirvisin ajakirja. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ma pidin järjekorras ootama"" means ""I had a clear conscience"". This implies that the person did something wrong or illegal without getting caught. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the person tried to cover up their tracks by creating an alibi."
"Response:  Option B - Kärbes jäi liikumatuks. 
Explanation: The word ""kärbes"" means ""to be stuck"". In this context, it's more likely that the person will remain stuck in their current situation rather than moving forward or backward. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta oli suremas) is a more plausible explanation for why the person wrote the testament than option B (Ta oli lesk). Here's why: The phrase ""Ta oli suremas"" suggests that the person was in a state of euphoria or excitement when they wrote the testament, whereas ""Ta oli lesk"" implies that they were feeling depressed or melancholic. Given the context of writing a will, it seems more likely that the person would be in a positive emotional state rather than a negative one. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta kiirendas oma tempot) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker will speed up their own tempo. This means they will try to finish the task faster than usual, which aligns with the idea of trying to outdo a competitor. Option A (Ta katkestas võistluse) does not necessarily imply a change in pace or tempo, but rather a decision to stop what you're doing and focus on something else instead.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B will happen - ""Ma mõtlesin lahenduse välja"". This is because the word ""mõtlesin"" in Estonian means to solve or to deal with something, so it implies that the speaker has taken action to address the problem. Option A, ""Ma küsisin nõu"", means ""I would cry a river"", which doesn't necessarily imply any action being taken to solve the problem."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta tundis ekstaasi) is more likely to occur. Here's why:
The phrase ""väriseval rippsillal"" suggests that something significant or dramatic has happened, causing a chain reaction of events. The word ""ekstaasi"" means ""ecstasy,"" which implies an intense emotional state, often characterized by feelings of joy, excitement, or elation. Given the context of the sentence, it seems more plausible that the person will experience ecstasy rather than Hirmu (which means ""torment""). Therefore, Option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ta seda oma sõpradega kihla) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker has already taken some action towards their goal of becoming a successful YouTuber, specifically by investing in their own equipment. This suggests that they are taking their ambition seriously and are willing to put in effort to achieve their desired outcome. In contrast, option A (Ta sai oma sõpradega kokku, et mängu vaadata) does not imply any specific actions or efforts being made towards achieving the goal of becoming a successful YouTuber. Therefore, based on the given information, option B is more likely to be true.
"Response:  Option B - Ta luges lambaid. 
Explanation: The premise ""Poiss ei suutnud uinuda"" suggests that something unexpected or unpredictable will happen to the person. Option B, ""Ta luges lambaid,"" means ""To have a heart attack,"" which is an unexpected and unpredictable event. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur based on the given premise."
