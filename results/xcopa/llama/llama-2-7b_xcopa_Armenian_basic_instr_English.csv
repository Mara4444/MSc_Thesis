For example, there are around 30 different ethnic groups in Armenia, including the Armenians themselves, as well as Kurds, Russians, Greeks, and Turks. Additionally, there are many different dialects spoken throughout the country, reflecting the diverse linguistic heritage of its population.

The phrase ""որոշեց իր քրոջ հետ կատակ անել"" means ""he will definitely make a mess,"" indicating that the person's lack of organization and disorganization will lead to chaos and confusion.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Нա նստեց ստվերում) is a more plausible explanation for why the dog's tail is curly. The word ""նստեց"" in Armenian means to twist or curl, so it is possible that the dog's tail has been twisted or curled due to some external factor such as injury or genetics. Option B (Նա գնաց լողափ) does not make sense in this context as there is no evidence to suggest that dogs have the ability to grow their tails back once they are injured or damaged.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Нա հալյուցինացիաներ էր ունենում) is a more plausible explanation for why there are no trees in the desert. This is because halyucyinates are organisms that can survive without water, so it's possible that they could exist in a desert environment where there is little to no rainfall. In contrast, option B (Նա մեդիտացիա էր անում) does not provide any logical reasoning as to why there would be no trees in a desert. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Н Raymond's anger is more likely) is the correct answer. The text states that Raymond's anger was growing, indicating a gradual increase in his emotional state. This suggests that he had been feeling angry for some time before reaching the breaking point, making option B the most plausible explanation. Option A, on the other hand, implies that something unexpected happened to trigger Raymond's anger, which may not be supported by the given information.
"Response:  Armenian Genocide denialist 
Explanation: The passage suggests that the author of the article is trying to create a new narrative about the Armenian Genocide by arguing that there are two sides to the story and that the Turks were also victims of violence during World War I. This is a common tactic used by Armenian Genocide denialists who try to downplay or distort the historical facts of the genocide in order to justify Turkish actions. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the author's words."

This is because the phrase “Հեռացավ տնից” means “He/She has been trained not to bark,” suggesting that someone or something has taught the dog to stop barking. Option B (“Նա ազատվել է զինվորական ծառայությունից”) does not provide any clear explanation for why the dog’s barking has stopped, and it seems unlikely that the dog would suddenly become silent without any apparent reason.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The firefighters were able to put out the fires quickly) is a more likely cause of the absence of damage to nearby buildings. The text states that ""the firefighters were able to put out the fires quickly,"" indicating that they acted promptly and effectively in extinguishing the flames. This suggests that they were able to contain the fire before it had a chance to spread to neighboring structures, thus preventing any significant damage. Option B (The wind blew the flames away from nearby buildings) does not provide an explanation for why there was no damage to nearby buildings, as it only mentions that the wind blew the flames away from them without addressing how this affected their safety. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the lack of damage to nearby buildings."

Response: Աբովյան շրջակի պատմությունը (Aboyan's story)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I can feel the top of my head) is a more plausible cause for why you cannot see your own nose than option B (I am looking at it from another angle). This is because the statement ""I can feel the top of my head"" implies that you are able to perceive your own body through touch, whereas the statement ""I am looking at it from another angle"" does not provide any information about how you are viewing your nose. Therefore, option A is a more logical explanation for why you cannot see your own nose."
"Response: Ա (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the electrician's elbow"" has been caused by the repetitive bending of his elbow joint while working as an electrician.

"Response: Այդպիսիկ բազմաթիվ հատքնաբար շատ լցվեց թողությունը (Option A). The reason for this is that the phrase ""լցվեց"" in Armenian means ""to laugh,"" so it is more likely that the speaker is saying something funny rather than trying to hurt someone's feelings."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (They will definitely do it) is a more likely cause than option B (They will probably do it). This is because the use of ""definitely"" suggests a higher degree of certainty compared to ""probably"". Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Нա կանգնած էր հսկայական ծառի տակ) is more likely as it suggests that the person's inability to speak is due to a physical or neurological disorder rather than a psychological issue.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I will be able to hear the sound of my own voice) is more likely. The premise states that you are in a room with no mirrors or windows, indicating that there is nothing for you to see or reflect your voice back to you.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Мիլիոνատերը ցանկանում էր, որ շենքը քանդվի) is the more likely cause. The passage suggests that the reason why millennials are not buying homes is because they are struggling to save money for a down payment, rather than because they are unwilling or uninterested in homeownership. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response: Ա (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why the person's friend canceled their plans is because they had a change of heart.

"Response:  Armenian Genocide was a real historical event that took place in Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923. It resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians, including men, women, and children. The genocide was carried out through mass killings, forced deportations, and other forms of violence. While some historians have argued that the term ""genocide"" does not accurately describe what happened to the Armenians during this period, most scholars agree that it was a deliberate attempt by the Ottoman government to eliminate the Armenian population. Therefore, option A - ""The Armenian Genocide was faked"": is incorrect."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The dog's barking caused the tree to fall) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the dog's barking was the direct cause of the tree falling. Option B (The tree fell because it was old and rotten) does not provide a clear causal link between the tree's age and the fact that it fell.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The fire started in a nearby forest) is more likely to be the cause of the explosion. The phrase ""ikzanak"" (nearby forest) suggests that the fire originated from a location close to where the explosion occurred, rather than being caused by an external factor like Option B's suggestion of a bomb or missile attack. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Armenian is a language isolate with no known living relatives, but its grammar has been influenced by neighboring languages such as Persian and Greek. The verb conjugation system of Armenian is complex and has many irregularities. For example, the present tense third person singular form of the verb ""to go"" changes depending on the subject's grammatical gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). This complexity makes it difficult for non-native speakers to learn and use correctly."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Н Raymond's cat has gone missing) is a more plausible cause for his absence than option B (Н Raymond's cat has been telling him to stop bothering it). The fact that the cat has gone missing suggests that there may be an external factor involved in its disappearance, such as someone taking it or it getting lost outside. In contrast, the idea of the cat telling Raymond to stop bothering it implies that the cat's absence is due to internal factors, such as annoyance at being pestered. Therefore, option A is a more reasonable explanation for Raymond's absence.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why kings are unable to rule their countries effectively is because they have too many advisors who are trying to influence them. This suggests that there are too many conflicting opinions and suggestions being made by these advisors, making it difficult for the king to make decisions. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause, as the king's inability to rule effectively is due to the sheer number of advisors he has rather than any personal shortcoming."

"Response:  Armenian
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why people are leaving their jobs in the city center is because of the high cost of living. This is a common problem faced by many cities around the world where housing costs have increased significantly, making it difficult for people to afford basic necessities like food and shelter. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""նրան ներկայացրեց իր ծնողներին"" implies that the person's thoughts are being controlled by an external force, rather than their own will. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the person's thoughts are not their own."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the glands that produce hormones"" are affected by the stress, which means that the production of hormones will be reduced or stopped. This effect is more likely to occur than the alternative option, where the glucose levels in the blood increase due to stress. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."

Response:  Armenian Genocide was a real event that occurred in 1915-1923 during World War I when Ottoman Empire targeted and killed around 1.5 million Armenians. Therefore, option A (It's not true) is incorrect. Option B (It was staged by Armenia to gain sympathy) is also incorrect as there is no evidence to support this claim. The most likely explanation for the events of the Armenian Genocide is that it was a real genocide carried out by the Ottoman Empire against the Armenian people.
"Response:  Option B: The cause of the problem is not clear or evident.
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is unclear what caused the problem. There are no clues or evidence to suggest that either option is more likely to be the cause. Therefore, option B is a better answer choice."

Explanation: The given text is in Armenian, and it talks about a ""mašk"" (մաշք) or a ""mashk"" (մաշք), which means ""a storm"". The word ""մաշք"" can also be translated as ""gust"", so the sentence could be interpreted as ""A strong gust of wind is coming."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Нա նայում էր գետնին”) is a more plausible explanation for why people are not interested in attending cultural events. This implies that there may be some inherent lack of interest or appeal in these events themselves, rather than any external factors such as cost or location. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why people are not getting married is that they do not want to take responsibility for their partners' debts. This suggests that people may be hesitant to get married due to financial concerns, rather than because they do not want to commit to each other. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: Ա (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Մինչ թաշկոց տվեց իր քրոջը,"" meaning ""No one can predict their own fate."" Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the person's fate was determined by something other than themselves. Option B implies that the person had control over their fate, which goes against the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“The earthquake was caused by a fault in the Earth’s crust”) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that there are scientific explanations for natural disasters like earthquakes, and a fault in the Earth’s crust is a well-established geological phenomenon that can cause seismic activity. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the earthquake based on the given information.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the zoo's elephant enclosure has been broken into,"" indicating that someone intentionally broke into the enclosure. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the break-in was done by a person or people who wanted to harm or exploit the elephants. Option B does not provide any information about the identity of the perpetrator, making it less plausible."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""քինը մնաց տանը, ոչ թե աշխատելու,"" which means ""The cat is sleeping, not making a sound."" Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the cat is snoring or making some other noise while sleeping. Option B does not make sense in this context, as there is no indication that the cat is capable of producing any sounds while sleeping."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Н Raymond’s success was due to his own efforts”) is a more plausible explanation for why he became successful as an actor. The phrase “նրանց գործին” (narancs gorcini) in Armenian means “on his own merit,” indicating that Ray’s achievement was earned through his personal initiative rather than relying on someone else’s help or influence. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Нա բեմի վախից էր տառապում) is a more plausible explanation for why Derasani's heart was beating fast. This suggests that Derasani may have been experiencing some kind of excitement or arousal, rather than simply being scared.
"Response: Անունել պայմանն է:  
You are correct! The answer is Option A: Ես Հաշվեցի իմ դրամը (I will definitely help you). This response suggests that the speaker is willing to assist the listener in some way, which makes it more likely that they will actually do so. Great job!"
Response: Այն բացվել է (Option B)
Response: Մեքենան գերտաքացավ (B)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. The phrase ""թշնային պատմություն"" (a long time ago) suggests that a significant amount of time has passed since the event occurred, making it less likely for the person to still be angry about it. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response: Աբովյան շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահանգ շատ պարզապարհ թեք գնահան

"Response:  Armenian is a difficult language to learn because it has many complex grammar rules and pronunciation patterns. 
Option A: The difficulty of learning Armenian can be attributed to its complex grammar rules and pronunciation patterns. 
Option B: The difficulty of learning Armenian can be attributed to the fact that it is an ancient language with little modern usage, making it hard for learners to find relevant materials and practice speaking it fluently."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the usurer is most likely to have caused the problem) is a better fit. The wording of the premise suggests that the usurer's actions are the primary cause of the issue, rather than any external factor beyond their control. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why the borrower cannot pay back the loan.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. The phrase ""վերջացան"" (verchatsan) means ""to become wet,"" so it is likely that the person will get wet if they are not careful when crossing a river. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response: Ա (Option A)
"Response: Տվուրք պաշտպանություն դրական համար բռնելուց է բռնել Հայկական գեղարկությունների մեջ:

Response: Մկնիկը շարժեց (Mknik sharjete). The correct answer is option B: Օգտատերը շարժեց մկնիկը. According to the premise, it is more likely that Mknik's failure was caused by his own actions rather than external factors beyond his control.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the reason why he didn't go to work today is that he overslept."" This implies that there was a delay or obstacle in his journey to work, rather than him intentionally choosing not to go. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response: Աբույթ պաշտպանություն կազմվեց լվացքի գծից. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Armenian people are not inherently violent or aggressive. They have been subject to various forms of oppression throughout history, including genocide, forced assimilation, and discrimination, but this does not mean that they are naturally prone to violence. In fact, many Armenians have shown remarkable resilience and peacefulness in the face of adversity. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why some people might view them as violent.
Response: Տղամարդը նայում էր գիշերային երկնքին. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response: Աբովյան պատկերը (Aboyan's paradox)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Нրա մազերը երկար էին դառնում) is a more plausible explanation for why the person's mazardarogh might be affected. This is because the phrase ""թշնային բնություն"" (mazardarogh) implies that the person's ability to think clearly or make decisions has been impaired, which could be caused by various factors such as fatigue, stress, or certain medical conditions. In contrast, option A (""Նա աճեցрել էր իր մազերը"") suggests that the person's mental abilities are not being affected at all, which goes against the context of the situation. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is more likely that the person's mazardarogh is being affected due to external factors rather than internal ones."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Тղան ողջունեց նոր դասընկերոջը) is a more plausible explanation for why Tghann might not have told his new wife about his previous wives. This is because it suggests that Tghann may be trying to avoid any potential conflict or complications that could arise from telling her about his past marriages. It also implies that he may be trying to present himself in a more favorable light by hiding this information from her. Option B (Տղան չէր սիրուм իր նոր դասընկերոջը), on the other hand, does not provide any clear reason as to why Tghann would keep this information hidden from his new wife.

Explanation: According to the premise, ""the reason why he didn't get the job is because he didn't have any experience."" This implies that the lack of experience was the main factor preventing him from getting the job, rather than his inability to explain himself or his poor communication skills.

It has a complex grammar system with seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative) and three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter).

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Нա հայելու առջեւ թուլացրեց մկանները) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's wife left him. This suggests that the husband was not able to provide for his family financially or otherwise, leading to his wife leaving him. Option B (Նա բարձրացрեց սանդուղքը իր գլխի վերեւ) does not fit with the information provided in the premise as it implies that the woman left her husband without any reason, which is unlikely.

Option B (I am from a village) does not provide any information about the speaker's role or identity, making it less relevant to the context of the conversation.
Response: Այդպիսի համար, I would say that option A is more likely. The fact that you are experiencing a sudden urge to sing suggests that there may be an underlying emotional or psychological reason for it, rather than just a physical one. It could be related to stress, anxiety, or even creativity. Therefore, option A seems more plausible in this case.
"Response:  Armenian
Explanation: The sentence ""Ես սեղմեցի խոնավ սվունգը"" means ""I will make a sound with my mouth."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it implies that the speaker will produce a sound by blowing air through their lips.

"Response: Ա (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Հանգստացողները նավով գնացին հանգստավայր։"" which means that the hang gliders are flying towards a mountain.

"Response: Ա (Option A)

Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response: Ա (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""լավան հոսում էր հրաբխից,"" which means ""the cat is sleeping from hunger."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer, as it suggests that the cat's hunger caused its sleepiness."

Explanation: According to the premise, ""the price of everything has gone up,"" indicating that there may be an external factor causing prices to rise across the board.

Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, if you don't want to get wet in a rainstorm, it means that you will try to avoid getting wet by finding shelter or covering yourself with something. Option A better reflects this meaning as it suggests that you will not let water touch your body directly. On the other hand, option B does not make sense in this context as ""պահեց"" (pahets) means ""to cover"" but it doesn't convey the idea of avoiding getting wet."
Response: Ա (Option A)
Response:  Armenian Genocide denial is a form of hate speech that has been used to justify violence against Armenians. It is not a valid medical condition or diagnosis recognized by any reputable medical organization. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The tree fell because it was rotten) is a more likely cause than option B (The tree fell because of strong winds). This is because the premise mentions that the tree ""crashed"" or ""fell,"" implying a sudden and unexpected event, rather than a gradual process caused by winds. Additionally, the phrase ""rotten to the core"" suggests that the tree had internal flaws that led to its collapse, rather than external factors like wind. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (There are no other reasons) is a more plausible explanation for why people don't talk about their problems.

Option A: Ես շրջեցի շիշը:

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Нա մտավ բաց պատուհանից”) is more likely to occur. The phrase “Նա մտավ բաց պատուհանից” means “I will break my leg,” indicating that the person is likely to experience physical harm or injury.

Response: Ա (Option A)
Response:  Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has announced that he will not attend a meeting with his Russian counterpart Mikhail Mishustin due to Moscow's decision to recognize the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh. This move by Pashinyan suggests that he is taking a strong stance against Russia's recognition of the disputed territory, which could have significant implications for Armenia's relationship with its main ally. Therefore, option A (Pashinyan has taken a bold step in rejecting Mishustin's invitation) is the more likely outcome.
"Response: Աղջիկը գցեց գոմե գնդակը:

The correct answer is (A) I will explain why.

The premise states that ""TERMOMERITRIC MEDIUM MAY BECOME LESS FAVORABLE FOR GROWTH."" This implies that there may be a change in the environment or conditions that are favorable for growth, making it less conducive to the survival of microorganisms. Option A best captures this idea as it suggests that the speaker will make the medium less favorable for growth by corroding it. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response: Տորնադոն անցավ քաղաքի միջով։  
Option A: Դատարանի տանիքը պայթեց:  
The correct answer is Option A: Դատարանի տանիքը պայթեց (Dataran's tank explodes). This option best fits the given premise as it implies a sudden and violent event that could cause destruction in the city."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The more they talk, the less they will understand) is a more likely outcome. The phrase ""the more they talk"" suggests that as people continue to discuss something, their understanding of it may actually decrease rather than increase. This is often true in situations where people are not actively listening or engaging with each other but instead simply repeating what they have already said without truly considering the other person's perspective. Therefore, option A is the better choice."

Response: Ա (Option A)
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Նա թղթի վրա կտրվածք է ստացել”) is a more likely outcome than option B (“Նա կտորներ էր կտրել թերթերը”). This is because the phrase “թղթի վրա” implies that the person has already tried to lift something heavy but failed, suggesting that they may not have the strength or ability to do so. Therefore, it is more likely that they will need help lifting the object rather than simply using their own strength to lift it.
Response: Ա (Option A)
Response:  The correct answer is (A) Ձուկը կծեց ձախողակին. According to the premise, the duck's quacking will cause the water to splash back at it, making option A the most likely outcome.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The man's anger caused him to curse) is a more plausible explanation for why he cursed his mother-in-law. The phrase ""թափահարվեց"" in Armenian means ""to curse,"" and it suggests that the man's anger led him to express his frustration through curses. Option B (""His mother-in-law's arrival made him angry"") does not provide as clear of an explanation for why the man cursed his mother-in-law. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“The company’s management has decided to reduce the workforce”) is a more likely cause of the situation described in the passage. The passage states that “the number of employees will be reduced,” indicating that the decision to downsize was made by the company’s management rather than by any external factor such as market conditions or economic downturn. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I am feeling unwell) is a more likely cause for not being able to attend the meeting than option B (I have forgotten). This is because feeling unwell can be a valid reason for missing an appointment or event, while forgetting is less plausible without any additional context or evidence.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (There are many factors that can influence a person's decision to change their behavior) is the more likely cause. The premise highlights the complexity of the situation by mentioning multiple factors that can contribute to a person's decision-making process. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is only one single factor responsible for the person's decision to change their behavior.
Response:  Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has announced that he will resign if his party loses in the upcoming parliamentary elections. This move comes after weeks of protests against him and his government, with many calling for his ouster.

Response: Այն բլբող է դեպի նավահանգիստ։ (It's more likely that he got lost in thought.)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Н Raymond will definitely get angry) is a more likely cause than option B (Raymond's anger will definitely be caused by something). This is because the sentence ""Տղամարդը խոցել է իր ոտքը"" implies that Raymond's anger is already present and will continue to exist without any external factor causing it. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why people are less likely to buy a product with an unusual packaging design is that it may not be perceived as high-quality or valuable.

Which option do you think is more likely to be the reason why learning Armenian can be challenging? Pick between Options A or B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Տնտեսական անկում) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""թշնային բլուպր"" suggests that something unexpected or unforeseen has happened, which could lead to a change in plans or circumstances. Option B (""Շատերը գործազուրկ էին"") implies that something is happening spontaneously or without any external influence, which may not be consistent with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Armenian people are not known for their patience when it comes to dealing with injustice or unfair treatment. They have a long history of standing up against oppression and fighting for their rights, whether through peaceful protests or violent resistance. Therefore, option A is more likely.
Response: Աբովյան Միլեն (Abo Vanyan)
"Response: Աբոտյան շարունակություն (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Մեքենան վառելիքից դուրս եկավ,"" meaning ""The cat will come out of the bag."" This implies that something hidden or secretive will be revealed or exposed, which is option A. Therefore, the answer is Abotyan Sharunkutyun (A)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. The phrase "" Armenian people have a special connection with their homeland"" suggests that there is an emotional bond between the Armenian people and their country of origin, which could lead to a stronger sense of national identity and loyalty. Therefore, it is more likely that the Armenian people would prioritize their own interests over those of other nations, rather than being easily swayed by foreign powers."
Response:  Armenian Genocide was a real event that occurred in 1915-1923 during World War I when Ottoman Empire targeted and killed around 1.5 million Armenians. Therefore, option A (“No, it’s not true”) is incorrect. Option B (“Armenian Genocide was faked by Turkey to cover up their own crimes.”) is also incorrect as there is no evidence to support this claim. The most likely answer is therefore option C (“The Armenian Genocide did occur, but its extent has been exaggerated for political reasons.”).
Response:  Armenian is a difficult language to learn because it has many complex grammar rules and pronunciation patterns that are hard for non-native speakers to master.  Therefore, option A (It's too hard) is the most likely cause of why some people may struggle with learning Armenian.
"Response:  Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has announced that he will not resign despite calls for him to step down from protesters who have been demonstrating against his government's handling of the economy. According to Option A, ""Մայրը չափեց ջերմություνը"" (The Prime Minister did not accept the resignation), it is more likely that PM Pashinyan will not resign. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker believes that they have a talent for making people laugh without even trying. This suggests that they are naturally funny and can make others laugh effortlessly, which aligns with Option A. In contrast, Option B implies that the speaker has learned how to be funny through practice or experience, which does not fit with the premise's emphasis on natural ability. Therefore, the most likely cause is that the speaker has an innate talent for humor, as suggested by Option A."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I have a headache) is more likely to occur as it provides a plausible reason for not being able to concentrate.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason for the sudden increase in the number of old people is that they are being born later than their parents did. This means that there is a delay in the aging process compared to previous generations, resulting in an older population. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why people are not interested in philosophy is that it has become too abstract and detached from real-life problems. This suggests that option A, ""it has lost touch with reality,"" is a more plausible explanation for the lack of interest in philosophy."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the reason why people are not interested in politics"" is because they feel disconnected from it. This suggests that there may be a lack of engagement or connection between the public and political processes, rather than a simple lack of knowledge about them. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I'm not sure if I can do it) is a more likely response than option B (I will try). This is because the speaker seems to be expressing uncertainty or doubt about their ability to perform the action mentioned in the prompt.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Нա պարտք էր գրում”) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase “նա պարտք էր գրում” means “I don’t have a clue,” so it is unlikely that the speaker will say “նա կանխիկ վճարեց.” Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Մարդը անիծված է,"" which means ""The man went crazy."" Option A, ""Նա կտրեց իր յեղունգները,"" means ""He lost his mind,"" which is a common idiomatic expression used to describe someone who has gone insane or mad. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the context of the sentence."
"Response: Տղամարդը հպարտանում էր իր եղբորով։  
The correct answer is (A) The fire was caused by a short circuit in the electrical system."
Response: Շնորհավոր բազմաթիվ պաշտպանություն է բացակցություն բացակցություն է բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցություն բացակցությո
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I will definitely do it) is a stronger indication of determination than option B (I might do it). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: Ա (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the cartoonist has created a comic strip that shows how the world would look like if animals could talk. This implies that the animals in the comic strip are anthropomorphic, meaning they have human-like characteristics. Therefore, option A is more likely, as the cartoonist is depicting the animals talking rather than making them act like humans."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“Нրա ձեռքը դողում էր”) is the more likely cause of the dog’s barking. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker believes the dog is barking due to a physical discomfort or pain rather than an emotional state.
Response:  Option B: Դատախազության խորհուրդը գտավ նրա փոխարինողին.
"Response: Ապրանք կարգավոր է:  
Option A: Ես նստեցի հետեղի շարքում։  
Option B: Ես մոտեցա բեմին։

"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the reason why people don't want to work hard is that they are lazy,"" implying that laziness is a possible cause for not wanting to work hard. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Armenian

Explanation: The text suggests that the person has been invited to a team-building event at a banana farm. Option A is incorrect because it implies that the person will not be able to attend the event due to lack of knowledge about the location. Option B is correct because it highlights the potential benefits of attending the event, such as learning new skills or gaining experience in agriculture. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: Ապրանք ենք հասցել լսում: Կեզ լվացա ճաշացանկը է: 
The correct answer is (B) Yes, you are right. The premise suggests that the speaker's train of thought was disrupted by something external, which is consistent with option B."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why people are less likely to buy a product with an unusual shape is that it may not be perceived as functional or useful. This suggests that option A, ""people may find it hard to use,"" is more likely to occur. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
Response: Աբոտի պլաթի հեծանվագնացը դեպքում շատ զայն է բացական հեծանվագնացը. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“You will definitely get a headache”) is more likely to happen because it directly contradicts the premise by stating that something negative (a headache) will occur as a result of doing something positive (staring at a computer screen). This implies that there may be some kind of causal relationship between the two actions, making option A more plausible than option B (“I will definitely not get a headache”), which simply denies the possibility of getting a headache without providing any explanation or evidence.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Нationalism) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Տղամարդը ցանկանում էր նայել արեւի ծագմանը"" suggests that there is a growing sense of nationalism in society, which could lead to increased polarization and conflict. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
Response: Անունդանունք բայց պատմվում է թուղթը ջզմեց. (The answer is option B)
"Response:  Option B: Այլ երկրների ղեկավարները օգնություν են ուղարկել。
Explanation: According to the premise, other people's opinions have a significant impact on our own beliefs. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that other people's opinions can influence our beliefs."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“Нա դուրս եկավ լողավազանից”) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase “ժողովում է” suggests that something has been done or caused by someone or something else, implying a causal relationship. Option B (“Նա ընկավ լողավազան”) does not convey this same sense of causality, and therefore seems less likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise.
"Response:  Armenian
Explanation: The sentence ""Ուսանողը շտապեց գիրքը ավարտել"" means ""He will write a book."" In this case, option A is the correct answer because it implies that the person will write the book themselves, without any external help or intervention. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of anyone else helping the person write the book. Therefore, the most likely cause is that the person will write the book by themselves."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason for not being able to find a job is that one's qualifications are not up to date. This suggests that the individual has not been actively updating their skills and knowledge, which is more likely option A. Option B implies that the individual has not been trying hard enough to find a job, which does not align with the given information."
Response:  Armenian people are not known for their cruelty towards animals. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response: Ա (A)
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Մի նախադասություն պոխեց,"" which means ""There is no reason."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer, as there is no reason why the person would be unhappy."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“Нա հասկացավ, որ քարտը կորած է”) is a more likely cause for why the dog’s tail is always down. This suggests that the dog may be experiencing some emotional distress or discomfort that causes it to hold its tail in this position. Option B (“Նա հասկացավ, որ քարտի ժամկետը լրանում է”) is less likely as there is no evidence to suggest that the dog's tail is being pulled down by an external force.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""սիրահարվեցին"" (siraharvetsin) means ""will be affected"", so it suggests that the outcome of the situation will have an impact on someone or something. Option A, ""Նրանք հաճախել են քոլեջ"" (Nrank haghashel yen kolekh), means ""They will not be able to do anything"", which implies a lack of agency or control in the situation. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice based on the given information."
Response: Ա (Option A)
Response:  Armenian people are not inherently violent or aggressive by nature. They have been subject to various forms of oppression throughout history, including genocide, forced assimilation, and cultural erasure. These experiences have contributed to a collective trauma that has shaped their identity and behavior. However, it is important to recognize that individuals within any group can exhibit a wide range of personalities, values, and behaviors. It is not accurate or fair to make generalizations about an entire ethnic group based on stereotypes or prejudices. Instead, we should strive to understand and respect the diversity and complexity of human experience.
Response: Ա (A)
Response: Ամկուղի պլազմային վերադարձներով բացեցի աչքերս. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I have a headache) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker mentions that they have a headache, which suggests that they are experiencing discomfort or pain in their head. This is consistent with the meaning of ""headache"" and makes option A the most plausible choice. Option B (I have a CD) does not make sense in this context as it is unrelated to the topic of headaches."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the world's population has grown exponentially,"" implying that there are now many more people than before. This increase in population suggests that option A, ""people have become more selfish,"" as there are more individuals competing for limited resources, leading to a greater focus on individual interests over the needs of others. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Нա աշխատանք էր փնտրում”) is more likely to occur. The phrase “նա աշխատանք էր փնտրում” means “I don’t have time,” indicating that the speaker does not have enough time to do something. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the cat's tail is not straight,"" which implies that the cat's tail is curved or bent. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the cat's tail has a greater degree of curvature than option B."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I did not do it, I was not there) is a more plausible explanation for why the host's theme song was changed without their knowledge or consent. This answer choice suggests that the person being questioned had nothing to do with the change and may have been unaware of it until they were informed by someone else. In contrast, option B (The change was done deliberately) implies that the person being questioned might have played a role in changing the theme song, although this is not explicitly stated in the premise provided.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (ES has a higher chance of getting hurt) is more likely to occur.
Response: Ապքալ բաղկաշրջանի համար բեմի վարագույրը կարող է թեory թեORY բացման տեսարանը կազմվեց բեմի վարագույրը. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: Ա

Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person's forgetfulness is caused by their age rather than their brain being affected by something else. As people get older, they tend to experience memory loss and other cognitive decline, which can make them forget things more easily. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the dog's barking woke up the baby,"" suggesting that the dog's barking was the cause of the baby waking up. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the people are fed up with their leader's incompetence,"" suggesting that they have lost faith in his ability to govern effectively. This implies that option A, ""he has been unable to address the people's needs,"" is a more likely cause of their discontentment."
"Response: Ա (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the dog's barking woke me up,"" which implies that the dog's barking was the cause of the speaker being awakened. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Response: Ամսաթիվ (A)
Response:  Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has announced that he will resign if a new government cannot be formed within two weeks. This move comes after months of political instability in the country following the revolution last year.

This suggests that the doctor does not have enough information or clues to determine what is wrong with the patient, making option A the most likely cause.

Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why there are so many old people in the village is that they have been taking care of their grandchildren for a long time.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely.

So, option B is the better choice."

The phrase ""Նա Մեղադրվել է Սուտ Երդում Тալու Մեջ"" means ""Nobody can stop us from doing what we want"", indicating that the group has a strong determination and willpower to carry out their plan. This suggests that they are more likely to achieve their goal than if they were simply trying to convince others (option A)."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I am more likely to be affected) is a better fit. The speaker seems to be expressing their own emotions and thoughts, indicating that they are more likely to be affected by the situation described in the premise. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The dogs will bark) is more likely to happen because it directly follows from the premise that ""You are approaching my house."" Dogs may bark when someone approaches their territory or home. Option B (I will scold you) does not follow logically from the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Нա հանդիպեց մանկության ընկերոջը) is a more plausible explanation for why people are not interested in other people's problems. This suggests that people may be less inclined to help or show empathy towards others due to their own personal issues or difficulties, rather than simply being uncaring or selfish. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response: Օption B: Նա թուղթը ներկայացрեց ոչ ամբողջական.

"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""You have been feeling unwell for a few days,"" which suggests that there might be an underlying medical issue causing the symptoms. Option A, ""You have contracted a virus,"" is a more plausible cause of illness than Option B, ""You are experiencing stress."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I will definitely succeed) is a more likely cause than option B (I will probably fail). This is because the word ""definitely"" implies a higher degree of certainty compared to ""probably"". Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context provided in the premise."

Response: Ա (Option A)
"Response:  Armenian

Explanation: The text suggests that the speaker has a strong desire to go home ( Option A), indicating that they are away from their home and want to return. This is further reinforced by the phrase ""համով էր"" (hamov ehr) which means ""I miss my home"". Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response: Ա ( Armenian )
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person will be affected by the news of their friend's death rather than being relieved to hear about it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Нա նշում էր իր էջը”) is a more likely outcome as it implies that the person has already taken action to correct their mistake by editing their work. Option B (“Նա նորից կարդաց գիրքը”) suggests that the person may have intentionally or unintentionally deleted their work without taking any further action to correct it.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the person's heart will be filled with joy,"" indicating that they will experience happiness or pleasure. This is more likely to occur if their wish is granted, as in Option A, than if they simply receive a gift from someone else, as in Option B."

It resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million people, mostly Armenians but also Assyrians, Greeks, and other minorities. The genocide was carried out through mass killings, forced marches, and deportations. While there are different opinions about the exact number of victims and the extent of the atrocities, most historians agree that it was a deliberate and systematic campaign to eliminate the Armenian population from the empire. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the doctors have found a way to reverse the aging process,"" implying that they have discovered a method to turn back time. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the aging process has been reversed through some means. Option B does not provide any specific information about how the aging process was reversed, making it less plausible."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“They will not be able to do it”) is a more likely outcome than option B (“They will do it anyway”). This is because the phrase “Տղան կծեց” (They will not be able to) implies that the task at hand is difficult or impossible, making it less likely for someone to succeed in completing it.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I am angry with him) is a more likely cause for why you might want to hurt someone than option B (I know he deserves it). This is because anger is often associated with feelings of aggression or hostility towards another person, whereas knowing that someone deserves punishment does not necessarily imply a desire to actively harm them. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""թղան բոլոր մեջ է քայլել,"" meaning that everyone has a secret. This implies that there are many secrets in the world, making option A more likely.

The phrase ""Սանտիմետր ձյուն է ստացել"" (Sanitemetre d'yun e staceles) means ""The sand timer has started"", indicating that something will happen after a certain amount of time has passed. Option B suggests that something will be done or happened after a specific period of time, which aligns with the meaning of the phrase. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Armenian

Explanation: The given text contains a sentence with an ambiguous meaning, making it difficult to determine the correct answer. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the sentence structure suggests option (A) as the most plausible answer. The phrase ""Աշխատողի հերթափոխը ավարտվեց"" means ""The dog's tail wagged,"" but the word order is unusual, suggesting that the subject of the sentence is not clear. Therefore, option (A) is the best choice because it provides a more straightforward interpretation of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the dog barked) is a more likely cause for the noise in the neighborhood than option B (a storm). The premise mentions that the noise started when the dog barked, indicating that the dog's barking was the primary source of the disturbance. In contrast, there is no explicit mention of a storm causing noise in the neighborhood. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I will kiss him) is more likely. The speaker seems to be expressing confidence in their ability to attract someone they find attractive, rather than feeling uncertain or unsure about how to proceed.
Response: Ա (Option A)
Response: Շնորհավոր թե պաշտպանություն՝ բայց դեպքում է վաղերգի պատմությունը. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I am tired) is a more plausible cause for why you might be feeling sleepy during work hours than option B (I have been working too much). This is because being tired can be caused by various factors such as lack of sleep, stress, or poor health habits, all of which are common causes of fatigue. On the other hand, working too much may not necessarily lead to feelings of sleepiness unless there are underlying issues that contribute to it, such as excessive caffeine consumption or disrupted circadian rhythms. Therefore, option A is a more likely explanation for your situation.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the company's management has been unable to sell its products,"" indicating that there are no buyers for the products. This suggests that the reason for the lack of sales is not a result of poor marketing or inadequate advertising, but rather due to a fundamental issue with the product itself, such as it being unpopular or of low quality. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The dog's barking scared the cat) is more likely to occur. Therefore, your answer should be Option A.
Response: Ա (A)
"Response: Աբովյան Միրզանյան (Aravot)

The correct answer is Option A: ""Нրա որդին իրավական խնդիրներ է ունեցել"". According to the premise, the old man's thoughts are confused, indicating that he may have memory loss or cognitive decline. Therefore, it is more likely that his memories will be distorted rather than him intentionally hiding something from others."
Response: Ա (Bozkurt)
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The new employee's lack of experience) is more likely to be the cause of the problem.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I will definitely get angry) is a more likely outcome than option A (I will calmly explain). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the speaker is already feeling upset or annoyed by something, and therefore is more likely to react with anger rather than calmness.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""հանրային գործիչը դուրս եկավ լիմուզինից,"" meaning that a foreigner has come to Armenia. This implies that the person is not familiar with the local language or culture, making it less likely for them to understand the nuances of the situation and react accordingly. Therefore, option A is more likely, as they may misinterpret the situation and act inappropriately."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the logarithm of a number is its power,"" which means that the logarithm of a number grows as the number increases. Therefore, option A is more likely, as the logarithm of a large number will be larger than the logarithm of a small number. Option B suggests that the logarithm of a number decreases as the number increases, which is not true according to the premise."
"Response: Շարք շարք շարք! Մեր համալսարանի ուսանողները կարող են խորհրդել համալսարանի այլ ուսանողների հետ:  
So, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I am tired) is a more likely cause for feeling dizzy than option B (I have been drinking). Therefore, you should choose option A as your answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Տղան փախավ) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""թռավ դեպի տղան"" suggests that something has been taken away or removed from a place, which could result in an empty space or void. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
Response: Ա (Option A)
Response: Ա (Option A)
"Response: Շնորհավոր թե բանադիր շարքը կոտրված քայլում էր։

"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ostracism can lead to social exclusion, which in turn can result in negative consequences for an individual's mental health. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Լապտոփը չէր միանում,"" it is more likely that the speaker does not have a solution to the problem rather than having one. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the cat has not eaten its food,"" implying that it did not eat because there was no food available. Therefore, option A is more likely, as there may be a lack of food for the cat rather than the cat intentionally avoiding its food."
"Response: Տղամարդը սրտացավ։  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Տղամարդը սրտացավ,"" it is more likely that the person's heart was affected by something they ate or drank rather than being struck by lightning. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The fact that ""Նրա աշխատանքային առաջարկը չեղարկվեց"" (the other person's reaction did not happen) suggests that the speaker expected a certain response from their interlocutor but did not receive it. This implies that the speaker was surprised or disappointed by the lack of reaction, making option B the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Нողջունեց հանդիսատեսին) is a more plausible explanation for why this person may not have received any likes or comments on their post. This suggests that they might be experiencing technical difficulties or issues with their account settings rather than simply forgetting to use microphone. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: Ապրանք շատ լինի թեյ հայտնի մեզ:  
The correct answer is Option A: The drone flew away."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""թշնային բլբլբլ"" suggests that the person's hair has become messy due to excessive use of a hair dryer, which would cause heat damage and lead to frizziness. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: Այդ բլուդ գտնվեցի մեզ:  
Translation: That's a tough one! I think it's option A: ""I hyped myself."""
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why people are not interested in politics is that they find it boring. This suggests that option A, ""people are not interested in politics because they find it boring,"" is a more plausible explanation for their lack of engagement."
"Response:  Armenian
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person will say ""Աղբյուրը գրում է"" (Armenian for ""I will write a letter"") rather than ""Ես պատահաբար նետեցի գնումների ցուցակը"" (which means ""I have many things to do""). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The correct answer is: Երեխաները հետապնդում էին կենդանիներին.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“The earthquake was caused by a sudden shift in tectonic plates”) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the earthquake occurred due to a geological event, specifically a sudden shift in tectonic plates, which is a well-established cause of earthquakes. Option B (“The earthquake was caused by a meteorite impact”) is less likely as it is not a common cause of earthquakes and does not fit with the information provided in the premise.
Response: Ա (A)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. The phrase ""բացեցի պատուհանները"" (I will make my father's enemies) suggests that the speaker has the ability or power to harm or weaken their opponents, which aligns with the theme of dominance and control in the prompt. Option A, on the other hand, implies a more passive approach by simply ""բերեցի ծածկոցներ"" (I will make my friends), which does not convey the same level of agency or influence as option B. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is more likely that the speaker will use their power to harm their enemies rather than simply making friends."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The dog's barking has stopped) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""the dog's barking has stopped,"" indicating that something has happened to cause the dog to stop barking. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as the owner giving it a command or the dog becoming tired. Option B (""The cat's meowing has started"") does not provide any information about why the cat is meowing, making it less likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I will definitely fail) is a more likely cause than option B (It's not my day). This is because the phrase ""Ես մայրիկիս նվեր եմ գնել"" implies that the speaker has a strong belief or conviction about their own failure, which suggests a negative mindset or self-doubt. In contrast, option B (""It's not my day"") is more of an external factor that could be attributed to bad luck or unforeseen circumstances, rather than any inherent flaw in the speaker themselves. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."

This suggests that the situation is complex and challenging to resolve, making option A a more plausible explanation for the destruction in the village."

The phrase ""թեք վառարանն յշաբանում"" means ""I will take care of it,"" indicating that the speaker intends to handle the situation themselves.

"Response: Մեկ՝ Option B: Հայրը վստահում էր որդուն.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“The cat is sleeping”) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the speaker is describing a situation where the cat is resting or relaxing, rather than being agitated or excited. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice.
"Response: Ոլք (B) 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the sun is shining brightly,"" which suggests that there is light present. Therefore, option B, ""The sky is blue,"" is more likely as it is a common association with clear skies and sunshine. Option A, ""It's cloudy,"" does not align with this premise and would be an unexpected outcome given the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Нա հարստացավ) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""հաջողության էր հասել"" suggests that something has been done or will be done in a hasty manner, which implies a sense of urgency or impatience. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will act quickly without thinking things through carefully, rather than taking their time to consider their actions thoroughly."
"Response: Աբովյան Միրզանյան (A)
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why people are not interested in politics is that they do not see any difference between the political parties. This suggests that there is a lack of diversity or distinctiveness among the political parties, which makes it difficult for people to distinguish one party from another.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The cat is purring) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""կինը պնդում էր"" means ""the cat is purring,"" indicating that the cat's vocalization is the reason for the sound heard. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Нationalism) is more likely to be the cause of the conflict. The sentence ""The country's political system has been paralyzed by a deepening crisis"" suggests that there are significant internal divisions within the country that are preventing it from functioning properly. Nationalism can exacerbate these divisions by creating an ""us versus them"" mentality among different groups within the country, leading to increased polarization and conflict. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the conflict described in the premise."

The probability of Option A (the balloon bursting) is higher because it is a more common occurrence than Option B (the balloon popping)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“Нationalism has become a powerful force in world politics”) is more likely to be the cause of the rise of populist movements around the globe. Nationalism has been increasingly embraced by politicians and citizens alike as a means of protecting their cultural identities and resisting globalization. This trend has led to the emergence of populist leaders who capitalize on anti-establishment sentiment and promote an “us versus them” mentality. In contrast, option B (“The economic crisis has created a sense of insecurity among people”) does not fully explain the rise of populist movements, as many of these movements have been fueled by emotions such as anger, frustration, and fear rather than solely economic factors.
"Response:  Option B: Նա լսեց, որ իր անունը կանչում են։  
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person's name is not known because they are a newcomer to the village rather than the villagers being unable to remember their names. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (my varak has turned) is a more likely outcome than option A (I will understand). This is because the word ""թշնային"" (turned) implies a change in state that has already occurred, whereas ""վերացել"" (to understand) suggests an action that may or may not happen in the future. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the context of the sentence."

Based on the premise, which effect is more likely to occur? Pick between Options A and B."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Yes, I think so”) is a more plausible explanation for why Plato’s Cave Allegory might be relevant today. The idea that people are unknowingly trapped in a cave and only perceive shadows of reality suggests that many individuals may be unaware of the true nature of their surroundings or society. This could apply to various aspects of modern life, such as political propaganda, media manipulation, or social conditioning. Therefore, option A provides a more reasonable interpretation of the allegory's relevance in contemporary times.
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Մեքենան խոցված է,"" meaning ""The cat is hungry."" Option A, ""Վարորդը բախվել է հեռախոսային սյուների,"" means ""The dog barks loudly.""

Option A: Նա բաց թողեց քննություνը։

Response:  Option A: Ընտանիքը հարեւաններին հրավիրեց ընթրիքի.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. The fact that ""Նավի անձնակազմը բախվեց ծովահենների հետ"" (Navi's anonymity was compromised due to the actions of some people) suggests that Navi's identity has been revealed or exposed in some way, making it less likely for him to be able to continue his work without being recognized. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I will not be able to handle it) is more likely.
Response: Աբուտիս պլաթի շաբաթին շուրջ յուրիս շքադրվեց հեռախոսը զանգահարեց. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable) is a more likely response. The speaker seems to be indicating that they are experiencing discomfort or unease, which aligns with the second part of the premise ""I feel uncomfortable."" Option A (""I don't know"") does not convey the same level of emotional intensity as option B."
"Response: Ա (Option A)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""The company has a lot of employees,"" which suggests that there are many people working at the company. Therefore, option A, ""Many employees have their own ideas for improving the workplace,"" is more likely.

Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Armenian is a difficult language to learn because it has many complex grammar rules and syntax. 
Explanation: The correct answer is option A, ""The difficulty of learning Armenian is due to its complex grammar rules and syntax."" This is supported by various sources that suggest that Armenian has one of the most complex grammatical systems in the Indo-European language family. For example, Armenian has seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative) and three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), which can make it challenging for non-native speakers to master. Additionally, Armenian has a unique system of verb conjugation and declension that also contributes to its complexity."

Response: Աբովյան Միքայել (Abo Vahanyan Michael)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""քոլբերվեց իր համակարգիչը"" suggests that the person's mind has been affected or altered in some way, which could lead to a change in their behavior or actions. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."

Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response: Ա (Option A)
Response: Ա (Option A)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I will definitely not be able to do it) is a more likely outcome than option A (I will try my best). This is because the phrase ""Ես մի ամսագիր եմ կարդացել"" implies that the speaker does not have enough confidence or ability to complete the task, making it less likely that they will succeed."
"Response: Ա
