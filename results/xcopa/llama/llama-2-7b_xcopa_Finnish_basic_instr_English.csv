"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Löysin lipun) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Tyhjensin taskut"" means ""The sky is empty"", so it's unlikely that there will be any clouds or light in the sky for the sun to shine through. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Leirinvalvoja kertoi heille tarinan kummituksista) is more likely to be the cause of their fear. The story told by the camp monitor would have been a source of frightening information that could have contributed to their nightmares.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hän halusi tukea ystäväänsä) is more likely as it suggests that Mies wanted to support his friend, rather than just thinking about what he had said.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Onnettomuus oli minun syytäni,"" option A (Tunsini syyllisyyttä) is a more likely response than option B (-Minä nostin syytteen). This is because the phrase ""onnettomuus oli minun syytäni"" implies that the speaker believes they are responsible for the accident, which aligns with option A. Option B suggests that someone or something else caused the accident, which does not fit with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ketju hajosi"", option A is more likely. The word ""hajosi"" implies that something broke or shattered, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, it is more likely that Ketju was wrapped around a ring than one of its eyes being broken (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He väsyivät riitelemään) is more likely. The text states that they were tired of negotiating, indicating that they had been trying to reach a compromise for some time without success.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (laid it in the microwave) caused the ice cream to become soft. This is because microwaves can quickly heat up food without cooking it evenly, leading to a soft or mushy texture. In contrast, peeling off the plastic packaging may not have had as much of an impact on the texture of the ice cream. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for why the ice cream became soft.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hänellä oli vatsakramppeja) is more likely as a cause for why the employee called in sick. The statement suggests that the employee was actually experiencing stomach cramps, which could be a legitimate reason for missing work. In contrast, Option B (Hän halusi vapaapäivän) does not provide any specific medical reason for the employee's absence and seems less plausible given the context of the scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tyttö putosi altaaseen"", option A (She fell into the water) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Elokuva sai huonoja arvosteluja) is the more likely cause for why the movie was not successful at the box office.

"Response: 
Option B: They negotiated a treaty."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hänestä tuli unelias) is more likely.

Explanation: The premise ""Nainen törmäsi sohvaan"" (A woman bumped into a couch) suggests that she may have fallen or tripped over something, causing her to injure herself. Scratching one's leg is a common injury that can occur when someone falls or bumps into something hard. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pallopallo räjähti) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He menivät lentokentalle) is more likely. The fact that they were passengers who had checked into a hotel suggests that their destination was not an airport but rather a city or town where they would be staying in a hotel. Therefore, option B is more plausible than option A (They opened their luggage).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Persikka on ruhjeissa) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Minä purin persikkaa"" suggests that the speaker is eating a persimmon, but the additional information provided in Option A clarifies that the persimmon is actually inside a fruit jar. This detail makes it less likely that the persimmon is outside in the open air, as suggested by Option B. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Käteni liimistuivat,"" option A (Söin donitsin) is the more likely cause. The word ""liimistuivat"" means ""became sticky,"" indicating that something has become stuck to one's hands.

Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why one's hands might be sticky."

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Tuotteet testattiin laadunvarmistusta varten) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""aktivistit boikotoivat tuotteita,"" indicating that there was a boycott of products, and then goes on to explain that this was due to concerns about quality control. This suggests that the activists were protesting the quality of the products rather than their production methods. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Pöly puhalsi ulos reiästä) is more likely. The sentence ""Porasin reiän seinään"" implies that there is a hole in the wall, and therefore it is more likely that something inside the room would come out of the hole rather than an animal or dust coming from outside the room."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Hänen siskonsa erosi) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Vaihdoin paidan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Kaadoin viiniä paitaani"" suggests that something unpleasant or harmful is happening to the speaker's body, and changing their clothes would be a logical response to this situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kassa avasi kassan"", it is more likely that option A (Asiakas etsi lompakkoaan) is correct.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She missed her parents) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise highlights the character's longing for their parents, indicating that they are missing them. This suggests that the character has been separated from their parents for an extended period of time, which could be due to various reasons such as moving away or being estranged. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B, which only provides a vague explanation without providing any context or details about the situation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Lentäjä lensi myrskyn läpi) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Lehdet muuttuivat väreiksi) is more likely. The word ""muuttuivat"" in Finnish means ""changed"", so it's likely that the leaves changed color rather than gathering together."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Matkustajat laskeutuivat junasta,"" option A (Juna saapui asemalle) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He panicked the wax seal) is more likely. The wax seal would be broken if he panicked it, but not if he simply closed the envelope.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Käteni ahdistui,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""vaimoni"" suggests a romantic partner, rather than a handwritten essay. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's wife held their hand tightly, causing them distress, rather than writing an essay by hand."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vaihdoin sen) is a more plausible cause for why Pultti's nose started to twitch than option B (Käänsin venyksen). This is because there is no logical connection between käänsin venyksen and a person's nose starting to twitch. In contrast, vaihdoin sen could be interpreted as meaning ""I will sneeze"" or ""I am about to sneeze,"" which would make sense in the context of someone's nose starting to twitch before they actually sneeze. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the provided information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Kaupungin viranomaiset hylkäsivät asunnon) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She wanted to see the sunset) is more likely the correct answer.

This is because it suggests that the garden had not been maintained or cared for in a long time, allowing the weeds to take over. Option B (Se oli täynnä rikkaruohoa) does not provide any specific information about how the garden became overgrown, and could potentially be caused by other factors such as neglect or lack of maintenance.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nainen nukkui"", option A is more likely. The fact that she spent the night in a hotel suggests that she was not at home when she forgot to set her alarm clock, making it less likely that she simply forgot to do so."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (tutkijat todistivat teorian) is a more likely explanation for how the theory was accepted by experts. The passage suggests that it was through rigorous scientific testing and analysis conducted by experts in the field that the theory gained acceptance, rather than simply being approved or accepted by individual scientists or any other group of people. Therefore, option A is the better choice.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tunsi viileän ilman kulkevan päälleni) is more likely. The phrase ""tunsi viileän ilman"" suggests that the speaker felt cold air passing over their body, indicating that they were outside in a cool or cold environment. Option A (""Vettä ruiskutettiin iholle"") does not provide any information about the temperature or weather conditions, so it is less likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Surffaajat palasivat rannalle,"" option A is more likely. The word ""läpimärkä"" means ""wavy"" or ""undulating"", which suggests that the waves were rough and choppy, making it difficult for them to swim back to shore. Therefore, option A is a better fit than option B, as there is no mention of anything visible in the water that could have caused them to lose their way."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vesi tyhjensi ammeesta) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""vedin kylpyammeesta"" suggests that there is a lot of steam coming from the bathroom, which could cause water to evaporate quickly and leave the floor dry. Option B (Vesi piserrettiin lattialle) does not make sense in this context as it implies that water would be poured onto the floor, which is unlikely given the amount of steam present. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hän tunnusti uskottomuutensa) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Odotin, että muste kuivuu) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The fact that the ink is still wet suggests that it has not had enough time to dry, which could indicate that the ink is too fresh or that there are issues with the printing process. On the other hand, adding water to the ink may actually make the problem worse by diluting the ink and causing it to spread unevenly, leading to a messier appearance. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the issue.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Lapsi woke up screaming due to a nightmare (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Hänen isänsä istui pöytään) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Poika pani jalkansa pöydälle"" implies that a boy put his feet on the table, which would not be appropriate or respectful behavior in many cultures. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's father sat down at the table rather than him."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Huusin hänen nimeään) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and verb tenses suggest that the speaker was reacting to someone turning towards them, and ""huusin"" means ""to shout"", indicating a sudden and forceful action. Option B (Minä heilutin käsiäni), on the other hand, suggests a more deliberate and controlled action, such as waving one's hands. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kansalaiset järjestivät kapinan) is more likely. The premise suggests that there was a resistance or uprising among the citizens, which implies that they were actively involved in organizing and participating in the event.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He pitched a tent) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She wanted to learn how to draw) is more likely. The premise highlights her desire to acquire a specific skill, which aligns with Option A. Option B does not provide any context or reason for why she would want to experience other cultures.

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Mies näki harhoja) is correct. The phrase ""Mies näki avaruusolioita"" suggests that he saw something in his mind's eye, but does not provide any explicit evidence of him seeing hallucinations or meditating. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened to Mies."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Maanjäristys järjesti kirjakaapin) is more likely as a cause for why books are falling off shelves. Earthquakes can cause structural damage to buildings and bookshelves, leading to books falling off or becoming dislodged. On the other hand, mold growing in the library may not be strong enough to pull books off their shelves. Therefore, option B is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sytytin valo) is more likely to cause the lights to go out. The sytytin valo is a device that produces an electrical spark when turned on, which can potentially damage or destroy electronic devices such as light bulbs. Therefore, it is more likely that turning on the sytytin valo would cause the lights to go out rather than adjusting the voltage of the power supply.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ajoimme vuoritoradalla,"" option B is more likely. The sentence suggests that something exciting or thrilling happened while they were driving down the mountain, which aligns better with the meaning of ""Se näytti hauskalta."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kaadoin voita pussiin) is more likely. The word ""kaado"" in Finnish means to crush or destroy something, so it's unlikely that the speaker would put the popcorn in the microwave as it would not be able to survive the heat. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened to the popcorn."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Puun putosi sähköjohtoon,"" option A (Sähköt katosivat naapurustossa) is the most likely explanation for why the tree fell over. The electrical charge may have weakened or disrupted the tree's structural integrity, causing it to fall. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The speaker's intention to provoke a reaction from the audience suggests that they may have been trying to offend or upset them, rather than simply boring them.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hikoulusävy tippui kasvoilleni) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""hikoulusävy"" means ""cold sweat,"" which suggests that the person may be experiencing anxiety or fear, leading them to break out in a cold sweat. This is a common physical response to stressful situations, making it the most plausible outcome based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kala kellui säiliössä"", option A (Se oli nälkäinen) is a more likely cause than option B (Se oli kuollut)."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hänellä oli flunssa) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Mies kuuli raivoksi"" suggests that the man experienced a sudden change or shift in his mood, which could be caused by various factors such as illness or stress. The mention of flunssa (a common cold) as a possible cause further supports this conclusion. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hissien ovet aukenivat,"" option A is more likely. The word ""aukenivat"" means ""opened,"" indicating that something (the door) opened or was made accessible. Therefore, it is more likely that Hissi entered through a door that had been previously closed or locked, rather than getting stuck in the middle of a floor."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He valued his freedom more than he feared punishment) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vessa tulvi,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the washing machine filled with water suggests that it may have been caused by a malfunction or overloading of the machine rather than a breakdown of the drain pump."

The fact that the dog's owner put a collar on it suggests that they are trying to keep the dog close by or under control, which aligns with the premise of the dog being near its owner. Option B (Omistaja piti pennua hihassa) does not provide any information about why the dog was near its owner, and could potentially be true even if the dog were not kept near its owner intentionally.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies näki peilikuvan,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""laajalle ulottuva puu"" suggests a large tree with a wide canopy, which could create a sense of depth and distance in the environment. Option B does not provide any information about the size or shape of the environment, making it less specific and less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Tapasimme illallisella) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Heidän koiransa karkasi kotoa) is the more likely cause for the search of neighbors. The fact that the dog ran away suggests that it may have escaped from home and could be somewhere nearby, leading to a search by its owner. Option B (Heidän kodistaan puuttui kalliita koruja) does not provide any logical explanation for the search of neighbors and seems unlikely given the context. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Näin hengitykseni hengittäessäni"", option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""näin hengitykseni"" means ""I feel my breathing"" in English, indicating that the speaker is experiencing their own breathing sensations. This suggests that the temperature of the air they are breathing in (option A) is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (They wanted better working conditions) is a more likely cause for why workers formed an industrial union. The passage states that workers ""perustivat ammattiliiton,"" which means they founded a professional organization or trade union.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She had korkokengät) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A, ""Vesi kiehui"" (Water boiled) caused the steam to rise. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kaikki sukkani olivat pesulassa,"" it is more likely that Option A (Minilla oli sandaalit) is correct. The word ""sandaalit"" refers to shoes or sandals, which are typically worn indoors, including in a bathroom or shower. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker had their shoes on when they were in the bathroom than their socks (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He lost voters' support) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Pariskunta karkasi) is more likely to happen as it suggests that the couple broke up rather than becoming pregnant.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Miljonääri halusi rakennuksen purettavan) is more likely. The fact that the building was ""omistettu miljonäärille"" suggests that it was built for a wealthy individual, who may have wanted to demolish it for personal reasons or as part of a larger plan. Option B (Miljonääri lahjoitti rahat sen rakentamiseen) does not fit with the given information, as there is no indication that the wealthy individual donated money towards its construction."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Myyntipäällikkö syytti tyttöä varastamisesta) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""myyntipäällikkö syytti tyttöä varastamisesta"" implies that the sales manager accused the girl of stealing, which suggests that there was evidence or suspicion of wrongdoing. In contrast, option B (""Myyjä auttoi tyttöä löytämään sen, josta hän piti"") does not convey any sense of accusation or blame towards the girl. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A: Sotilaat lähetettiin taistelemaan will occur. The premise states that ""Maa julisti sodan naapurimaalle,"" indicating that a war was declared against a neighboring country. This implies that military action will be taken, rather than the soldiers being reunited with their families. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Oikeustalon edessä alkoi mellakointi) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that a violent confrontation or disturbance occurred outside of the courthouse, rather than a sudden change of heart among the parties involved.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hän otti keksit purkista) is more likely. The phrase ""haistoi jotain palavaa"" suggests that something hot or burning was taken from a container, which aligns with Option A as it implies taking food or an object from a package. On the other hand, Option B does not make sense in this context as leaving something in the oven would not result in the action of ""haistoi."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sade oli valtava"", option A (Myrsky paheni) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Hissi lakkasi toimimasta) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the passage that palovaroitin would be able to detect or alert anyone about a potential danger, especially not one as serious as an earthquake. Additionally, the phrase ""rakennus on evakuoitu"" suggests that some kind of action has been taken to evacuate the building, which further supports the idea that hissi lakkasi toimimasta is the most likely explanation."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Isä osti pojalleen oluen) is the correct answer. The premise states that the father hated his son's alcoholism, which suggests a negative emotional response to the situation. It is unlikely that the father would buy his son alcohol as a way of dealing with his own feelings towards his son's addiction. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hissi oli rikki) is more likely. The fact that the elevator was out of order suggests a technical issue rather than something intentional or unexpected like someone entering the office without permission.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Maassa vietettiin itsenäisyytensä juhlaa) is the more likely cause. The fact that Finns hung their national flag outside their homes to celebrate independence suggests that they were marking a significant event or achievement related to their country's independence. This is more likely than option B (Maalla oli taloudellisia vaikeuksia), as there is no indication in the premise of any economic difficulties affecting Finland at this time.

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that a maanjäristys (Option A) caused the building to collapse rather than an increase in criminal activity (Option B). The phrase ""kaupunkiin"" (to the city) suggests that the event occurred within the city limits, rather than being a widespread phenomenon across the entire region or country. Additionally, the mention of a ""rakennus"" (building) collapsing implies that there was some sort of structural failure involved, which is more consistent with the idea of a natural disaster like an earthquake than with criminal activity. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (He rukoili häntä ottamaan hänet takaisin) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""jätti tyttöystävänsä"" suggests that the speaker has been left behind or abandoned by his girlfriend, and he is now pleading with her to take him back.

Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."

The text states that ""Lapset ottivat pallon samalla kertaa,"" indicating that they took the ball at the same time, which suggests a coordinated action. Therefore, it is more likely that the ball flew away due to their combined effort rather than their heads colliding."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pesukarhu ryösti roskiksia,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ryösti"" implies forceful taking or stealing, which suggests that someone (pesukarhu) took something from another person's property without permission. Therefore, it is more likely that there was something valuable in the roskicks that pesukarhu wanted to take. Option B does not fit with the given information as there is no indication of anything being removed from the roskicks."

Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the woman did not pay for the dress."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Raaputus iholleni oli syvä"", option A is more likely. The word ""parani"" means to become better or improve, so it's likely that the situation improved rather than left a legacy."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (He talked to himself) is more likely. The passage suggests that the man was staring at something outside the window, implying a state of deep thought or contemplation rather than simply gazing at the landscape below. Talking to oneself is a common behavior associated with introspection and self-reflection, making it a more plausible explanation for the man's actions than simply looking out the window.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Muhratit ryömiä) is more likely. The word ""murto"" in Finnish means a hole or an opening, so it's possible that the mice are digging holes into the wall. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies otti minttuhatta,"" option A is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kypsät hedelmät viipyvät auringossa,"" it is more likely that they shrunk (Option B) than that they were eaten (Option A). This is because the word ""viipyä"" in Finnish means to dry out or wither away, which suggests that the hedelmät lost moisture and shrank in size rather than being consumed by an animal or person."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Käänsin kytkimen päälle) is the correct answer. The phrase ""auto hajosi"" suggests that there was an electrical failure or malfunction in the vehicle's engine, which could have caused the car to stall.

Option B: Hän jäi nukkumaan useita päiviä."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Minulla ei ollut enää polttopuita) is a more plausible cause for why there was no fire in the room than option B (Talossa oli kylmä).

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (She has a cramp in her side) is the correct answer. The phrase ""hänellä on kramppi kyljessä"" suggests that the woman is experiencing discomfort or pain in her side, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as muscle strain, injury, or illness.

Response:  Based on the given information, option A (opiskelija vastasi kysymykseen oikein) is the more likely cause. The fact that the teacher praised the student for giving the correct answer suggests that the student was able to provide a good response, indicating that they have a good understanding of the material. Therefore, it is more likely that the student actually understood the question and gave an accurate answer rather than simply being unable to respond.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naisella loppuivat munat,"" option B (Hän meni supermarkettiin) is more likely. The word ""supermarkettiin"" suggests a larger store or marketplace, rather than a specific location like ""tilalle."" Therefore, it is more likely that she went to a supermarket to buy food for her children."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Opiskelija saapui luokkaan märkä,"" option A is more likely. The student arrived at school wet, indicating that it was raining outside.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Onnettomuus sattui päätiellä) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pelivaatteet kuivuivat) is more likely. The fact that the laundry has been left outside to dry suggests that it may have been forgotten or left unattended for an extended period of time, which could result in them being dried completely. On the other hand, if the washing machine had broken down, it's unlikely that the clothes would still be wet after a few hours. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nainen otti lasit päähänsä"", option A (Aurinko paistoi kirkkaasti) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies tuijotti yötaivaista,"" option A (Hän toivoi, että olisi kesä) is the more likely cause. The man is expressing a desire for something he does not currently have, which suggests that he is feeling dissatisfied or unhappy with his current situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Olin uupunut,"" option A (Menin aikaisin nukkumaan) is more likely. The phrase ""uupunut"" suggests that the speaker is feeling tired or exhausted, which could lead to them wanting to go to sleep early. Option B (Olin hereillä koko yön) does not necessarily imply fatigue or exhaustion, but rather a willingness to stay awake for an extended period of time."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies meni parturiin,"" it is more likely that he grew his beard rather than his beard having grown longer (option B). Therefore, the correct answer is option A: He grew his beard."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Halusin lasin maitoa,"" option A (Söin keksit) is the more likely cause. The word ""keskit"" in Finnish means to dream or imagine something, so it's possible that the person was daydreaming about eating cheese instead of actually eating it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kuljettaja sytytti ajovalaisimet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (pysäköin kadun toiselle puolelle) will occur. The reason for this is that the phrase ""tyhjä"" (empty) suggests that there are no cars already parked in the area, making it more likely that a new car will be able to find an empty space on the other side of the street. Option B (pysäköin sisäänkäynnin lähelle) may not be as effective because it would require the car to turn around and back into its parking spot, which could be more difficult or inconvenient depending on the specific location and circumstances."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She had a writing class) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the writer did not finish the script until the end of the semester, implying that she was enrolled in a writing course during that time.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Pyysin puhumaan esimiehelle) is more likely to be the correct cause. The sentence suggests that the speaker wants to talk to their boss about something, implying that they are seeking permission or approval from them. Option B (Annoin henkilötunnukseni) does not make sense in this context as it means ""I will annoy people with my phone number"" and has no connection to the previous sentence. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."

Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He crushed his muscles in front of a mirror) is more likely. The phrase ""nyrjäytti lihaksiaan"" specifically refers to the act of crushing or smashing something, which aligns with the idea of someone intentionally harming themselves. In contrast, ""Hän nosti baarin päänsä yli"" means ""He raised his head above the bar,"" which does not fit the context of self-harm. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (He took out his calculator) is a more likely outcome than option B (He mixed it up). This is because taking out a calculator suggests that the person wants to perform calculations or solve a problem, whereas mixing something up does not necessarily imply this action.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Majoitus oli varattu) is the correct cause for why Lomarit could not find a place to stay at the destination.

Therefore, it is unlikely that they would have been unable to find a place to stay due to lack of availability at the last minute.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hän pelkäsi neuloja) is more likely. The fact that the person got a tattoo despite being afraid of needles suggests that they may have been motivated by something other than wanting to rebel or challenge authority.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tuntematon auto pysäköityi taloni ulkopuolelle,"" option A, ""Minusta tuli epäileväinen,"" is more likely. This is because the word ""epäileväinen"" implies a sense of uncertainty or doubt, which aligns with the idea that the car has disappeared without a trace. Option B, ""Soitin poliisille,"" suggests a more proactive approach to dealing with the situation, which may not be as fitting given the ambiguous nature of the premise."

In this context, it is more likely that the girl slipped or slid onto the ice rather than falling or dropping suddenly."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naisella oli silmämunaa"", option A (She was awake all night) is a more likely cause than option B (She put her son to bed). This is because the phrase ""silmämunaa"" suggests that she did not get enough sleep or rest, which would make it less likely for her to have put her son to bed."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tulivuoresta virtaa laavaa"", option A (Tulivuori purkautui) is the more likely cause. The flow of lava from a volcano suggests that there has been an eruption or outpouring of magma, which can only occur during an active phase of volcanic activity such as an eruption. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nainen otti kengät jalkaansa"", option A is more likely.

The phrase ""maito maistui hauisalta"" suggests that the milk tasted sour or spoiled, which could be caused by a number of factors such as improper storage or contamination with bacteria or other microorganisms. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the milk tasted bad."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The fact that I was late to work suggests that there may have been some obstacle or difficulty in getting there on time, which could be attributed to being tired from staying up late.

Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B (He Nousi Katolle), as it does not require any physical means to enter the house.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vierailija koputti oveen) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""vierailija koputti"" means ""visitor knocked,"" implying that someone outside the oven is knocking on it.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she got it from the store (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hammastahna suihkutti putkesta) is a more likely outcome than option B (Tyttö sylki hammastahnan ulos). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the action of ""puristing"" is taking place inside the bathtub, rather than outside of it. Therefore, it is more likely that the hammam will come out of the faucet rather than the girl pulling it out."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Rauhanmieliset pitivät paraatin) is more likely. The use of the word ""paratiini"" suggests a formal event or gathering, rather than an informal protest or demonstration as implied by Option A."

The passage states that the person made plastic surgery, which implies that they are an expert in their field and have a lot of experience. This suggests that they may be older and more experienced, rather than looking younger. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Munasta nousi kananpoika,"" option A (Munasta kuoriutui) is the most likely cause. This is because the word ""nousi"" in Finnish means ""came out"" or ""emerged"", which implies that something inside the egg hatched or emerged, rather than being crushed by someone or something.

"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Sää lämmensi) is the most likely cause for the temperature reading on the thermometer to increase. This is because sauna heating can raise the body's core temperature, which in turn can cause the thermometer to read higher than actual body temperature. Option A (Pudotin lämpömittarin) means ""lowered the thermometer,"" which does not explain why the temperature reading would increase."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Oikeustalon katto räjähti) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Polvistuin maahan) is a more plausible cause for why you might feel like you're losing yourself than option B (Kiedän itseni peittoon). This is because ""polvistuin"" means to sink or submerge in Finnish, which could suggest a feeling of being overwhelmed or lost in one's surroundings. In contrast, ""kiedän itseni peittoon"" means to forget oneself completely, which may not be as directly related to the idea of feeling lost.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She has a pimple) is more likely to be the cause of her reluctance to go to school.

Therefore, it is more plausible that she has a pimple rather than taking her retainer out of her mouth as the reason for her hesitation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ilmeeni kirkastui,"" Option A (Sain hyviä uutisia) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pyyhin käteni pyyhkeellä,"" option A is more likely. The word ""märkä"" (murk) suggests that the hand was dirty or wet, so it is more likely that the hand was covered in mud rather than being wet from sweat."

Therefore, option A is the better answer.

"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Kadu virheeni) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""anteeksiantoa"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not working as intended, which aligns with the meaning of ""virhe"" in Finnish.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely. The text states that ""Kansankulujen talous heikkeni,"" indicating a decline in the economy of the country.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Her mother measured her temperature) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (He wanted to make an impression on his companion) is a more likely cause for why Mies suihkutti itsensä partavetille.

Explanation: The word ""otin"" means ""took"" in Finnish, so it's more likely that the speaker took a lamp than searched for one."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option B: Äiti synnytti kaksoset occurred. This is because the passage mentions that the family moved into a new house, but does not provide any information about the son's graduation from high school. The mention of twins being born suggests that there may have been a change in the family's circumstances, such as the birth of new siblings.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She wanted to save her energy) is a more likely cause for why the marathon runner stayed in a slow pace. The premise suggests that she was conserving her energy, which makes sense if she wants to finish the race strong.

The phrase ""kone sylki"" in Finnish means ""the machine broke down,"" suggesting that there was a technical issue with the device rather than something external like a cat sitting on it.

The idea of someone attacking or injuring themselves does not fit as well with this premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Hän katsoi tähtiä) is more likely. The phrase ""halusi oppia"" suggests that the girl wants to learn something new, and looking at the stars could be a way for her to do so."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (Laitoin julisteen oven yläpuolelle) caused the wall to stick together. This is because the heat from the oven would have melted the glue holding the wall together, causing it to bond with the new piece of paper.  
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Arkkitehti muutti suunnitelmia) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hänen kätensä tärisi) is a more likely cause than option B (Hän nuoli lusikkaa).

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tulin myöhässä luennolle"", option B (Lähestyin lavalle) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Her family paid her fine) is more likely to be the correct answer.

"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Tarkistin postilaatikon lähtiessäni talosta) is a more likely explanation for why I left my house. This is because the phrase ""postilaatikko"" refers to a mailbox or letter box, which suggests that the speaker may have been expecting something in the mail. Therefore, it makes sense that they would leave their house to check if there is any new mail. Option B (Suljin oven lähdettyäni talosta), on the other hand, does not provide as clear of an explanation for why the speaker left their house."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies halusi katsoa auringon nousu"", it is more likely that he went north (Option A). The sun rises in the east, so if he wanted to see the sunrise, he would need to go north towards the rising sun."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Taivutin lehden"", option A is more likely. The word ""rypistyi"" means ""torn"" or ""ripped"", which does not fit with the context of a book falling from a shelf.

Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the boy's hair were at the top of the hill."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ruiskutin itseni hyönteismyrkkyllä) is the more likely cause of the situation described. The use of insecticide to harm oneself is not a common or recommended method for dealing with stress or other negative emotions, and it can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Heräsin) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's eyes are open than option B (Minä rentouduin). This is because ""heräsin"" means ""woke up,"" indicating that the speaker was previously asleep and has now woken up. In contrast, ""minä rentouduin"" means ""I became awake,"" which could suggest that the speaker was already awake before but then became even more alert or aware of their surroundings. Therefore, option A is a more straightforward explanation for why the speaker's eyes are open."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pyysin häntä hiljentämään sitä) is more likely. The phrase ""kovaa naapurini musiikki"" suggests that the person's neighbor is playing loud music, which could be disturbing or annoying to them.

Option B does not provide any indication of such intentions."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Musiikkopoika taputti jalkaansa) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""Lavalla oli jyrinää,"" indicating a loud noise was heard at Lavalla, which could be caused by something falling or hitting the ground. Tapping one's foot is not as likely to produce a loud noise as hitting an object with force, such as drumming. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the cause of the loud noise at Lavalla."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Lapsi heräsi huutaen painajaisesta) is more likely. The fact that the child woke up crying suggests that they had a nightmare or bad dream, which is a common cause of children's fear of going to bed.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she was born with a hearing impairment (option B). The fact that she speaks using sign language suggests that she has difficulty hearing or communicating verbally, which could be due to a congenital condition such as profound sensorineural hearing loss. While option A mentions that she was born early, there is no indication in the premise that this would have anything to do with her ability to communicate through sign language. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Työntekijät lakkoilivat) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Äärimmäiset vaikuttivat häneen) is more likely. The phrase ""vihasi maansa ääri-ihmisiä"" suggests that the leader had a strong dislike for extreme individuals in his country, implying that he may have been influenced by their views or actions to some extent. However, there is no indication in the premise that he was murdered by them. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kävelin alasti rannalla,"" option A is more likely. The word ""alasti"" implies that the speaker was walking barefoot, which could cause discomfort or pain if there are sharp objects such as rocks or shells on the beach.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Heräsin keskellä yötä ja tunsin kylmyyttä,"" option B (Join lasin vettä) is more likely. The phrase suggests a feeling of coldness or chilliness, which could be alleviated by drinking water. Option A (Laitoin housut jalkaan) does not necessarily address this feeling of discomfort."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Hänellä on ihonala) is correct. The word ""ihonala"" means ""skin condition"", so it suggests that the boy had a skin problem rather than straight teeth. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Heräsin tänään lihaskipuissa) is more likely to be true than option B (Heräsin tänään kurkkukipuineen). This is because the phrase ""heräsin"" implies a state of waking up or becoming aware, which is more closely associated with physical sensations such as pain in the muscles rather than digestive discomfort like bloating. Therefore, option A is the more plausible choice based on the context provided."

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (the winds strengthened) is a more plausible explanation for why the fire spread quickly through the forest than option B (the arsonists were arrested).

Therefore, it seems more plausible that he signed his will as a way of preparing for his death.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otin siemauksen paahtavaa kahvia,"" option B is more likely. The word ""paahtava"" suggests that the coffee is strong or intense, so it's more likely that the person will burn their tongue rather than lose their voice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kirjoittaja vältti puolueellisuutta tarinoissaan) is the more likely cause. The fact that the editor fired the writer suggests that there was a disagreement or issue with the content of the stories, rather than a simple failure to meet a deadline.

Response:  Option A - He recognized the patient's symptoms.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Raaputin ihoani,"" option A is more likely. The word ""hikoillut"" means ""to freeze,"" so it is more likely that the bear froze than that it was hit by a car."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mies menetti malttinsa) is the correct answer. The phrase ""kiireellinen leikkaukset"" suggests a sense of urgency or frustration, which could lead to losing one's temper or patience. This is consistent with the idea that Mies became irritated or angry due to the delays in his surgery. Option B (Hän sai Sydänkohtauksen), on the other hand, does not fit as well with the context provided in the premise, as it implies a sudden cardiac arrest, which would be an unexpected and unlikely occurrence in this situation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hän taivutti käsiään) is more likely as it better fits the context of a person stretching their hands.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies nosti kulmakarvansa,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""yllättynyt"" means surprised or astonished in English, which fits with the idea of being pleasantly surprised by something unexpected. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Uskoin, that he knew better) is more likely to be the cause of his colleague's mistake. The premise suggests that the speaker was surprised by their colleague's error and implied that they should have known better.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mie was wrong) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (He found a rat in the basement) is more likely.

It's unlikely that the owner had a colony of ants in their home if they needed to call for extermination services.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I was too tired to prepare) is more likely. The speaker mentions that they were not prepared for the dinner invitation, which suggests that they may have been feeling fatigued or overwhelmed at the time of the invitation.

Option B does not provide any information about why Lap's hand retracted quickly, making option A a more plausible explanation.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (They shared the survey with customers) is more likely to increase customer satisfaction. By sharing the survey with their customers, the company can gather feedback directly from them, allowing for a more accurate assessment of their needs and preferences. This will enable the company to make informed decisions about how to improve their products or services, leading to increased customer satisfaction. Option A (Offering discounts to new customers) may also have some positive impact on customer satisfaction, but it would be less effective in addressing the root causes of dissatisfaction than collecting direct feedback from existing customers.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Puinen lattia raaputettiin,"" option B is more likely. The boy probably rapped the tray onto the floor rather than throwing it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Suojelin kasvojani,"" option A is more likely. The word ""suojeli"" means to protect or defend, so it suggests that the speaker is trying to protect their face from something harmful. Option B does not fit with this context as ""nosti"" means to lift up, which would not be a suitable action for defending one's face. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Samaan osui salama) is more likely to be the cause of the famous bear's demise. The phrase ""paloi"" in Finnish means ""burnt,"" suggesting that the bear was killed by a lightning strike or some other natural disaster. While option B (Ihmiset tulivat kunnioittamaan sitä) suggests that people came to honor the bear after its death, it does not provide any information about how the bear died. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the famous bear's demise based on the given premise."

Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (bensa loppui) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies söi jäätelön auringossa,"" option A (Jäätelö menetti makunsa) is the more likely outcome. The sun's heat would cause the ice cream to melt, resulting in it losing its flavor and value."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Matto näytti likaiselta) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""Ripustin taideteoksia huoneeseen,"" indicating that the author placed artworks in the room. This suggests that the author had a deliberate intention to display the artworks in the room, rather than simply leaving them lying around or neglecting them. Therefore, it is less likely that the artworks were left unattended and became damaged due to lack of care, as suggested by Option B (Seinät näyttivät alasti)."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Minilla oli päänsärky) is the correct cause for leaving work early.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Laitoin kukka nenäni alle,"" option A (Kukat irtosivat terälehdestä) is the more likely outcome. The phrase suggests that something soft and delicate, like a flower petal, would be blown away by the wind rather than sticking to someone's nose."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nainen tunsi nostalgiaa"", option A is more likely. The woman encountered her childhood friend. "
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He toimitti paperin aikaisin) is more likely.

Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Autoni hajosi"", option A (Kävin ostoksilla) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Se oli nimettömän) is more likely. The phrase ""Heitin viestin pois"" suggests that something was sent or delivered to someone, but since it's not specified who received it, it could be anyone.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Autotalli oli auki) is more likely to be the cause of the car being parked in front of the house. This is because if the garage was full, it would be unlikely for someone to park their car in front of the house instead of finding another parking spot elsewhere. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Rikollinen laski aseen) is more likely to occur than option B (Uhri nosti kätensä ylös). This is because the premise states that the perpetrator has already aimed their weapon at the victim, indicating that they are prepared to use it.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (going to uncle's funeral) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option B (Minua pahoinpideltiin) is the more likely cause of the speaker's feeling of being tired all the time. The phrase ""minua pahoinpideltiin"" suggests that the speaker has been subjected to some kind of harm or abuse, which could be causing them to feel exhausted. In contrast, option A (""Minä vain unelmoin"") implies that the speaker is simply daydreaming or fantasizing without any real basis for their feelings of exhaustion. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice based on the information provided in the passage."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Tulostin muste oli vähissä) is a more plausible explanation for why the book was printed endlessly than option B (Papirilopetus loppui). This is because the passage specifically mentions that there were no limits to how much paper could be used, indicating that the printing process itself did not stop. Therefore, it is more likely that the lack of ink (tulostin muste oli vähissä) caused the book to print endlessly.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Fanit ryntäsivät kentälle) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Minä tarjosin sen) is more likely to be the correct answer.

"Response: 
Option A: Hän merkitsi sivun. (He marked the page)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man marked the page rather than reading the book again. The act of marking a page suggests that he wants to remember or refer back to that specific passage later, which aligns with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mies kiristi turvavyötään) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the man tightened his seatbelt in preparation for turbulence, rather than simply looking out the window.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poika tärisi"", option A is more likely. The word ""tyttö"" in Finnish means girl, so it's unlikely that a girl would hit someone. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (He amputated her leg) is more likely to be the correct answer. The passage states that the doctors gave the patient a prosthetic limb, indicating that they had previously removed one of her legs.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poika astui mutaan"", option B is more likely. The boy got dirty from the mud."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ihmiset piiloutuivat maan alle) is more likely. The sentence ""Kaupungissa putosi useita senttimetrejä lunta"" implies that there was a significant amount of snowfall in the city, which could make it difficult for people to move around or stay outside for long periods of time. Piiloutuminen maahan (hiding underground) would be a logical response to such weather conditions as it would provide protection from the cold and potential danger posed by the heavy snowfall."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He uhkasi lopettaa työnsä) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Puu vahingoitti taloa,"" option A (Puu putosi katolle) is the more likely cause. The word ""vahingoitti"" in Finnish means to damage or destroy something, so it's likely that if the tree fell onto the house, it caused significant damage. Option B (Puu varjosti takapihalla) means ""The tree blocked the back door,"" which doesn't seem as relevant to the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Puun puolittaminen"", option A (Pistin puun takan päälle) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Pariskunta ilmoitti, että heillä oli lapsi) is more likely to be the cause of the couple's decision to divorce.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I was hesitant) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Mies otti pitsan uunista) is more likely to occur because it provides a logical explanation for why the man's food has disappeared. The other option (Mies purki ostokset jääkaappiin) does not provide any clear reason as to where the food might have gone.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hän teki kovasti töitä) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hänen poikansa joutui oikeudellisiin vaikeuksiin) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""hänen poikansa"" suggests that the speaker's son is involved in legal troubles, which could lead to financial difficulties for the family. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nainen astui liekkeihin,"" option A (Liekit sammuivat) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""astui liekkeihin"" suggests that the woman climbed onto or entered something flammable, such as a fire or a hot surface. Therefore, it is more likely that she would be burned by the heat than for smoke to rise from her body."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Her driver's license was revoked) is a more likely cause than option B (She got into an automobile accident). The premise states that she was at the car repair shop, indicating that her vehicle had broken down or needed maintenance, rather than suggesting that she was involved in an accident. Therefore, it is more likely that her driver's license was revoked due to a violation or other reason related to driving, rather than as a result of an accident.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nukuin herätyskelloon"", it is more likely that she has not eaten breakfast (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kamerat vilkkasivat hänen suuntaansia) is more likely. The fact that the paparazzi are flashing their cameras towards him suggests that they are trying to capture his image or actions, which could be a sign of increased media attention.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hän liittyi veljeskuntaan) is more likely. The fact that the student wants to meet other students at the campus suggests that they are interested in socializing and making new friends, which aligns with joining a fraternity or sorority. On the other hand, studying engineering may not necessarily lead to meeting new people outside of class. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Etsin muutosta) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nostin sohvan tyynyjä"" suggests a desire for change or something new, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the speaker is more likely to be looking for a change of scenery or environment rather than simply rearranging their living space."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Se lentää poikaa kohti"", option A (Poika pakeni) is more likely. The word ""lentää"" in Finnish means to fly, but it can also be used as an expression for something moving quickly or hastily. In this context, it suggests that the boy is running away from something or someone. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible outcome than Option B (Poika poimi kukkaa), which means ""The boy picked a flower""."
"Response: 
Option B: Hänet pantiin kuolemaantuomittujen joukkoon. 
Explanation: In Finland, if a person is found guilty of a crime, they can be sentenced to prison or community service. However, in some cases, the sentence may be death penalty. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Veteraani käveli nilkkaaen,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""nilkkaaen"" suggests that the veteran suffered an injury during his military service, which is consistent with the idea of him being wounded in battle.

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Minä pudotin sen) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Ei käynnistynyt"" suggests that something did not start or work properly, and the phrase ""minä pudotin sen"" implies that the speaker may have accidentally turned off or disabled the device. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the device did not start."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (He bought a large wardrobe) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the passage states ""there was no longer any space"" in the closet, indicating that the amount of available space in the closet had decreased. This suggests that the person had acquired more items to store in the closet, such as clothing or other belongings, which would require a larger storage space. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies oli sydän särkynyt,"" option A (Hänen vaimonsa synnytti) is the more likely cause of his heartbreak."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hän sai pätevyyden haluamaansa työhön) is correct. The sentence ""Mies sai tutkinnon"" implies that he passed an examination or obtained a degree, which would make him eligible for certain jobs. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He tervehti yleisöä) is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Heitin kolikon vesiputoukseen,"" option A is more likely. The word ""uppoutui"" means to sink or submerge, so it is more likely that the koliko will sink into the water rather than break in half."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pelaaja lyö palloa kohti reikää"", option A is more likely. The ball went into the hole."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Minulla oli hikka) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""hikka"" in Finnish means ""a stomachache"", so it's possible that the speaker had a stomachache while lying on their back. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Asiakas käytti väärennettyä rahaa) is more likely. The fact that the customer used fake money suggests that they may have intentionally tried to deceive the cashier or the store's system. It is less likely that the customer simply forgot their wallet at home or left it somewhere else without realizing it, as suggested in Option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Roska sai keittiön haisemaan pahalle) is more likely. The phrase ""roska sai"" implies that something was taken or moved from one place to another, which fits with the idea of veins being removed from a body part. Option B (Heitin vahingossa pois ostoslistal) does not fit as well with the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Lapset ihailivat eläimiä) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mies hengitti kovaa) is the correct answer. The phrase ""hengitti kovaa"" suggests that the man's breathing was labored or difficult, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as respiratory problems or heart disease. However, the specific cause mentioned in the premise is not related to the lungs but rather to the brain, which makes option B less likely. Therefore, option A is the most probable choice."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Toin peittoja"" (The windows froze) will occur. The phrase ""Talon ilmastointilaite hajosi"" suggests that there was a malfunction in the air conditioning system of the building, causing the temperature inside to drop significantly. This could lead to the windows freezing over rather than the windows breaking or shattering."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poikan selkä särkee,"" option A is more likely. The word ""särkee"" means to crack or break, so it's unlikely that Poika's backpack was open by itself without any external force causing it to do so. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Leivotin hänelle kakun) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Ostin äidilleni lahjan"" suggests that someone gave a gift to their mother as a birthday present, and therefore it is unlikely that she was born on her birthday."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mehiläinen puri puutarhuria) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""puutarha"" in Finnish means garden, so it's possible that a bee might find nectar or pollen in a flowerbed or garden. On the other hand, option B (Oravat kaivoivat sipulit esiin) doesn't make as much sense, as the phrase ""kaivoavat sipulit"" means something like ""digging up potatoes,"" which isn't related to the context of finding food in a garden."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Löin tikun"", option A (Lieke sammui) is more likely to occur."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They didn't want to go to court) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that a tsunami occurred (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hän paniikkasi) is more likely. The phrase ""vaeltaja kohtasi myrkyllinen käärme"" implies that something dangerous or threatening encountered the person, leading them to panic. This is a common reaction when someone encounters a potentially harmful situation, such as a poisonous snake. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Uuni tuli kuumaksi"", option A is the most likely cause. The word ""kuuma"" means hot in Finnish, so it's likely that the oven became too hot due to a malfunction or misuse rather than being placed on top of something else."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the strawberry has been boiled (Option A). The phrase ""sitruuna on homettunut"" means ""the strawberry has been boiled"". Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B - Maa siirtomaa maata is the more likely outcome. The premise states that ""Maat löysivät uusia maita,"" indicating that new lands were discovered by nations. This suggests that there may be a desire to expand territorial control over these newly discovered lands, rather than abandoning an existing territory. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Se hajosi lattialle) is a more likely outcome than option B (Se putosi pyykkipylvään). This is because the word ""putosi"" in Finnish can also mean ""to fall"", but it specifically refers to falling onto something soft or flat, like a mattress or a floor. Therefore, it's more likely that the object fell onto the floor rather than onto a pillar."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the lattia was liukas (wet) than epätasainen (uneven). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option A: Hänen poikansa tunnusti totuus (His son confessed the truth)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hän otti yskänlääkettä) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the person's mental illness is hereditary (Option A). The statement ""Hän kävi terapiassa"" suggests that the person has been receiving treatment for a mental illness, and the phrase ""mielisairaus oli perinnöllistä"" implies that the illness may be inherited. There is no mention of any other potential causes of the person's mental health issues, such as depression or stress, which would suggest that the illness is more likely to be genetic in nature."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nainen tarttui kurkkuunsa,"" it is more likely that she ate something too fast (Option A) than that she got stuck to her food (Option B). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Her voice sounded gruff) is correct. The premise suggests that the woman's voice was deep or coarse, which aligns with Option A. Option B (She spoke with an accent) does not fit well with the given information as there is no indication of the woman having an accent in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Koira tuijotti mehukasta pihviä pöydällä"", it is more likely that option A, ""Se kuolasi"" (He died) is correct. The use of the word ""tuijotti"" (he looked) implies a sense of longing or yearning, rather than movement or action. Additionally, the phrase ""mehukasta pihviä"" (sweet ice cream) suggests something indulgent and enjoyable, but not necessarily something that would cause death. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hänestä tuli rikas) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kello soi) is more likely to be the cause of the students leaving their classroom. Therefore, the answer is Option A.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hän sai aivohalvauksen) is the more likely cause for why Mies menetti kykynsä puhua. The phrase ""menetti kykynsä"" suggests that something happened to his ability to speak, which could be caused by an ailment such as a stroke or brain hemorrhage (aivohalvaus in Finnish). Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sementissä oli halkeama) is more likely to be the cause of the nainen's confusion. The fact that she became lost in thought while walking down a familiar path suggests that there may have been something unusual or unexpected about her surroundings, such as a crack in the sidewalk, that caught her attention and caused her to become distracted.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pelastaja hyppäsi hänen peräänsä) is more likely. The use of the word ""hyppäsi"" suggests that the rescuer jumped or leaped towards the person in need of help, which aligns with the idea of a heroic act. Option B (""Mies kastasi hengenpelastajaansa"") does not convey the same sense of urgency or action."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that tulehdus will spread (Option B). The premise states that ""otin antibiooteista"" which implies that there are already existing bacteria resistant to antibiotics, indicating a likelihood of resistance development over time. This suggests that the infection may not be fully eliminated by the treatment with antibiotics, leading to its potential spread. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kuljettaja painoi jarruun) is more likely to cause a yellow light at an intersection. When a driver presses the brake pedal hard, it can cause the brake lights on their vehicle to turn on, indicating that they are slowing down or stopping. This can alert other drivers of their intention to proceed through the intersection, even if the light has turned yellow. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I poured hot water into the container) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the given information that the temperature of the water in the container increased after pouring hot water into it.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Kuljettaja törmäsi puhelinpylvään) is the most likely cause of the accident. The fact that the driver crashed into a phone pole suggests that there was some kind of obstacle in the road that the driver could not avoid, rather than simply driving recklessly or erratically. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the accident.
"Response: 
Option B: Hän läpäisi tentin. 
Explanation: The premise states that the boy studied all night, indicating that he was preparing for an exam or test (tentti in Finnish). Therefore, it is more likely that he will pass the test than him not being in the exam."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He feared swimming lessons) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Laitoin käteni rintaani,"" option A (Tunsini syövi) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (there was a mess) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Perhe kutsui naapurit illalliselle) is more likely. The family wanted to get to know their new neighbors better by inviting them over for dinner. This suggests that they are interested in building a positive relationship with their neighbors, which aligns with the idea of wanting to make a good impression.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vesi on suihkunut altaasta,"" option A (Uimailija sukelsi altaaseen) is the more likely cause. This is because the word ""suuhkus"" in Finnish means ""to flow"" or ""to pour"", indicating that water was flowing from the surface of the lake into the deeper part of the lake where the swimmer was located. Therefore, it is more likely that the swimmer submerged themselves in the water rather than floating on top of it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nielaisin vahingossa siemenen) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""puristin vesimelonin"" suggests that the person has a strong belief or conviction about something, which could lead them to take drastic actions in order to prove their point. In this case, it's possible that they might try to harm someone else's plant in an attempt to disprove their theory. Option B (olen vahingossa repinyt hampaan) does not fit as well with the given premise, as it implies a more random and unintentional action rather than a deliberate one."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poika kompastui,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Takki oli auki,"" is the correct answer. The word ""kompastui"" implies a sudden stop or collision, which would be consistent with the jacket being open. If the boy's jacket was open, he may have lost control of his bike and collided with something, leading to the injury. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ääni häiritsi häntä) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why the person's hearing was affected. The other option, Option B (Hän sai korvat lävistetyksi), does not provide any logical reasoning to support its claim. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Join Kaiken Veden) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Täytin vesipulloni"" means ""I filled up a water balloon,"" indicating that the speaker has already prepared or inflated something with water. Therefore, it makes sense for them to join all of the water together in one place, rather than storing it separately in a fridge."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (the show contained vulgar language) is the correct answer. The passage states that the show was ""sensational"" and ""contained vulgar language,"" which suggests that it may have been explicit or offensive in nature. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the show was not suitable for broadcast."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Alus haaksirikkoutui"", option A (Miehistö hukkui) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He asked for hints) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Puhelin soi"", option A (Mies katkaisi puhelun) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tunsini oloni epämukavaksi) is a more likely response than option A (- Minä halailin häntä). This is because the phrase ""tunsin oloni epämukavaksi"" means ""I felt my mood was unpleasant,"" which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the premise. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that the speaker enjoyed looking at the woman, which does not fit with the tone of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He ottivat kuvia näyttelyistä) is more likely. The sentence implies that they took pictures of exhibitions, indicating a specific action taken to obtain images.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ystäväni esitteli minut miehelle) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Pumppailin ilmaa renkaan"". This is because there is no indication in the premise that changing the tire would cause the air to fill up again."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hänen isänsä luki hänelle tarinaa) is more likely to be the correct answer because it suggests that the girl's father told her a story, which could have caused her to look pale.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kynästä loppui muste,"" option A (I used a pen) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies ei saanut lainaa,"" it is more likely that he was in debt (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Hänellä oli vesirokko) is more likely to be the correct cause for why the girl stayed home from school. This is because the phrase ""vesirokko"" specifically refers to a water bottle, indicating that the girl may have left her water bottle at home as an excuse not to go to school. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Roskapussi oli täynnä"", option A (Vein sen roskakoriin) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Huonetoverini kaatoi punssia) is the more likely cause for why Pyyn maton imurointiin might be difficult to learn. The phrase ""huonetoverini"" refers to a Finnish word game where players take turns saying a series of words that start with the same sound as the previous word. This type of game requires a high level of language proficiency and cognitive ability, making it challenging to master. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given in the question."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Hän heitti tuolin huoneen toiselle puolelle) is more likely. The fact that she ""sulki"" her computer suggests that she may have been frustrated or upset with it, but throwing a chair across the room is a more extreme action that is unlikely to happen without a stronger motivation."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kanta paloi) is a more likely outcome than option B (Tuli sammui). This is because ""leiritu"" in Finnish means ""firewood"", so it's unlikely that the fire would go out. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A, ""Lämmin vesi oli poissa,"" is the cause of why Mies tuli suihkusta. The fact that warm water was missing suggests that there may have been an issue with the shower's plumbing or heating system, rather than a lack of towels. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (They sääsivät rahaa opiskelurahoihin) is the correct answer. The premise suggests that the parents wanted their children to go to university, which implies that they were willing to spend money on their education. Option B (He kannustivat lapsiaan leikkimään ulkona) does not provide any information about the parents' financial situation or their desire for their children's education. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation of the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies avasi kengännauhansa"", option A is more likely. The word ""löysä"" means soft or loose in Finnish, so it's possible that the man opened his shoes to find them soft or loose inside. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hän pakasti jääkaapin jäännökset) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nilkkani oli turvonnut"", option B is more likely. The word ""turvonnut"" implies a sudden or unexpected change, which suggests that the situation has become unstable or chaotic. This aligns with Option B, where hieroin siihen voidetta means to pour something into an empty space, implying a sense of filling or stabilizing the situation. Option A, laitoin jäätä siihen, would mean to leave it as it is, which doesn't necessarily address the instability suggested by the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I heard a conversation) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Minä istuin) is a more likely response than option B (- Minäkin luin lehden). This is because the first sentence in the premise (""Minun piti odottaa"") implies that someone was waiting for something, and ""istuin"" means ""I sat"". Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would have been sitting and waiting for something to happen. On the other hand, ""- Minäkin luin lehden"" means ""I also read the letter"", which doesn't fit as well with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mies iski kärpäselle,"" option A (kärpäs suusi pois) is more likely. The word ""iskki"" in Finnish means ""to hit"" or ""to strike"", so it's likely that the man struck the spider with his finger."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mies was dying) caused him to write his will. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He kiihdytti vauhtiaan) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Keksi ratkaisu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Mietin huolellisesti ongelmaa"" suggests that the speaker is deeply troubled by a problem, and therefore is unlikely to simply ask for advice or suggestions without putting in some effort themselves. Instead, they are more likely to try to come up with their own solution through careful consideration."
"Response: 
Option B: Hän oli innoissaan. "
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He met a friend to watch the game) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hän asetti herätyskelloonsa) is a more likely explanation for why the boy did not get up than option B (Hän laski lampaita). This is because setting an alarm clock is a common way to wake oneself up in the morning, while milking cows is not typically associated with waking someone up. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context provided.
