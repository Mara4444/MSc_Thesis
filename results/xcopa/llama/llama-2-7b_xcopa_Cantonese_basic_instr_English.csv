"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (哩個係一個脆弱嘅器官) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""啲嘢被包裹喺泡泡膠入面"" suggests that something delicate or fragile has been wrapped in a sticky substance, which could potentially damage it. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice as it implies that one of the organs mentioned is weak or fragile."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我晒我嘅錢袋"" (I'm showing my money bag), option A is more likely. The phrase ""錢袋"" (money bag) suggests that the speaker has a lot of money, which could be used to buy an expensive flight ticket or other luxury items. Option B, on the other hand, implies that the speaker may have found something illegal or dangerous, such as a weapon, which would not be a practical or legal way to spend money."

The phrase ""個巡探"" implies a thorough investigation or inspection, which suggests that the authorities are taking a closer look at the traveler's documents and personal belongings. This could be due to suspicion of illegal activities such as drug trafficking or money laundering, rather than simply accusing them of stealing something."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the day off was a holiday) is the correct answer. The phrase ""辦公室關咗"" suggests that something related to work or the office is happening, and the fact that it's a holiday implies that it's not a typical working day. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢跳咗一條) is more likely. The phrase ""呢個女仔嘅能量用咗"" suggests that the girl has a lot of energy, so it's more likely that she would be jumping around or moving quickly rather than playing cards."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (more people joined the line) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""this woman no longer has to wait in line,"" implying that there are now fewer people ahead of her in the queue. Therefore, it is more likely that more people have joined the line rather than her having left it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (個細路喺佢嘅奶嘴上滴) is the more likely cause of the situation described. This is because the phrase ""個女仔住佢個鼻子"" suggests that a woman has taken up residence inside someone's nose, which is an unlikely and absurd scenario. Therefore, it is more plausible that she has somehow managed to get inside his mouth or throat rather than inside his nose."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the audience will be clapping along with the music (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the girl brings a fruit basket to her math teacher) is more likely.

The phrase ""嗰啲細路真係好驚"" suggests that something unexpected and frightening happened, which aligns with the idea of telling a ghost story. Additionally, the mention of ""營隊長"" (team leader) implies that there was some sort of group activity or gathering where the story was shared, further supporting Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢迷失咗喺思考之中) is more likely. The man's confusion and disorientation suggest that he has lost his way in thought, rather than simply experiencing a minor head injury.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A is the correct answer. The speaker mentions that they have written a check but has not received any money yet, indicating that their bank account may be empty. This is consistent with option A, where the speaker's bank account is empty. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of the problem.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""佢除咗垃圾郵件"" (he/she deleted the spam emails). This is because the premise states that the person's email inbox is full of trash emails, indicating that there are many unwanted messages that need to be removed. Option B, on the other hand, suggests sending multiple emails, which may not necessarily address the issue of spam emails in the inbox."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢受到呢個病嘅影響) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the crew member has been affected by a disease or illness, rather than simply being happy.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢自己都咁唱) is more likely. The fact that she has already remembered the password suggests that she is capable of remembering it without writing it down. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why she doesn't need to write down her passwords.
"Response:  Option B: 杯子開始充滿.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我倒咗水入杯裡"", it is more likely that the cup will start to fill with water rather than all the water in the cup being drunk by someone else."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (supporting one's friend) is the correct answer. The phrase ""when they finish speaking"" suggests that the speaker is referring to a conversation or statement made by their friend, and the desire to support them implies a willingness to listen and offer encouragement. Option B (""thinking about what they said"") does not align with this interpretation as it implies a focus on one's own thoughts rather than supporting one's friend."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""事故係我個錯"" (the accident is my fault), option A is more likely. The speaker is expressing a sense of responsibility for the accident, indicating that they believe it was their own mistake or error that caused the incident."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (個鎖圍住一塊輪胎) is more likely to be the cause of the broken lock. The phrase ""個鎖圍住"" means to surround or encircle something with a chain or rope, which could potentially damage or break the lock if it is applied too tightly or for an extended period of time. Option B (鎖裡邊嘅一個環節斷咗) does not provide any information about how the lock was damaged, so it cannot be determined as the cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢哋都好厭煩爭執) is more likely. The couple's decision to compromise suggests that they are tired of arguing and want to find a solution that works for both parties.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She hires a campaign manager) is more likely to be effective in helping her win the election. Here's why:

* Campaign managers are professionals who specialize in running political campaigns. They have experience and expertise in areas such as strategy, messaging, fundraising, and voter outreach. By hiring a campaign manager, she can leverage their knowledge and skills to improve her chances of winning the election.
* On the other hand, going to court may not necessarily help her win the election. While it could potentially result in her opponent being disqualified or removed from the race, it may also attract negative attention to her own campaign and create unnecessary controversy. Additionally, the legal process can be time-consuming and costly, which could divert resources away from other important aspects of her campaign.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, option A is more likely to be effective in helping her win the election."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will bring a warm coat (Option A).

Bringing a large luggage (Option B) may not be practical or necessary in this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢係個蠢人) is more likely. The student's response of ""佢係個蠢人"" suggests that they are aware of their mistake and are trying to cover it up by blaming someone else. This reaction is more consistent with human behavior than simply raising one's hand in silence (option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""個男人眼中流咗水"", option B is more likely. The man's eyes are described as having water in them, indicating that he may be crying or have something in his eyes. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (佢嘅對手話佢係作弊嘅) will occur.

This could result in them losing to weaker opponents by a large margin, as they are not taking the game seriously enough or making crucial errors.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (佢捉到個學生作弊) is the correct answer. The phrase ""老師撕碎咗學生嘅考試"" suggests that a teacher has cheated in an exam for a student, which implies that the student did not perform well due to their own lack of effort or knowledge rather than any mistake by the teacher. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Option A: 我失去了我把聲.  
Explanation: The premise ""我停低，唔好講嘢"" suggests that the speaker's voice has been lost or stolen. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."

The reason being that a person would not be able to run across the pool deck without getting wet, especially if they fell into the water from a height.

People are generally more likely to respond positively to someone who has made an effort to improve themselves, rather than isolating or mocking them."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (佢打印咗一封信) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""個女仔嘅手上有"" suggests that there may be a letter or note in her hand, which could have been printed by someone else rather than climbed up by an animal. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."

"Response:  Option A: 我朋friend叫我等 (My friend calls me)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我失去了耐心"" (I lost my patience), it is more likely that the speaker's friend called them to wait rather than their friend being punctual.

The premise states that they are travelers who have checked into a hotel room, indicating that they have already arrived at their destination and are preparing to leave.

"Response:  Option A - 桃花咗 (The cherry blossom blooms)

Reasoning: The premise states that the cashier opened the cash register, indicating that they had access to the money inside. If a customer were to take the money, it would be more likely for them to do so without the cashier noticing or resisting. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢叫人群走咗) is more likely. The street performer's performance has attracted a crowd of people, who are now following him out of curiosity or interest. This suggests that the performer has successfully captured the attention of the passersby and drawn them in with his music. Option A (人哋畀咗佢錢) is less likely, as there is no indication in the premise that the performer is receiving money from the audience.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The pilot will fly over the storm rather than navigating through it because flying directly into a strong wind or thunderstorm can be dangerous and could cause loss of control or structural damage to the aircraft. It's generally safer for pilots to fly around the edges of a storm or at an angle to avoid its full force.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""樹落咗葉"" (The leaves have fallen), option A is more likely. The leaves are likely to change color before they fall off the tree."

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - 佢將個印記放喺信封上 (he will put a stamp on the envelope). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the person is actively taking an action to seal the letter, rather than simply closing or covering it up.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (佢哋鐘意同其他人一齊) is the correct answer. The phrase ""佢哋唔再聯繫"" suggests that they have lost interest in contacting each other, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as moving away or finding new friends. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why they are not in touch anymore."
"Response:  Option B: 佢放咗假期。
Explanation: According to the premise, the company's accountant has not been managing well. This suggests that there may be a lack of attention to detail or poor financial management practices in place.

Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我睇住個鐘"", option A is more likely. The word ""睇"" means to watch or observe, so it suggests that the speaker is actively paying attention to a clock.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the researcher will withdraw or retract their theory rather than have everyone accept it without question."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (遊戲開始延長時間) is more likely to be the cause of the delay in the game. The premise states that ""球迷喺比賽上都咗,"" indicating that there are fans involved in the game, which suggests a human factor rather than an error made by the referee. Therefore, it is more plausible that the game was delayed due to fan interference or other factors related to the players or spectators, rather than a mistake made by the referee."

The phrase ""在帆上"" means ""on the sail,"" indicating that the kayaker is in a position where they are exposed to the elements and could potentially be affected by waves or other external factors. Option A (皮划艇到岸上) does not take into account this factor and assumes a safer scenario where the kayaker reaches shore without any obstacles."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (佢撞到圍) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""個女仔唔再控制佢架單車"" suggests that the woman is not able to control her scooter, which could lead to a collision with an object or wall.

Option A does not provide any information about the effect of the fan."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢哋見到一隻魚) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (water has come out) is more likely. The phrase ""我咗浴"" implies that water has been poured or used, and the word ""排水栓"" specifically refers to a drainage pipe.

The phrase ""开始起义"" means ""to start a rebellion,"" indicating that the situation has escalated to the point where citizens are taking action against the government. This is in line with the premise's description of the government exerting pressure on people, leading to resistance and unrest among the population. In contrast, option B (""公民登记投票"") refers to voting, which is a less dramatic and confrontational response to government pressure compared to starting a rebellion."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢嘅同事升咗上工) is more likely. The man's jealousy towards his colleague suggests that he feels threatened by their success or promotion, rather than their work ethic during working hours. Therefore, Option A better aligns with the premise provided.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man experienced a hallucination (Option A). The idea of an extraterrestrial civilization visiting Earth is often associated with science fiction and is not supported by scientific evidence. Hallucinations, on the other hand, are a common phenomenon that can occur due to various factors such as mental health conditions, sleep deprivation, or sensory overload. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for the man's experience.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (佢將漂白劑放入去) is the correct answer.

"Response:  Option B: 我重置咗個電路斷線器.  
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker has reset the circuit breaker rather than turned on a light switch. The circuit breaker is an electrical component that can trip or ""break"" when there is an excessive amount of electricity flowing through it, causing a temporary shutdown to prevent damage to the electrical system. Resetting the circuit breaker would be a common solution to restore power to the house after a tripped circuit breaker."

Explanation: Based on the premise ""我哋喺嗰條過山車上騎過"", it is more likely that the person is excited to ride a roller coaster than scared. The phrase ""睇起嚟好好玩"" suggests enthusiasm and enjoyment, rather than fear or anxiety. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (I will put it in the microwave) is the more likely cause.

Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for what happened based on the given information."
"Response:  Option B: 氣象預測有好大嘅風.  
Explanation: According to the premise, a tree has fallen onto power lines.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I have pricked myself with a needle) is more likely to occur than option A (I have sweat droplets on my face). This is because pricking oneself with a needle can cause bleeding or irritation, whereas sweating alone does not typically result in visible droplets on one's face. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the fish has died (Option B). The phrase ""漂浮在水槽表面"" means ""floating on the surface of the water tank,"" indicating that the fish's body has already decomposed and is now floating at the top of the tank. This suggests that the fish has died and is no longer alive to eat anything ( Option A). Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (he has a cold) is the correct answer. The mention of ""感冒"" (cold) in the premise suggests that the speaker may be experiencing symptoms related to a common illness, rather than quitting smoking. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (升降機到達指定樓層) is the more likely cause. The elevator has reached a specific floor, indicating that it was in operation at some point before stopping abruptly. This suggests that there may have been an issue with the elevator's mechanics or electrical system, rather than simply getting stuck due to overuse.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (she stole from her parents) is the correct answer. The phrase ""呢個十歲嘅女仔"" suggests that the person in question is a young girl, and the fact that she ""偷偷地走咗出屋企"" implies that she may have taken something without permission. It is unlikely that her parents would lock her up as punishment for something she did not do."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (Toilet water overflows) is the cause of the flooded bathroom. The fact that the water level in the bathtub is higher than usual suggests that there may be a blockage or issue with the toilet's drain line, causing the water to overflow into the bathtub. While Option B (Warm water heater breaks down) could also potentially cause flooding in the bathroom, it seems less likely given the specific details provided in the scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (個主人將個仔仔戴上頸項圈) is the correct answer. The phrase ""仔仔喺主人身邊住"" suggests that the child is living with or near the main character, and therefore it makes sense for the main character to put a necklace around the child's neck as a way of keeping them close by."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢企喺個平靜嘅湖面上) is more likely. The reflection of a person's face in a calm lake surface is a common phenomenon that can occur when light from the sun or other sources hits the water at a shallow angle, creating a mirror-like effect. This is why many people enjoy taking photos of themselves by lakes or other bodies of water to capture this unique optical illusion. In contrast, seeing one's own reflection in a tree trunk is less common and may require a specific type of tree with a smooth, flat bark, such as a willow or a cottonwood.
"Response:  Option B: 我同佢一齊食晚餐.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the speaker will invite their girlfriend to eat dinner together rather than calling her back immediately. This is because the speaker seems to be in a romantic relationship with their girlfriend, and inviting her to share a meal together can be seen as a way of spending quality time together and strengthening their bond. Calling her back immediately may not have the same level of emotional significance or intimacy."
"Response:  Option A: 佢哋個狗離開屋企.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the search party has been organized to look for a missing person in a specific district. This suggests that there may be clues or evidence related to the missing person's whereabouts within that district. It is less likely that the house without valuable jewelry would provide any relevant information regarding the missing person's disappearance. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (天氣好冷) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker sees their breath. When it's cold outside, people tend to breathe out more heavily, causing them to see their breath more clearly. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the employees are forming a union to improve their working conditions rather than demanding higher wages from their employer. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the warm and savory aroma spreads throughout the room) is more likely to occur.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢戴住高跟鞋) is more likely to be the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (water boils) occurred. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我所有都係洗衣間"" (Everything I own is in the laundry room), option A is more likely. The speaker is unlikely to put their shoes in the laundry room, as they are not typically washed together with clothes. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: 佢被指控貪污.  
Explanation: According to the premise, 政治家嘅論點被認為係荒謬嘅， suggesting that they have made controversial or unpopular statements. Being accused of corruption is a common political attack tactic, especially when an opponent is trying to discredit someone's reputation. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (呢對夫婦懷孕咗) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (百萬富翁想將建築物拆毀) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""致敬呢個百萬富翁"" suggests that the building is being constructed as a tribute to the wealthy man, implying that he has played a significant role in its creation or funding. Therefore, it is more likely that he would want to preserve the building rather than demolish it."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A is more likely. The salesperson sees the woman putting items into her purse, indicating that she may be shoplifting. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""military troops are deployed to fight in a neighboring country."" This is because the premise mentions the country declaring war on its neighbor, indicating a military conflict."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (喺法庭前發生咗一場暴動) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""法院支持咗呢個爭議性嘅裁決"" suggests that the court has supported a controversial decision, which could lead to protests or violence outside of the courthouse. Option B (有對夫婦喺法庭前交咗婚禮) does not align with the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢將餅乎從裡面出來) is more likely. The phrase ""個女仔聞到有嘢燃燒嘅味道"" suggests that a woman heard something burning in her house, which could be interpreted as a fire or smoke coming from inside the house. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will take the cookie out of the oven rather than putting it back inside."
Response:  Option A - 暴風越嚟越嚴重 (The storm gets worse and worse).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the elevator will no longer operate) is the cause of the people being unable to enter the building. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (個阿爸將佢個仔出屋企) is more likely. The father's anger towards the child suggests that he may want to punish or get rid of the child, rather than buying him a drink.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the cause of the lawyer's difficulty in reaching his office is Option B: The elevator is not functioning normally. This is because the phrase ""律師上咗樓梯"" specifically mentions climbing stairs, indicating that the elevator is not available or functional. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the lawyer's predicament."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (佢嘅朋友打斷佢) is the correct answer. The phrase ""打斷"" (dǎo fēn) means to break or cut off a relationship with someone, which aligns with the idea of a friend abandoning another person. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - the cashier will remember to give the woman her change. The premise states that the woman has a lot of money in her purse, which may make the cashier more alert and attentive when handling her transactions. Additionally, the cashier may be more motivated to provide accurate change due to the large amount involved. Option B, on the other hand, implies that the cashier was not paying attention or did not care about providing correct change, which is less likely to happen.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she was injured in a car accident (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option A (国家慶祝緊獨立) is more likely to be the cause of the situation described. The phrase ""市民喺屋企门口掛起国旗"" suggests that citizens are hanging flags outside their homes to celebrate an important national event or holiday, such as Independence Day. This implies that there is a sense of patriotism and national pride among the population, which is consistent with the idea of a country celebrating its independence. In contrast, option B (國家正面對經濟困難) does not provide any specific context or evidence to suggest that the country is facing economic difficulties, which would be a less likely explanation for why citizens might be displaying national flags outside their homes."
"Response:  Option B: 佢哋激發咗佢哋嘅粉絲  
Explanation: According to the premise, the team's poor performance in the competition has caused their fans to be disappointed or disillusioned with them. This suggests that option B is more likely, as it implies that the team's actions have had a negative impact on their fanbase."
"Response:  Option B: 我覺得好自豪 (I feel embarrassed)
Explanation: The premise ""我朋friend指出我牙入面有食物塞住"" implies that someone pointed out something embarrassing about the speaker's teeth. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice as it suggests a feeling of embarrassment rather than pride."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (佢係課堂上好專心) is the correct answer. The passage states that the boy did not pass his history exam, suggesting that he may have been distracted or unfocused during class. It does not provide any evidence to suggest that he forgot to study for the exam. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the boy did not pass his history exam.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (地震擊中城市) is more likely to be the cause of the building collapse in the city. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially if they occur near populated areas. While an increase in crime rate could potentially lead to a higher likelihood of criminal activity around the collapsed building, it would not directly cause the building to collapse. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (佢求佢將佢帶返嚟屋企) is more likely to happen. The speaker's girlfriend has asked him to bring her back home, indicating that she wants to leave the party with him.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the ball flies away) is more likely to occur. The premise states that two people are stretching their hands towards each other at the same time, indicating a mutual action. As such, it is unlikely for both parties' heads to collide simultaneously. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (there are papers inside the trash can) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (價錢好便宜) is more likely to be the cause of why a man might not write with a pen. This is because the cost of pens can vary greatly depending on factors such as brand, quality, and location, so it's possible that the cost may deter someone from using them.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (佢將收據丟咗) is the correct answer. The phrase ""佢將收據丟咗"" implies a deliberate act of throwing away the receipt, which suggests that the cashier may have intentionally refused to give change to the woman. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option A (He will heal quickly)
Explanation: The premise ""我身體嘅傷口好深"" implies that the wound is deep, but option A suggests that it will heal quickly, which is a more plausible outcome given the severity of the injury."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (個細路將麵包擺埋一邊) is more likely. The phrase ""個細路"" refers to a narrow path or alleyway, which suggests that the speaker is in a confined space with limited room for movement. Therefore, it is less likely that the speaker will be able to ""爬過啲碎片"" (climb over the broken pieces) and more likely that they will have to find another way around them, such as ""個細路將麵包擺埋一邊"" (navigate through the narrow passage by carrying the noodle basket on one side)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""果個女人嘅妹妹,佢隻手都咗埋一齊."" The phrase ""佢隻手都咗埋一齊"" suggests that the girl's hands are full of something, implying that she cannot hold onto the paper towel. Therefore, it is more likely that her sister will take the paper towel from her."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""呢個男人有錢"" (This man has money), option B is more likely. The reason being that a person's breath can be affected by their diet or oral hygiene habits, whereas having money may not directly impact their breath."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They predicted that there would be traffic around the theater) is more likely. The passage states that ""呢對夫婦好早就去"" (They went early), implying that they were trying to avoid traffic. If they had known about the direction of the theater, they might have gone directly there instead of arriving early."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The passage implies that the woman's colleagues are trying to protect her from being scolded by their boss, rather than praising her for her work. Therefore, Option B is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢支持佢哋嘅原因) is more likely. The man signed the petition because he supports his friends' reasons for protesting.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢好驚嘅) is more likely.

"Response:  Option B: 我將地圖展開。
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我已經迷失咗"" (I have already lost), it is more likely that the speaker will take action to find their way back, rather than simply counting their money. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢俾人食咗) is more likely. The phrase ""果實熟咗"" means that something has ripened or matured, and ""落喺太阳之下"" means it has fallen to the ground. This suggests that the thing in question has reached its peak state and is now ready for consumption. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""車壞咗"" (car broke down), option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will sleep for a few days (Option B). The phrase ""背痛"" (back pain) suggests that he may be experiencing discomfort or pain in his back, which could make it difficult for him to move around or perform daily activities. Sleeping for a few days may be a way for him to rest and recover from the pain, rather than seeking medical attention (Option A)."
"Response:  Option A (I don't have a stove).
Explanation: The phrase ""我喺壁上點咗火"" implies that there is no stove or cooking facility available in the room where the speaker is located. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker does not have access to a stove for cooking. Hence, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢重新得到新生命) is more likely. The phrase ""呢個女人唔再跑"" suggests that she has given up running, implying a sense of hopelessness or resignation. In contrast, ""佢重新得到新生命"" implies a new beginning or rebirth, suggesting a more positive outcome. Therefore, Option B is more likely to be the correct answer based on the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (my neighbor left his door unlocked) is more likely to happen. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢丈夫唔明白佢有咩擔心) is more likely. The woman's disappointment and frustration are not due to her husband's lack of understanding but rather his inability to provide emotional support.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (学生答对問題) is the correct answer. The phrase ""老師讚揚咗學生"" suggests that the teacher praised a student for answering questions correctly, implying that the student was able to provide answers. Therefore, Option A is the most appropriate choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she will go to a supermarket (Option B). The reason is that buying eggs at a supermarket is more practical and convenient than going to a farm to buy them. Supermarkets typically have a wider selection of products and are open for longer hours, making it easier for people to purchase what they need. In contrast, visiting a farm may require more time and effort, especially if the farm is located far away from the person's home or workplace.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I hugged him) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢捉到咗魚) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the woman does not want to enter the lake, suggesting that she may have a reason for avoiding it. Option A provides a plausible explanation by stating that she has caught something in the lake, which could be a fish or other aquatic creature. This would provide a valid reason for her to avoid entering the lake. In contrast, option B (啲油睇落去係污染緊嘅) does not provide a clear connection to the premise and seems less likely as a cause for the woman's reluctance to enter the lake.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (佢嘅傘打碎咗) is the correct answer. The phrase ""一路潮湯"" implies a long and tiring journey, and the addition of ""咗"" at the end of ""傘"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken during this journey. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student's umbrella was broken due to prolonged exposure to rain than for someone to have stolen their bicycle."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (用戶移咗老鼠) is more likely. The light beam emitted by the computer screen is unlikely to be directly controlled by the user's mouse clicks. Instead, it is typically controlled through software settings or hardware configurations that are beyond the user's direct control. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the light beam is moving on the computer screen.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (an accident occurs on a main road) is more likely. The phrase ""喺主要嘅路上"" specifically refers to a major or primary road, indicating that the incident is unlikely to occur on a minor or secondary road. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: 麻布上有污。 (The bed sheet has stains.)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我將嘅床單掛喺外面嘅衣上,"" it is more likely that there are stains on the bed sheet rather than it being made of silk. The use of the word ""上"" (shàng) in the premise suggests a higher surface area or location, which aligns better with the idea of stains on a bed sheet."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (太阳光好发光) is the correct answer. The phrase ""太阳光好发光"" means ""The sunlight is so bright,"" which suggests that the woman's sunglasses are not necessary for protection from the sun but rather to enhance her appearance or style. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the woman might be wearing sunglasses indoors."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""個男人望住夜空"", option A is more likely. The phrase ""望住"" means to long for or yearn something, so it's likely that the man in question is hoping for a summer night sky."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我覺得好疲倦"", option B is more likely. The speaker feels tired and wants to go to bed earlier than usual, so they are more likely to choose option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""個男人去咖理髮師"", it is more likely that option A is correct, as the phrase ""長咗長"" (long hair) is commonly used to describe a man's long hair. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the male student does not care about his new classmate) is more likely. The use of the word ""唔鍾意"" (mái xiāng yì) in the premise suggests that the male student has a negative attitude towards his new classmate, indicating that he does not care or is indifferent to him. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: 我喺度麵包.  
Explanation: The premise ""我好想飲杯奶"" implies that the speaker wants to drink milk. However, option B ""我喺度麵包"" means ""I am hungry for noodles,"" which is not related to drinking milk. Therefore, option B is the less likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: 司機將車轉向後方.  
Explanation: According to the premise ""開始下雨,"" it is more likely that the driver will turn the car towards the back of the vehicle rather than turning on the headlights. This is because the driver may want to protect themselves from the rain by facing away from it while driving."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (My car is parked near the entrance) is more likely to be true. The speaker mentions that they are parking their car ""near the entrance"", indicating that they are not far from it. This suggests that the speaker's car is likely located closer to the entrance of the building than the opposite side of the street. Therefore, Option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: 佢編輯咗個草稿.  
Explanation: The passage suggests that the author had a deadline to meet and was struggling to come up with ideas for their article. This implies that they were experiencing writer's block, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as lack of inspiration or pressure to meet a deadline. It is less likely that the author was physically unable to write due to external factors such as having no pen or paper available. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for the author's situation."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (I want to request the same manager to speak) is more likely. The speaker is asking for a specific person to speak with them, indicating that they have already established some level of familiarity or connection with this individual. This makes it less likely that they would need to provide their personal file number in order to get someone to speak with them.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (窗都起咗) is more likely. The wind blowing through an open window would cause the window to vibrate or shake, rather than making a sound like option A (鈴響咗).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (我咗燈) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""我屋企嘅電斷"" suggests that there was a power outage in the house, which could be caused by various factors such as a faulty electrical system or a storm damaging the lines. It is less likely that someone would have an accident while using a protective device like insurance (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢喺鏡面度扭曲咗佢嘅肌肉) is the more likely cause of the person's muscle distortion. This is because the premise mentions that the person's face is being reflected in a mirror, which suggests that they are looking at themselves in a mirror. The act of looking at oneself in a mirror can cause one to unconsciously contort their facial expressions, leading to muscle distortion. Option B (佢將抬到頭上) does not provide any context or explanation for why the person's muscles would be distorted.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the student starts to have hallucinations) is more likely. The idea of a student using their brain to count something implies that they are engaging in mental calculations or problem-solving, rather than relying on external tools like a calculator. Hallucinations are also a common symptom of intense mental strain or overexertion, so it's possible that the student may experience them as a result of trying to use their brain too much.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (爸爸換咗細路嘅尿布) is more likely to be the cause of the baby's crying. This is because babies often have accidents or spill their diapers during sleep, especially if they are not yet fully trained to control their bladder and bowel movements. Therefore, it is possible that the baby in this scenario cried due to a wet or soiled diaper.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (呢個男仔受咖腦震) is more likely to occur. When a girl throws water at a boy, it is more likely that he will get wet than that his brain will be affected.
"Response:  Option B: 響相入面嘅人都笑唔到. 
Explanation: The premise suggests that the photographer forgot to turn off the flash, resulting in a harsh and unflattering lighting condition for the subjects. Option B better captures this idea by implying that the faces of the people in the photo are not smiling due to the awkward lighting. Option A does not convey the same meaning as it simply means the photo is blurry without providing any context or explanation."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (I'm feeling lonely) is the correct answer. The speaker mentions that they have been invited to a birthday party but declined, indicating that they are not interested in attending social events at the moment due to feelings of loneliness.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我做運動"" (I do exercise), option A is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in option A are more consistent with the given premise than option B."
"Response:  Option A - 佢吸收咗水.
Explanation: According to the premise ""我壓咗個"", we know that water will be compressed into a smaller space. Therefore, option A is more likely, as water will indeed be absorbed by the object."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the holiday village is located on an island) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""呢個細路有個刺青,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""刺青"" refers to a tattoo or a piercing, so it's likely that the person in question has a tattoo or piercing somewhere on their body. Option A, ""佢好驚針,"" means ""he/she was surprised by the needle."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: 我打電話俾警察.  
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker will call the police rather than start doubting themselves. The phrase ""停喺我屋企對面"" suggests that the car has stopped in front of their house, which could be a cause for concern or even fear. Therefore, option B is the more appropriate choice as it implies that the speaker will take action by calling the authorities to report the incident."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the criminal will confess (Option A). The phrase ""證據都指向佢"" means ""all evidence points to him,"" indicating that there is strong evidence against the criminal and he has no choice but to confess. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢避免咗咖啡因) is more likely to lead to weight loss. The man in the scenario has decided to avoid coffee because it contains sugar, which can contribute to weight gain if consumed excessively. By limiting his coffee intake, he may be able to reduce his overall calorie consumption and promote weight loss. Option A (佢唔再食糖果) does not directly address the issue of coffee consumption and may not have as significant an impact on weight loss.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""個女仔踩咗冰"" (a girl steps on ice), option B is more likely. The word ""踩"" (step) implies that the girl's foot made contact with something hard, such as ice, rather than slipping or sliding. Therefore, it is more likely that she will fall through the ice rather than just slide on top of it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""嗰個女人喺眼底有圈"", it is more likely that option A is correct, i.e., ""佢成晚唔瞓 LEFT"". This is because the phrase ""嗰個女人喺眼底有圈"" suggests that there is a circle or ring around her eyes, which could be caused by excessive sleeping or lack of rest. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (volcanic eruption) is more likely to be the cause of the rock formation. Volcanic eruptions can produce a wide range of rocks, including basalt, andesite, and rhyolite, which are common types of rocks found in Hawaii. In contrast, option B (no volcanic activity) is less likely, as Hawaii is known for its active volcanoes and geothermal activity. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""呢個女人著咗佢嘅鞋"", option B is more likely. The woman wants to leave the party because she has a pair of shoes that belong to someone else."
"Response:  Option B: 佢喺收費站住我. 
Explanation: The phrase ""佢畀我"" (佢畀 means to provide or offer something) implies that the service provider will offer the service at a certain location. However, the word ""住"" (住 means to live in) suggests that the service provider may be living at the payment station, which is unlikely. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (佢賣咗佢公司嘅股票) is the correct answer. The passage states that the manager had been selling off the company's assets to pay off his personal debts, which suggests that he was using the company's funds for his own benefit rather than investing them in the business. This behavior is consistent with option A, as the manager would be selling off the company's shares to raise cash rather than investing in the business.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (醫生係度放假) is more likely. The man's decision to go see a doctor suggests that he may be experiencing some discomfort or illness, which could be a valid reason for taking time off work. It is less likely that he would simply not feel like going to work without any specific reason.
"Response:  Option B: 房間冇人住.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我從窗口出咗間睡房"", it is more likely that there is no one living in the room as the speaker has to climb out of the window to sleep in another place. This implies that the room is unoccupied or abandoned. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (佢沖咗個好长嘅淋浴) is the correct answer. The premise suggests that the person's hand has become longer, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as an injury or a medical condition. However, using too much soap or detergent ( Option B - 佢用肥咗手) is unlikely to cause the hand to become longer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我吐出咗牛奶"" (I spat out milk), it is more likely that option A is correct, i.e., the taste of the milk is sour. This is because the phrase ""吐出咗"" (spit out) typically implies a negative reaction to something unpleasant or unwanted, such as a bad taste."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B (I was late returning to work) is the correct answer. The phrase ""錯過"" in Cantonese implies a sense of missed opportunity or failure, which aligns with the idea of being late returning to work. Option A (""I went to work too early"") does not fit as well with the context provided."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the passenger car ( Option B) will be involved in a collision with the goods vehicle (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 部車被撞到.
Response:  Option A (佢哋贏咗)
"Response:  Option B: 我將個帽子扭開.  
Explanation: The premise ""果酒瓶響起一聲"" suggests that something has caused a wine bottle to make a noise. Option B better fits this context as it implies someone turning or twisting their hat, which could potentially cause a noise similar to what is described in the premise. Option A does not provide a clear explanation for the noise mentioned in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will climb up to the roof (Option B). The phrase ""佢爬上屋頂"" implies a physical action of climbing upwards, whereas ""佢喺個開嘅窗入嚟"" does not convey any specific action or direction. Therefore, Option B is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (佢將佢擺喺衣櫃度) is more likely. The speaker mentions that the man will put his dirty clothes in the wardrobe, indicating that he will store them away rather than washing them immediately.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (個女仔吐咗牙膏) is more likely to occur. The idea of a woman spitting out toothpaste suggests that she may be experiencing discomfort or difficulty while trying to use it, which could lead to her spitting it out rather than simply blowing it out of the tube like in option A.
"Response:  Option B: 和平主義者舉行咗一場遊行.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the number of civilian deaths has increased during the war. This suggests that there are more civilians who are directly affected by the conflict and may be in need of protection or aid. Holding a march or protest can raise awareness about the issue and put pressure on those in power to take action, but it may not necessarily provide direct assistance to those in need. Therefore, option B, where peace activists hold a march, is more likely to have an impact on the situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (佢綁咗條帶) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""個女仔喺頭髮上拉咗個帶"" suggests that a woman has tied her hair into a bun, which would require tying it with a ribbon or elastic band. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why there might be a ribbon or elastic band on top of her head."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢之後嘅年齡) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the little chicken hatched from an egg (Option A). The phrase ""一個小雞從蛋裡頭出咗來"" literally means ""a small chicken comes out of an egg,"" indicating that the little chicken was born inside an egg. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""囚犯餓死,"" it is more likely that option A (佢去咗) is the correct answer. The phrase ""囚犯餓死"" means ""prisoner starved to death,"" indicating that the person in question died due to lack of food or other basic necessities while incarcerated. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the person escaped, is less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢從梯度跌落嚟) is more likely. The man has already lost his balance and is likely to fall down the stairs rather than climb up them.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢飲咗一蘇打水) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""飲咗"" means to drink, so it suggests that the person drank something, possibly water. Option B (佢打開咗個蘇打水) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of opening a bottle of water. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I bled) is more likely to occur because it implies that something has happened to cause blood to come out of the window. The other option (I relaxed) does not provide any information about what might have caused the blood to appear at the window.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option B (佢嘅成績好好) is the cause of 嗰個學生得到大學學費. The passage states that 嗰個學生 has good grades, which suggests that their academic performance is strong enough to warrant a scholarship. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (佢係佢隔壁嘅鄰居) is the correct answer. The phrase ""同個男仔"" suggests that they are neighbors of the same gender, and the use of the word ""隔壁"" implies a physical barrier or separation between them. Therefore, it is more likely that they are living in adjacent apartments or houses."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢冇錢) is more likely. The passage states that the homeless person stole food, indicating that they did not have money to buy it legally. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I want a private space) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker mentions wanting to make a call to their friend, indicating that they are in a public place or situation where privacy may not be easily accessible. Therefore, the desire for a private space ( Option A) is more plausible than feeling lonely (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I hit him) is more likely. The man has extended a hand to you, but instead of shaking it, you decide to hit him. This implies that there may be some conflict or tension between you two, and violence may be an appropriate response in this situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我住咗"" (I am living), option A is more likely. The phrase ""煙花開始喺空中"" (Smoke starts in the air) suggests that something unexpected or unusual has happened, while ""飛盤飛向我嘅頭"" (A plane flies towards my head) is a more direct and dangerous threat. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢好擔心) is more likely. The phrase ""個女仔咬咗佢嘅指甲"" suggests that a woman has bitten off someone's fingernail, which could be a sign of aggression or frustration. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response as it implies that the person is worried about the situation."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (a new moon) is more likely to be the cause of turning pages in a calendar. This is because a new moon typically marks the beginning of a new lunar cycle and is often associated with renewal and change, which could explain why someone might feel inspired to turn over a new leaf or start fresh. Option A (writing an appointment) does not seem as directly related to the idea of turning pages in a calendar.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (佢咗佢嘅律師) will occur. The husband may choose to seek legal advice or representation in order to protect his interests and rights in the marriage. This option aligns with the theme of seeking professional help to address a difficult situation, which is consistent with the tone of the prompt.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (球跳咗) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""丟咗"" means ""to throw,"" so it's unlikely that the ball will emit light. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (佢咗佢答案) is more likely. The phrase ""呢個女仔喺考試上犯咗個錯"" implies that the girl made a mistake in her examination, so it is more likely that she will choose the wrong answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢嘅對手捉住咗嗰球) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""佢嘅"" means ""he/she grabs"" or ""he/she catches,"" indicating that the opponent will try to grab or catch the ball. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: 佢哋都好成熟.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我從葡萄樹上番茄"", it is more likely that the speaker picked ripe tomatoes from a grapevine rather than watering them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢同前女友一齊食午餐) is more likely to be the desired outcome for the man in this scenario. This is because the phrase ""同前女友"" (together with his ex-girlfriend) implies a level of intimacy and closeness that would not be possible if he were simply buying her jewelry ( Option B). Therefore, option A better aligns with the idea of expressing romance through shared experiences rather than material gifts."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the temperature has risen due to a change in weather (Option B). Therefore, the answer is Option B.
"Response:  Option B: 高速公路變咗危險嘅冰.  
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the high-speed highway will be affected by the storm rather than the court building's roof being blown off. The phrase ""高速公路變咗危險嘅冰"" (high-speed highway becomes dangerous due to ice) suggests that the storm may cause hazardous road conditions, such as icing over of the roads, which could make driving difficult or even dangerous."
"Response:  Option A: 佢嘅成績都提高咗.  
Explanation: According to the premise, students are more likely to benefit from tutoring sessions than to cheat during exams. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我覺得舒服"" (I feel comfortable), option B is more likely. The phrase ""我將自己包裹喺毯上"" (I will wrap myself in a blanket) suggests a sense of coziness and relaxation, which aligns with the given premise. Option A does not convey the same level of comfort or relaxation."
"Response:  Option A - 佢開始滑落嚟 (He started to slide down)
Explanation: The premise ""我磨咗石頭"" implies that something has been rubbed or ground against a hard surface, causing it to wear away and potentially create friction. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the object began to slide down due to this friction."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我將糖加入咖啡,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""咖啡有好強嘅味道."" Adding sugar to coffee will make its flavor stronger, not sweeter."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (佢撕碎咗嗰啲紙) is more likely. The phrase ""撕碎"" (pierce or tear apart) implies a more violent action than ""傷咗"" (scratch), so it is more likely that the man will tear the newspaper into pieces rather than just scratching it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (釘子入咗木頭) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""用子打咗個釘"" implies that someone is using a hammer to hit something, and since the word for ""hammer"" in Chinese is also used to describe hitting or striking something, it's more likely that the action of hitting will result in the nail entering the wood. Option B (""釘子開始咗"") doesn't make as much sense in this context, as it would imply that the nail is starting to move or rotate inside the wood without any external force being applied."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""魚咬咗個"", it is more likely that option A will occur - the fish will bite the hook."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢有一個) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""佢有一個"" means ""he/she has a toothache,"" which aligns with the context of the passage. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Option A: 我收到好消息 (I received good news)
"Response:  Option A: 毛巾係潮嘅.
Explanation: The premise ""我用毛巾擦咗手"" implies that the speaker used a towel to wipe their hands. This is more likely to be true if the speaker's hands are dirty or wet, as towels are commonly used for drying or cleaning one's hands. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (個喺佢下面搖搖) is more likely. The phrase ""個男人喺上失去了平衡"" suggests that the man has lost his balance, which could be caused by him stumbling or slipping on something below him. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option B: 佢哋嘅教練取消咗練習.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the teammates are blaming each other for their poor performance in a game. This suggests that there was some sort of conflict or disagreement among them during the game, rather than simply losing due to individual mistakes. Therefore, option B, where the coach cancels practice, is more likely as it implies that the team's poor performance was caused by internal conflicts rather than external factors like opponents' strength."
"Response:  Option A (My regret for my mistakes)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我求過原"" (I have regrets), option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""我後悔咗我犯嘅錯"" (I regret my past mistakes) suggests that the speaker has reflected on their actions and realized they could have done things differently. This aligns with the idea of having regrets or remorse for one's mistakes. In contrast, option B does not convey a sense of regret or remorse, but rather a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction towards achieving one's goals. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (She talks about her own problems) is the correct answer. The premise states that the woman is unhappy with her boyfriend, suggesting that she may be sharing her own feelings and concerns with him rather than simply talking about herself.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢嘅臉紅咗) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""佢嘅臉紅咗"" suggests that the person's face will turn red due to laughter or embarrassment, which aligns with the context of a funny joke being told. Option B (""佢嘅穴都露出嚟"") does not make sense in this context as it implies that the person's holes are exposed, which is an absurd and impossible scenario. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (佢穿過呢個礦山) is the correct answer. The phrase ""礦山"" suggests a mountain of ore or minerals, which could be a physical obstacle for a ship to pass through. Therefore, it is unlikely that the enemy's ship would openly enter the port without first neutralizing any potential threats in its path."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man stepped on broken glass (Option B) than entered a water pool (Option A). The reason is that stepping on broken glass can result in injury or pain, while entering a water pool may not necessarily cause harm to the man's foot. Therefore, Option B is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise.
Response:  Option B: 佢哋喺犯罪現場搵到咗呢把武器.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (I ask him if he wants me to send him) is more likely. The speaker is more concerned with finding out what the other person wants rather than simply taking a left turn.
"Response:  Option B: 好多人面臨失業問題.
Explanation: According to the premise, ""國家嘅經濟衰退,"" which means that the country's economy is declining. This can lead to a situation where many people face unemployment problems. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (佢哋即刻要行入迎面車流) is more likely to be the cause of the situation described in the scenario. This is because the phrase ""叫你們快速地進入迎面車流"" suggests that there is a sense of urgency or danger involved, which would motivate people to quickly enter the flow of traffic. In contrast, Option B (""佢喺附近認識佢哋"") does not convey a sense of urgency or danger, but rather a casual encounter between two groups of people. Therefore, based on the given premise, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (佢话我知真相) is the correct answer. The phrase ""佢話我知真相"" means ""He/She said something that made me realize the truth."" This fits with the context of the premise, as the speaker is expressing their realization or understanding of something after hearing someone else's words. Option B (""佢講咗一個諷刺嘅說話"") means ""He/She spoke a sarcastic remark,"" which does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (司機喺路上被困住) is more likely. The phrase ""被困住"" implies that the driver is stuck in a situation where they cannot move forward or backward, which could be due to various reasons such as traffic congestion, road construction, or an accident. This scenario is more plausible than option B (司機上咗一個乘客), as it is less common for drivers to pick up passengers unexpectedly while driving."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""呢個女人生咗產"", option A is more likely. The phrase ""生咗產"" means to give birth, so it suggests that the woman has already had a child. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢脫咗帽) is more likely to be the cause of the man losing his hat in the wind. The phrase ""個男人戴嘅帽子"" implies that the man was wearing a hat, and the sentence structure suggests that something happened to the hat as a result of the wind. Option B (""外面好風"") simply states that there is strong wind outside without providing any context or explanation for why the man's hat might have been blown away."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the girl received an invitation to her classmate's birthday party rather than buying a gift for them. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢媽媽量咗佢體溫) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of a hot day in Hong Kong where people are seeking relief from the heat. The phrase ""佢媽媽量咗佢體溫"" means ""Mom measures his body temperature,"" suggesting that the speaker's mother is checking her son's temperature to ensure he doesn't have a fever due to the heat. In contrast, Option B (佢媽媽帶佢去公園) means ""Mom takes him to the park,"" which does not necessarily relate to the theme of heat or temperature."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (he wants to impress his girlfriend) than Option B (he wants to make himself smell good). The premise mentions ""his girlfriend"" and does not mention anything about personal hygiene or grooming habits. Therefore, it is more plausible that he is using cologne as a way to impress her rather than for its intended purpose of making oneself smell good."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I turn on a light) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (個媽媽生咗雙胞胎) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the passage mentions ""one big house"" without providing any context or explanation as to why there would be a need for multiple bedrooms in such a household. It is much more plausible that the family grew by having twins than by one of the children moving out and getting their own place."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (he thinks about returning energy) is more likely. The runner's slow pace suggests that they are not giving their all to the race, and instead may be conserving their energy for later stages of the marathon or for future races. This aligns with Option A, as the runner is thinking about how to return energy rather than focusing solely on reaching the finish line.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (machine spits out zero dollars) is more likely. The premise implies that something unexpected happened to the vending machine, causing it to dispense nothing in return for the money inserted. This could be due to a technical issue or a malfunction, making Option A the most plausible explanation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我朋friend個狗死咗"", it is more likely that option A will be chosen, as the speaker may want to turn away or avoid looking at the dead dog. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: 佢用現金嚟付
Explanation: According to the premise, the merchant has refused to accept the card payment, so the customer will have to pay with cash. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢同佢兄弟同佢哋嘅父母架) is the more likely cause for the man to feel proud. The premise suggests that the man's parents are also proud of him, implying a positive relationship between them. In contrast, option B (佢兄弟被大學錄取) does not necessarily imply a direct connection between the brother's academic achievement and the man's pride in himself. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢去咗圖書館) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the girl wants to learn about the solar system by going to a library.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (“我將海報放喺門口上面”) is the correct answer. The phrase “海報” can be translated to “newspaper,” and the sentence structure implies that the speaker will place the newspaper on top of something, such as a door or a wall. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the speaker might hang up their newspaper. Option B does not make sense in this context, as there is no logical connection between hanging a newspaper behind another piece of paper.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B ( builder adjusts design) is more likely to occur. The customer has approved the designer's design drawings, indicating that they are satisfied with the initial design. However, there may still be some adjustments or modifications needed to accommodate the building codes, local regulations, or other factors. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""個男人落咗個匙,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""落咗"" means to drop or fall, so it's more likely that the man dropped the key rather than having it taken from him."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the board of directors will dissolve the company (Option A). The CEO's resignation may have created a vacuum in leadership, leading to instability within the organization. In this scenario, the board of directors may decide to dissolve the company rather than appointing a new CEO or allowing the existing management team to continue without proper oversight.
"Response:  Option B: 我行近咗個講台. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我到講座时遲到,"" it is more likely that the speaker will be nearer to the podium than the back of the room. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person was attacked by another inmate (Option B). The phrase ""佢攻擊咗另一名囚犯"" suggests that the person was assaulted by someone else while in prison, rather than being protected by their insurance policy (Option A)."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""我踩住咗個頭"" (I stepped on a head), option B is more likely. The phrase ""踩住"" (stepped on) implies forceful contact with an object, which could result in breaking or damaging it. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The girl joins a discussion team to learn communication skills rather than computer knowledge. Therefore, she is more likely to have learned how to communicate effectively with others in the team rather than how to use computers.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我個心情好咗"" (I feel good), option A is more likely. The act of listening to music is something that can improve one's mood, so it is a plausible cause for feeling good. Option B, on the other hand, does not have any direct connection to improving one's mood."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (providing food for the homeless) is more likely to achieve the goal of raising funds. 
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the passengers will laugh (Option A). The phrase ""輪椅落咗急落嘅山坡"" suggests a sudden and unexpected fall, which could be humorous or amusing to the passengers. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""我折咗嗰张纸"" (I have torn a piece of paper), option B is more likely. The word ""折"" (chuī) in the premise implies that the speaker has actually torn the paper, so it is unlikely that they will simply return it to its original state. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (other country's leaders also send people to assist) is more likely. 
Explanation: The premise states that a major natural disaster has occurred in the country, indicating a large-scale crisis that requires external assistance. It is unlikely that other countries would not provide any help in such a situation, especially if it involves a neighboring country or one with strategic importance. Therefore, Option B is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢爬出水池) is more likely. The premise states that ""細路嘅衫都晒,"" indicating that there are many narrow paths leading to a pool of water. It is unlikely for someone to fall into the water from above, as they would need to climb down or jump into the water from a height. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (returning the book to the library) is more likely. The student is in a hurry to finish reading the book, indicating that they need it for some purpose or deadline. It's unlikely that they would lend it to their friend without returning it first. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the person was sentenced to death ( Option A). This is because the phrase ""犯人被處死"" suggests that the person has been sentenced to death, rather than being arrested or charged with a crime (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I open the window) is more likely to let sunlight enter the room. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that 佢嘅假髮脫咗出嚟 (Option A). The premise states that 我拉住個假冒犯嘅頭髮, implying that there is a fake hairpiece involved. As such, it is more plausible that the fake hairpiece would come loose rather than undergo a transformation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢覺得呢本書好有吸引力) is more likely. The use of ""good"" (好) in Cantonese implies a positive evaluation, suggesting that the person finds the book attractive or appealing. In contrast, option B (佢覺得判斷冇明確) does not convey any particular emotion or evaluation towards the book."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢發現卡嘅期限過咗) is more likely. The woman discovered that her credit card had expired, indicating that she may have forgotten to renew it or was not aware of its expiration date.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢哋結婚) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: 我寫咗我自己嘅歌 (I will write my own song)
Explanation: The premise ""音樂聽得太弱"" implies that the speaker finds music too soft or not loud enough. Given this context, it is more likely that the speaker will take action to make their own music louder, rather than increasing the volume of someone else's music. Writing one's own song is a common way for people to express themselves creatively and make their music heard. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (呢個女仔拉咗個) is more likely. The phrase ""拉咗個"" implies a physical action of pulling or tugging, which could potentially harm the person's hair. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman in question has had her hair pulled or tangled rather than being excited or aroused."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""果隻蟲被住,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, i.e., the speaker has applied insect repellent to their own body. This is because the phrase ""果隻蟲"" specifically refers to a mosquito bite or sting, which would be caused by an insect's venom rather than being crushed by foot. Therefore, the speaker's claim of having been bitten by an insect suggests that they have been exposed to an insect repellent."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我开眼睛"" (I open my eyes), option A is more likely. The phrase ""醒咗"" (wake up) implies a sudden change in state from being asleep to being awake, which aligns with the idea of opening one's eyes. Option B does not convey this same sense of suddenness or change in state."
"Response:  Option A: 我叫佢低音 (I call him low-pitched)
Explanation: The premise ""我隔壁嘅音樂好大聲"" implies that the speaker's voice is loud and clear, which suggests that they have a strong vocal range. Therefore, option A, ""我叫佢低音"" (I call him low-pitched), is more likely to be the correct answer as it aligns with the tone of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the reason for their financial difficulties is that they are underpaid (Option B). The phrase ""佢係錢嘅"" suggests that they are struggling to make ends meet due to a lack of money, rather than being overpaid. Additionally, the comparison to the minimum wage in Option B implies that their salary is lower than what is legally required, further supporting this answer."

The phrase ""綁架者威脅要傷害人質"" suggests that the abductor is threatening to harm the hostage if their demands are not met. This implies that the abduction was carried out with the intention of using the hostage as leverage for some other purpose, rather than simply taking them for ransom. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: 個音樂家打鼓. 
Explanation: The phrase ""一聲巨響"" (one sound huge) suggests that a loud noise was made, which could be caused by someone hitting a drum or other percussion instrument. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (個細路從惡夢中大叫醒咗) is more likely. The phrase ""個細路"" refers to a nightmare or bad dream, suggesting that the person may have been having a frightening experience in their sleep. This aligns with the idea of someone waking up screaming from a bad dream. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢係早出咗世) is the more likely cause for why this woman uses sign language to communicate. The phrase ""早出咗世"" means ""to be born early,"" which could refer to a situation where someone was born with a disability or condition that affects their ability to speak or communicate verbally. Therefore, it is more likely that the woman in question uses sign language as her primary mode of communication due to a physical limitation rather than simply being more comfortable with it."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (啲作物都消滅咗) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""旱"" typically refers to a drought or lack of rain, which can cause crops to wither and die. Therefore, it is more likely that the crops will be affected by the drought than the water being contaminated."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""貓追住鳥"" (cat chases bird), option A is more likely. The word order in the premise suggests that the cat is actively pursuing the bird, making it more likely for the bird to fly away than for the bird to be caught by the cat."

"Response:  Option B: 極端分子暗殺咗佢  
Explanation: According to the premise, the leader of a country has formed an extreme opposition relationship with a certain group of people.

"Response:  Option B: 波沖到岸邊. 
Explanation: The premise ""我喺海灘上赤腳行過"" implies that the speaker has walked barefoot on the beach. As a result, option B, ""波沖到岸邊,"" is more likely to occur as the waves will definitely reach the shore. Option A, ""我腳上嘅沙係粘住咗,"" does not make sense in this context as there would be no sand for the feet to stick to if they are already in the water."
"Response:  Option B: 我飲咗一杯水.  
Explanation: According to the premise ""我係半夜醒返"", the speaker woke up in the middle of the night. As a result, they are likely to be feeling cold, which can be alleviated by drinking water. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢個仔喺度) is more likely. The phrase ""佢個仔喺度"" suggests that the child is feeling annoyed or frustrated with their mother's constant nagging, which aligns better with the premise than Option A (""佢個仔微笑咗"") which implies a more neutral expression."
"Response:  Option B: 我喺路面上.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我條牛仔褲有個"", it is more likely that the speaker has dropped their pants while walking on the road rather than pulling them up. The phrase ""喺路面上"" implies a location where one might be walking or standing, whereas ""拉咗起褲個拉"" suggests an action taken from a seated position. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢嘅牙變直) is more likely. The word ""支架"" in the premise can be translated to ""brace,"" which implies that something is being held or supported. Since the man's teeth are changing direction, it is more likely that his braces have caused this change rather than him having a single tooth."
Response:  Option B: 我今日醒返嘅時候喉痛咗. (My throat hurts today after waking up.)
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The other students are likely to feel neglected or overlooked if they are not included in the lunch invitation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢決定要試下翻轉) is more likely. The phrase ""落台上"" implies that something has fallen or dropped from a height, so it's unlikely that the object would be able to fly back up into the air. Instead, it's more likely that the object will try to turn over or flip over in mid-air to avoid crashing to the ground."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (郵局將信送到去) is more likely. The premise states that the sender will put the letter in a mailbox, implying that it will be delivered by the post office. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢將佢所有錢都賭咗下) is more likely. The speaker seems to be in a state of desperation and hopelessness, indicating that they have lost all their money through gambling. Option B (佢返到屋企嗰陣都冇錢) does not convey the same sense of urgency or despair.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (wind becomes stronger) is more likely to be the cause of the fire spreading. The premise states that ""the wind has become much stronger,"" which suggests that the conditions are ideal for the fire to spread rapidly. In contrast, Option B (people setting fires intentionally) does not align with the given information as there is no indication that anyone purposely set the forest ablaze. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the fire's expansion is an increase in wind speed."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢媽媽將帶咗傷口) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""個細路咗佢隻膝"" suggests that the person's knee has been injured, and the mother may try to treat the injury by applying a bandage or dressing. Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he signed a will. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Option B: 我燒咗我條舌頭. (I burned my tongue.)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the author did not include a crucial detail in their story) is the correct cause for the error. The fact that the editor noticed an inconsistency in the story but could not find any other errors suggests that there may have been something specific missing or incorrect in the narrative. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the error.
"Response:  Option B: 我成日都喺度讀書.  
Explanation: The premise ""我覺得好疲倦"" suggests that the speaker feels tired or exhausted. Option B better fits this context as it implies that the speaker has been reading books every day, which could contribute to their exhaustion."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Dr. Chan discovered the patient's symptoms (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: 佢發現病人有嘅症狀.
"Response:  Option B: 我覺得有。
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我住自己嘅皮膚,"" it is more likely that the speaker feels that they have a skin condition or irritation rather than excessive sweating. The phrase ""住自己"" (staying oneself) implies a sense of discomfort or unease, which is consistent with the idea of having a skin issue. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (佢心臟病發) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""佢需要急症手術"" suggests that the person has a serious medical condition that requires immediate attention, and heart disease (心臟病) is one of the most common and life-threatening conditions that can require emergency surgery. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice based on the information given in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (佢扭曲咗手臂) is the correct answer. The phrase ""肌肉變咗腫咗"" suggests that there has been some kind of deformation or twisting of the muscle tissue in the arm, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as injury or disease. However, the specific cause mentioned in the premise is ""病人隻手臂嘅肌肉變咗"", which implies that the change in the muscle tissue is specifically related to the patient's illness or condition. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""個男人抬起眉毛"" (a man raises his eyebrows), option B is more likely. The phrase ""佢覺得好喪"" (he feels sad) better fits the context of a person raising their eyebrows than ""佢好驚訝"" (he is surprised)."
"Response:  Option A: 我相信佢有好好嘅意圾。 (I believe he has good intentions.)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""他不是對我誤會,"" it is more likely that the other person has good intentions rather than knowing something better. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢開始更早起身) is more likely to lead to him not smoking anymore. The premise suggests that he has been trying to quit smoking for a while but hasn't succeeded yet. Starting his day earlier may help him establish a routine that can make it easier for him to avoid smoking.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the attacker's nose will start bleeding (Option B).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the man did not aim properly) caused the arrow to miss its target. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A is more likely. The mention of a ""地下室"" (underground room) suggests that the infestation may be hidden or secretive in nature, which aligns with the idea of finding old rats in the basement. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible cause for the infestation."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I am too tired to prepare anything) is more likely the cause of why the speaker suggests going out for dinner. The speaker mentions being tired, implying that they do not have the energy or motivation to cook or prepare a meal at home. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - 佢開始收埋日記 (He starts to collect his diary). This is because the phrase ""捉到佢兄弟"" (catches his brother) implies a sudden and unexpected event, which could lead to him discovering his brother's diary and starting to read it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢係加班工作) is more likely. The premise implies that the woman has no money to rent a house, suggesting that she may be working excessively long hours or multiple jobs to make ends meet. This could lead to physical and mental exhaustion, making it difficult for her to afford basic necessities like housing. Option B (佢離開咗佢份工) does not necessarily address this issue and could potentially worsen the situation if the woman loses her job entirely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢摸住個熱) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""個細路嘅手"" suggests that someone is holding onto something small and delicate, which could refer to a hot object. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B ( sending a survey to customers) is more likely to achieve the desired outcome of knowing customer satisfaction. This is because surveys provide a structured way for customers to share their thoughts and opinions, allowing companies to gather valuable insights into their experiences and preferences. In contrast, offering discounts to new customers may not directly address customer satisfaction, as it primarily benefits those who are already loyal to the company.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (個男仔將沙發上嘅枕頭丟下) is the more likely cause of the damage to the floor. This is because throwing a pillow onto the floor can potentially cause damage to the surface, especially if it is thrown with force or from a height. In contrast, dragging a chair across the floor may not necessarily cause as much damage, depending on the type of chair and the surface being dragged over. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我遮住我塊臉"" (I covered my face), option A is more likely. The speaker may have been trying to hide their face from someone or something, rather than being hit by them."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (because of an electrical shock) is more likely. The passage mentions that the famous statue was destroyed, but does not provide any information about people coming to worship it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the statue was damaged.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我將果實擺喺上"", option B is more likely. The word ""擺"" (pian) means to place or put something down, so it's unlikely that the fruit will grow on top of the plate. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (佢指住腳) is the correct answer. The phrase ""芭蕾舞家撕裂咗"" suggests a sudden and violent tearing apart, which aligns with the idea of someone using their hands to hold onto something tightly. Option B (佢扭咗隻腳) does not fit as well with this image, as it implies a twisting or turning motion rather than a direct pulling action."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (佢學識點樣綁呢啲結) is the correct answer. The phrase ""打開咗"" suggests that something has been opened or unlocked, which aligns with the idea of untying a knot. Therefore, it is unlikely that option B (佢喺操场周圍跑) is the correct answer, as running around the field does not involve untying a knot."
Response:  Option A (I return to the book again and again)
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the person's beliefs were influenced by their parents rather than them abandoning their child. The passage states that the person's father was a devout believer who taught his son about God from an early age, indicating that he played an active role in shaping the person's religious beliefs. Additionally, the passage notes that the person's mother was also religious, further suggesting that they grew up in a household where religion was valued and instilled in them. Therefore, option A (the person's parents influenced their beliefs) is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Option B: 司機瞓著咗。
Explanation: The phrase ""汽車慢慢停咗下來"" suggests that the car has come to a slow stop. This could be due to various reasons such as traffic or road conditions. However, among the two options provided, option B is more likely as it implies that the driver may have fallen asleep while driving, which can cause the car to slow down or even stop unexpectedly. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the ice cream will melt) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (毯子睇起嚟係嘅) is the correct answer. The phrase ""毯子睇起嚟係嘅"" means to hang something on a wall or on a surface, which aligns with the idea of hanging art pieces in a room. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: 我老開會 (I am too tired)
Explanation: The phrase ""我老開會"" means ""I am too tired,"" which aligns with the premise of feeling unwell in the morning due to working late the night before. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (個主人畀咗個仔仔一隻禮物) is more likely. The use of the word ""畀"" (to give or offer) suggests that the owner willingly gives a toy to the dog as a gift, rather than simply having one given to them by someone else."
"Response:  Option A (My friend originally had me).
Explanation: The phrase ""我同朋friend道歉"" means ""I apologize to my friend."" In this context, ""同"" (tong) means ""same,"" so the sentence can be translated as ""Same friend originally had me."" This implies that the speaker's friend was responsible for something in the past, rather than the speaker themselves. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (佢帶住一個背包) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""脫而出"" suggests that the man is trying to escape or run away from something, which would require him to carry a backpack with his belongings. Therefore, Option A is more plausible than Option B (佢著住一件虹燈形嘅背心), as it better fits the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the witness will be accused of providing false testimony (Option B). The phrase ""呢個見證人喺宣誓之下講咗大話"" suggests that the witness has made exaggerated or untrue claims under oath, indicating a possibility of perjury."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (佢想融入大家嘅圈子) is more likely to be the reason why the woman dyes her hair. The phrase ""融入大家嘅圈子"" means to blend in or fit in with a particular group or circle of people, suggesting that the woman may be trying to change her appearance to conform to societal beauty standards or to gain acceptance from others. This is consistent with the idea of wanting to have a new face or identity. Therefore, Option B is the better choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢哋被遣返返去美國) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the audience will laugh ( Option A).
"Response:  Option A: 我因為太阳而失明. (I lost my sight because of the sun.)
Explanation: The premise ""我望住太陽"" means ""I looked directly at the sun,"" which suggests that the speaker was gazing at the sun for an extended period. This increases the likelihood of option A, as looking directly at the sun can cause eye damage or even blindness. In contrast, option B does not convey a sense of prolonged exposure to the sun, making it less plausible."
"Response:  Option B: 我打哈欠.  
Explanation: The phrase ""打哈欠"" (dāo hǎ lè) in Chinese means to be bored or fed up with something. Based on the context of the premise, it is more likely that the speaker feels bored or fed up with the situation rather than being annoyed or irritated. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""牛排好難切"", option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""好難切"" means ""very difficult to cut"". Therefore, it is unlikely that the butcher would say ""刀係無味嘅"" (the knife tastes bad), as this does not align with the difficulty of cutting the meat. Instead, they are more likely to say ""牛排係生嘅"" (the steak is raw)."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she has accumulated too much elderly care subsidy ( Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Option B: I decide to visit him.
Explanation: The premise states that your friend has been living in a shared flat with his girlfriend for some time now, but he hasn't told you about it until recently. This implies that there may be some tension or awkwardness between them, perhaps due to their living arrangement. Therefore, option B, ""I decide to visit him,"" is more likely as it suggests that you are taking an initiative to reach out to your friend and show support, rather than simply accepting the situation without questioning (option A)."
"Response:  Option B: 我聞到花嘅味道. 
Explanation: The premise ""我將花放喺我鼻下"" implies that the speaker will smell the flower. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢遇到一個童年朋友) is more likely. The phrase ""呢個女人對舊情有懷念"" suggests that the woman has nostalgia for her past, which could be triggered by encountering someone from her childhood or youth. Option B (""佢對佢嘅細路大叫"") does not necessarily imply a connection to the woman's past."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (佢將冇完整嘅文件提交咗) is more likely to happen. The student will probably delay submitting the essay because they have not completed it fully.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我個車壞咗"", option B (I will call a mechanic) is more likely. This is because the speaker has already acknowledged that their car is broken, so it makes sense for them to seek professional help rather than going to a mall."
"Response:  Option A - 係匿名嘅 (It's anonymous)
Explanation: The speaker mentions that they have ""张紙"" (a lot of paper), implying that they are writing or drawing something. However, when asked what it is, they say ""唔識字"" (I don't know how to read/write). This suggests that the speaker may be illiterate or unable to read what they have written, making option A (it's anonymous) a more plausible explanation for why they can't reveal what they have created."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""birds have wings to fly,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""birds have wings to fly"" implies that birds use their wings for flight, so it is more likely that a bird will flap its wings upwards than lay eggs."
"Response:  Option A: 車庫開咗 (The car trunk is open)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我泊喺車道上"" (I am parked on the road), it is more likely that the car trunk is open rather than full. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (being victim raises hands) is more likely to occur. The reason being that when someone is shot at close range, they would instinctively raise their hands in self-defense or to protect themselves from further harm. This reaction is more natural than simply dropping a gun, especially if the person is not trained in firearms handling. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the given scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我好期待週末"", option A is more likely."
"Response:  Option A: 我喺度白日夢諗住 (I'm in a white dream state)
Explanation: The phrase ""white dream state"" suggests a state of altered consciousness or a dream-like state, which aligns with the theme of not knowing how to measure time. This option is more plausible than ""I think so,"" as it provides a more creative and imaginative explanation for the speaker's confusion about time."
"Response:  Option B: 紙張已經用曬.  
Explanation: The passage states that ""文件打印出唔清晰"", indicating that the printout is not clear. This suggests that there may be an issue with the paper rather than the ink cartridge. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause - the paper has already been used and is worn out, resulting in a less-than-clear printout."
"Response:  Option B: 球迷趕緊入场。
Explanation: According to the premise, the national anthem is being played during a baseball game. When this happens, fans are expected to stand up and sing along with the anthem. Therefore, option B is more likely, as fans will be rushing to their seats to comply with the protocol of standing for the national anthem."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I will put it in the restaurant) is more likely. The speaker seems to be suggesting that they have brought something from home to eat at a restaurant, rather than leaving it somewhere else.
"Response:  Option B: 漏油留低嘅粘性殘留物. 
Explanation: When you put a piece of paper towel on top of oil spill, it will absorb some of the oil due to its hydrophilic nature (it has affinity for water). However, there may still be some residue left behind from the oil that can stick to the surface. This is because oil can form a thin film on surfaces, known as ""adhesive force"" or ""wetting angle"", which makes it difficult for liquids to penetrate or spread evenly. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A is more likely. The woman will add her own page numbers to the book instead of reading it again. This is because she wants to keep track of her progress in the book and not start over from the beginning.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (個男人望出窗外) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the man is looking outside the window, which aligns with the context of a plane encountering turbulence. Option A (個男人緊緊咗安全帶) does not provide any relevant information about the situation and seems out of place in this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""呢個男仔咗,"" it is more likely that option B is correct, i.e., ""個女仔咗佢."" The use of the word ""咗"" (hēi) in the premise suggests a past tense action, which aligns with Option B's interpretation of a woman having taken something from the man."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (佢哋截肢咗佢隻腳) is the correct answer. The phrase ""人工肢體"" in the premise suggests that a prosthetic limb was created for the patient, which aligns with option A. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of any medical equipment or devices being used to observe the patient's life."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (佢對佢咗肩) is more likely. The phrase ""佢對佢咗肩"" implies that the man is embracing or hugging the woman from behind, which would not cause her to stretch out her arm. Option B (佢將佢嘅手臂拉開咗) suggests that the man is pulling the woman's arm away from him, which would be less likely in this scenario."
"Response:  Option B: 我知道我係啱嘅. 
Explanation: The correct answer is option B because it best fits the context of the premise. ""我知道我係啱嘅"" means ""I know I'm just a friend,"" implying that the speaker recognizes their limited role in their friend's life. This interpretation aligns with the idea that the speaker values their friend's opinion but also acknowledges their subordinate position in the friendship. In contrast, option A suggests an excessive reliance on the friend's opinions, which may not be accurate based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (泥打咗佢個臉) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""踩入泥土"" implies that the person has stepped into mud or mire, which can be difficult to walk through and may cause discomfort or difficulty in movement. It is unlikely for the mud to get stuck on their shoes as they are already sinking in it. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (people hiding underground) is more likely. The phrase ""castle fell how many inches of snow"" suggests a significant amount of snowfall, which could make it difficult or impossible for people to go outside. People may seek shelter in underground locations such as basements or subway tunnels to avoid the harsh weather conditions."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the employee will be threatened with termination (Option B). The phrase ""佢威脅要離職"" implies a sense of urgency and consequences if the employee does not comply, which suggests that the employer is taking a more serious approach to addressing the issue. Option A simply states that the employee has already left work without any implication of negative consequences."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (tree falls onto the roof) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I will use an axe to chop the tree) is more likely. The phrase ""tree trunk"" suggests a larger, thicker tree that would require an axe to cut through, rather than simply stacking it on top of another tree."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the couple announces they want to separate) is the correct answer. The phrase ""家庭祝咗呢對夫婦"" suggests a happy or joyful occasion related to the family, but the use of the word ""宣布"" (announce) implies a sudden or unexpected change in the relationship. Therefore, it is more likely that the couple will be separating rather than having a secret affair."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢好鍾意佢) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""好鍾意"" (good interest) suggests that the woman has a strong feeling towards the man, which aligns with the idea of sending a love letter as a romantic gesture. Option B (""佢吻咗佢"") does not convey the same level of intensity or emotional investment in the relationship."
"Response:  Option A: 我真係好困惑 (I am really confused)
Explanation: The speaker seems to be struggling with understanding their friend's perspective, indicating that they are genuinely perplexed by it. This aligns better with option A, as the speaker is expressing confusion rather than agreement or disagreement."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢哋想搵一個妥协嘅方法) is more likely. The phrase "" LEFT ONE COIN"" suggests that there may be a conflict or disagreement among the group members, and they are looking for a compromise to resolve the issue. This aligns with Option A, where the group members are trying to find a way to reach an agreement. In contrast, Option B does not provide any contextual clues related to finding a compromise or resolution, making it less likely."
Response:  Option B (披薩從烤箱裏面出來) is more likely based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢好努力工作) is more likely. The phrase ""有一個雄心勃勃的目標"" suggests that this woman has a strong determination to achieve her goals, so it is more likely that she will put in effort and hard work to reach them. Option A (""佢放鬆咗"") does not convey the same sense of determination or effort."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢個仔係繼承咗佢財富嘅) is more likely. The rich man's death will lead to his wealth being inherited by his children or other heirs, rather than causing a legal problem.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""呢個女人踩住火焰"", option B is more likely. The smoke will come out of the fire as a result of her stepping on it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (佢嘅駕駛證被咗) is the correct answer. The phrase ""嗰個女人嘅車"" suggests that a woman's car has been involved in an accident, and the fact that her driver's license has been taken away implies that she was at fault or responsible for the accident. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我瞓著就咗鐘"" (I'm sleeping and it's already late), option B is more likely."
"Response:  Option B: 佢嘅家人出席咗記者會  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person's family will attend a press conference rather than the camera angles being directed towards them. The mention of ""family"" suggests that there are people close to the person involved in the situation, and it makes sense for them to be present at a formal event like a press conference to provide support and answer questions from the media."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the water in the bathtub warms up) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢加入咗一個同學會) is more likely. The protagonist wants to see other students in the campus, so joining a student club or organization would be a good way for him to meet new people and socialize. Option B (佢嘅專業係工程) does not provide any information about how the protagonist will encounter other students in the campus.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (I'll pick up my pillow) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""my pillow"" and does not include any mention of a customer room or rearranging furniture, which suggests that the speaker is referring to their own personal belongings rather than someone else's space. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""蜂fly去男仔身邊"", option A (呢個男仔走咗) is more likely. The phrase ""蜂 fly"" implies a sudden movement or action, while ""摘"" (to pluck) suggests a slower and more deliberate motion. Therefore, it is more likely that the bee will suddenly fly away from the man's body rather than slowly plucking a flower."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that she will be sentenced to community service rather than death penalty. This is because the crime of stealing a small amount of money from her boss is considered a minor offense in Hong Kong's legal system, and community service is often imposed as a punishment for such crimes. Therefore, option A (she will be judged and do community service) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (糖份溶咗) is more likely to occur because when sugar is added to hot tea, it will dissolve into the liquid rather than steaming the tea leaves.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢被征召去打仗) is more likely. The phrase ""退伍军人"" suggests that the person in question was a soldier who has been discharged from their military service, implying that they have had some kind of combat experience. Additionally, the use of the word ""著行路"" (to walk along the road) implies that the person is now civilian life, suggesting that they are no longer involved in any kind of military action. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the person may be walking alone on the road."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the criminal will escape from the police rather than being caught. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (“I threw him”) is the correct answer. The speaker mentions that they cannot turn on their laptop, implying that they are the one who has thrown something away, rather than someone else having taken their laptop without permission.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (佢將啲衫折) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""嗰個女人櫃入面冇地方可以匿"" suggests that there are no places for a woman to hide her face or body in public, implying that she may need to find alternative ways to conceal herself. Therefore, option B, which involves folding one's clothes to create a makeshift hiding place, is more plausible than option A, which involves buying a large wardrobe."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (佢老婆生咗個仔) is the correct answer. The phrase ""心碎"" typically implies a sense of sadness or disappointment, which could be caused by the loss of a loved one, such as a child. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's heart is broken due to the death of his child rather than his wife leaving him."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢嘅工作機會被撤銷) is more likely. The man's work opportunities are being taken away, indicating that he may not be able to find a job or advance in his career due to various reasons such as lack of qualifications, age discrimination, etc.
"Response:  Option B: 佢話俾咪話. 
Explanation: The phrase ""佢嘅聲音響成個禮堂都得人聽得明"" suggests that the sound of someone's voice can be amplified to fill a large space, making it audible to many people. This implies that the person speaking has a powerful or projecting voice, rather than simply having good enunciation or pronunciation. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option A (硬幣沉到底部) is more likely to occur based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (球入咗個洞) is more likely. The word ""咗"" in Cantonese means ""to enter"", so it's likely that the ball will enter a hole rather than return to a player."
"Response:  Option B: 我打氣。
Explanation: The premise ""我喺樓吸咗好多塵埃"" implies that there are a lot of dust particles in the air near the speaker's home. This could cause irritation or discomfort for the speaker. Therefore, option B, ""我打氣,"" which means ""I feel annoyed"" or ""I am fed up with something,"" is the most likely response to this situation."
"Response:  Option B: 客人開頭燈. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the customer used a fake bill to pay for the item. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause as it suggests that the customer opened the package to inspect its contents before returning it."
"Response:  Option B - 我唔小心丟咗我買嘢嘅名單.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我將垃圾帶出去,"" it is more likely that the speaker accidentally threw away their shopping list than for the trash to make the house smell bad. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (細路追住啲動物) is more likely. The phrase ""追住"" implies a strong desire to chase after something or someone, which could be interpreted as the children being excited to see the animals at the zoo."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (佢嘅腎臟病發嚴重) is the more likely cause of the man's difficulty breathing. The premise suggests that the man's kidneys are not functioning properly, which could lead to fluid buildup in the lungs and make it difficult for him to breathe. This is a common complication of kidney disease and can be a life-threatening condition if left untreated. Option B (佢嘅肺部因為咁被堵住) does not provide any specific information about the man's medical history or symptoms, making it less likely as the cause of his difficulty breathing.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (I ask my friend if he has any interest in going) is a more likely response than Option A (I ask myself if I have any interest in going). This is because the premise suggests that the speaker is considering inviting someone else to attend the concert with them, rather than simply deciding for themselves whether or not they want to go. Therefore, it makes more sense for the speaker to ask their friend about their interest before making a decision.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (opening the window) is more likely to cool down the room because it allows for airflow from outside to enter the room, which can help lower the temperature inside. Opening a window also allows hot air to escape, which can further contribute to cooling down the room. On the other hand, placing a fan near the door may not have as much of an impact on cooling down the room, especially if the door is far away from where you are trying to cool down.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""呢個男仔個背好痛"" (This guy's back hurts), option B is more likely. The phrase ""背好痛"" implies that the person's back is sore or painful, which could be caused by carrying a heavy backpack. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我買咗我媽咪個禮物"", it is more likely that option A is correct, i.e., the speaker bought a gift for their mother."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (a bee stings a gardener) is more likely to occur than Option B (mice dig up a garden). This is because bees are known to sting when they feel threatened or provoked, while mice do not typically dig up gardens unless they are searching for food or shelter. Therefore, it is more plausible that a bee might sting a person in a garden setting rather than mice digging up the same area.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the fire will be extinguished (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option B is more likely. The passage states that ""the two sides have been at odds for a long time"" and that they are ""determined to find a way out of their impasse."" This suggests that both sides are willing to make concessions and work towards finding a resolution, rather than simply relying on legal arguments in court. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A is true - 佢哋父親已經去世。 This is because there is no indication in the premise that the parents are still alive or that they have abandoned their child. The phrase ""被送去孤兒院"" suggests that the child was sent to an orphanage, which is typically done when a parent is unable or unwilling to care for the child. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the child is now living in an orphanage."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the meteor will cause a tsunami (Option A). The phrase ""落入咗海"" implies that the meteor has fallen into the sea, which would result in a massive wave or tsunami rather than simply falling to the bottom of the ocean."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢好驚) is more likely. The hiker is surprised by the snake's sudden appearance, so they are likely to be startled rather than starting to sweat.
"Response:  Option B (I will put it in). 
Reasoning: The premise ""开始热起嚟"" implies that something has already started to heat up or become active, so option B is a better fit as it suggests that the speaker will continue to add fuel to the fire rather than starting from scratch."
"Response:  Option A - Change. 
Explanation: The premise ""我咗一塊"" (I have a piece) implies that something has been taken or given to someone else, leading to a change in possession. Therefore, option A - Change is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (呢個國家殖民咗呢塊地) is more likely to occur. The country will likely try to colonize the new land instead of giving it up.
"Response:  Option B: 佢落喺一堆衣服上面。
Explanation: Based on the premise ""杯子落咗喺上"", it is more likely that the cup will fall onto a pile of clothes rather than flying in different directions on the floor. The phrase ""落喺"" implies a direct and specific location, suggesting that the cup will land on something or someone, rather than scattered everywhere. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the floor is not level (Option A). The phrase ""個桌子搖咗"" suggests that something is shaking or moving on the table, which could be caused by an uneven surface. Additionally, the phrase ""地板唔平嘅"" implies that the floor is not flat, which would make it difficult to keep a table steady. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The father trusts his child and believes that he will not get into trouble. Therefore, the effect of the child's talk being a success is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he ate too much sugar (Option A). This is because headaches caused by eating too much sugar are relatively common and can be triggered by consuming large amounts of sugary foods or drinks. On the other hand, while aspirin can also cause headaches in some people, it is less likely to cause this specific symptom compared to excessive sugar consumption.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (佢正接近火車站) is the correct answer. The phrase ""佢正接近火車站"" suggests that the train is approaching the station, which means that the train's speed has been reduced. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the train to slow down."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the man's mental illness was caused by his family situation) than option B (he was diagnosed with depression). The premise states that the man had previously undergone psychotherapy, which suggests that he may have been experiencing emotional or psychological distress for some time before seeking treatment. It also mentions that the man's family situation may have contributed to his mental health issues, which further supports the idea that his mental illness was caused by his family environment rather than a formal diagnosis of depression.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (she swallowed her food) is the correct answer. The premise states that she ""捉住咗佢條喉,"" which implies that she had difficulty swallowing something, rather than choking on food. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢個聲音好) is more likely. The speaker's throat pain may affect their voice quality, making it sound hoarse or strained. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the speaker's condition.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (佢開始落嚟) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""佢開始落嚟"" means that something starts to fall or drop, which aligns with the idea of a dog dropping its food on the table. Option A (""我口裡面滴咗水"") does not make sense in this context as it implies that water is coming out of one's mouth, which is not related to the scenario described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢變得有錢) is more likely. The passage suggests that the woman's business has succeeded, implying that she has become wealthy as a result.
"Response:  Option B: 老師畀佢做功課.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""學生離開教室,"" it suggests that the students have left the classroom. Therefore, option B, ""老師畀佢做功課,"" which means ""the teacher assigns homework to them,"" is a more plausible explanation for why the students are not in the classroom."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢嘅知人同佢有關係) is more likely. The fact that the woman has seen a ghost suggests that there may be some kind of connection or relationship between her and the ghost, rather than simply expressing skepticism towards the idea of ghosts existing.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he lost his hearing due to a sudden loud noise (Option A). The premise does not provide any indication of a violent or dangerous incident such as an explosion (Option B), which would be less likely to result in sudden deafness. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the balloon flies up) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man has suffered a heart attack (Option A). The phrase ""lost his voice"" typically implies that the person's vocal cords have been damaged or paralyzed, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as a stroke, brain injury, or respiratory problems like pneumonia or bronchitis. However, a heart attack would also cause sudden loss of speech due to damage to the brain or the nerves responsible for controlling speech. Therefore, Option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (there is a crack in the water pipe) is more likely to be the correct answer. The mention of ""water"" and ""crack"" suggests that there may be a problem with the piping system, rather than someone calling out the woman's name."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the man shoots himself) is more likely to happen. The premise states that the man ""uses a gun to shoot himself into the water,"" indicating that he intentionally takes his own life by shooting himself into the water. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我食咗抗生素"" (I took antibiotics), option A is more likely. The reason is that taking antibiotics can help to kill bacteria or other microorganisms in the body, which may reduce the severity of an infection. However, it's less likely that taking antibiotics would have a direct impact on viruses like the common cold or flu, which are caused by viruses rather than bacteria. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the driver presses down on the car) will occur. The reason is that when a traffic light turns yellow, drivers are expected to slow down and prepare to stop their vehicles. If the driver fails to do so and continues to drive through the intersection at high speed, there is a higher risk of an accident occurring. Therefore, option A is the more plausible outcome in this scenario.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (placing the container in warm water) will cause the plastic to melt than option B (putting the container on fire). This is because melting occurs at a lower temperature when using warm water compared to direct heat from a flame. Therefore, option A has a higher likelihood of causing the plastic to melt.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (司機撞到電話柱) is more likely. The phrase ""有痕"" implies that there is damage or a mark left behind, which is consistent with a car hitting a telephone pole. Option B (司機開紅燈過咗) does not provide any information about damage or marks, and it is less clear how this would result in a car accident."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢通過咗考試) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (佢好驚要學游泳) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the man lives by a water pool, suggesting that he may have easy access to swimming facilities. Therefore, it is more likely that he would want to learn how to swim rather than needing rescue from a lifeguard.
"Response:  Option B: My heartbeat speeds up.
Explanation: The premise ""我將手放喺胸前"" (I will put my hand on my chest) suggests that the speaker is experiencing some kind of physical sensation or emotion, which could be a rapid heartbeat. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (my office space is well-equipped) is more likely to be true. The use of the word ""good"" in this context implies a positive evaluation, suggesting that the speaker's office space is well-equipped with necessary tools and resources. Option B (""my workspace is good"") does not convey as much information or detail about the quality of the speaker's workspace."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (佢哋邀請鄰居嚟食晚餐) is more likely to happen. This is because inviting neighbors over for dinner can help establish a friendly relationship and promote social interaction within the community. It allows them to get to know each other better and build trust, which can lead to a stronger sense of belonging and cohesion among neighbors.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (a swimmer jumps into the water) occurs than option B (a swimmer floats on top of the water). This is because jumping into the water would involve entering the pool from above, whereas floating on top of the water would require the swimmer to be already in the water or for some other external force to lift them up. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the information provided.
"Response:  Option B - 我唔小心撞咗一塊牙. (I didn't bite into a tooth.)
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker bit into something, but did not bite their tongue or any other part of their mouth. Therefore, it is more likely that they bit into an object outside of their mouth, such as a piece of fruit, rather than injuring themselves inside their mouth."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (佢嘅外套嘅拉已經開) is the correct answer. The phrase ""呢個男仔跌倒咗"" implies that the person fell down, and the fact that their pants are unzipped suggests that they may have fallen forward or landed awkwardly, causing their pants to become undone. It is less likely that their shoelaces were open beforehand, as this would not necessarily explain why their pants are unzipped. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢因為噪音而分心) is more likely. The phrase ""戴咗耳塞"" means to wear earplugs or earmuffs, which suggests that the person is trying to block out noise. Therefore, it is more likely that the person is feeling distracted or anxious due to the loud noises around them rather than having an actual physical sensation of something poking into their ears."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (I will put it in the freezer) is a more plausible cause for why you have run out of water again. Freezing water can help preserve its volume, so putting the water bottle in the freezer may prevent it from emptying too quickly. On the other hand, drinking all the water (Option A) would not address the underlying issue of running out of water.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the cover has too many dirty words) is more likely to be the cause of the TV show being banned. The use of profanity or vulgar language in a TV show's cover art may not necessarily affect the content of the show itself, but it could potentially lead to censorship or restrictions on its distribution. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (船員都淹死咗) will occur. The phrase ""啲船墜毀咗"" suggests that the ship has been destroyed or sunk, which would result in all crew members drowning. Option B (船員遇到海盜) implies that the crew may have encountered pirates, but this does not necessarily lead to their deaths. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢解咗個難題) is more likely. The man in the scenario is experiencing difficulty understanding something, which suggests that he has encountered a difficult problem or question. Option B (佢想知道有咩嘢) implies that the man is simply curious about something without any particular difficulty or obstacle.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (個男人接咗電話) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I embraced her) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A is more likely. The group of people leaving the museum suggests that they are not interested in exhibits or artifacts, but rather something else. Therefore, option A, ""They took pictures of each other,"" is a more plausible explanation for their actions."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (my friend supports me) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""我將空气入轮胎"" (I will inflate the tire). This is because inflating the tire with air will make it easier for the car to move forward, rather than changing the tire itself."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (佢爸爸摸住佢嘅額頭) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the tone of the dialogue and the character's personality. The father is depicted as a clueless and inept individual, so it makes sense that he would accidentally touch his daughter's head instead of reading her a story.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""筆冇墨水"" (pen without ink), option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that the speaker has used up all of their ink, making it unlikely for them to have any left over to write with. Option B, however, does not provide any information about the speaker's current supply of ink, so it cannot be inferred whether they have some left or not."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢開始咗自己嘅事業) is more likely. The man's rejection of a loan suggests that he may be taking matters into his own hands by starting his own business to generate income. This aligns with the idea of entrepreneurship as a means of overcoming financial difficulties.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢有水) is more likely to be the cause of the girl not going to school. The premise implies that the girl does not have access to water, which could make it difficult for her to attend school due to personal hygiene reasons or lack of transportation. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation than Option B (佢好鍾意學數學), which suggests that the girl has no interest in mathematics, which is an unlikely reason for her absence from school.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (倒入個洗手盆) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: 我個狗掉咗一塊毛.  
Explanation: The premise ""我掃咗地毯"" implies that something has been swept or cleaned up, suggesting that there may be a mess to clean up. Given this context, it is more likely that the speaker's dog has dropped something (option B) rather than the speaker's friends drinking alcohol (option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (佢將個扔過個房間) is more likely. The phrase ""lost his cool"" implies that the man became angry or upset, which could lead him to throw something across a room."
"Response:  Option A: 枝條燒咗 (The branch will burn)
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the branch will burn when thrown into the fire. The word ""營"" in the premise means ""campfire"", which implies a hot and fierce flame. As a result, the branch will be exposed to intense heat and will likely catch fire and burn. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (熱水已經唔多喇) is more likely to be the cause of the man's discomfort in the bath. The phrase ""熱水已經唔多喇"" suggests that there may not be enough hot water for a long soak, which could make the man uncomfortable or even painful. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (佢哋為學費咗錢) is more likely. The parents are willing to spend money for their children's education, indicating that they prioritize their children's academic success over other activities such as playing outside.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""個男人解開鞋帶,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""佢哋嘅鞋鬆咗"" means ""his shoelaces are loose."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (佢將剩餘食物放喺冰箱度) will happen. The phrase ""個男人食咗一半嘅首菜"" implies that the man has already eaten half of a dish, so he would be unlikely to throw away the remaining food in the fridge. Instead, he might put it back in the fridge for later consumption or share it with someone else."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""我隻腳腫咗"" (My foot is swollen), option B is more likely. The word ""腫"" (swollen) implies that there is fluid accumulation in the foot, which could cause discomfort or pain. Therefore, option B, ""我咗油落去"" (I have oil poured away), is a more plausible outcome as it suggests that the fluid has been drained from the foot. Option A, ""我將冰放上去"" (I will put ice up), does not make sense in this context as ice cannot be used to drain fluid from the foot."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (I heard it in the hallway) is more likely. The speaker is indicating that they heard the conversation from a distance, implying that it occurred in a public area such as a hallway rather than in their own office.
"Response:  Option B: 我睇咗一本雜誌.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""我必須排隊等,"" it is more likely that the speaker will choose to do something else while waiting in line, such as reading a magazine. This option better fits the context of the sentence than sitting down, which would not be practical or comfortable while standing in line."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (果隻停咗喺度) is more likely. The man's gaze towards the plane suggests that he is watching it fly away, rather than stopping in mid-air. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (佢將要死) is the correct answer. The phrase ""呢個男人將遺言寫咗喺紙上"" suggests that the man has written his will, indicating that he is nearing death or at least contemplating mortality. Option B (""佢係個寡婦"") does not fit with this context as it implies that the speaker is a widow, which would be an unlikely scenario given the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the available evidence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢加快步伐) is more likely. The runner will try to speed up in order to catch up with their competitor, rather than giving up and leaving the race.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I think of a solution) is more likely. The premise mentions that the speaker has ""thought about"" or ""pondered"" the problem, indicating that they have been actively considering possible solutions. This suggests that the speaker may have already come up with an idea for how to address the issue, rather than simply asking for opinions from others."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢覺得好开心) is more likely. The phrase ""搖搖嘅"" suggests that the person has experienced something exciting or thrilling, which aligns with feeling happy or delighted rather than scared or frightened."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (佢同佢朋友打賭) is more likely. The man predicts his team's victory and places a bet with his friend, indicating that he has a strong belief in their chances of winning.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (佢將鐘定咗) is more likely. The phrase ""呢個男仔瞓唔到"" suggests that the person in question has fallen asleep without realizing it, which could be due to being tired or bored. Option A aligns better with this idea of someone falling asleep unexpectedly, while option B does not make sense in this context."
