"Response: Б (I poured drain cleaner into it).

Explanation:
The sentence ""The bathroom sink was clogged"" implies that there is a blockage in the sink, which can be caused by various factors such as hair, soap scum, or other debris. Option B, ""I poured drain cleaner into it,"" is more likely to unclog the sink because drain cleaners are specifically designed to dissolve and break up these types of blockages. Turning on the faucet (Option A) may not be effective in unclogging the sink, especially if the blockage is located further down the pipe."

Причината за изборът си е в това, че в предположението се споменава, че steam rose off of the pot of water, което означава, че водата е била на повърхността и е излъчвала пара. Когато се покрие потът с твърдо тяло (в този случай - ковчег), тогава парата не може да излезе от него и така се увеличава температурата на водата до тачка, където водата достига своята максимална течност."

Explanation:
The sentence ""The parking lot of the building was empty"" implies that there were no cars in the parking lot. Therefore, option A is not a plausible answer as it suggests that you parked across the street, which means you would have been able to see the empty parking lot. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that you parked near the entrance, which could be true even if the parking lot was empty. Hence, option B is more likely to be true based on the given premise."

"Response: 1. Option A is more likely.
Reasoning: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the speaker positioned the poster above the door rather than sticking it to the wall or putting tape on its back. This is because the sentence ""The poster stuck to the wall"" implies a physical connection between the poster and the wall, while the other two options do not provide any such implication. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the poster was placed."
"Response: Б - The architect adjusted the plans.

Explanation:
The given premise states that the client approved the architect's plans for the building. This means that the architect had already prepared a design or blueprint for the building and presented it to the client for approval. Therefore, option B (the architect adjusted the plans) is more likely as it suggests that the architect made changes to their original design before presenting it to the client for approval. Option A (the architect constructed the building) does not make sense in this context as it implies that the architect built the entire building without any prior planning or approval from the client."
