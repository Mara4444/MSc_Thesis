Option A is correct because ""They grew tired of arguing"" implies that they were no longer able to resolve their differences through discussion and had reached a point where they could not continue the argument any further. This suggests that they may have been arguing about something important or significant enough to warrant such exhaustion.
On the other hand, option B is also correct because ""They avoided discussing the problem"" implies that they deliberately chose not to talk about it anymore, which could be due to various reasons such as fear of confrontation, lack of interest in resolving the issue, or simply avoidance of conflict. In this case too, there may be an underlying reason why they stopped talking about the problem, which could be more complex than just growing tired of arguing."

"Response:  Based on my analysis, option B is more likely to lead to a successful outcome than option A. Here's why:

Option A involves asking for advice from someone who may not have all the necessary information or expertise to provide effective guidance. This could result in poor decision-making and potentially harmful consequences.
On the other hand, option B involves careful consideration of the problem and coming up with a solution based on one's own knowledge and experience. While this approach may take longer and require more effort, it is more likely to lead to a successful outcome as it allows for a thorough evaluation of the situation and the development of a well-informed plan."
