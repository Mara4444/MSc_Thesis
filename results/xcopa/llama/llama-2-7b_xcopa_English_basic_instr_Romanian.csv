* The sales associate did not accuse the girl of stealing until after they had found each other's lost items. This suggests that the association may have been looking for a reason to suspect the girl of stealing.
* When the sales associate asked if the girl had taken anything else, the girl replied that she only took the purse by mistake. This implies that the girl was honest and did not intend to steal anything.
* If the sales associate had simply helped the girl find her purse without accusing her of stealing, there would be no conflict or misunderstanding between them. However, by accusing the girl of stealing first, the sales associate created an unnecessary confrontation.
Therefore, based on the information given in the scenario, it is more likely that option B (The sales associate helped the girl find the purse she liked) is the correct cause."
