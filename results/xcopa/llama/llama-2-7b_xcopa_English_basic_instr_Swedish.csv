"Response:  Alternativ A: It was fragile. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the item was fragile because bubble wrap is typically used to protect delicate items from damage during shipping. If the item was small, it may not have required as much protection and could have been packaged differently."
Response: 100% (B) I found a weapon.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The termites ate through the wood in the house. 
Explanation:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the termites will eat through the wood in the house rather than disappearing or not being present at all. This is because termites are known to feed on cellulose-based materials such as wood and other organic matter, and they can cause significant damage to structures made of these materials."

B: The baby soiled her diaper."
"Response: 100% (3/3)

The correct answer is Alternative A: ""The audience clapped along to the music."" This is more likely because when a band plays one of its hit songs, it's common for the audience to show enthusiasm by clapping or singing along."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The girl brought the teacher an apple. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the girl brought the teacher an apple as a way of showing appreciation rather than staying after school for detention."
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""Their camp counselor told them a ghost story"", is more likely the cause of their fear because it suggests that someone intentionally scared them with a spooky tale. Toasting marshmallows on the campfire (alternative B) may have been a fun and enjoyable activity for the young campers, but it would not necessarily make them feel scared."
Response: 2 (B) Han got a concussion.
"Response:  Alternativ B: I earned a pay raise. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the reason for the check bouncing is because the writer's bank account was empty (alternative A). This is because a pay raise would typically result in an increase in income, which would leave the writer with a larger balance in their bank account and reduce the likelihood of checks bouncing due to insufficient funds."
Response:  Alternativ A (He deleted the spam) is more likely to happen because it is a direct and simple solution to the problem of an overflowing inbox.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""He was exposed to the disease"", is more likely."

"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: They avoided discussing the problem."
Response:  Alternativ A (She hired a campaign manager) is more likely the cause of her decision to run for public office.
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the correct answer because it better fits the context of the sentence. The man's preparation for cold weather is the main focus, and packing warm clothing is a logical way to prepare for that. Traveling with a big suitcase does not necessarily help him prepare for cold weather, although it could be useful for other reasons such as carrying extra clothes or souvenirs.
Response:  B: He goofed off.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He put goggles over his eyes. 
Ordet ""dust"" i meningen kan syfta på att det var små partiklar som kom i hans ögon, vilket kan ha orsakat vattnet att rinna ur dem. Detta stöter dock mot textens upplysning om att han satte sig vid en damm, där det inte finns några partikler som kan ha hamnat i ögonen. Därför är det mer troligt att han satte sig vid dammen med goggles över ögonen för att skydda sig från regnvatten eller annan nederbörd."

Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the employee fake sick than having any other reason. Therefore, Alternative A ""He had stomach cramps"" is the less likely option and should be eliminated."
Response: 2 (B) She jumped off the diving board.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""It was opening day for the movie"", is more likely the cause of the movie tickets selling out. On opening day, there is typically a high demand for tickets due to excitement and anticipation among fans, which can lead to sellouts. Poor reviews, on the other hand, may not necessarily result in a sellout as some people may still be interested in watching the movie despite negative critical reception."
"Response:  Alternativ B: People complemented him. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that people would complement the man for losing weight rather than isolating him."
Response: 100% av tiderna, Alternativ A (She typed up a letter)
"Response: 100% (3 utfall)
Eftersom det anges att cirkusartisten jugglade medan han satt på en encykel, är det mer troligt att Alternativ A, ""The audience cheered in astonishment"", är korrekt. Detta är för att det anges i fråga att cirkusartisten jugglade under hela sin performance, vilket betyder att publiken hade möjlighet att se honom genom hela showet."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: My friend arrived on time."
"Response: 100% (B) Negotiated a treaty.
Explanation: Developing nuclear weapons would not likely lead to peace, as it would only increase the likelihood of further conflict and escalate the situation. On the other hand, negotiating a treaty is more likely to bring about peace, as it allows for a diplomatic solution that can address the underlying issues causing the conflict."
Response:  Alternativ A: Han blev torr.
Response: 2 (B) She bruised her knee.
Response:  Alternativ A (The balloon popped) is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ A is more likely. 
Explanation: The sentence ""They traveled to a new city"" implies that they have just arrived at their destination, and therefore it is more likely that they would check into their hotel room before doing anything else. Unpacking their suitcases is also a logical thing to do after checking into a hotel room. Going to the airport, on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that they are leaving the city or returning home."
Response:  Alternativ A (The peach bruised) is more likely.
"Response: 100% av rösterna har valt Alternativ A, ""I ate a doughnut""."
"Response: 100% av gångerna (3 utfall)
Eftersom du har valt alternativet ""The door opened"", är det mest sannolika att följden till next event will be ""I entered the room""."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The products were manufactured through child labor. 
Förklaringen till svaret är att boycotten av produkten ledde till en minskad efterfrågan, vilket gjorde det mer lönsamt för företaget att sänka priserna genom att anställa barn till arbete istället för att investera i qualitets kontroll. Detta kan ha lett till att produkterna var av dålig kvalitet, vilket i sin tur ledde till att activisterna organiserades en bojkotts campagin mot produkterna."
"Response: 100% av gångerna valde deltagarna alternativet A, ""A mouse crawled out of the hole"". Detta tyder på att mössen är mer vanliga i våra tankar än dust som kommer ut ur hål i väggarna."

Betydelsefulla informationer:  The passage suggests that the woman is envious of her sister because she believes that her sister is happier than her, which implies that the woman feels unhappy with her own life. This could be due to various reasons such as a lack of fulfillment in her personal relationships or career. Therefore, Alternative B is more likely to be the cause of the woman's envy."
Response: 100% (3 röster)B: Jag bytte min skirt.
Response: 100% av tiderna, Alternativ A (The customer searched his wallet)
Response:  Alternativ A (People gave him change) is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ A: Han missade sina föräldrar. 
Ordet ""missed"" i meningen indikerar att han var sorglös eller ledsen på grund av att han var ifrån sitt hem och sin familj, vilket stöter sig bäst med alternativet A."
Response:  Alternativ A (The pilot navigated away from the storm) is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The leaves turned colors"", is more likely to occur because it is a natural process for trees to shed their leaves in autumn and turn them into various shades of orange, red, yellow, and brown before falling off. This process is a common phenomenon observed in many parts of the world during late fall or early winter. On the other hand, option B, ""The leaves accumulated on the ground,"" may not be as likely to happen as it implies that the leaves did not fall off the tree but instead piled up on the ground, which could be less probable depending on factors such as wind speed, humidity, and temperature."
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - He decided to play a practical joke on his sister.
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - His father stopped the car at a gas station.

"Response:  Alternativ B: She engaged in a protest. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the woman's political views changed as a result of engaging in a protest rather than switching her party affiliation. Protests are often a form of activism and can be an effective way for individuals to express their opinions and bring attention to issues they care about."
"Response:  Alternativ B: I poured drain cleaner into it. 
Explanation: Pouring drain cleaner into a clogged sink is more likely to unclog it than turning on the faucet alone, as drain cleaners are specifically designed to dissolve and break up blockages in pipes."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the cause of the passengers getting off the train.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He sealed the envelope shut. 
Explanation: Based on the context, it is more likely that the man sealed the envelope shut rather than putting a stamp on it. This is because the sentence mentions the man pressing down on the moist flap of the envelope, which suggests that he may have been trying to close or seal it."
"Response:  Alternativ B: They moved to different cities. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the friends lost touch because they moved to different cities. This is supported by the fact that the friends ""lost touch"" and were unable to maintain their friendship despite trying to keep in touch through social media. It is common for friendships to fade away when people move to different locations and are no longer able to see each other regularly."
Response:  Alternativ A (She was fired from her position) is more likely to happen because of the fact that the accountant mismanaged the company's funds, which suggests that she may have been negligent or incompetent in her duties, leading to disciplinary action such as termination.
"Response:  Alternativ B: I wanted to check the time. 
Ordet ""wanted"" i detta fall anger att personen har en intention eller en önskan att göra något, vilket kan indikera att de inte bara lyssnade på klockans tickande utan också tog aktivt steg för att kontrollera tidens flyt. Detta stödjer därmed teorin om att personen i fråga var intresserad av att se hur mycket tid som hade gått sedan de senaste ögonblicket."
"Response: 100% sannolikhet att Alternativ A är korrekt, detta på grund av att ""my hand cramped up"" kan betyda att man skrev med handen istället för att använda en dator eller annan maskinskriven apparat."

"Response:  Alternativ B: She hit the backspace key. 
Explanation:  When the woman hits the backspace key, she will delete the last character or characters entered on the screen. In this case, it is likely that she will delete the incorrect letter ""t"" and replace it with the correct one. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response: 2 (B) She won a contest.
Response:  Alternativ A (It poured overnight) is more likely the cause of the muddy lawn because heavy rain can make the grass slippery and muddy.
"Response: 100% av rösterna har valt alternativet A, ""She stayed the night in a hotel""."
"Response:  Alternativ B: Han went to the beach. 
The man's decision to go to the beach suggests that he wanted to expose himself to direct sunlight, which contradicts the assumption that he put on sunscreen. Therefore, alternative B is more likely."
"Response:  Alternativet A, ""The researchers retracted the theory"", is more likely to occur because it is a common occurrence in scientific research for findings to be disproven or retracted if new evidence emerges that contradicts them. This can happen due to various reasons such as methodological flaws, data errors, or alternative explanations for the observed phenomenon. In contrast, the likelihood of individuals accepting a theory without proper evaluation and verification is higher, especially when the theory aligns with their preexisting beliefs or values. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."

"Response:  Alternativ B: I spilled water on the poster. 
Förklaring:  It is more likely that you spilled water on the poster because it is a common occurrence and can easily happen accidentally, especially when handling something as delicate as a poster. Waiting for the ink to dry may not be a feasible solution if the ink has already smudged."
Response:  Alternativ B: Han vred sig i sömnen.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B. His father lectured him."
Response: 100% av gångerna: Alternativ A (I shouted his name).

B: She wanted to learn about other cultures."
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""His coworker got a promotion"", is more likely the cause of the man's jealousy."
"Response: 
Alternativ A, han var hallucinerande, är mer troligt än Alternativ B, han var meditierand. Det finns inga bevis för att människor kan se eller höra utomstående varelser, och det är vanligt att personer som säger sig ha sett ufoter har påvisats som falska eller psykiskt sjukliga. Meditation kan dock leda till mystiska upplevelser men inte i det här fallet."
Response:  Alternativ A (He put bleach in it) is more likely the cause of the man's hair turning blonde, as bleach is a strong chemical that can lighten hair significantly. Shampoo does not have this effect on hair color.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the artist experienced a stroke of inspiration rather than criticizing their previous work. This is because the passage states that the artist ""created new work,"" which suggests that they were feeling inspired and motivated to create something new, rather than reflecting on and evaluating their existing work."
"Response: 100% av svaren valde alternativet B, ""He was going to college""."
"Response:  Alternativ B: An earthquake shook the bookcase. 
Förklaringen till svaret finns i slutet av testet."
"Response:  Alternativ B, ""I reset the circuit breaker"", is more likely to cause the lights to turn back on because it directly addresses the issue of the power being cut off by resetting the circuit breaker. Option A, ""I turned on a light,"" does not address the underlying issue and may not have any effect on the lights turning back on."
Response: 2 - It looked fun.
"Response:  Alternativ B: I heated it in the microwave. 
Förklaringen:  Heating the bag of popcorn in the microwave is more likely to cause the kernels to pop than pouring butter into the bag, as heat is necessary for the kernels to expand and pop."

Explanation:  Since a tree fell on the power line, it is more likely that the electricity in the neighborhood went out rather than the forecast predicting heavy winds."

Response: 100% (3 röster)B - A drop of blood formed on my finger.
"Response:  Alternativ B: It was dead. 
Förklaringen:  Since the fish was floating on the surface, it had likely died and sunk to the bottom of the tank. This is a more plausible explanation than the fish being hungry, as dead fish do not have the ability to eat."
"Response:  Alternativ A, han had a cold. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the man's hoarse voice was caused by a cold rather than him quitting smoking. There is no mention of any other factors that could have caused his voice to be hoarse, such as allergies or environmental pollutants, which are common causes of a sore throat. Additionally, colds are a common cause of a hoarse voice, and they can last for several days or even weeks. Quitting smoking, on the other hand, may take longer to affect the voice and would not necessarily cause a sudden change in the man's voice."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The elevator got stuck between floors. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the elevator got stuck between floors than arrived at the designated floor. This is because there was no indication of the elevator arriving at a specific floor, only that the doors opened. Additionally, the phrase ""got stuck"" implies that something unexpected happened to prevent the elevator from moving, which is consistent with an elevator getting stuck between floors rather than arriving at a destination."

Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B, ""My chest felt tight,"" is the cause of your shortness of breath. This is because a tight feeling in the chest can be a common symptom of respiratory problems such as asthma or bronchitis, which can cause difficulty breathing. On the other hand, the weather being chilly (Alternative A) may not directly cause shortness of breath."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely the cause of the employees forming a union. Better working conditions are often a key motivation for workers to organize and form a union, as they seek improved safety, fairness, and job satisfaction. While an increase in wages may also be a factor, it is less likely to lead directly to the formation of a union.

Response: 20% (B) She took off her shoes.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""Steam rose off of the pot of water"", is more likely the cause because it describes a physical process that occurs when water is heated and turns into steam. Covering the pot would not produce steam."

Response:  Alternativ A: The storm worsened.
"Response:  Alternativ B, the fire alarm went off. 
Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that the fire alarm went off rather than the elevator stopping functioning. This is because the building was evacuated, which suggests that there may have been a potential danger or emergency situation that required immediate attention. Additionally, the fire alarm is typically designed to alert occupants of a potential fire hazard, and going off in response to smoke or other signs of a fire."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The father kicked his son out of the house. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the father would react negatively to his son's alcoholism by kicking him out of the house rather than buying him a beer."

I texten står det ""The man became annoyed with his friend"" vilket tyder på att han blev irriterad av sin vän, men ingenting om att denne interruerade honom. Därför är Alternativ B, ""His friend bought him lunch"", mer plausibel som orsaken till att mannen blev annoyad."
Response:  Alternativ A (The cashier gave the girl her change).
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""She was paralyzed in an accident"", is more likely to be the cause of the woman's disability because it directly implies that she suffered an injury that left her unable to walk. In contrast, alternative B, ""She entered the hospital in a stretcher"", does not necessarily imply that she was injured and may simply mean that she was transported to the hospital for another reason."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The country was facing economic hardship. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the citizens were hanging the national flag out of a sense of patriotism and solidarity during a time of economic hardship rather than to celebrate the country's independence."

Earthquakes are known to cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially those located in seismically active areas. On the other hand, crime rates increasing may not have a direct impact on the structural integrity of a building."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
Begged her to take him back is the less likely outcome because it implies that he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend and wants to win her back, which may not be a realistic or healthy response to a breakup.

"Response:  Alternativ B: She got a second wind. 
Explanation:  Based on the context, it is more likely that the woman got a second wind rather than a cramp in her side. This is because the passage states that she ""stopped jogging"" and then ""started running again,"" which suggests that she experienced an increase in energy or endurance after pausing. Additionally, there is no mention of any physical discomfort or pain that would indicate a cramp. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the woman started running again."

"Response: 100% (3 röster)

"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B. The boy got soaked."
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The photos turned out blurry"". This is the most likely outcome given that the photographer forgot to use the flash on the camera, which can result in blurry images."

Response:  Alternativ A: I felt energized.
Response: 100% av gångerna: Alternativ A - It soaked up water.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The resort was on an island. 
Förklaringen till detta svar är att om resenärerna tog en ferry till resortet, då var det logiskt att resorten skulle ligga på en ö, istället för i närheten av en ort som inte krävde transport med fartyg."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

This is because cutting out sweets will reduce the overall calorie intake, which can lead to weight loss. While avoiding caffeine may have some benefits for overall health, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on weight loss without other changes in diet and exercise habits.
Response:  Alternativ A: She slid.
Response: 2 (B) She put her son to bed.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The volcano erupted"", is more likely.

Response: 2 (B) She wanted to leave the party.
Response: 100% (3 röster)B: She detained me at the tollbooth.
Response:  Alternativ A (He sold his company stock) is more likely the cause of the executive's financial problems because it suggests that he took deliberate action to sell his shares, potentially for financial gain. In contrast, option B (He squandered his fortune) implies a more careless and reckless approach to managing his finances, which may not have been as intentional or strategic.
"Response: 100% av rösterna har valt alternativet A, ""The doctor was on leave""."
Response: 100% av tiderna, Alternativ A (The house was on fire).
"Response:  Alternativ B: He lathered his hands with soap. 
Ordet ""pruny"" i fråga 1 syftar på att fingrarna blir små och krökta, vilket kan bero på att han har sköljt händerna med soap."
Response:  Alternativ A: The milk tasted sour.
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (I was early to work)
"Response:  Alternativ B: The car got smashed. 
Explanation: Based on the given information, it is more likely that the car will get smashed in a collision between a truck and a car. Therefore, alternative B is the correct answer."

Response:  Alternativ A (He crawled in through an open window) is more likely.
"Response: 100% av gångerna valde deltagarna alternativet A, ""The visitor tapped the knocker on the door"". Detta tyder på att det är mer troligt att en besökare skulle använda knackaren för att signalera sitt uppträde vid dörren istället för att titta genom nyckelhålan."
Response: 100% av tiderna, Alternativ A (He got it dry-cleaned)
Response:  Alternativ A: The toothpaste squirted out of the tube.
"Response:  Alternativ B: Pacifists held a parade. 
Explanation: Holding a parade is more likely to increase support for the peaceful resolution of conflicts than staging a protest, as it promotes a positive message and can be seen as a celebration of peace rather than a condemnation of violence."
Response: 100% av tiderna, Alternativ A (She tied the ribbon)
Response: 2 - He looked younger.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The egg hatched"". This is the more likely cause because it is a natural process that occurs in birds, and there is no evidence to suggest that you had anything to do with it."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Response: 100% - Alternativ B: I shivered.
"Response:  Alternativ B: She made good grades. 
Förklaringen till svaret är att det är mer likely that the student received a scholarship due to their academic achievements (making good grades) rather than because of their classmates' respect for them."

B: She had a crush on him."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: Han had no money."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: I felt lonely."
Response: 100% (B) I slapped him.
"Response:  Alternativ A: The fireworks launched up in the air. 
Förklaringen:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the fireworks launched up in the air rather than the frisbee soaring towards your head. This is because the context of the situation suggests that there was a loud noise and flashes of light, which are consistent with the launching of fireworks into the air, but less likely to be caused by a flying object such as a frisbee heading towards someone's head."
Response: 100% av tiderna, eller 4 av 4 gånger, säger att hon var worryad (alternativ A).
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - It was the beginning of a new month.
"Response: 100% sannolikhet att han filade för divorce. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the husband will file for divorce rather than firing his lawyer. This is because the discovery of an affair typically leads to a breakdown in a marriage and the desire to end the relationship. Firing one's lawyer would not necessarily address this issue or lead to a resolution."
Response:  Alternativ A: The ball bounced. (The ball will likely bounce when it is dropped.)
"Response:  Alternativ B: She erased her answer. 
Explanation: Based on the context, it is more likely that the girl erased her answer rather than guessing at it. The sentence mentions that she made a mistake on her exam, which suggests that she may have written something incorrectly and then tried to cover it up by erasing it."
Response: 100% av gångerna (3 utfall) ledde till att motståndaren tog emot passesen. Detta innebär att Alternativ A är mer troligt.
Response:  Alternativ A (They were ripe) is more likely the cause of why I picked the tomatoes from the vine.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He bought his girlfriend chocolates. 
Explanation:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the man will buy his girlfriend chocolates as a romantic gesture than meet his ex-girlfriend for lunch."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The weather got warmer. 
Förklaringen till svaret är att om temperaturen på en termometer stiger, det betyder att lufttemperaturen har stegnet, inte att man har lagt ner termometern."
Response:  Alternativ A (The roof of the courthouse blew off) is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ A: His grades improved. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the student's grades improved due to his receiving tutoring rather than him cheating on the exam."
"Response: 100% av gissarna valde Alternativ A, ""I knelt down on the ground""."
Response: 100% av gångerna: Alternativ B - It became shiny.

Response:  Alternativ B: The fisherman recasted the line.
Response: 2 (B) She got her braces off.
"Response:  Based on the context, it is more likely that Alternative A (I received good news) is the correct answer. The use of the phrase ""my facial expression lit up"" suggests a positive reaction to something unexpected and joyful, which aligns with the idea of receiving good news."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: My hands were wet."
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The stool wobbled underneath him"", is more likely to be the cause of the man losing his balance."
"Response:  Alternativ B: Their coach cancelled practice. 
Förklaringen:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the team's loss was caused by their coach cancelling practice rather than them directing blame at each other. This is because the text states that they ""directed blame at each other,"" which suggests a lack of cohesion and communication among the team members, rather than a specific event like a cancelled practice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that option A (I regretted my mistake) is the correct answer. The passage states ""I asked for forgiveness,"" which implies that the speaker made a mistake and is seeking forgiveness, rather than achieving their goal."
Response: 2 (B) He talked incessantly about himself.
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - Her dimples showed.
Response: 100% (B) It sailed into the harbor.
Response:  Alternativ B, han steped on broken glass, is the more likely cause of the man's injured foot.
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - They found the weapon at the crime scene.
"Response:  Alternativ B: I asked for a ride. 
Explanation: The sentence ""There was a lot of traffic on the highway"" implies that the speaker is in a situation where they need to get somewhere quickly, and they are unable to drive themselves due to the heavy traffic. Asking for a ride from someone else is a more likely response than taking a detour, as it would be faster and less stressful than trying to find an alternative route."
Response:  Alternativ B is more likely to have occurred in this scenario because it directly addresses the cause of the economic downturn (i.e., job loss) rather than just its symptoms (i.e., illness).
Response: 100% av tiderna, Alternativ A (They were about to walk into oncoming traffic.)
"Response: 100% (3/3)

Answer: 100% (3/3)

Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the woman gave birth to a baby rather than experiencing morning sickness."
"Response: 100% av alla svarsmöjligheter pekar på att Alternativ B, ""It was windy outside"", är den troligaste orsaken till att mannens hat blew away."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Between Alternative A and B, the answer is more likely to be Alternative B: She bought a gift. This is because it is more common for someone to buy a gift for a friend's birthday rather than receiving an invitation to attend the party."
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - His mother took him to the park.
"Response: 100% av rösterna har valt Alternativ A, ""He wanted to impress his date""."
"Response: 100% (B)

I would pick up a shovel because it is more likely that if the electricity in the house shut off, there might be an emergency situation such as a power outage or a natural disaster, and having a shovel could help me to dig my way out of the situation."
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The son graduated from high school"", is more likely the cause of the family moving into a bigger house. As graduating from high school is often seen as an important milestone in a person's life and can lead to increased financial stability and opportunities for further education or employment, it is reasonable to assume that this event could provide the necessary resources for the family to move into a larger home."
"Response: 100% av alla svarsmöjligheter pekar på att Alternativ A, ""She wanted to conserve her energy"", är den troligaste orsaken till att maratonlöparen höll sig vid en långsam tempo."
Response:  Alternativ A (The machine spit out the change) is more likely.
"Response: 
B: I gave him a hug."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Between Alternative A and B, the answer is 100%. This is because option A states that he wrote an IOU, which means he did not pay for the meal immediately, while option B states that he paid with cash, which means he did pay for the meal immediately. Therefore, option B is more likely to be true."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: Han stubbade sitt fot."
Response: 100% sannolikhet att Alternativ A är troligare, förutsatt att mannen kände sig stolt över sin bror. Det finns ingen information i texten som pekar på att brodern kommit i konflikt med föräldrarna eller blivit antagen till juristutbildningen.
Response:  Alternativ A (She went to the library) is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ B: I put tape on the back of the poster. 
Ordet ""put"" i detta fall betyder att placera, inte att sticka. Det innebär att du har lagt en lapp på baksidan av affischen istället för att ha fastställt den på väggen med klist. Därför är orsaken till att affischen står på väggen mer trolig att vara alternativet B."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The architect adjusted the plans. 
Explanation: Since the client approved the architect's plans, it is likely that the architect made some changes or adjustments to the original design in order to meet the client's needs and preferences. Therefore, alternative B is the more likely outcome."
Response: 100% av tiderna, eller 4 av 4 gånger, säger att mans hand var skakande när han drog till sig spaden. Detta innebär att Alternativ A är mer troligt än Alternativ B.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The board of directors found his replacement. 
Explanation:  When a CEO resigns, it is likely that the board of directors will find a replacement rather than dissolving the company. This is because the board of directors has a responsibility to ensure the continuity and success of the organization, and finding a new CEO is an important part of this responsibility. Dissolving the company would not be in line with this goal, as it would result in the loss of the company's assets, employees, and reputation. Therefore, alternative B is more likely to occur in this scenario."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: I approached the podium."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: Han attackade en medfånge."
Response: 100% sannolikhet att Alternativ A (They sold their house) är den troligaste orsaken till att familjen förlorade alla sina ägodelar, eftersom detta innebär att de tidigt tog kontroll över sitt eget hus och dess innehåll innan det brann ner.
Response:  Alternativ A: The can was recycled.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
Betydelsefulla förändringar i texten:
Alternativ A: ""She learned to use a computer"" - This change makes the sentence more specific and relevant to the topic of debating, as using a computer is an important tool for researching and preparing arguments in a debate.
Alternativ B: ""She learned communication skills"" - While communication skills are certainly important for success in any field, they may not be directly related to joining a debate team or participating in debates specifically."
Response: 100% av gångerna: Alternativ A - I listened to music.
Response:  Alternativ A (They fed the homeless) is more likely to have raised the desired amount of money for the charity because feeding the homeless is a tangible and direct way to help people in need, which can inspire others to donate money. In contrast, holding an auction may not be as emotionally impactful or directly beneficial to those in need, which could limit its fundraising potential.
Response: 2 (B) The passengers screamed.
"Response:  Alternativ B: I slammed the door upon leaving the house. 
Eftersom ""slam"" har en kraftig, explosiv klang som ofta associeras med vrede eller ilska, är det mer troligt att personen i fråga slår dörren när de lämnar huset i ett utbrott av vrede än att de kontrollerar posten i fråga."
"Response:  Alternativ B: He got up early. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man got up early in order to watch the sunrise rather than travelling north."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B. The paper creased."
"Response:  Alternativ B is more likely to have the desired effect. 
Explanation: In this scenario, leaders of other countries sending emergency relief is more likely to help alleviate the suffering of the affected population than forming an alliance with them. Emergency relief aid can provide immediate support and assistance to those in need, such as food, water, shelter, and medical care. This type of aid can help save lives and reduce suffering during a natural disaster. On the other hand, forming an alliance may take longer to organize and may not provide immediate relief to those affected by the disaster."
"Response: 2 (B) Fall into the pool.
Explanation: Based on the sentence ""The boy's clothes got soaked,"" it is more likely that he fell into the pool rather than climbing out of it."
Response:  Alternativ A: It was due to be returned to the library.
Response:  Alternativ B: Han var dömd till livstid i fängelse.
Response:  Alternativ A (I opened the curtains) is more likely the cause of the sunlight entering the room.

Bald"
Response: 100% av tiderna, Alternativ A (He found the manuscript compelling)
"Response:  Alternativ B: She realized the card was expired. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the woman realised her credit card had expired rather than that she realised it was missing because there is no indication in the passage that the card was lost or stolen."
"Response: 100% (36/36) av de som tog provet valde Alternativ B, ""They got married"". Detta tyder på att det är mer troligt att mannen och kvinnan gick med i ett äktenskap sedan de fallit i kärlek till varandra."
Response: 1. Alternativ A: I turned up the volume.
"Response: 2 (B) The girl pulled it.
Explanation: Based on the context, it is more likely that the girl pulled the boy's hair rather than ruffling it. Pulling someone's hair can be a common form of playful aggression among children, while ruffling their hair may not have the same level of intensity. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."
"Response:  Alternativ B: I stepped on the bug. 
Bugget got squashed because you stepped on it, not because you sprayed yourself with bug repellent."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: I relaxed."
Response: 1. Asked him to turn it down. (The most likely outcome is that you will ask your neighbor to turn down the music, as this is a more direct and straightforward approach.)
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man's family lived in poverty because he was earning below minimum wage. This suggests that he did not have a high income and therefore could not afford many of life's necessities, leading to poverty for himself and his family."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
Betydelsefulla informationer:  The student is more likely to have taken up a hobby than to have looked for a job after graduating from the university."
Response:  Alternativ A, the paint splattered everywhere.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the reason for changing the topic of conversation is Alternative A: ""I ran out of things to talk about."" This is because the passage states that the speaker had been talking with their friend for a long time and then suddenly changed the subject without any obvious reason. It suggests that the speaker may have simply run out of topics to discuss."
Response: 100% - Alternativ A: I welcomed him back home.
Response:  Alternativ A (The opening scene of the play began) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage (Alternative A). This is because the phrase ""submitted to the kidnapper's mandates"" suggests that the hostage was forced to comply with the kidnapper's demands, which could involve threats of violence if the hostage did not comply. In contrast, Alternative B does not provide any specific evidence of a threat being made to the hostage."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The musician pounded the drum. 
Förklaringen:  Pounding the drum would create a louder and more intense sound than tapping one's foot, which is why it is more likely to cause a reverberation across the stage."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The child was scared to look under her bed. 
Förklaringen:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the child was scared to look under her bed than that she awoke screaming from a nightmare. The sentence ""The parents rushed to their child's bedroom"" suggests that there may have been something frightening in the child's room, and the fact that the child was scared to look under her bed supports this interpretation."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the woman was born deaf rather than being born premature. This is because there is no mention of any medical conditions related to prematurity in the passage, whereas deafness can occur due to genetic factors or exposure to excessive noise during fetal development. Therefore, option B (She was born deaf) is the more plausible explanation for the woman's condition.
Response:  Alternativ A, The water became contaminated, is more likely to occur during a drought. When there is not enough rainfall, the water table can drop, and the soil can become dry and dusty, which can lead to contamination of the water supply.
Response:  Alternativ B: The bird caught a worm.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: She moved to a new town."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The employees went on strike. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, the employees are likely to take collective action and go on strike in order to pressure the factory owner into raising their wages. This is because they have limited individual bargaining power and may not be able to negotiate higher wages with the owner directly. Going on strike is a way for them to demonstrate their strength as a group and bring attention to their demands."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The extremists assassinated him. 
Explanation: Based on the given information, it is more likely that the extremists among the leader's country assassinated him rather than influencing him or being influenced by him. This is because the leader had already antagonized the extremists, which suggests that there was a conflict between them. Therefore, it is more plausible that the extremists took violent action against the leader rather than trying to influence him through peaceful means."
Response:  Alternativ A: Sand stuck to my feet.
Response:  Alternativ A (Jag puttet sweatpants på)
"Response: 100% av gissarna valde alternativet A, ""Her son smirked""."

Based on the information provided, it is more likely that you tripped on the pavement and ripped your jeans than that you zipped them up."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: Hans tänder blev raka."
Response:  Alternativ A (I woke up today with sore muscles) is more likely to occur as a consequence of working out at the gym yesterday.
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - Other students at the lunch table felt left out.
Response:  Alternativ A: She sprung back up into the air.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The post office expedited the letter. 
Explanation:  Since you deposited the letter in the mailbox, it is more likely that the post office expedited the letter rather than delivering it. Expedited delivery typically means that the postal service will prioritize and rush the delivery of a package or letter to ensure timely arrival."
"Response: 100% (3/3)

The correct answer is Alternative A: ""He bet all of his money."" This is the most likely outcome given that the gambler was confident and had no other financial resources to fall back on."
Response:  Alternativ A, the winds became stronger, is more likely to have caused the forest fire to spread.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B. His mother put a bandage on the wound."
"Response: 100% av alla respondenter vände sig till alternativet A, ""He signed his will"". Detta tyder på att de trodde att det mest sannolika scenariot var att mannen skrev sitt testamente innan han överlevde sin dödliga sjukdom."
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - Burnt my tongue.
Response:  Alternativ A (The writer avoided bias in her stories) is more likely because it provides a positive reason for why the editor would fire the writer, rather than simply stating that the writer was fired without explanation.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""I slept all day"", is more likely the cause of your exhaustion because sleeping can help to recharge and refresh the body and mind, leading to increased energy levels. Studying, on the other hand, can be mentally demanding and may lead to feelings of fatigue if done for extended periods of time without breaks."
Response:  Alternativ A (She identified the patient's symptoms) is more likely.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: It felt itchy."
"Response:  Alternativ B: Han suffered a heart attack. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man suffered a heart attack during the emergency surgery rather than losing his temper."
Response:  Alternativ A (He flexed his arms) is more likely the cause of the man's bulging arm muscles. Flexing involves contracting and shortening a muscle, which can lead to increased muscle mass and definition. Rubbing, on the other hand, does not directly affect muscle growth or definition.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: He felt discouraged."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
Betydelsefulla utfall: 25% (7 röster)

I excused my colleague's blunder.

This response suggests that you believe your colleague acted with good intentions, rather than being aware of what they were doing. This is a more empathetic and understanding explanation for their mistake."
Response:  Alternativ A: Han began exercising more. (It is more likely that the man's decision to quit smoking led to him starting to exercise more, as quitting smoking can increase one's energy levels and motivation to engage in physical activity.)
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
Beträffande Alternativ A, ""The attacker's body went lifeless"", kan vi se att detta inte stämmer med texten som angivits i fråga. I texten står det ""punched her attacker in the nose"" vilket innebär att hon anföll sin attackare istället för att han anfallit henne. Därför är det mer troligt att Alternativ B, ""The attacker started to bleed"", är korrekt."
Response:  Alternativ A: The man's aim was off. (The man's aim was not good enough, which is why he missed the target.)
"Response: 100% av gissningarna pekar på att Alternativ A, ""He discovered rats in the basement"", är den mer sannolika orsaken till att en exterminator behöver komma till husägarens hus. Det finns fler tecken på att det finns ratter i huset genom beskrivningen i fråga, som ""basement"" (en del av huset som ofta används för lagring) och ""discovered"" (engelska ordet för ""hitta"")."
Response: 2 - Alternativ B: My houseguest overstayed her welcome.
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - She got a new diary.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: She quit her job."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: He patted the puppy's head."
Response:  Alternativ B is more likely to have the desired effect. Offering a survey to customers will allow the company to gather valuable feedback and insights into their satisfaction levels, which can be used to improve their products or services. On the other hand, offering a discount to new customers may not necessarily lead to an increase in overall customer satisfaction.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The boy dragged a chair across the floor. 
Ordet ""dragged"" i detta fall anger att handlingen var en aktiv, medvetet genomförd handling, vilket gör att det troligaste orsaken till skador på golvet är att han drog stolen över golvet."
Response: 100% (B) My enemy cocked a fist.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""It was struck by lightning"", is more likely the cause of the statue's destruction because lightning strikes can be unpredictable and can cause significant damage to structures and objects. While people may come to venerate a statue, it is unlikely that they would do so in such a destructive manner."
"Response:  Alternativ B: Flies swarmed the fruit. 
Explanation:  In this scenario, it is more likely that flies will swarm the fruit because leaving the fruit out on a table in a warm and humid environment will attract insects such as flies. Shedding of seeds by the fruit is less likely to occur under these conditions."
Response: 2 (She twisted her ankle)
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Between Alternative A and B, option B is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why the child's shoelaces came undone. Running around on the playground can cause the laces to become loose or come undone due to the physical activity involved. On the other hand, learning how to tie one's shoes is not directly related to the laces coming undone in this scenario. Therefore, option B is the better answer."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: Lost track of time"
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""His parents influenced him"", is more likely the cause because it suggests that the man's beliefs were shaped by his upbringing and exposure to his parents' ideas, rather than their disownment of him."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The driver fell asleep. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that the car stopped due to the driver falling asleep rather than running out of gas. There is no indication in the passage that the car was low on fuel, and the fact that it ""gradually slowed to a stop"" suggests that the driver's fatigue was the cause of the vehicle coming to a halt."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The ice cream dripped from the cone. 
Explanation: In this sentence, ""the man ate the ice cream in the sun"" implies that the ice cream is melting due to the heat of the sun. Therefore, alternative B, ""The ice cream dripped from the cone,"" is more likely to occur as the melted ice cream will drip down from the cone."
"Response: 100% av gissarna valde Alternativ A, ""The carpet looked dirty""."
Response: 100%: Alternativ A - I had a headache.
"Response: 100% av gångerna valde deltagarna alternativet A, ""The owner scolded the puppy"". Detta tyder på att människor oftare associerar skam med straff än belöningar."
Response:  Alternativ A: My friend forgave me.
"Response: 100% av alla svarsmöjligheter pekar på att Alternativ B, ""He wore a neon vest"", är den mer sannolika orsaken till att han stod ut i folkmassan. En person som bär en neonvests kan vara mer synlig och utsatt för uppmärksamhet än en person som bär en vanlig ryggsäck."
"Response: 100%
Risk:  Low

This question is designed to test your ability to recognize the consequences of a lie told under oath in a court of law. Alternative A, ""He completed his testimony,"" is incorrect because if the witness lied under oath, they would likely be charged with perjury and their testimony would not be considered complete. Therefore, the correct answer is Alternative B, ""He was charged with perjury."" This question carries a low risk level because it is based on a common legal concept that you may have learned in school or through other sources."

Response:  Alternativ A: The sun blinded me.
Response:  B: I yawned.
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The knife was dull""."
Response:  Alternativ A (She received alimony payment) is more likely the cause of her financial difficulties because it suggests that she was receiving financial support from her ex-husband, which could have helped alleviate some of her debt and financial stress. In contrast, alternative B (She acquired massive debt) implies that she accumulated a large amount of debt on her own, which may be less likely given the context of the situation.
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (I wondered if he was out)
"Response: 100% av personerna valde alternativet B, ""I picked up the flower's scent""."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
Betydelsefulla informationer:  The passage suggests that the woman is feeling nostalgic, which means she is experiencing a sentimental longing for the past. This could be due to various reasons such as running into an old friend or being reminded of happy memories from the past. However, it is also possible that the woman is feeling frustrated or angry with something in the present moment, which could cause her to feel nostalgic. Therefore, both alternatives are plausible causes for the woman's nostalgia."
"Response:  Alternativ B: Han submitted the paper incomplete. 
Explanation:  Procrastination often leads to incomplete work, as the student may not have had enough time to complete the assignment properly. Therefore, it is more likely that the student submitted the paper incomplete rather than early."

Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the reason for discarding the note was that it was anonymous (alternativ A).
"Response: 100% av gångerna (25 utfall)

Eftersom det anges att ""the bird flapped its wings"", som innebär att den flygande fågelens vingar slogs samman för att starta flykten, är det mer troligt att Alternativet A ""It laid eggs"" är felaktat. Detta på grund av att en flygande fågel inte lägger ägg, utan istället har ungarna i sitt bo. Därför är Alternativet B ""It ascended upwards"" mest troligt valt."
"Response: 100% av gissningarna pekar på att Alternativ A, ""The garage was open"", är den troligaste orsaken till att du inte hittade bilen i framsidan."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The victim put his hands up. 
Explanation: In this scenario, the victim's actions are more likely to have a positive impact on the outcome than the criminal's actions. By putting their hands up, the victim is signaling that they do not pose a threat and may be able to defuse the situation. This is more effective than the criminal aiming the gun at their victim, which increases the likelihood of harm or injury. Therefore, alternative B is the most likely outcome in this scenario."
"Response:  Alternativ B: I planned to attend my friend's wedding. 
Förklaringen:  The sentence ""I looked forward to the weekend"" implies that the speaker is looking forward to something enjoyable or exciting, which is more likely to be a social event like a wedding than a somber occasion like a funeral."
"Response: 100% (3/3)

Answer: The answer is Alternative B - I was nauseous.

Explanation:
The sentence ""I lost track of time"" does not provide any information about the speaker's physical state, and therefore cannot be used to determine which alternative is more likely. On the other hand, the phrase ""I was nauseous"" suggests that the speaker may have been feeling unwell, which could explain why they were unable to keep track of time. Therefore, Alternative B is the more likely explanation for the given sentence."

"Response: 100% av gångerna: Alternativ A - ""I valued his opinion""."
Response:  Alternativ A: The mud stuck to his shoes.
"Response:  Alternativ A (Schools shut down) is more likely. 
Explanation:  In a small town, the closure of schools due to heavy snowfall is a common occurrence and can be easily predicted based on the weather conditions. On the other hand, hiding underground may not be a feasible or safe option for people in a small town, especially if there are no suitable underground structures available. Therefore, alternative A is more likely to occur than alternative B."
"Response: 100% (3/3) av de frågade personerna valde alternativet A, ""He went home for the day""."
Response:  Alternativ A (The tree fell onto the roof) is more likely.

"Response:  Alternativ B (The man took the pizza out of the oven). 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man took the pizza out of the oven because this action follows logically from the fact that the timer in the kitchen went off. Unloading the groceries into the refrigerator does not necessarily follow from this event."
Response: 20% (B) She worked hard.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the wealthy man's son inherited his fortune rather than getting into legal trouble. Therefore, the answer is option B."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B. Smoke arose from the flames."
"Response:  Alternativ B: She got in a car accident. 
This is the more likely cause because it provides a specific and plausible reason for why the woman's car was in the shop, which is that she got into an accident. Getting one's driver's license revoked is not as directly related to the woman's car being in the shop, and may be seen as less of a probable cause."

"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B. His family attended the press conference."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The bathwater drained out of the tub. 
Explanation: Based on the given information, it is more likely that the bathwater drained out of the tub than that it became lukewarm. The passage states that the woman ""lingered"" in the bathtub, which suggests that she was relaxing and enjoying her time there. It is unlikely that she would have noticed a change in the temperature of the water without realizing it, especially since she did not get out of the tub until after the water had drained out. Therefore, alternative B is the most plausible outcome."
Response:  Alternativ A (He joined a fraternity) is more likely to help the college student meet other students on campus because joining a fraternity provides opportunities for socializing and networking with other members, which can lead to meeting new people and making friends.

Detta alternativa stämmer överens med texten, som talar om en veteran som gick med en limp, vilket kan tyda på att han skadades under stridigheter i kriget. Därför är Alternativ B mer troligt än Alternativ A.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The police chased the criminal. 
Because it is more likely that the police would chase a criminal who has run away, rather than attending to the victim."
Response:  Alternativ A (Jag drog det) is more likely the cause of the problem because if you had accidentally charged it, it would still be possible to turn it on even though it was not fully charged.
Response: 2 - She folded her laundry.

"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: I sneezed."
Response:  Alternativ A (The customer used counterfeit money) is the more likely cause because it is a serious offense that could result in criminal charges, whereas leaving one's headlights on is a minor traffic violation.
"Response:  Alternativ B, ""I accidentally threw away my shopping list"", is more likely the cause of the problem because it provides a specific and plausible reason for why the garbage might have been taken out. It also suggests that the speaker may have been in a hurry or distracted when taking out the trash, which could explain why they forgot their shopping list. In contrast, alternative A does not provide any clear explanation for why the garbage might have caused the kitchen to smell bad."
Response:  Alternativ A (The children admired the animals) is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ B: His lungs were congested. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man's loud breathing was caused by his lungs being congested rather than his kidneys failing. Congestion in the lungs can cause difficulty breathing and lead to a distinctive sound when breathing, while failure of the kidneys would not typically affect breathing sounds."
"Response:  Alternativ B: I asked my friend if he was interested in going. 
Bakgrunden:  You have a spare ticket for a concert and you want to find someone who wants to go with you. 
Forutsättning:  My friend is also interested in attending the concert. 
Effekt:  Your friend agrees to go to the concert with you."

Risk:  Low

This question is designed to test your ability to make predictions based on a given scenario, and to evaluate whether you are likely to choose an option that leads to a logical conclusion. In this case, the scenario describes a situation where a country discovers new land, and you are asked to predict which of two alternatives (A or B) is more likely to occur as a result.

The correct answer is Alternative B: The country colonizes the land. This is because discovering new land typically leads to its exploration and settlement by the discovering nation, rather than abandonment or no action at all. Colonization is a common outcome when a country encounters new territory, especially if it is strategically located or has valuable resources."
Response:  Alternativ A (It shattered all over the floor) is more likely.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The floor was slippery. 
The table wobbled because the floor was slippery, making it difficult for the table to remain stable."
Response: 100% av gångerna, Alternativ A (His son confessed the truth).
"Response:  Alternativ B: Han took aspirin. 
Explanation: Aspirin is a common over-the-counter medication used to relieve headaches and other types of pain. It is more likely that the man would have taken aspirin than cough syrup, especially if he was experiencing a severe headache."
Response:  Alternativ B: It was running behind schedule.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He was diagnosed with depression. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man was diagnosed with depression rather than mental illness running in his family. Depression is a common mental health disorder that can affect anyone regardless of their family history. While mental illness can run in families, there are many other factors that can contribute to developing depression, including trauma, stress, and brain chemistry imbalances."

B: She choked on her food."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
B: She spoke with an accent."
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (It drooled)
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Between Alternative A and B, the most likely outcome is Alternative B - She became wealthy. This is because the passage states that the woman's business succeeded, which implies that she was able to generate profits and become successful in her venture. It does not mention anything about firing employees, so it is less likely that this would be the consequence of her success. Therefore, Alternative B is the more probable outcome."
"Response: 100% av tidigt utfallena i detta fall är att ""The bell rang"". Detta är baserat på att ""The students exited the classroom"" bara kan ske om ""The bell rang""."
Response: 40% av de frågade sa att Alternativ A (Her acquaintances expressed skepticism) var mer likely.
Response:  Alternativ A (He nearly drowned in the ocean) is more likely.

"Response: 100% av tidigt testtagna personer valde alternativet A, ""The lifeguard jumped in after him""."
"Response: 100% (3/3) av deltagarna valde Alternativ A, ""My infection cleared up""."
Response:  Alternativ A (The driver pushed the brake) is more likely to be the correct answer because it is a safer and more responsible action than honking the horn in this situation.
"Response:  Alternativ B: I placed the container on the hot stove. 
Ordet ""placed"" i detta fall betyder att man placerade kontainern på en hett ugnsplatta, vilket kan ha lett till att plasten smält."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The driver ran a red light. 
Förklaringen:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the driver ran a red light than hit a telephone pole. Running a red light is a common cause of accidents, and it does not require any special circumstances to occur. On the other hand, hitting a telephone pole is less common and would typically require a specific set of circumstances, such as driving off the road or into a utility pole."
Response: 2. Alternativ B: Han passade provet. (The boy studied all night, so he is likely to have passed the exam.)
"Response:  Alternativ B: The lifeguard was on duty. 
Förklaringen till detta svar är att ""the lifeguard was on duty"" är en mer plausibel orsaker för att han klingade vid ledningen av poolen än ""han feared learning to swim"". Det finns ingen anledning att tro att han var rädd att lerna simma, men det finns stor sannolikhet att han höll sig fast i ledningen på grund av att han inte kunde simma."
Response:  Alternativ A: I felt my heartbeat.
"Response:  Alternativ B: My office was noisy. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the noise from the construction of the building adjacent to your office caused a disturbance in your work environment than any other factor mentioned in alternative A. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Alternativ A: The family invited the neighbors over for dinner. 
Explanation: Inviting the neighbors over for dinner is a more proactive and personal way of getting to know them compared to simply waving from the yard, which may not be as effective in initiating a conversation or building relationships."
Response:  Alternativ A (The swimmer dove into the pool) is more likely the cause of the water splashing up from the pool because when a person dives into the water, they create a sudden and forceful movement that can cause waves to form on the surface of the water. This is more likely to result in water splashing up than floating in the pool.
"Response: 100% (3 röster)
Beträffande Alternativ A: ""I accidentally swallowed a seed.""
Eftersom du har angivit att du satte ena munnen i en bit av vattenmelonen, det är mer troligt att du också svårligen swallowade frön. Det finns ingen anledning att tro att du skadade tanden på grund av detta. Därför är Alternativ A den mest sannolika resulaten."

"Response: 100% av rösterna har valt Alternativ A, ""She was distracted by noise""."

B. My friend stood up for me."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to have caused the tire to inflate than alternative B because pumping air into a flat tire will increase its pressure, making it less likely to be flat again soon afterward. Switching gears on the bike would not affect the tire's pressure and therefore is unlikely to cause the tire to inflate.
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - Her father felt her forehead.
Response: 100% av gångerna: Alternativ B (I signed my name).
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""He was in debt"", is more likely the cause of the man's denial for a loan."

B: Han threw a chair across the room."
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - The fire went out.
"Response:  Alternativ B: Han couldn't find a towel. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man didn't have a towel available after getting out of the shower than that the hot water ran out (alternative A)."
"Response:  Alternativ A is more likely. 
Explanation:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the parents set aside a savings fund for tuition than they encouraged their children to play outside. This is because going to college typically requires financial support and saving money for tuition is a common way to prepare for this expense. Playing outside may not have the same direct connection to attending college."
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The shoes loosened"", is more likely the correct answer because it better fits the context of the sentence and the meaning of the verb ""unlace""."
"Response: 100% av alla respondenter vände sig till Alternativ A, ""He refrigerated the leftovers"". Detta tyder på att många föreställer sig att mannen lagrade resterna i kylen istället för att spara receptet."
"Response:  Alternativ A: I put ice on it. 
Eftersom icing kan minska inflammation och reducera svullenhet, detta är den mest sannolika lösningen."
Response: 100% (3 röster)B - I overheard the conversation in the hall.
Response: 1) I took a seat.
"Response: 100% av gångerna (3 utfall)

The answer is option B, ""The fly stayed still"". In this scenario, it is more likely that the fly will stay still rather than buzzing away because the man is trying to swat it with a newspaper, which suggests that he wants to catch or eliminate the fly. Therefore, the fly would be less likely to move away and more likely to remain still in order to avoid being caught."
Response: 100% av tiderna, Alternativ A: Han var död.
Response: 2) He sped up his pace.
Response:  Based on my previous experience and knowledge, I believe that Alternative B is more likely to occur. This is because I have been able to come up with solutions to similar problems in the past, and I am confident in my ability to do so again. Additionally, asking for advice from others may not be as effective or efficient as coming up with a solution on one's own.
"Response:  Alternativ B: Han felt ecstatic. 
Explanation:  The sentence ""The traveler walked on the shaky suspension bridge"" implies that the traveler is in a dangerous situation, and it is more likely that he would feel terrified rather than ecstatic."
"Response: 100% (3 röster)

Betting on the outcome of a sports event is not something that I would do, and it is also illegal in many places. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 100% av gångerna (3 utfall)
