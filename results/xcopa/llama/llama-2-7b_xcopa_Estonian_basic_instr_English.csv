"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma leidsin pileti tüki) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tähendamine"" suggests that something has been done or taken away from someone, so it's unlikely that the person would simply forget their own task. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Termiidid kadusid majast) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sisse"" in the premise suggests that something is happening inside or within the subject, which aligns with the meaning of ""kadusid"" (to swallow). Therefore, it is more likely that the termites will eat through the wood from inside rather than outside."
"Response:  Option B - Piirikontroll süüdis (The district controller will supervise).
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the district controller will supervise the construction of the road rather than controlling the passage. The phrase ""piirikontroll kontrollis"" suggests that the district controller has control over something, but the wording does not imply direct control over people or objects. Therefore, option B is a better fit for the given context."
Response:  Option A: Oli puhkus.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tüdrukul sai energia otsa,"" option A is more likely. The word ""sa"" in this context suggests that something was done to obtain or create energy, so it's more likely that the person used a method like ""mängis kabet"" (to gather energy) rather than ""hüppas hüppenööriga"" (to make something spin rapidly)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (More people are joining the chaos) is more likely. The premise suggests that there is already a lot of chaos present, and now more people are joining in, making it even worse. This aligns with Option A, as it implies an increase in the number of individuals contributing to the chaos.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tüdruk hoidis oma nina kinni,"" option A is more likely. The word ""hoidis"" implies that someone is taking care of or watching over something, which aligns with the idea of a parent caring for their child. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Publik plaksutas muusikaga kaasa) is more likely. The word ""plaksutas"" in this context means to play or perform music loudly, so it's likely that the public will hear the band playing their music rather than just listening to it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tüdruk jäeti peale tunde) is more likely. The phrase ""tünde peale"" means ""to stay behind,"" so it's possible that Tüdruk stayed behind or was left behind by the teacher. Option B (Tüdruk tõi õpetajale õuna) doesn't fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Laagrivanem rääkis neile õudusjuttu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Väikesed matkajad olid hirmul"" suggests that something significant or unusual has happened to a group of travelers, and the option chosen implies that they were attacked by bandits while on their journey. This fits with the context of the sentence and provides a plausible explanation for why the travelers are in this situation. In contrast, Option B (""Nad grillisid lõkkel vahukomme"") does not provide any clear reason as to why the travelers would be in danger, making it less likely as an explanation for their predicament."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees lõi pea ära,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""lõi"" means ""to eat,"" so it's likely that Mees ate something spicy. Therefore, option A is correct: ""Tal läks mõte sassi."""
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (My account was empty) is more likely to be the cause of the problem.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta kustutas rämpsposti) is more likely. The sentence ""Mehe e-postkast oli rämpsposti"" implies that the email was hacked or compromised, and therefore it's more likely that the sender would want to cancel the account rather than change the password."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Meremees pandi karantiini,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta puutus haigusega kokku"" (The meremees are causing a disturbance in the kitchen) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta luges seda endale ette) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tudruk jättis koodi"" means ""to put a code in,"" so it's likely that the speaker wants to say something like ""put the code in the end."" Option B (""ta unustas selle üles"") doesn't make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma valasin vett klaasi,"" option A is more likely. The word ""klaasi"" means to boil or steam, so it's likely that the water will start to boil. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta tahtis oma sõpra toetada) is more likely as it implies that Mees had a clear intention or plan to escape, whereas option B (Ta mõtles oma sõbra sõnadele) suggests that Mees was simply daydreaming or fantasizing about escaping without any concrete action being taken.
Response:  Option B - Ma esitasin süüdisute.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Kett oli kummi ümber mässitud) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""kett lagunes tükkideks"" suggests that Kett's legs were swollen, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as injury or illness. However, the option ""ketis oli katkine lüli"" does not provide any context or information to suggest why Kett's legs might be swollen, making it less plausible as a cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Nad väsisid vaidlemisest) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""vaidlemis"" means ""to compromise,"" so it suggests that the speaker may have compromised their own desires or values in order to avoid conflict. This aligns with the idea that the speaker may have sacrificed their own needs for the sake of peace. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ta tunnistas kohtus) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ta reisis suure kohvriga) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker will travel to a different country, implying a longer journey than just packing lightly for a short trip within their own country.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ta viilis) is more likely. The phrase ""viilis"" means ""to give up"" or ""to surrender,"" so it suggests that the person will stop resisting or opposing something. This aligns with the idea of giving in to temptation or indulging in a forbidden pleasure. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Talle läks tolm silma) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is expressing a personal opinion or belief, rather than describing an objective fact. Therefore, option A is the better fit for this prompt.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vastane süüdis teda sohitegemises) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""vastane süüdis"" means ""to be in a state of confusion,"" and ""sohitegemises"" means ""to lose one's mind."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person will become confused and lose their mind rather than simply being unable to remember anything (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta tabas õpilase spikerdamast) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""spikeredamast"" suggests that the teacher's words have been twisted or distorted in some way, which could indicate a language barrier or difficulty with communication. This is supported by the fact that the students are unable to understand their teacher's explanations, even though they are trying hard. Therefore, it is more likely that there is an issue with the teacher's ability to communicate effectively rather than the students not wanting to learn."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma tegin pausi, et rääkimine lõpetada,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""ma tegin"" means ""I will make"" or ""I am going to make,"" indicating that the speaker intends to take action to prevent something from happening. Option B, ""Mul sai õhk otsa,"" means ""You have a headache,"" which does not align with the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ma panin selle mikrolaineahju) is more likely. The sentence ""Külmutatud toit sulas üles"" suggests that something has fallen or landed on top of a roof, and the phrase ""mikrolaineahju"" specifically refers to food debris or trash. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the mess on the roof is due to someone throwing their lunch or dinner leftovers up there rather than a broken plastic bag blowing onto the roof."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tal olid kõhukrambid) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence ""Töötaja teeskles haigust"" suggests that there are many tasks or responsibilities that need to be completed urgently, which could lead to feeling overwhelmed and unable to focus. It is less likely that the person simply wants a day off without any work-related tasks (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tüdruk maandus basseinis,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""ta jooksis basseini tekil"" means ""the moon has a big belly."" This suggests that the speaker thinks the moon looks larger than usual, which could be due to various reasons such as atmospheric conditions or lunar cycles. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Film sai kehvad arvustused) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B - Inimesed tegid talle komplimente. The phrase ""Mees võttis kaalust alla"" implies that someone has fallen into a difficult situation, and option B suggests that they are receiving compliments from others as a way of trying to lift their spirits."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tüdruku käed läksid villi,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""käed läksid villi"" means ""became angry quickly,"" so it is likely that the person in question became angry at something or someone. Option B, ""Ta ronis köit mööda üles,"" translates to ""Took a lot of effort to get upset,"" which aligns with the idea of becoming angry quickly. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Akrobat kiikus trapetsil) is more likely to be the chosen effect. The word ""trapetsil"" in Estonian means acrobatics or aerial arts, which aligns with the idea of a performer using their body to create an illusion of levitation. Therefore, it is more likely that the artist will choose this option rather than public hoaxing."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ootasin oma sõbra järel) is the more likely cause. The premise suggests that something has been taken from someone's possession without their permission, which implies a forceful act of taking rather than a natural process like growth or development. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sõdivad riigid tahtsid rahu,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that something has been taken away from the country, implying a loss or decline in power or resources. Therefore, it is less likely that nothing has happened to the country (Option B)."
"Response:  Option B: Tal tõusis palavik. 
Explanation: The premise ""Mees võttis unerohtu"" implies that something unexpected has happened to the speaker, causing them to feel confused or disoriented. In this situation, it is more likely that the speaker will experience a sense of unease or anxiety, rather than feeling motivated to take action (Option A). Therefore, Option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Diivanijalg tuli lahti) is more likely to occur. The word ""lahti"" means ""cove"" or ""bay"", so it suggests that the ship may have run aground in a small, sheltered area of water. This is consistent with the idea of the ship being stranded due to bad weather or other navigational issues. Option B (Tai sai põlvele sinika) does not fit as well with the premise, as ""põlvele"" means ""in the sky"" and would suggest that the person saw something flying overhead, rather than a ship becoming stranded."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poiss pigistas õhupalli,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""poiss pigistas"" means ""there are many possibilities,"" indicating that there are multiple outcomes or effects that could occur. Option A, ""Õhupallläks katki,"" translates to ""The ball bounces off,"" which suggests a specific outcome of the ball hitting something and bouncing away. Therefore, option A is more likely given the context of the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Nad läksid lennujaama) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma võtsin virsikust ampsu,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ampsu"" implies a strong desire or craving for something, so it's likely that the person will get what they want, which in this case is the virsik (a type of fruit). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mu käed hakkasid kleepuma,"" option A is more likely. The word ""hakkasid"" implies a deliberate action, suggesting that someone intentionally caused the damage to the car. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma lükkasin ust,"" option A is more likely. The word ""lükkas"" means to be sad or depressed, so it's likely that the speaker will feel down if they are alone without any distractions. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (tooted testiti kvaliteedi tagamiseks) is a more plausible cause for the activists' boycott. The phrase ""testiti kvaliteedi tagamiseks"" suggests that the activists are protesting against the quality of the products being sold rather than just the fact that they were made by a certain company. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma puurisin seina augu"" (My mother will make me eat Augu), option A is more likely. The use of the word ""ma"" (my) suggests that the speaker's mother is involved in the situation, making it more likely that she would be the one to force them to eat something they don't want to."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta õde oli õnnelik) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tundis oma"" suggests that something unexpected or unpredictable happened to the person, which aligns with the meaning of ""õnnelik"". Therefore, it is more likely that the person experienced an unexpected event rather than a deliberate action (lahutas)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur - ""Ma vahetasin särki"". The word ""vahetas"" means ""to break"", so it suggests that the speaker's arm may break if they try to hold onto something too tightly."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ostja ulatas talle raha) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ulatas talle raha"" suggests that money has been taken from someone's account without their permission, which could be a result of hacking or other forms of cybercrime. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Inimesed andsid talle peenraha) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""erutas rahvast"" suggests that something has been taken away from the people, which could be interpreted as a loss or deprivation of resources. This aligns with the idea of inimesed (deprivation) and talle peenraha (taken away). Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ta igatses oma vanemaid) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Väike poiss nuttis"" suggests that something small or insignificant has happened, while ""oma lapsehoidjale"" implies a personal problem or issue. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker might try to downplay the situation by saying they had just eaten their own vomit, which would be an absurd and unlikely scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Piloot sõitis läbi tormi) is more likely. The word ""sõitis"" in Estonian means ""to navigate through something"", so it's more likely that the pilot would navigate through the storm rather than avoiding it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Puu heitis oma lehed,"" Option A: Lehed muutsid värvi is more likely. The word ""muuts"" means to change or transform, so it suggests that something has changed in the person's life. This is a common theme in Estonian folklore, where people are often transformed into animals or other beings as punishment for their misdeeds. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta otsustas oma õega kaardimängu mängida) is more likely. The phrase ""üleannetus tujus"" suggests that something has been elevated or exaggerated beyond its natural limits, which could refer to a physical object or a person's abilities. Option A aligns better with this idea of something being amplified or enhanced, whereas option B does not make as much sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Laps kaebas, et ta peab tualettruumi minema,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that something has been taken away from the person, implying a negative impact. Therefore, it is more likely that they will feel sad or upset rather than happy or excited."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kalad hüppasid akvaariumist välja) is more likely. The phrase ""laps puistas"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, and ""akvaariumist välja"" means ""the aquarium burst"". Therefore, it is more likely that the aquarium burst rather than the water inside the tank being drained out through a small hole in the bottom."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta osales protestis) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the person will take action in opposition to the proposed change, rather than accepting it passively.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A is more likely. The sentence ""Ma keerasin kraani lahti"" means ""I made a hole in the pot,"" indicating that something was added to or taken out of the pot, rather than anything being inside it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Rong saabus jaama) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""rong saabus jaama"" means ""the person who came late was punished,"" indicating that the speaker believes that the person who arrived late faced consequences for their tardiness. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation of the situation based on the provided premise."
Response:  Option B - Ta pitseeris ümbriku kinni.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Nad nautisid üksteise seltsi) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Sõbrad kaotasid ühenduse"" suggests that there has been a disruption in the relationship between two things, and the fact that they are not communicating with each other implies that there is some kind of barrier or obstacle preventing them from doing so. This could be due to a lack of understanding or mutual interest, rather than any physical distance between them. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why they are not communicating with each other."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta läks emapuhkusele) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""haldas firma rahalisi"" implies that the company's financial situation has worsened, making it difficult for them to pay their employees' salaries. Therefore, option B, which suggests that the employees will be laid off, is a more plausible outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma vaatasin kella,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ma kuulsin kella tiksumist,"" is the correct cause. This is because the word ""vaatasin"" implies a sense of hearing or perceiving something, which aligns with the idea of listening to a bell ringing. In contrast, option B suggests control over something, which does not fit as well with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Mu naine ja mina hoidsime käest kinni) is more likely to be the correct cause. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker's wife or partner and they are more likely to have taken care of the cramps rather than the speaker themselves.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ma vahetasin poldi völja) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is expressing a desire to eat something sweet, rather than causing harm to someone or something else. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Paarike allkirjastas korteri üürilepingu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""korteri üürilepingu"" suggests that Paarike will enter a competition or challenge in the kitchen, where she will have to prepare a dish using only ingredients found in the pantry. This implies that Paarike has limited resources at her disposal, making it harder for her to win the competition. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ta arvas, et nägi äikest) is more likely. The phrase ""et nägi äikest"" means ""and saw a ghost,"" indicating that the speaker had a supernatural encounter. This aligns with the theme of paranormal activity in the premise, making Option B the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees kandis vees päästevesti,"" option A is more likely. The word ""kandis"" suggests that something has been done or happened to the speaker's body, which implies a physical action or event. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker had an accident or injury rather than simply feeling unwell."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta vajutas tagasisammuklahvi) is more likely to occur. The text suggests that the person will be asked to write a summary of a long document, which may require them to condense complex information into a shorter form while still maintaining its meaning. This task would likely involve using their analytical skills and attention to detail, rather than simply memorizing information. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta sai halva hinde) is more likely. The word ""hinde"" in Estonian means ""headache"", so it's possible that the speaker has a headache due to some reason."
"Response:  Option A: Öö läbi sadas. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Muru was once a man. This implies that he had a physical body in the past, which means he could have died or been injured. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that Muru's death occurred due to some external factor rather than his own actions."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta veetis öö hotellis) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence ""Naine magas sisse"" means ""The water is rising inside,"" which suggests that there is a flood or some other type of water-related disaster occurring inside the hotel. Option B (Ta unustas äratuskella panna) does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Option A - Ta istus varjus.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Teadlased võitisd teooria tagasi) is more likely. The passage states that ""the theory has been widely accepted,"" indicating that it has gained widespread acceptance and support in the scientific community. This suggests that the theory has been successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena and has been consistently supported by empirical evidence, making it unlikely to be rejected or replaced anytime soon. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Mäng läks lisaajale) is more likely to be the correct cause. The sentence ""Fännid mängul hüüdsid halvakspanealt"" can be translated to ""The teacher gave the students half an exam."" Therefore, the most likely reason for this situation is that the teacher only provided half of the exam to the students, rather than any other option."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ma keerasin luku kinni) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""keerasin luku"" means ""to mix or combine,"" so it suggests that the two sisters are combining their talents in some way. Option B (Lukk avanes) does not make sense in this context and seems unrelated to the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Isa andis pojale natuke raha) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Rahvas intensiivistus"" suggests that something intense or strong is happening, which could potentially cause harm to someone or something. Therefore, it is more likely that Isa will be affected by whatever is happening rather than being unaffected and unharmed."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma tegin lumest lumepalli) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Lumi blokeeris sissesõiduteed"" suggests that something has happened to Lumi's light, making it less bright or dimmer than usual. Therefore, Option A, which means ""I will make Lumi's light brighter,"" is a more appropriate response to this situation."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kajakk jõudis kaldale) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""aerutega"" suggests that something has been taken or removed from someone's possession, which aligns with the idea of a kayak being stolen. Option B (""Kajakk sõitis tabas lainet"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""The kayak was too heavy for him."""
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ta sõitis aeda sisse) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person will try to control their emotions by calming themselves down, rather than resorting to destructive behavior like breaking things.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma panin puhuri tööle,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""munahale pritsis vett"" means ""I will make a mess of things."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will cause chaos or confusion rather than simply disappearing without a trace."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Surfarid naasesid randa,"" option A is more likely. The word ""naasesid"" means to swallow or gulp down, so it's unlikely that the person would have a stomachache from not eating anything. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vesi voolas vannist ära) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""vani"" means ""water"" in Estonian, and ""ära"" means ""wet"". Therefore, the sentence ""Ma tõmbasin vanni äravoolukorki"" can be translated as ""I have a wet headache."" As water cannot dry up something that it has already wet, it is more likely that the person will continue to feel wet rather than the opposite."
"Response:  Option B - Ta tunnistas oma truudusetust talle. 
Explanation: According to the premise, after drinking too much alcohol, Mees's brain will start to shrink. This means that his cognitive abilities will be affected, making it harder for him to remember things or think clearly. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that Mees's brain will shrink, leading to a decrease in cognitive abilities."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Ma ootasin, kuni trükivärv kuivab"" implies that the speaker has taken something (probably food) out of a container (trükivärv), and then left it outside to dry. This could potentially lead to spoilage or contamination of the food, which would not be desirable. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta nägi õudusunenägu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Laps ärkas"" suggests that something has caused discomfort or pain to a child, while ""Üles"" implies that the cause is external rather than internal. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the child's discomfort is an external factor such as a bump or injury, rather than an internal issue like a fever."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ta isa istus laua taha maha) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Poiss pani oma jalad lauale"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual has happened, and ""Ta isa istus laua taha maha"" means ""He/She had a great success"". Therefore, it is more likely that the person experienced a positive outcome rather than a negative one."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ma hõikasin ta nime) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence ""Mu sõber pööras pea minu poole"" suggests that something is preventing water from flowing through a pipe, and the phrase ""ta nime"" means ""to name"". Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is caused by a blockage or obstruction in the pipe rather than an issue with the hand."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kodanikud korraldasid ülestõusu) is more likely. The phrase ""Valitsus surus oma kodanikke alla"" suggests that something is being controlled or influenced by someone in power, and the word ""korraldasid"" implies a forceful or coercive action. Therefore, it is more likely that the person in power is using their influence to control or manipulate others rather than simply registering them."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poiss oli metsa eksinud,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""Ta pani telgi püsti"" means ""The forest was burning."" Therefore, the effect of a fire in the forest is more likely to occur based on this premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naine reisis välismaale,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the phrase suggests that the person is traveling abroad for education. Therefore, they are likely to want to learn a new language to facilitate their travels and interactions in foreign countries."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta töökaaslane edutati) is more likely. The sentence ""Mees oli oma töökaaslase peale kade"" implies that the person had their own workspace at home, which suggests that they were working remotely or independently. Therefore, it is more likely that they took a break to educate themselves rather than simply taking a break for leisure."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees nägi tulnukaid,"" it is more likely that option A (Ta nägi viirastusi) is the correct answer. The phrase ""mees"" means ""my"" in Estonian, and ""tulnukaid"" means ""saw."" Therefore, the sentence translates to ""I saw something."" Option B (""Ta mediteeris"") does not fit the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mehe juuksed muutusid blondiks,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta pani neisse valgendit"" (To take a pill for hair growth) is the correct answer. The word ""juuksed"" in Estonian means ""hair grown out"", so the sentence suggests that something has caused the person's hair to grow out or become thicker. Taking a pill for hair growth would be a common solution to this problem, rather than using shampoo."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta kritiseeris oma eelnevat tööd) is more likely. The text suggests that the artist is criticizing their own work, rather than seeking inspiration from it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poeg kolis kodust ära,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""poeg kolis"" means ""to break a leg,"" which is an idiomatic expression used to wish someone good luck before they embark on a challenging task or performance. Therefore, it is unlikely that the person would choose option B, as there is no logical connection between breaking a leg and going to school."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Maavärin raputas raamaturiiulit) is more likely as it suggests that the reason for the disappearance of the people in the village is due to their own actions or decisions rather than external factors like natural disasters or alien invasions.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mu kodus läks elekter ära,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Ma panin lambi põlema"" means ""My electricity bill increased."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the cause of the American Dream being delayed or deferred for many people is Option B: See tundus lõbus (the lack of affordable housing). This is because the premise highlights the challenges faced by many Americans in achieving their financial goals, including saving for a down payment on a house. The lack of affordable housing options can make it difficult for people to purchase a home, leading to delays or deferrals in achieving the American Dream.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ma kallasin võid kotti) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""kotitäis popkorni hakkas"" suggests that something has happened to a potato, and ""praksuma"" implies that it was cooked or prepared in some way. Therefore, option A, which translates to ""I boiled the potato,"" makes sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ilmateade ennustas tugevaid tuuli) is more likely. The phrase ""ilmateade"" means ""weather forecast"" in Estonian, and ""tugevaid"" means ""strong"". Therefore, the sentence implies that the weather forecast predicts strong winds."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ta solvas publikut) is more likely to occur. The author of the article is suggesting that by taking a strong stance against corruption, they will be able to influence public opinion and create a movement towards change.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mehe hääl kõlas kähe,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Tal oli külmetus"" means ""There was a storm."" This suggests that the cause of the damage to the roof is weather-related, such as strong winds or hail. Option B, ""Ta jättis suitsetamise maha,"" means ""He left his suitcase behind."" While this could potentially be a cause for the damage to the roof if it were somehow related to the suitcase, it seems less likely given the context provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Lift jõudis määratud korrusele) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary suggest that the lift was caused by a malfunction in one of its parts, rather than being lifted by an external force.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Take valued items from your home) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""valued items"" suggests that the person has something important or valuable in their home that they do not want to lose or damage. This could include things like family heirlooms, expensive electronics, or other possessions that are particularly meaningful to them. Therefore, it is more likely that the person would take these items with them rather than leaving them behind."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vannituba ujutas üle,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ujutas"" means ""to boil,"" so it's more likely that the cause of the water being hot is due to a boiler malfunction rather than a kettle explosion."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Omanik pani kutsikale kaelarihma) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""kutsikas püsis"" suggests that something has been cut off or separated from its original place, which could indicate a physical obstruction or blockage in the pipes. Option B (Omanik hoidis kutsikat jalutusrihma otsas) does not provide any specific information about what might be causing the problem, making it less plausible as the primary cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ta seisis laialivalguva puu all) is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""Mees nägi oma peegeldust"" suggests that something was seen or found by the speaker, which aligns with the meaning of ""laialivalguva"" as ""to find"". Therefore, option A is a plausible interpretation of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ma helistasin talle tagasi) is more likely. The phrase ""tudruksõbra"" suggests that something has been taken or stolen, and ""tagasi"" means away from home, so it's likely that the speaker's phone was taken away from them while they were at home."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nende koer jooksis kodust ära) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something has happened to the speaker's ears, implying a physical cause rather than a psychological one.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ilm oli jahe) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Ma nägin oma hingeõhku"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising happened to the speaker, and the fact that they are wondering what caused it implies that they are unsure of the reason. The word ""jahe"" means ""surprise"" in Estonian, making option A a better fit for the context."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Mädanev lõhn täitis köögi) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""mädanev lõhn"" means ""to make something dirty,"" so it's likely that the person will get their hands dirty while trying to fix the broken thing."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta kandis kõrgeid kontsi) is more likely to be the cause of Naisel's death. The sentence suggests that Naisel was killed by a large stone, which could have been thrown at him from above. This implies that someone may have intentionally harmed or killed Naisel, rather than suggesting that he died due to natural causes such as old age or illness.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Veepotist tõusis aur,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""veepotist"" means ""to boil or steam,"" so it is likely that the speaker is referring to a situation where something is being heated up or cooked in some way. Option A, ""Vesi kees,"" translates to ""The water is hot,"" which aligns with this interpretation of the premise. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kõik mu sokid olid pesus,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ma kandsin sandaale"" (I would faint) will occur. This is because the word ""pesus"" in Estonian means ""faint"" or ""pass out."" Therefore, given this context, it makes sense that the speaker might feel lightheaded or pass out due to the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta kaotas valijate toetuse) is more likely. The argument suggests that the politician's absurd arguments are causing chaos, implying that their actions have led to a state of disorder or confusion. This is consistent with the idea that the politician's behavior is causing problems for themselves and others, rather than simply being corrupt.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Paar jäi rasedaks) is more likely. The phrase ""Kõik panid paarikese kihlumist pahaks"" suggests that everyone has experienced painful periods, implying that some people may have had their periods for a longer time than others. Therefore, it is more likely that some people will experience prolonged periods rather than having them stop suddenly."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Miljonär tahtis, et hoone lammutataks) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tahtis, et"" indicates that the rich person wants or intends something, which aligns with the idea of wanting to avoid paying taxes. Option B (""Panustas selle ehitamiseks"") suggests that the rich person is motivated by a desire to build something, but does not necessarily imply an intention to avoid taxes."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Müüja nägi, kuidas tüdruk kaupa oma käekotti pani) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that Müüja has a plan to buy her own house, implying that she has the financial means to do so. Therefore, it is less likely that she would be struggling to pay for someone else's house (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sõdurid saadeti völja võitlema) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""riik kuulutas naabruses"" suggests that the country has taken control of a disputed territory, and the use of the word ""saadeti"" implies that they are trying to assert their dominance over it. This implies that the country will try to maintain control over the territory, rather than giving it up. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""vahetas kohtuhoone"" suggests that something has been added or put into the house, which could be causing the strange noises. Therefore, it is more likely that there is an external factor affecting the house rather than the house itself being haunted."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ta võttis küpsisted purgist välja) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tüdruk haistis midagi põlemas"" suggests that something was taken out of the stomach, which could be a food item or substance. Therefore, it is more likely that the person vomited after consuming something rather than simply feeling sick without any obvious reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vihma kallas alla,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""vihma"" means storm in Estonian, so it's likely that the speaker is referring to a severe weather event. Therefore, option A, ""Torm läks halvemaks,"" which translates to ""The storm will pass quickly,"" is the most appropriate response."
"Response:  Option A - Lift lõpetas töötamise.
Explanation: The premise ""Hoone evakueeriti"" suggests that there has been a house evacuation due to some reason. This could be because of a fire or any other hazardous situation inside the house. Therefore, option A - Lift lõpetas töötamise (Lifting the roof) is more likely as it implies that the roof needs to be lifted to access the area where the danger lies."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Isa viskas oma poja kodust välja) is more likely. The phrase ""alkoholismi pahaks"" suggests that alcohol consumption has negative effects, and therefore it is more likely that Isa would try to avoid drinking or reduce their alcohol intake rather than increasing it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Sekretär läks selleks päevaks koju) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that a secretary is being referred to, rather than an elevator or lift. Additionally, the phrase ""selleks päevaks koju"" implies that the secretary is working during the daytime, which further supports Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta sõber katkestas teda) is more likely to be the correct answer because it makes sense in the context of the sentence. The phrase ""mees sai oma sõbra"" means ""the man had his own head,"" so ""ta sõber katkestas teda"" can be translated as ""he hit his own head."" Therefore, option A is a plausible response."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kassapidaja andis tüdrukule vahetusraha) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tüdrukule vahetusraha"" suggests that Kassapidaja will gain something from Tüdruk, rather than losing something to him. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

The sentence ""Naine pandi ratastooli"" suggests that something unexpected or unpleasant has happened to the person, and the phrase ""halvatuks"" implies a sense of disappointment or frustration. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's mood is affected by some external factor rather than their own thoughts or actions."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Riik tähistas oma iseseisvust) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Kodanikud heiskasid oma kodudel riigilipu"" suggests that something has happened to the people's homes in the countryside, implying a natural disaster or other catastrophic event. This could lead to a sense of uncertainty and fear among the population, causing them to seek shelter elsewhere. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the people are leaving their homes."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Nad inspireerisid oma fenn) is more likely. The phrase ""Tiim kaotas turniiri"" suggests that something unexpected or chaotic has happened, which could potentially inspire someone to create art. Inspiration can come from a variety of sources, including personal experiences, emotions, and observations of the world around us. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will be inspired by their own thoughts and feelings rather than trying to replicate someone else's work."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ma tundsin piinlikkust) is more likely. The phrase ""piinlikkust"" means ""too good to be true,"" implying that something is not as it seems or is too perfect to be realistic. This fits with the idea of a person trying to convince someone else that they are not in trouble by downplaying their situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta pani tunnis tähele) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Poiss kukkus oma ajaloo"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising has happened, and ""eksami"" implies an examination or test of some kind. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker might feel overwhelmed and want to take a break rather than try to study for an exam."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Linna tabas maavärin) is the more likely cause of the problem. The sentence ""Kesklinna hoone varises kokku"" suggests that there is a problem with the heating system in the building, and the phrase ""maavärin"" implies that there may be a blockage or obstruction in the heating ducts. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is caused by debris or other obstructions in the ducts rather than a lack of insulation in the walls."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mehe tüdruksõber jättis ta maha,"" option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that something has been left behind or forgotten, which aligns with Option A's interpretation of trying to find something that was previously there but is no longer present."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Pall veeres ära) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""kaks last kummardusid"" suggests that there are two recent events or occurrences that have happened, and the sentence ""üheaegselt, et maast pall võtta"" implies that something has caused a problem or obstacle for one of these events. Therefore, it is more likely that the event that was affected by the obstacle is the one that occurred recently, which in this case would be option A (Pall veeres ära)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Prügikasti tuhnis prügikasti läbi,"" option A is more likely. The word ""prügikasti"" means ""to hit or strike,"" so it is likely that the subject of the sentence is hitting something else. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of a physical object being struck. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poiss teritas pliiatsit,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""pliiatsit"" suggests that something has been stretched or elongated, which aligns with Option A's meaning of ""See oli odav."" Therefore, the most likely explanation for the given premise is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta kaotas oma tšeki ära) is the more likely cause for why a person may not be able to find their lost keys. This is because the phrase ""kaotas oma tšeki"" means ""to lose one's mind,"" implying that the person may have misplaced or forgotten their keys due to confusion or disorganization rather than any physical obstacle. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: See jättis armi.
Explanation: The phrase ""Kriimustus mu nahal oli sügav"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, and the speaker is trying to find it. The word ""jättis"" in option B means ""giant,"" implying that whatever was taken away is enormous in size. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees sai rongis reisijatelt imelikke pilke,"" Option A (Ta vaatas maha) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""rongis reisijatelt"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, and ""imelikke pilke"" implies a sudden and unexpected event. Therefore, it is more likely that the damage was caused by an external force, such as a blow or impact, rather than a gradual process like corrosion."
"Response:  Option B - Laps pani leiva ära.
Explanation: The premise ""Laps jättis puru põrandale"" implies that something has happened to the child's stomach, making it difficult for them to digest food. Option B, ""Laps pani leiva ära,"" suggests that the child may have become weak or frail due to illness or malnutrition, which could be a result of difficulty in digesting food. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Naise õde pani käed risti) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""pani käed risti"" suggests that something has been stuck or caught in a place where it shouldn't be, which could potentially cause damage or disrupt the normal functioning of the system. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta huuled olid lõhenenud) is a more plausible cause for why Mees võttis münti than option B (Ta muretses halva hingeõhu pärast). This is because the phrase ""Mees võttis münti"" suggests that something unexpected or unfortunate happened to Mees, rather than indicating that he simply made a mistake or had bad luck. Therefore, it is more likely that some external factor caused Mees's situation, such as him being hit by something or falling into a hole, rather than his own actions or decisions causing him to lose his money."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nad aimasid, et teatri ümber on tihe liiklus) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that Paarike's laughter is caused by something external to her, such as a joke or a funny situation, rather than an internal factor like nervousness or anxiety. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. The sentence ""Ta töökaaslane võttis tema vahetuse üle"" means ""She took her work home with her"", indicating that she brought her work back home. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Ta toetas nende üritust) is the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tal oli lavahirm) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""süda peksis enne etendust"" suggests that something has been spreading or growing rapidly, which aligns with the meaning of ""lavahirm"". Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma lugesin oma sularaha üre) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""olinu"" means ""I am exhaling,"" indicating that the speaker is breathing out or releasing something. This suggests that the speaker may be expelling a substance from their body, such as smoke or gas, rather than pulling it in. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Option B - See tõmbus krimpsu (The crimp will break).
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ma keerasin süüdet) is more likely to be the cause of the car's breakdown. The phrase ""Auto läks katki"" suggests that the car has broken down or stopped working, and ""keerasin süüdet"" means ""I filled up with gas."" Therefore, it is possible that running out of gas caused the car to break down."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees tegi oma seljale haiget,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""ta läks psühhiaatri juurde"" means ""to see a psychiatrist immediately,"" indicating that the speaker believes their mental state is deteriorating rapidly and requires immediate attention from a professional. This response aligns with the urgency conveyed by the premise. In contrast, Option B's suggestion to ""ta jäi mõneks päevaks voodisse"" (to stay in bed for a few days) implies a less severe reaction to the situation and may not address the underlying issues as quickly or effectively."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma tegin kaminasse tule,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mul olid küttepuud otsas"" (The mother has a headache) is the correct cause. The phrase ""tegin kaminasse tule"" suggests that something is causing discomfort or pain in the mother's head, which could be due to various reasons such as stress, fatigue, or illness. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tal läks könig krampi) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""könig krampi"" suggests a strong or intense cramping sensation, which could indicate that the muscles in the neck are contracting tightly due to overuse or strain. This is a common occurrence among musicians who play wind instruments, as they often hold their instrument in an awkward position for extended periods of time, leading to tension in the neck and shoulder muscles."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Mu naaber kutsus mind sisse) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""kutsus mind sisse"" suggests that the speaker's thoughts are being pulled into their own mind, indicating a sense of introspection or self-reflection. This aligns with the idea of someone trying to understand themselves better through meditation. In contrast, Option B (""Mu naaberläks kodust ära"") does not convey this same sense of internal focus, but rather implies that the speaker's thoughts are wandering aimlessly without any particular direction or purpose."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Naine ohkas frustreeritult) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""frustreeritult"" suggests that the person's emotions are bottled up or suppressed, which could lead to feelings of irritability or aggression without any obvious external trigger. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Õpilane vastas küsimustele õigesti) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the teacher will give a task to the student, and the student will complete it successfully. Option B (Õpilane kahtles, kas küsimusele vastata) implies that the student may or may not choose to answer the question, but this does not align with the tone of the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naisel said munad otsa,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Ta läks farmi"" (Let's go to the farm) will be the correct response. This is because ""munad otsa"" means ""let's go"" in Estonian, and ""farmi"" is a common place to visit or go to in Estonia."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma avaldasin talle saladuse) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""avaldata"" means ""to be worthless,"" so it suggests that the speaker's money will become worthless or lose value. This implies that they will not have enough money to buy anything, including expensive clothes. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naine vältis järve minemist,"" it is more likely that Option A: ""Ta püüdis kala"" (To take a poison) is the correct answer. The phrase ""vältis järve minemist"" suggests that someone has been poisoned, and taking a poison would be the most likely cause of this effect."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta vihmavari oli katki) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The word ""katki"" in Estonian means ""rotten"", so it suggests that the mushrooms have gone bad due to spoilage rather than being stolen."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the user clicks on a link) is more likely to occur. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Peateel oli õnnetus) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is expressing a negative emotion or feeling, rather than simply stating a fact. Additionally, the use of the word ""oli"" instead of ""jah"" suggests that the speaker is using an older form of Estonian, which would be consistent with the idea that the speaker is expressing a personal opinion or feeling."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Linad kuivasid) is more likely. The word ""kuivasid"" means ""to be covered"" in Estonian, so it's possible that the speaker is referring to something being covered or hidden by the mist."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naine pani päikeseprillid ette,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Päike oli ere."" This is because the phrase ""naine pani"" means ""she was angry,"" indicating that the subject of the sentence is in a state of anger. The word ""päikeseprillid"" means ""angry with,"" so the overall meaning of the sentence is ""She was angry with something."" Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of any action being taken by the speaker."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees silmitses öist taevast,"" option A is more likely. The word ""öist"" means ""suddenly"" or ""all of a sudden,"" indicating that something unexpected happened without warning. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma tundsin end rampväsinult,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tundsin"" implies a negative emotion such as disgust or unease, which suggests that Ma may not enjoy the taste of the food. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The sentence ""Mees läks juuksuri juurde"" implies that something has already happened to the person's hair, so it is unlikely that they would be able to grow their own hair back. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Poiss tervitas oma uut klassikaaslast) is more likely. The sentence ""Poiss tegi oma uuele klassikaasla"" implies that Poiss has created a new classic, and therefore it is unlikely that he would have abandoned his previous work to create something entirely different."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Maihaldasin klaasi piima,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ma sõin küpsiseid,"" is the correct answer. This is because the word ""sõin"" means ""to drink"" in Estonian, so it makes sense that someone would want to drink a glass of milk if they had one. Option B, ""Ma küpsetasin leiba,"" does not make as much sense in this context, as ""leiba"" means ""water"" in Estonian, rather than milk. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Juht pani esituled põlema) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Hakka's sadama"" suggests a situation where someone is feeling down or depressed, and ""esituled põlema"" means to wallow in one's emotions. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will indulge in self-pity rather than try to distract themselves from their feelings by engaging in an activity like gardening."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ma parkisin sissepääsu juude) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sissepääsu juude"" suggests that something is being pulled or sucked into a small space, which could be interpreted as the park's entrance becoming smaller due to some unknown cause. Option A (""Ma parkisin üle tee"") does not provide any information about the size of the park's entrance changing."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tal oli kirjaniku blokk) is a more plausible cause for why Kirjanik did not understand the instructions. As a block of text, it's unlikely that Kirjanik would be able to comprehend or follow written instructions. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma tahtsin ülevaatajaga rääkida) is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""partner katkestas"" suggests that there is a conflict or disagreement between two parties, and ""ülevaatajaga rääkida"" means to try to resolve or settle something through negotiation or compromise. Therefore, it is more likely that the conflict between the two parties is the main reason for their separation."
"Response:  Option A - Uksekell helises. 
Explanation: The premise ""Tuul puhus lahtisest aknast sisse"" implies that there is a strong wind blowing towards the lake. This means that the water level in the lake will decrease due to the wind pulling water out of the lake. Therefore, option A - Uksekell helises (The water level decreases) is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mu majas läks elekter ära,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""lambi seinast välja"" means ""to electrify a fence,"" which suggests that something has been energized or charged with electricity. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ta painutas peegli ees oma muskleid) is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""peegli"" refers to a person's own body, so it is unlikely that someone would give their own body to another person as a gift. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why someone might say ""Tõstja röhatas."""
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta sattus segadusse) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person has a tendency to overthink things, leading them to become anxious or stressed. This aligns with the idea of having too much information in one's head and feeling overwhelmed by it.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Isa vahetas tita mähkmeid) is the more likely cause of Tita's situation. The phrase ""tita mähkmeid"" suggests that Tita has been cursed or hexed by someone, which could explain why she is stuck in her current state. This is a common trope in folklore and mythology, where a person can be afflicted with a curse or spell that prevents them from moving on to the afterlife. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for Tita's predicament."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pois sai peapõrutuse) is more likely. The word ""peapõrutuse"" means ""to make a mess,"" so it's likely that Tüdruk will create a bigger mess than just making a small one."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Kõik keeldusid pildil naeratamast) is more likely. The phrase ""kõik keeldusid"" means ""all were taken,"" indicating that all of the photos were used or consumed in some way. This suggests that there was a high demand for the photographs, which is consistent with the idea of a successful photography business."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma ütlesin sünnipäevakutse ära,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that Ma was the one who wrote the letter, rather than someone else writing about Ma. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma tegin trenni,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ma tundsin end energiliselt"" (My mother doesn't understand energy) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""trenni"" in the premise suggests something that is not understood or comprehended, which aligns with the meaning of ""tundsin"" in Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma pigistasin niisket svammi,"" option A is more likely. The word ""niisket"" in this context suggests that something is being held back or restrained, which aligns with the idea of a person holding their breath. Therefore, it is more likely that they will see images inside their head rather than experiencing a physical sensation like water flowing through their ears."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Puhkekeskus oli broneeritud) is more likely. The word ""broneeritud"" means ""constructed"" or ""built"", indicating that the skyscraper was intentionally created as a shelter for people during a disaster. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Teismeline tegi tätoveeringu,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta kartis nõelu"" (To make a mess) is the correct cause. This is because the word ""tegi"" in the premise implies an action that results in something being made or created, rather than simply moving something around. Therefore, option A aligns better with the meaning of the premise than option B."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma muutusin kahtlustavaks) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""muuta"" means ""to change,"" and ""kahtlustavaks"" means ""into a different shape."" Therefore, it is possible that the car will transform into something else entirely, rather than simply being moved or called by the police."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tõendid segasid ta asjasse) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is describing a situation where something has been done or caused by someone else, rather than simply not happening. This implies that there may have been an intentional action taken by another person or entity that led to the current state of affairs. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the problem exists.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta lõpetas magusa söömise) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""otsustas kaalus alla võtta"" suggests that something has caused a problem or obstacle in the way of achieving a goal, and ""magusa söömise"" means to give up or quit trying. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will choose to give up rather than find an alternative solution like avoiding coffee."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tüdruk astus jääle,"" Option A: Ta libises is the most likely outcome. The word ""libises"" means ""to freeze."" Therefore, it is likely that the weather will be cold enough to cause ice to form in the area."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta oli terve öö üleval) is the more likely cause. The sentence ""Naisel olid rõngad silmade all"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not working properly, and ""ta oli terve öö üleval"" means ""he was healthy and strong."" Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is with something else rather than with Ta's physical strength."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vulkaan purskas) is more likely. The sentence ""Laava voolas vulkaanist"" implies that there is a flow of lava towards the volcano, which suggests an eruption or outpouring of magma from the volcano. This is consistent with Option A, as it states that the volcano is emitting lava. On the other hand, Option B does not make sense in this context, as it implies that the volcano has already been flooded by water, which would not be possible if there was no eruption or outpouring of magma. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naine pani kingad jalga,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""ta teadis kõiki peol"" means ""to take care of everything."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to taking care of their belongings or possessions rather than harming someone else's property."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta lasi mind tolliputkast läbi) is more likely. The phrase ""ma maksin tolliputka"" means ""my maximum tolerance,"" so it's likely that the speaker wants to express their limit or boundary. Option B (Ta pidas mind tolliputkas kinni) doesn't make sense in this context, as ""pida"" means ""to give"" in Estonian, and there's no word for ""kinni"" (meaning ""boundary"") after it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Take müüs oma firma atsiaid) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""Juhataja läks pankrot"" suggests that something has caused a financial crisis or bankruptcy for the person in question, and taking over someone else's business may be a way to alleviate this situation by gaining access to their assets or resources. In contrast, option B (Ta raiskas oma varanduse) does not provide any context or explanation as to why the person might be experiencing financial difficulties, making it less likely as a potential cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Meesläks arsti juurde,"" option A is more likely. The word ""arst"" in this context suggests that something has grown or developed over time, so it's unlikely that Mees simply forgot where he left his keys (option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Maja põles) is more likely to be the cause of her not being able to do magic. This is because the premise states that she has been trying for a long time but hasn't made any progress, suggesting that there may be an underlying issue with her ability or technique rather than simply lacking motivation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta oli pikalt duši all) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""oli pikalt duši"" means ""was very angry,"" which suggests that the person's emotional state may have contributed to their inability to solve the problem. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person was unable to think clearly and come up with a solution."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma sülitasin piima välja,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Piim maitses hapu"" (The pea is in the pod) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""sülitasin"" implies that something is inside another thing, which fits with the idea of a pea being inside a pod. Option B, ""Mu suu oli kuiv"" (My mouth was dry) does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma jäin bussist maha,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ma jõudsin vara tööle"" (I stayed at work late) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Veok põrkas autoga kokku,"" option A (Veok kiirendas) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person will be able to drive their car without any issues or problems. The phrase ""põrkas"" means ""to go"" in Estonian, so the sentence can be translated as ""You will be able to drive your car."" Option B (Auto purunes) does not convey this meaning and could potentially imply that something negative or problematic might happen with the car."
"Response:  Option B: Nad langesid välja. 
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker wants to avoid something, but it doesn't specify what they want to avoid. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer because ""langesid välja"" (to avoid something) implies that the speaker will not achieve their goal of getting closer to someone."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma pöörasin pudeli ümber) is more likely to be the correct cause. The word ""pöörasin"" in Estonian means ""to boil"", so it suggests that the speaker's mother may have boiled the puppy. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta roomas läbi lahtise akna) is more likely to happen as it suggests that the person will go through a difficult time or struggle, whereas option B (Ta ronis üles katusele) does not convey any negative connotation.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Külaline koputas uksekoputit) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""uksekell helises"" suggests that something is being pulled or stretched, which could result in a tear or rip. Option B (Naine piilus läbi ukse võtmeaugu) implies that someone is trying to pull something through a small opening, but this does not necessarily involve tearing or ripping anything. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ta riputas selle oma kappi) is more likely. The phrase ""omakaitse"" means to take care of one's own home or property, so it makes sense that the speaker would want to protect their own belongings rather than someone else's. Therefore, option B is a more plausible response given the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hambapasta purskas joana tuubist välja) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pursgas joana"" means ""to eat a lot,"" so it's likely that the person will eat too much hamburger and feel unwell afterwards. Option B (Tüdruk sülitas hambapasta välja) means ""The pig eats the hamburger,"" which doesn't fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Patsifistid pidasid paraadi) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""hüppeliselt"" suggests a sudden or unexpected event, and ""padasid paraadi"" means to panic or become disorganized. Therefore, it is more likely that the people will panic and become disorganized in response to an unexpected attack than to organize a protest."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Paelä lapsik välja) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""tudruk tõmbas äkitselt paela"" suggests that something unexpected has happened, and the speaker is trying to find a solution. Option B implies that the speaker may have accidentally knocked over a pot or container with hot liquid, causing it to spill onto their lap."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees käis iluoperatsioonil,"" Option A (Ta vananes) is more likely. The word ""vananes"" means ""to dream"" in Estonian, so it suggests that the person has been daydreaming or lost in thought."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Munast tuli beebikana välja,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""tuli"" means ""came"" or ""arrived,"" indicating that something happened to the egg after it was laid. Therefore, option A is correct because it suggests that the egg hatched."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vang nälgis,"" Option A (Ta suri) is more likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees kaotas redelil tasakaalu,"" option A is more likely. The word ""redelil"" suggests that something has been broken or damaged, so it's more likely that the thing will be repaired rather than replaced entirely. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Laps krooksus,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""krooksus"" means ""crooked"" or ""twisted,"" which suggests that something has gone wrong or awry. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to a situation where something has been distorted or twisted, such as a plan or idea, rather than a physical object like a spoon."
"Response:  Option B: Ma värisesin.
Explanation: The premise ""Külm tuuletõmbus tuli aknast sisse"" implies that something unexpected and unwelcome has happened to someone. Option B, ""Ma värisesin,"" means ""I got angry."" Therefore, option B is the most likely response to the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Ta sai häid hindeid. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the person received a scholarship for studying abroad. This means that they had to apply for the scholarship and go through a selection process. It is unlikely that they would have been able to obtain a scholarship without any prior knowledge or experience in the field of study they are pursuing. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta elas tema naabermajas) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""viskas poisi üle nalja"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the fermentation process, and ""naabermajas"" means ""to spoil or go bad."" Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is caused by improper storage or handling of the ingredients rather than a deliberate act of sabotage."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Näljane hulkur varastas süüa,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta sütitas kaastunnet"" (To sell the meat cheaply) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""näljane"" in Estonian means hungry or starving, implying that the person is struggling to afford food. Selling meat at a low price would be a way for this person to obtain food without breaking the bank."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma tahtsin privaatsust) is more likely to be the cause of why I don't have my own business. This is because the phrase ""tahtsin privaatsust"" means ""I think about starting a private business,"" indicating that the person has thought about starting their own business but hasn't taken any action yet. Therefore, it is more likely that this person lacks motivation or confidence in their ability to start a successful business rather than lacking knowledge or resources."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma surusin ta kätt) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""surusin ta kätt"" means ""I will cut off your hand,"" indicating a violent and harmful act that could result in physical injury or even death. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma kummardusin,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""kummardusin"" means to be annoyed or irritated, so it's likely that the speaker is experiencing a negative emotion caused by something else. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tüdruk númer küüsi"", option A is more likely. The word ""tüdruk"" means ""to count"" or ""to number"", so it's unlikely that the speaker would say ""ta oli mures"" (which means ""to take oil"") in this context. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma pöörasin kalendris lehte,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""pöörasin"" means ""to spoil or ruin,"" so it suggests that something negative has happened to the calendar. Option B does not fit with this meaning, as ""oli"" means ""there was"" in Estonian, and ""kuu"" means ""month."" Therefore, option A is a better match for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""ta andis lahutuse sisse"" means ""you will go inside your stomach,"" indicating that something harmful or unpleasant will happen to the person. Option A, ""Ta lasi oma advokaadi lahti,"" means ""You will drink your own lawyer's lake,"" which is a nonsensical and impossible scenario, making it less likely to occur. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Tüdruk will get sick from eating spoiled food (Option A). The phrase ""tüdruk viskas kummipalli maha"" suggests that Tüdruk has a weak stomach or digestive system, making him more susceptible to getting sick from spoiled or contaminated food. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta aimas vastust) is more likely. The phrase ""tudruk tegi"" means ""to resist or oppose,"" so it suggests that the person will try to avoid their grandmother's request. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta vastane püüdis söödu) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the person will take a pill to make themselves vomit. Vomiting is a common response to food poisoning or other stomach issues, and taking a pill to induce vomiting can help alleviate symptoms quickly. Option B (Ta vastane kukkus maha) does not specify what action the person will take, but ""kukkus"" means ""to explode,"" so this option implies that something dramatic and unlikely will happen."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma noppisin taime könjest tomateid,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Need olid küpsed"" (The potatoes are not cooked) is the correct answer. The word ""noppisin"" in Estonian means ""not cooked"", so it suggests that the potatoes have not been properly prepared for eating."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ta ostis oma tüdrukule šokolaadikomme) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker will buy their own chocolate bar, indicating a personal purchase rather than an external action like studying.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma kukutasin termomeetri maha) is a more plausible cause for why the temperature in the room has changed. The phrase ""kukutasin termomeetri"" means to measure or calculate something, suggesting that someone has taken deliberate action to change the temperature in the room. Option B (""Ilm läks soojemaks"") does not provide any context or explanation for why the temperature might have changed, making it less likely as a cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B: Maantee muutus ohtlikult jäiseks is more likely. The phrase ""maantee muutus"" means ""a change in direction,"" so it suggests that the storm will take a different path than previously expected. This aligns with the idea of a storm changing course, which is a common occurrence in nature. Therefore, Option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta hinded paranesid) is more likely. The word ""hinded"" implies a slowing or obstruction of progress, which aligns with the idea of feeling stuck in one's studies. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma tundsin end mugavalt,"" option B is more likely. The word ""tundsin"" implies a strong feeling of dislike or disapproval, so it's unlikely that the speaker would choose to embrace or accept something they don't like. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B: See muutus säravaks is more likely. The word ""säravaks"" means ""to change into something else"", so it suggests that the stone will transform into something else, rather than just being moved or rearranged (which would be the meaning of ""libedaks"")."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma lisasin kohvile suhkrut,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Kohv lõhnas tugevalt"" (The coffee will make you tired) will occur. The word ""suhkrut"" in Estonian means ""sugar"", so the sentence implies that the speaker has added sugar to their coffee, which can cause a temporary energy boost before leading to a crash or fatigue. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta sai paberi lõikehaava) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Mees paigutas pabereid ümber"" suggests that something has been put into a bag or container, and the word ""lõikehaava"" means ""to pack tightly"". Therefore, it is more likely that the contents of the bag will be compressed or compacted in some way, rather than being spread out or expanded."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma lõin haamriga naela,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""nael"" means to dream or imagine something, so it's likely that the person in question is experiencing a vivid dream rather than being physically harmed."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kalamees vinnas kala välja,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - Kalamees will eat the fish quickly."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tal was a pious man) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that Tal's religious devotion was a significant aspect of his personality. Therefore, it is more likely that he was a pious man rather than having the ability to break rocks.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mu näoilme lõi särama,"" option B is the most likely cause. The phrase ""lõi särama"" means ""broke something,"" so it is likely that the speaker accidentally broke something while cleaning their room. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Option A: Rätik oli märg (Rat was angry).
Explanation: The sentence ""Ma pühkisin oma käed rätikuga"" implies that someone's own rat had done something, suggesting that the speaker has a personal connection to the rat in question. Additionally, the use of the word ""märg"" to describe the rat's state suggests that it was feeling agitated or angry, which aligns with option A. Therefore, the most likely cause for the rat's behavior is that it was angry."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees kaotas taburetil tasakaalu,"" option A is more likely. The word ""kaotas"" means chaos or confusion, so it's unlikely that the person would be able to organize their thoughts and ideas into a coherent essay. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nad kaotasid mängu) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that something unexpected or unpredictable has happened, which aligns with Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma palusin adestust,"" option A is more likely. The word ""palusin"" means to be tired or exhausted, so it is more likely that the speaker's fatigue caused them to fall asleep at their desk rather than reaching a goal or achieving something significant."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta küsis tema kohta küsimusi) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is considering a specific question or problem related to their own situation, rather than simply ignoring it or avoiding it. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ta naerulohud ilmusid Nähtavale) is more likely. The word ""naerulohud"" means ""to make someone angry"", so it's likely that the person will become angry if they are constantly exposed to negative or unpleasant things."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vaenlase laev lendas õhku,"" it is more likely that option A, ""See láks üle miini,"" will occur. This is because ""laev"" means ""to wash away"" or ""to cleanse,"" and ""miini"" refers to a small amount of something, so it suggests that the speaker wants to see a small amount of dirt or impurity washed away. Option B, ""See seilas sadamasse,"" does not fit with this premise as ""sadamasse"" means ""in the sea,"" and does not convey the idea of washing away dirt or impurities."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees torkas oma jalga,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta kõndis lompi"" (You will break a leg) is the correct response. This is because ""torkas"" means to break or damage something in Estonian, and ""kõndis"" is a verb meaning to injure or harm someone. Therefore, the phrase ""Mees torkas oma jalga"" can be translated as ""You will injure your own leg."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Nad leidsid kuriteopaigast relva) is more likely. The detectives are trying to solve a mystery by analyzing clues, so it's unlikely that they would simply accept someone else's identity without questioning or investigating further.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Maanteel oli tihe liiklus,"" option B is more likely. The word ""tige"" in Estonian means ""thick"" or ""dense"", so it's likely that the speaker is referring to something being dense or thick, rather than something being visible or noticeable. Therefore, option B is a better fit for the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Paljud inimesed jäid haigeks) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Riigi majandus langes"" suggests that the government has taken measures to regulate or control the market, which could lead to a decrease in the number of businesses operating within it. Additionally, the phrase ""paljud inimesed jäid haigeks"" implies that many companies are struggling financially, which further supports the idea that there will be fewer businesses operating in the market. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Nad olid kõndimas lähenevasse liiklusesse) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that there was no visible reason for the sudden increase in popularity of the restaurant, implying that it may have been due to factors beyond what can be observed or measured. Therefore, Option A is a better fit than Option B (Ta tundis neid oma naabruskonnast ära), which implies that the increase in popularity may have been caused by something internal to the restaurant itself, such as improvements in food quality or service.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta tegi sarkastilise märkuse) is more likely to be the correct response. The phrase ""ta tegi"" means ""to make fun of,"" so it suggests that the speaker is trying to mock or tease someone with a sarcastic remark. Therefore, option B is the best fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Juht võttis hääletaja peale) is more likely. The phrase ""Autol sai bensiin otsa"" suggests that someone has spilled gasoline on their car, which could cause a fire or explosion if not handled properly. Therefore, it is more likely that the person in charge of cleaning up the mess would be wearing protective clothing to prevent injury from any potential hazards."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tita sündis) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Naine hakkas sünnitama"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone, implying a loss or deprivation. In this context, it makes sense for Tita to feel sadness (sündis) as a result of this loss. Option B (""Naisel oli hommikune iiveldus"") does not fit with the given premise and seems out of place in the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mehe müts puhuti ära,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""mehe müts"" means ""my head hurts,"" indicating that the speaker may have a headache or other discomfort. This could be caused by various factors such as stress, fatigue, or illness, but it is unlikely to be caused by something external like being hit in the head with an object. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta sai kutse) is more likely. The sentence ""Tüdruk käis klassikaaslase sünnipäevapeol"" suggests that something was taken from a classic case study, which implies that it is an academic or scientific concept rather than a physical object that can be bought. Therefore, option A is more plausible as it means ""You took a look at the classic case study."""
Response:  Option B - Ta ema viis ta parki.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta tahtis oma kohtingukaaslasele muljet avaldada) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Mees pihustas end odekolonniga"" suggests that something has been taken or stolen from someone, and ""ta tahtis oma kohtingukaaslasele muljet avaldada"" means to take something without permission. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's property was taken without their consent rather than them simply forgetting where they put it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Majas läks elekter ära,"" option A is more likely. The word ""taskulampi"" means ""flashlight."" Therefore, Maja is more likely to have a flashlight than a Labrador retriever."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Poeg lõpetas keskkooli) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""poeg lõpetas keskkooli"" means ""the teacher has left school,"" indicating that the reason for the problem is the absence of a teacher at the school. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta tahtis oma energiat kokku hoida) is the more likely cause for why marathon runners experience muscle soreness after a race. This is because running a marathon requires a significant amount of energy expenditure, which can lead to fatigue and muscle damage over time. Therefore, it makes sense that runners may feel sore or stiff after completing such an intense physical activity. Option B (Ta nägi finišijoont) does not provide any logical explanation for why marathon runners would experience muscle soreness after a race.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Müügiautomaat sülitas ta vahetusraha välja) is a more plausible cause for why the car won't start than option B (Krõpsukott oli kinni). This is because the phrase ""Poiss lõi müügiautomaati"" suggests that there may be an issue with the car's electrical system or engine, rather than simply being unable to find gasoline. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem lies in the car itself rather than the driver's lack of knowledge about where to buy fuel."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mu sõbra koer suri,"" option A is more likely to occur because it suggests that the speaker's eyes are drawn towards something or someone, rather than the speaker themselves being moved away from something."
"Response:  Option B: Ta maksis sularahas. 
Explanation: The premise states that the person has a lot of debt, implying that they may not have enough money to pay for something expensive like a vacation. Therefore, option B, which suggests that the person will spend their savings, is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees vandus,"" it is more likely that option A (Ta lõikas oma küüsi) is the correct answer. The phrase ""mees vandus"" implies that a person has been lost or misplaced, which could lead to them wandering around aimlessly without any clear direction or purpose. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why someone might be wandering around in circles."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta vend vaidles nende vanematega) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is expressing a desire to avoid something unpleasant or difficult, rather than seeking excitement or adventure. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will choose to stay at home rather than go out into the stormy weather.
"Response:  Option B: Ta vaatas tähti. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Ta vaatas tähti"" means ""You will reach the stars,"" which suggests that the person's potential for success or greatness is limitless. This option is more likely to be the correct answer based on the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ma paigutasin postri ukse kohale) is a more plausible explanation for why the poster remained stuck to the wall. This is because it suggests that there may be some kind of adhesive or sticky substance on the poster that is holding it in place, rather than any external force pulling it towards the wall. Option B (Ma panin kleeplinti postri tagaküljele), on the other hand, does not provide any specific reason as to why the poster would remain stuck to the wall.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Arhitekst konstrues hoone) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the wording of the premise. The sentence ""Klient kiitis arhitekti hoone plaanid heaks"" implies that the client has hired an architect to design a house, which would require the architect to construct or build the house. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees kukutas oma lusika maha,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta käed värisesid"" (Your cat has eaten your homework) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""mees kukutas"" means ""your cat"" in Estonian, and ""lusika"" means ""homework."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the speaker's cat has eaten their homework, rather than the other option, ""Ta limpsis lusikat"" (You have lost your homework)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Juhatus leidis talle asenduse) is more likely. The phrase ""tagasi"" suggests a return or reversal of something that had previously happened, which aligns with the idea of the juhatus leading to increased competition for the company's attention. Option A (Firma tegevdirector astus tagasi) implies that the director has returned after being away, but does not provide any information about what they did while they were gone."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma istusin tagaritta) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ma jäin loengusse hiljaks"" suggests that something has been bothering or troubling her for a while, so it's possible that she may have finally reached her breaking point and snapped at someone. Option B (""Ma lähenesin poodiumile"") does not fit with this interpretation as it means ""I became angry quickly,"" which implies a sudden and intense anger rather than a gradual build-up of frustration over time."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees sai vangist völja,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ta pere maksis ta kautsjoni"" means ""to take a long time to get something done."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will say ""Ta ründas kaasvangi"" instead of ""Ta pere maksis ta kautsjoni,"" as ""kaasvangi"" means ""to take a long time."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nad müüsid oma maja) is more likely. The phrase ""pere kaotas kõik oma asjad"" suggests that everything in the house belongs to someone, implying a sense of ownership or possession. Therefore, it is more likely that someone would try to protect their belongings by locking the door rather than leaving them unlocked for anyone to take."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Purk taastöödeldi) will occur. The word ""trampisin"" in the premise suggests that something heavy or solid is being carried, which aligns with the meaning of ""taastöödeldi"". Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the aluminum purging will cause damage to the object being carried."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ta õppis suhtlusoskusi) is more likely. The word ""suhtlusoskus"" means ""to be in a state of confusion or disarray,"" so it aligns better with the idea of someone being unable to focus due to external factors."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mu tuju paranes,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ma kuulasin muusikat"" (I heard music) is the correct answer. The word ""paranes"" in this context suggests a sudden or unexpected change, which could be caused by hearing music. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nad toitsid kodutuid) is more likely. The phrase ""Heategevusorganisatsioon seadis eesmärgiks raha koguda"" suggests that the organization has a lot of money to spend, but it does not specify how they will use this money. Therefore, it is more likely that they will simply waste it or not use it effectively rather than investing in something useful like code development."
"Response:  Option B - Reisijad karjusid (They will probably get angry).
Explanation: The premise ""Ameerika mägede rong sööstis järsust langusest alla"" implies that something unexpected or surprising has happened to all Americans. This could potentially cause anger or frustration among them. Therefore, option B - Reisijad karjusid (They will probably get angry) is a more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma olit maruvihane,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - you will control your emotions and not let them get the best of you."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees tahtis päikesetõusu vaadata,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Ta reisis põhja."" This is because the phrase ""tahtis"" implies a strong desire or intention to do something, and ""reisis"" means ""to rise"" or ""to go up."" Therefore, it is likely that the person will try to reach their goal of getting higher."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma taastöötlesin paberit) is more likely to occur than option B (Paber kortsus). This is because the word ""taastöötlesin"" means ""to stuff"" or ""to fill"", which implies that something is being put into a container, whereas ""kortsus"" simply means ""a paper"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will use the phrase ""ma taastöötlesin paberit"" to describe the action of filling a bag with papers, rather than just mentioning the presence of a paper."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Teiste riikide juhid saatsid hädaabi) is more likely. The phrase ""riik elas looduskatastroofi"" suggests a catastrophic event that affects multiple countries, while ""teiset riikide juhid moodustasid liidu"" implies a limited impact on specific countries. Therefore, it is more likely that the entire region will be affected by the disaster rather than just a few countries."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poisi riided olid läbimärjad,"" option A is more likely. The word ""poisi"" means ""sour"" in Estonian, so it's likely that the speaker is referring to a sour taste rather than a sweet one. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (See tuli raamatukokku tagasi viia) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""tagasi viia"" suggests that something has been pushed or moved away from its original position, indicating that the book may have been accidentally knocked over or displaced. Option B (Ta laenas selle sõbralt) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the problem and could potentially refer to a different issue altogether."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kurjategija hukati,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta pandi vangi"" (The cat purred) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""hukati"" in Latvian means ""to purr."" Therefore, the sentence ""Kurjategija hukati"" can be translated as ""The cat is purring."""
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma tõmbasin kardinad eest) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tõmbasin kardinad"" means to dig a hole in the ground, which suggests that something has been buried or hidden underground. This could be a treasure or valuable item, but it could also be something else of value like a secret or piece of information. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why someone might want to dig up the ground."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma sikutasid petise juukseid,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""ta parukas tuli ära"" means ""you will get a prize."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will receive a reward or prize for their hard work rather than being left behind."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta leidis, et käsikiri oli mõjuv) is a more plausible explanation for why the toimekrager changed the wording of the sentence. This is because the phrase ""mõjuv käsikiri"" means ""the text was wrong,"" indicating that there was an error in the original sentence. Therefore, it makes sense that the toimekrager would change the wording to correct the mistake. Option B (Ta pidas lauset ebaselgeks) does not provide any specific reason for why the toimekrager made the change, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the card was declined) is the correct answer. The phrase ""krediitkaardi konto kinni"" suggests that the speaker has a credit card account, and the fact that they are unable to use their card implies that there may be an issue with the account or the card itself, rather than simply forgetting where they left it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker cannot find their card."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees ja naine armusid,"" Option A (Nad käisid kõrgkoolis) is more likely. The phrase suggests that the man and woman are old and weak, which could lead to them being unable to attend school."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely. The speaker mentions that they will compose their own song, indicating that they are capable of creating music themselves rather than relying on someone else to do it for them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poisi juuksed hoidsid püsti,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Tüdruk sasis neid"" (The mouse ate the cheese) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""juuksed"" in Estonian means ""ate."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the mouse ate the cheese, rather than the other way around."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma pihustasin endale putukatörjevahendit peale) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman's breasts are sagging than Option B (Ma astusin putukale peale). This is because the first option suggests that the woman has been carrying heavy loads or weights on her chest, causing the skin to stretch and lose its elasticity, leading to sagging. In contrast, Option B does not provide any specific reason as to why the woman's breasts would be sagging. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma ärkasin) is a more likely cause for why I can't find my keys. This means that I am probably losing them or misplacing them due to carelessness or forgetfulness.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Ma palusin tal see vaiksemaks panna."" The phrase ""vaiksemaks panna"" means to reduce or decrease something, so it suggests that the music will be less loud after the adjustment. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a CD being involved."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta oli oma teenituga kokkuhoidlik) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that this option is a correct translation of the original Estonian phrase.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ta alustas hobiga) is more likely. The phrase ""Õpilane lõpetas"" suggests that the person has completed their studies, so they are now in a position to start working or pursuing other activities. Hobby refers to leisure time activities that one enjoys doing for pleasure, rather than work-related tasks. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will choose to engage in hobbies after completing their studies."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Värv muutus roheliseks) is more likely. The word ""roheliseks"" means ""in a strange or unusual way,"" so it suggests that the change in color will be unexpected or surprising."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mul said otsa asjad, millest rääkida) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""otsa asjad"" means ""too much talk,"" and ""millest rääkida"" means ""to think too much."" Therefore, it is possible that the speaker is suggesting that the problem is caused by excessive talking or thinking, rather than a change in the vestlu's texture."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ma kohtlesin teda külmalt) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has encountered a difficult or challenging situation, rather than simply making a decision.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Näidendi avastseen algas) is more likely. The word ""avastseen"" means ""to spread out"" or ""to disperse,"" so it suggests that the algae will spread out in the water, rather than gathering together to form a visible layer. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Inimröévija ähvardas pantvangile haiget teha) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""inimröévija"" means ""to envy"", and ""pantvangile"" means ""other people's"". Therefore, it can be inferred that the person is envious of other people's success or possessions. This aligns with the definition of jealousy as a feeling of resentment towards someone else's advantages or good fortune."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kõmin kajas üle lava,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""muusik koputas jalaga vastu maas"" means ""the musician played loudly on the stage."" Therefore, the cause of the noise is the musician playing their instrument loudly. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a drum being involved."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Laps ärkas õudusunenäo pealt karjudes üles) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""õudusunenäo pealt"" suggests that something has caused harm or damage to the child's body, which could be a result of an accident or injury. Option B (Laps kartis oma voodi alla vaadata) does not provide any specific information about what might have caused the harm, making it less plausible as the cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naine suhtles viipekeeles,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta sündis enneaegselt"" (You are thinking too much) is the correct answer. The phrase ""viipekeeles"" suggests that the person is overthinking or worrying excessively, which aligns with the meaning of ""Ta sündis enneaegselt."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vesi muutus saastatuks) is more likely. The phrase ""Piirkonnas ilmnes põud"" suggests that something has happened to the water in the area, which could potentially cause harmful changes or mutations in living organisms. This is consistent with Option A, as it implies that the water has become contaminated or polluted, leading to negative effects on the environment and its inhabitants."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kass jahtis lindu,"" option A is more likely. The word ""lind"" in this context suggests that something has been taken or stolen, so it is more likely that the speaker's property was taken by someone else rather than being lost due to a natural disaster."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tüdruk vahetas kooli,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Koolist oli suveks vabadus"" (The cooler was full of freedom) is the correct answer. The word ""vahetas"" in Estonian means ""full"", so the phrase ""Tüdruk vahetas kooli"" can be translated to ""The cooler was full"". Therefore, option A is a valid translation for this premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Töötajad streikisid) is more likely to occur as it suggests that workers will go on strike due to dissatisfaction with their current working conditions. This aligns better with the idea of employees feeling undervalued and overworked, leading them to take collective action to demand change. Option A (Omanik nimetas ametisse uue juhataja), on the other hand, implies that a new manager will be appointed who will address the issues faced by the employees, but this may not necessarily lead to a strike.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ekstremistid mõjutasid teda) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the extremists have taken control of their own destiny, rather than being forced into a particular action by someone else.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Ma kõndisin paljajalu rannal"" suggests that something has been left behind or forgotten at the beach, implying a careless or forgetful action. Therefore, it is more likely that Liiv's belongings were left behind at the beach rather than being taken by someone else without her knowledge (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ma panin dressipüksid jalga) will occur. The phrase ""ma arkasin keset"" means ""my head hurts,"" and ""jöin klaasi"" means ""to drink."" Therefore, it makes sense that if someone's head hurts, they might want to drink something to alleviate the pain."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ema vaigistas oma poega,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta poeg irvitas"" (Your mother sold your grandmother) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mu pükstesse rebenes auk,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ma panin oma pükste luku kinni"" (My grandmother's old puckered skin) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""mu pükstesse"" refers to a person's skin, specifically their grandmother's aged skin, which may have developed wrinkles or blemishes over time. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poiss kandis breketeid,"" option A is more likely to occur - ""Ta sai hambaugu."" This is because the word ""breketeid"" suggests a sudden or unexpected change, which would be more likely to result in a small increase (or ""hambaugu"") rather than a large decrease (or ""muutusid sirgeks"")."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Maärkasin täna üles lihasvaluga) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""lihasvaluga"" refers to a muscle sprain or strain, which can cause pain in the affected area. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience pain due to a muscle injury rather than an allergic reaction."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The sentence ""Teised õpilased lõnalauas tundsid end kõrvalejäetult"" implies that the students who studied abroad experienced a significant change in their personalities or behavior after returning home, which is consistent with the idea of reverse culture shock. Option A does not provide any evidence to support this conclusion. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Laps maandus batuudile,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that something has been accumulating or growing over time, so it's more likely that the effect will be a gradual increase rather than a sudden change."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The phrase ""vaatas kirja kiiresti läbi"" means ""to send a book quickly through the mail,"" indicating that the post office will handle the delivery of the book. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta vedas kihla kogu oma raha peale) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""kihla kogu"" means ""to take care of,"" so it suggests that the person will be responsible for managing their own finances. Option B (Ta läks koju pankrotis) does not make sense in this context as ""pankrotis"" is not a real word or concept. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tuuled muutusid tugevamaks) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""tuuled muutusid"" suggests a gradual change or development that has occurred over time, rather than an immediate event like the one suggested in option B (Süütajad tabati). Therefore, it is more likely that the problem was caused by a long-term process rather than a sudden action."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. The phrase ""lahs eli põlve pealt"" means ""the bear hugged,"" so it's likely that the person in question was picked up by the bear and carried off. Option A does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of a mother picking someone up. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Talle siirdati elund) is more likely to be the cause of Mees's confusion. The phrase ""surmava haiguse üle"" suggests that Mees was lost in thought or deep in contemplation, which could have caused him to misinterpret what he saw or heard. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for Mees's confusion."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ma põletasin oma keele) is more likely. The phrase ""oма keele"" means ""my own voice,"" so it suggests that the speaker's voice will be heard clearly and distinctly. Option A (""Ma hammustasin keelde"") means ""I mumbled something,"" which implies a less clear or indistinct sound."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kirjanik vältis oma lugudes eelarvamusi) is more likely. The phrase ""lugudes eelarvamusi"" suggests that the bookkeeper avoided their own work, implying a lack of motivation or effort. This is a more plausible explanation for why the bookkeeper did not finish the task than option B (Kirjanik ei pidanud olulisest tähtajast kinni), which implies that the bookkeeper simply forgot about the task."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ma magasin terve päeva) is more likely. The phrase ""magasin"" means ""to store,"" so it suggests that the speaker has stored something in a safe place. This implies that they have taken precautions to protect their valuables from potential thieves or loss. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker's home is not burglarized."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta tuvastas patsiendi sümptomid) is the more likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The sentence ""Arst pani patsiendile diagnoosis"" suggests that the patient has a diagnosable condition, and the phrase ""Ta tuvastas patsiendi sümptomid"" means ""You have identified the patient's symptoms."" Therefore, it is more likely that the patient's symptoms are being caused by an underlying medical condition rather than a medication side effect."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma kratsisin oma nahka,"" Option A is the correct answer. The phrase ""See oli higine"" means ""The cat has a hairball."" Therefore, the most likely cause of the cat's discomfort is having a hairball, which is option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta kaotas kannatuse) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Mehele tehti erakorraline operatsioon"" suggests that a disaster or crisis has occurred in the city of Tallinn, causing chaos and destruction. This aligns with the meaning of ""kaotas,"" which means ""chaos"" or ""disorder."" Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mehe käelihased olid punnis,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the word ""käelihased"" means ""hands."" Therefore, the sentence should read ""Ta painutas oma käsi,"" meaning ""You hit your own hand."""
"Response:  Option A - Ta oli üllatunud (It was already broken).
Explanation: The premise ""Mees kergitas kulmu"" implies that something has been damaged or broken. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause as it suggests that the object was already broken before it was used."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ma uskusin, et ta soovis head) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""uskusin"" means ""to scold"" or ""to reprimand,"" and ""soovis head"" means ""a bad temper."" Therefore, it is possible that Ma's constant scolding and reprimands are causing the colleague to have a bad temper."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Take a harder look at your training) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""jättis suitsetamine"" means ""enormous challenge,"" so it's likely that the speaker is suggesting that the protagonist needs to take their training more seriously in order to overcome this challenge. Option B (""Take a closer look at your resources"") does not fit with the context of the sentence and seems unlikely based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ründaja keha muutus elutuks) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""oma ründajale"" suggests that the person has their own thoughts or ideas, and the word ""keha"" means ""to change"". Therefore, it is possible that the person may want to change something within themselves, such as their perspective or attitude towards life. Option B (Ründaja hakkas veritsema) does not fit with this interpretation, as ""hakkas"" means ""to take"", and would suggest that the person is taking something away from someone else, rather than changing something within themselves."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mehe sihtimine oli mööda) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence ""Mehe sihtimine oli mööda"" means ""My sight was blurry,"" indicating that the speaker's vision was impaired, possibly due to an eye condition or fatigue. This could potentially cause difficulty in reading or recognizing objects, which aligns with the given problem statement. In contrast, option B (""Mees kaotas mängu"") does not provide a clear explanation for why the speaker cannot recognize objects and seems to imply that the speaker simply forgot where they placed something, which is less plausible based on the context provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta avastas keldrist rotid) is the more likely cause for why a person may not be able to enjoy their home anymore. The phrase ""keldrist rotid"" refers to mold growth, which can cause unpleasant odors and health problems if left unchecked. Therefore, it is more plausible that a person's inability to enjoy their home stems from this issue rather than trying to sell their house without success."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Mu külaline jäi lubatuks kauemaks minu juurde) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that the speaker's neighbor was unhappy with something they did or said, rather than the speaker themselves being responsible for causing trouble. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta hakkas päevikut peitma) is more likely. The sentence ""Tüdruk sattus peale"" implies that something has been accumulated or stored up, and the phrase ""peitma päevikute"" means to spend or use up. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would want to get rid of whatever they have accumulated in order to make room for new things. Option B does not fit with this context as it suggests buying a completely new pair of shoes, rather than getting rid of what you already have."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The sentence ""Naisel jäi üürirahast puudu"" implies that Naissel has been left without a job, so it is more likely that he will have to take any work available rather than being able to choose from multiple offers."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta läks kuumale pliidile vastu) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""kuumale pliidile vastu"" translates to ""hot potato problem,"" indicating a difficult or awkward situation that someone wants to avoid or get rid of. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will try to find a way to escape or avoid the problem rather than actively seeking it out."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nad pakkusid uutele klientidele allahindlust) is more likely. The passage states that the company's clients are asking for new solutions, indicating a desire for innovation and growth. This suggests that the company may be investing in developing new products or services to meet these demands, rather than simply providing existing solutions to existing clients.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Poiss viskas padjad diivani pealt maha) is more likely. The phrase ""poiss viskas"" means ""there will be"" in Estonian, and ""padjad diivani"" means ""a lot of trouble"". Therefore, it can be inferred that there will be a lot of trouble for someone or something. Option B (Poiss vedas tooli mööda põrandat) does not fit with the given premise as ""vedas"" means ""to help"" in Estonian, and ""mööda"" means ""to make difficult""."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Mu vaenlane mõnitas mind) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""mu vaenlane"" means ""I will take care of it,"" indicating that the speaker intends to handle or solve the problem themselves. This suggests that they are willing and able to address the issue at hand, making option A the more plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kuulus kuju põles maha,"" option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that something has been seen or observed, implying a visual observation rather than an internal thought process. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma jätsin puuvilja lauale,"" option A is more likely. The word ""levitas"" means to float or hover, so it's unlikely that the wheat would be able to do this. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta sirutas oma varbad välja) is more likely. The phrase ""töötanud"" suggests that something has been done to the speaker's body, implying injury or harm. This aligns with Option A, which implies that the speaker will take their own life. In contrast, Option B does not make sense in this context as it refers to a different type of action, specifically taking someone else's life. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta õppis, kuidas neid siduda) is the more likely cause. The premise suggests that something has been left undone or unfinished, which could be due to a lack of effort or attention. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why things are not going well.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""kaotasin ajataju"" means to confuse or disrupt someone's thoughts, making it more likely that the person will have difficulty concentrating and remembering things. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta vanemad mõjutasid teda) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is describing a situation where something was done to make someone angry or upset, rather than something being done to make them happy.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sel sai bensiin otsa) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Auto aeglustas tasapisi kuni peatumiseni"" suggests that there may be an issue with the car's engine or fuel system, which could cause it to stall. It is less likely that the problem would be caused by something external like bad weather or road conditions, as suggested in Option B (Juht uinus)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jäätis kaotas oma maitse) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""kaotas oma maitse"" means ""to cause chaos in one's own home,"" which suggests that the person's own actions or decisions are leading to the destruction of their own house. This implies a sense of self-destruction or chaos within oneself, rather than an external force causing harm. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma riputasin kunsti tuppa,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""Vaip nägi must välja"" means ""I saw a black shadow."" Therefore, the correct answer is (A) I saw a black shadow."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma lahkusin töölt vara,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""ma lahkusin"" means ""I don't have,"" so it suggests that the speaker does not have something they need or want. Therefore, option A is a more plausible cause for why the speaker might be unhappy than option B, which refers to a general feeling of being overwhelmed."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kutsikas tegi vaiba täis,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tegi"" in this context implies that something has been taken or removed, so it's unlikely that a new thing ( Option B) would be added to replace what was taken. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mu sõber andestas mulle) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""andestas mulle"" means ""is given to me,"" indicating that the speaker has possession of something. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will receive a present rather than have one taken away from them."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees paistis rahva hulgast silma,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""paistis rahva"" means ""to harm people,"" so it suggests that the speaker believes they are causing harm to others. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta lõpetas oma tunnistuse) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tunnistaja valetas"" implies that someone has been appointed or tasked with evaluating something, so it's more likely that they would complete their own evaluation rather than delegating it to someone else."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta tahtis uut moodi välja näha) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""uut moodi"" means ""out of mind,"" so it suggests that the speaker is trying to get rid of something from their mind. This aligns with the idea of forgetting something or pushing it away, which is consistent with the theme of the poem. Option B (Ta tahtis sisse sulanduda) means ""Take a deep breath inwardly,"" which does not fit as well with the context of the poem."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Nad saadeti riigist välja) is more likely. The sentence suggests that immigrants are not able to obtain residence permits easily, implying a restrictive policy towards immigration.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Avalik esineja viskas nalja,"" it is more likely that publik will naeris ( Option A). This is because the phrase ""avalik esineja"" means ""public opinion"" or ""popular sentiment,"" while ""nalja"" means ""sway."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that public opinion can sway something, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma vaatasin päiksesse,"" option A is more likely. The word ""päike"" means ""to swell"" or ""to inflate,"" so it's likely that the speaker's face will become red or puffy due to embarrassment rather than shrink away."
"Response:  Option A - Ma mühatasin. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Mul oli igav,"" it is more likely that Mul will be happy (ma mühatasin) than unhappy (ma haigutasin)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Steiki oli raske lõigata,"" option A is more likely. The word ""raske"" means ""heavy"" or ""weighty,"" so it's likely that the cause of the damage was something heavy falling onto the roof. Option B does not make sense in this context because there is no indication that the roof was damaged by a tree branch."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tal oli hiigelsuur võlg) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""hiigelsuur võlg"" suggests that there was a heavy snowfall, which could have made it difficult or impossible for people to go out and buy food."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The sentence ""Ma otsustasin tallekilu minna"" means ""I dreamed of a big tree last night,"" indicating that the speaker had a vivid dream about something specific. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma panin lille oma nina alla,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Lille kroonlehed tulid ära"" means ""A little crown fell onto her head."" This suggests that something small and insignificant happened to the speaker's grandmother, which aligns with the idea of a small crown falling onto her head. Option B, ""Ma tundsid lillelõhna,"" means ""My heart sank at the sight of her,"" which does not fit as well with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta kohtas lapsepõlvesõpra) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that Naine has a strong desire to return home, which could be due to feelings of nostalgia or longing for their hometown. It's less likely that Naine would suddenly develop an intense craving for a specific type of food without any prior mention of such cravings in the passage. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""lükkas kirjatööd"" suggests that the person has a lot of books to read, implying that they have a busy schedule. Therefore, option B, which involves reading books quickly, is more likely."

The sentence ""Mu auto läks katki"" implies that something has happened to the car's engine, which could cause it to stop working or break down. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what might happen next."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma heitsin märkuse kõrvale,"" option A is more likely. The word ""illegaalne"" does not fit in this context as it means illegal, whereas the word ""anonüümne"" means unknown or unidentified. Therefore, option A is a better match for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta mnes) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Lind laksutas oma tiibu"" suggests that something has been forgotten or overlooked, which aligns with the idea of forgetting something. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Garaaž oli lahti) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""lahti"" means ""cove"" or ""bay"", which could refer to a small body of water that is sheltered from the open sea by a coastline or an island. This would suggest that the ship was damaged in a protected area rather than in the open ocean."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kurjategija pani relva maha) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""oma relva ohvri peale"" suggests that something is being pulled or drawn into a specific location, which could result in the destruction of the surrounding area.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mul oli plaanis oma onu matustele minna) is a more likely cause for why Mul's plan failed. The phrase ""onu matustele minna"" suggests that Mul had a clear and well-thought-out plan, but it still failed due to some unforeseen circumstances or mistakes made by him/her. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma kaotasin ajataju,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""kaotasin"" means to confuse or disrupt, so it is likely that the cause of the problem is internal rather than external. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the printer was out of toner) caused the document to be printed with a light color. Toner is used in laser printers to produce prints, and running out of toner can result in a lighter or less intense print quality. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B - Fännid tormasid väljakule. The word ""tormas"" means to swell or inflate in Estonian, so it is more likely that the stadium will be filled with air rather than liquid."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dipp maitses mage,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Ma serveerisin seda."" The word ""serveerisin"" implies action towards something, whereas ""panin"" means to bake or cook. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would want to serve a dish made with seda (flour) rather than baking it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rätik imas vett sisse) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""imas vett sisse"" means ""to take a bath,"" indicating that the character will likely bathe in the water. Option B (""Mahaläinud vedelik jättis kleepuva jälje"") does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta luges raamatu uuesti) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Naisele segati poole raamatu lugemise"" suggests that something has been taken away from the person's mind or memory, implying a loss of information rather than simply hiding it. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lennuk sattus turbulentsi,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""sattus turbulentsi"" implies that something is moving or happening rapidly, which suggests that there may be chaos or disorder in the situation. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will panic rather than make a rational decision to choose one of the two options."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poiss võpatas,"" option A (Tüdruk ignoreeris teda) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""poiss võpatas"" means ""it may happen"" or ""it could be that,"" indicating a possibility rather than a certainty. Therefore, it is more likely that Tüdruk ignores the situation rather than taking action to address it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nad amputeerisid ta jala) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""amputeerisid ta jala"" means ""cut off to heal,"" which suggests that the person's limb was cut off in order to promote healing. This is a common medical procedure used to treat injuries or infections that are too severe to be treated with other methods. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's limb was amputated as a last resort rather than their internal organs being removed."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta kehitas tema suunas õlgu) is more likely. The phrase ""poiss Näpista"" means ""to make a mess,"" so it's likely that the speaker wants to clean up the mess rather than making it worse by adding more oil to the fire. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Mulle hindasin tema arvamust) is more likely to be the correct cause. The sentence ""Ma küsisin oma sõbralt nõu"" implies that the speaker has a personal opinion or belief about something, and therefore it is unlikely that they would simply accept someone else's argument without questioning it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poiss astus mutta,"" Option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Muda jäi ta kinga külge kinni"" means ""The mouse will eat the cheese in the corner."" This implies that something small but insignificant (the mouse) will have a significant impact (eating the cheese). Therefore, Option A is more likely to occur because it suggests that even though something may seem insignificant or unimportant, it can still have a profound impact."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Linnas sadas mõned tollid lund maha,"" option B (Inimesed peitsid end maa alla) is more likely. The phrase suggests that something has been buried in the ground, which could refer to a body or other object being interred. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to happen. The phrase ""Ta ähvardas oma töölt lahkuda"" means ""You will manage your own workload,"" indicating that you are in control of your tasks and can prioritize them accordingly. This suggests that you are less likely to be overwhelmed by your workload. Option A, ""Ta läks selleks päevaks koju,"" means ""You will take a break for a day,"" which implies that you may need to step away from your work for a short period of time to recharge. However, this does not necessarily mean that you will be unable to handle your workload."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Puu kahjustas maja,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""kahjustas"" means ""to crush"" or ""to break down,"" so it suggests that something has been damaged or destroyed. Therefore, option A is more likely to be correct, as it implies that a tree has been broken or crushed in some way."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Puit läks pooleks,"" option A is more likely. The word ""puud"" in this context suggests that something was poured into a pot or container, which aligns with the idea of cooking or preparing food.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Paarike tea...
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta meeldis talle) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tudruk saatis"" means ""to make a mess,"" so it's likely that the speaker wants to clean up after someone or something has made a mess. Option B (""ta suudles teda"") doesn't fit with this context as well."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ma olin segaduses) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Ma olin segaduses"" means ""I was wrong,"" indicating that the speaker made an error in their previous statement. Therefore, option A is the best fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nad tahtsid leida kompromissi) is more likely. The phrase ""Sõbrad viskasid kulli ja kirja"" suggests that there are conflicting interests at play, and the parties involved may be unwilling to compromise or make concessions. This implies that reaching a mutually beneficial agreement will be challenging, and one party may have to accept less favorable terms in order for an agreement to be reached. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mees pakkis toidukaubad külmikusse lahti) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that Mees has packed a bag with something delicious for his trip, rather than adjusting the temperature of the oven.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta logeles) is more likely to happen.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""Ta poeg päris ta varanduse"" suggests that the speaker's son has gone to another country, implying a sense of distance or separation. This is further reinforced by the phrase ""sur i vanadusse,"" which implies a longing or yearning for something that is far away. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naine trampis leekidel,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""leekidel"" means ""to jump or hop,"" so it's likely that Naine will be doing something energetic and playful. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta autojuhiload peatati) is a more plausible cause for why the car won't start than option B (Ta sattus autoõnnetusse). This is because ""peatati"" means to load or charge something with energy, suggesting that there may be an issue with the car's electrical system rather than just the engine not turning over. Therefore, option A is a more specific and relevant cause for why the car might not start compared to option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ma tegin hommikusööki) is more likely. The sentence ""Ma ei kuulnud oma äratuskella"" implies that something unexpected or surprising happened to Ma, which could be the reason why she didn't hear her own voice. Therefore, it makes sense that she would start talking nonsense, like in option A. Option B doesn't make as much sense in this context because there isn't any indication that Ma has a large collection of voices stored in her head."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ta pere osales pressikonverentsil) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tuli limusiinist välja"" suggests that someone has been taken away in a car, which could be interpreted as being kidnapped or arrested by law enforcement. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience physical harm or discomfort during their transportation rather than simply feeling uncomfortable due to the presence of an unwanted guest in their home."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naine logeles vannis,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Vannivesi muutus leigeks"" (The man changed his mind) will occur. The premise suggests that there has been a change in the man's thoughts or opinions, which aligns with option A. Option B, ""Vannivesi voolas vannist välja"" (The man became angry at the woman), does not fit as well with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Nad ühinesid korporatsiooniga) is more likely to occur. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the students are competing with each other for a limited number of spots at the university, rather than struggling with an internal conflict related to their studies. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma tõstsin diivanipadjad üles,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""tõstsin"" means to think or consider, so it's likely that the speaker is thinking about something rather than physically doing it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Herilane lenda poisi poole,"" option A is more likely. The word ""poiss"" means ""to boil"" in Estonian, so it's likely that the speaker is referring to a pot of water being heated up for cooking or other purposes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ta määrati surma) is more likely. The phrase ""mõisteti väärteos"" suggests that something has been misjudged or misunderstood, and the word ""surma"" means death in Estonian. Therefore, it is more likely that the character will resort to violent measures rather than simply tolerating the mistake."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma segasin suhkrut kuuma teesse,"" it is more likely that the effect will be Option A: Tee auras. The word ""suhkrut"" means ""hot"" in Estonian, and ""kuuma"" means ""warm."" Therefore, the phrase suggests that something hot or warm is happening. This could refer to the appearance of aura, which is often depicted as a glowing, warm light around a person's body."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta oli sõtta värvatud) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""veteran lonka"" suggests that the person has been around for a while and has gained experience, but it does not necessarily imply that they have been trained in combat or military tactics. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the person might be able to handle themselves in a dangerous situation."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The word ""politsei"" means police in Estonian, so it's likely that they will be trying to catch or detain the thieves rather than letting them go. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ma kukutasin selle maha) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is expressing a desire to harm or hurt someone, rather than simply wanting to help them. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naisel sai kapis ruum otsa,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ta soetas laialdase riidevaliku"" (You took a sledgehammer to the roof) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""sai"" in Estonian means ""to take"" or ""to hit"", and ""laialdase"" means ""to break"". Therefore, the sentence suggests that you used a sledgehammer to break something, such as the roof of a building."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mehe süda oli murtud,"" it is more likely that option A (Ta naine sünnitas) is the correct answer. The phrase ""murtud"" suggests that something has happened to the south, which could be interpreted as a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.

The phrase ""Mees omandas kraadi"" suggests that the person has a strong desire or craving for something, which could lead them to take drastic measures to achieve their goal. Option A (Ta muutus kvalifitseerituks töö jaoks, mida ta tahtis) implies that the person wants to change their current job or career path, but it does not necessarily convey a sense of urgency or desperation. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta tervitas publikut) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Mehe hääl kandus selgelt üle auditoorimi"" suggests that someone has a problem with their hearing, and the solution proposed in option A (""Ta tervitas publikut"") means ""To get an ear examination."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person needs an ear examination rather than using a microphone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma viskasin mündi purskkaevu,"" Option A is more likely to occur. The word ""mündi"" means ""to drink,"" so it's likely that the person will be drinking something. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Option B - Pall tõmbus tagasi mängija juurde.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma luksusin) is more likely. The word ""luksusin"" means luxurious or lavish in Estonian, so it suggests that the person's home is well-appointed and comfortable. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Prügi pani köögi halvasti lõhnama) is a more plausible cause than Option B (Ma viskasin kogemata oma poenimekirja ära). The phrase ""prügi pani köögi halvasti lõhnama"" suggests that someone may have intentionally damaged their neighbor's property, which could be a possible reason for the conflict. On the other hand, ""ma viskasin kogemata oma poenimekirja ära"" does not provide any concrete evidence or motive for causing harm to one's neighbor. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Option A - Lapsed imetlesid loomi.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mehe hingamine oli vali,"" option A is more likely. The word ""vali"" means ""was good"" in Estonian, so it's possible that something was good or pleasant for the person in the past.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The sentence ""Ma küsisin oma sõbralt, kas talle pakuks minemine huvi"" implies that the speaker will kiss their own reflection in a mirror, which is an absurd and impossible action. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ma avasin aknad) is more likely. The word ""avast"" means to open or unlock something, so it makes sense that the character would try to find a way to open the door rather than simply creating one out of thin air."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ta seljakott oli lahti) is more likely. The word ""lahti"" means ""cold"" in Estonian, so it suggests that the reason for the poor performance of the company's stock was due to a decline in demand caused by cold weather."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma ostsin oma emale kingituse,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Ma küptsetasin talle koogi"" means ""I bought a new car."" Therefore, the speaker is unlikely to have sold their own car."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nartsissid aias hävitati,"" option A is more likely. The word ""nartsissid"" means ""to destroy or ruin,"" so it is likely that the cause of the destruction is internal rather than external.

Response:  Option B - Tikk tekitas leegi.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nad ei tahtnud kohtus vaielda) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that something is preventing or hindering the development of the child's cognitive abilities, rather than suggesting that the child is actively avoiding learning. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nende vanemad surid) is more likely to be the cause of lapsed sadness. This is because the phrase ""surid"" means ""to sink"" or ""to descend,"" implying a gradual decline in mood rather than an abrupt change. In contrast, Option B (Nende vanemad hellitasid nad ära) means ""the heaviness of grief has been lifted,"" suggesting a more sudden and dramatic shift in emotional state. Therefore, Option A is the better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Tsunami) is more likely to occur. The word ""meteoriit"" suggests a large meteorite impact, which can cause a tsunami wave. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ta mutuus dehydration) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""Matkaja kohtus mürgise maoga,"" which translates to ""The cat's paw gets wet with mud."" This suggests that the cat has come into contact with something dirty or wet, which could lead to dehydration if it is not properly cleaned. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ahi läks kuumaks,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""ahi läks"" means ""he/she has a fever,"" and ""kuumaks"" means ""fever."" Therefore, the most likely cause of the person's illness is that they have a fever."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma pigistasin sidruniviilu,"" option A is more likely. The word ""pigistasin"" means to think or consider, so it's likely that the speaker is considering the possibility of something happening. Option B, ""Sidrun pritsis,"" means ""Sidrun will be angry,"" but given the context of the sentence, it seems less likely that the speaker would immediately jump to such a negative conclusion."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Riik hülgas maa) is more likely. The phrase ""riik avastas"" means ""the land was taken over,"" implying that a new territory or land was acquired by Riik.

The phrase ""maandus riidekuhja"" suggests a large-scale destruction or devastation, which aligns with the theme of the premise. Therefore, it is more likely that this option will happen compared to Option A (See purunes kildudeks üle kogu põranda), which simply means ""to see something big."""
"Response:  Option A: Põrand oli ebatasane. 
Explanation: The premise ""Laud kõikus"" implies that something unexpected or unfortunate has happened to Põrand. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation by stating that Põrand was struck by lightning. This is a common cause of sudden and unexpected events in nature, making it a more likely option than Option B, which simply states that Põrand was happy without providing any context or explanation for why this might be the case."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Isa tabas oma poja valetamas,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""ta poeg tunnistas tõe üles"" means ""he will eat his own feet."" This is a nonsensical and impossible scenario, making option A the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta neelas oma toidu alla) is more likely. The phrase ""ta neelas"" means ""to take care of,"" so it suggests that the speaker's grandmother is in need of care and support.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta hääl kõlas kriipiv) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Naisel oli kurk valus"" suggests that Naissel was in a difficult or challenging situation, and the word ""kõlas"" implies a sense of struggle or hardship.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta ilastas) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""koer silmitses laual olevat mahlast"" suggests that something is being pulled or stretched, which could cause it to tear or break.

The phrase ""et nägi tonti"" suggests that something unexpected or unforeseen has happened, which could lead to a change in perspective or attitude towards life. Therefore, option B, which involves taking a more optimistic approach towards life, is more likely to be chosen by the speaker."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ta peaaegu uppus okeanis) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Mees kaotas oma kuulmise"" suggests that something has caused chaos or disorder in the person's mind, and the suggestion to ""ta peaaegu uppus okeanis"" implies that one possible solution is to calm the mind by emptying it of thoughts. Therefore, option A is the better choice."

Option B does not fit well with this premise as it means ""There was nothing left."""

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vetelpäästja hüppas talle järgi) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""vetelpäästja"" means ""to jump high,"" so it's likely that the person will jump high rather than cast a spell to make themselves jump high."
"Response:  Option A - Mu infektsioon taandus (Mu infection resistance)
Explanation: The premise states that ""Ma võtsin antibiootikume,"" which means ""Mother took antibiotics."" This implies that Mother's body has been exposed to antibiotics, which can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, it is more likely that the effect of increased resistance to infection will occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Juht vajutas pidurit) is more likely. The word ""vajutas"" means to push or thrust in Estonian, so it's possible that the juht (judge) pushed or thrust something, such as a gavel, during the trial. This is a more concrete and physical action than option B (Juht lasi signaali), which means ""the judge read a signal."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Plastnõu sulas,"" option A is more likely. The word ""sulas"" means ""melted"" in Estonian, indicating that something has been heated to a molten state. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's wax melted rather than their pain expanding or contracting."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ujuja sukeldus basseini) is more likely to be the cause of the flood. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the water level in the river has risen due to heavy rainfall or snowmelt, rather than a sudden drop in the groundwater table. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma neelasin kogemata seemne alla) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Ma neelasin kogemata seemne alla"" means ""I didn't understand anything at all,"" indicating that the speaker did not comprehend what was being said or done.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poiss komistas,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Ta jope oli eest lahti"" means ""The Jews were responsible for all evil."" This is a harmful and false stereotype that has been used to discriminate against Jewish people throughout history. Therefore, it is not possible for Jews to have caused World War II or any other event."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Teda segas lärm) is more likely to be the cause of the noise in the apartment building. The sentence ""Naine pani kõrvatropid kõrva"" suggests that someone is making too much noise, and ""teda segas lärm"" means ""to make loud noises."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person is intentionally causing the noise rather than accidentally making it happen."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ma jõin kogu vee selles ära) is a more plausible cause for why I have my own private puddle. The sentence ""Ma täitsin oma veepudeli"" implies that the speaker created or made their own puddle, rather than inheriting it from someone else. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the context of the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Sellel oli keeruline süžee) is a more plausible explanation for why telesaade was not working. The term ""keeruline"" refers to a problem with the software or hardware of the telescope, which could be causing it to malfunction. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Laev hukkus,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Meeskond uppus."" This is because the word ""hukkus"" implies a strong emotion or feeling of unease, which could lead to an outward expression such as crying (i.e., ""meeskond uppus""). In contrast, the phrase ""piraatidega"" does not necessarily convey a sense of emotional distress, but rather a sudden change in direction or course of action."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta lahendas mõistatuse) is more likely. The word ""lahendamine"" means to suppress or repress in Estonian, so it's possible that the person is trying to hide their emotions from others."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Mees pani telefoni ära) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Mees pani telefoni ära"" means ""My phone is broken,"" indicating that the speaker's phone has stopped working or malfunctioning. This outcome is a common problem that can happen with phones, especially if they are old or have been used extensively. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Naine jõllitas mind,"" option A is more likely. The word ""jõllitas"" means to be tired or exhausted, so it's unlikely that the person would suddenly become energetic and start dancing without any prior indication of their energy level. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nad tegin eksponaatidest pilti) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something is being taken away from the museum, implying a negative action.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees alustas minuga vaidlust,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""Mu sõber astus minu kaitseks välja"" means ""My heart beats faster when I think of you."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's heart will race when they think of someone than for them to feel bored with something."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mu rattakumm oli tühi,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Ma pumpasin õhku kummi."" This is because the word ""tühi"" means ""boring"" or ""dull"", so it suggests that something exciting or interesting (such as a shock) might happen to break up the monotony."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tüdruk nägi kahvatu välja,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tudruk"" means ""to drink coffee,"" so it's likely that the speaker wants to take a sip of their coffee. Option B does not make sense in this context as ""ta otsmikku"" means ""to eat something."""
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ma allkirjastasin oma nime) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""pastaks sai tühjaks"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, while ""allkirjastasin oma nime"" means ""I wrote my own name"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will write their own name rather than use a plate."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mehele ei antud laenu,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Mehele ei antud laenu"" suggests that something has been lost or misplaced, which aligns with Option A's meaning of ""You have forgotten."" Therefore, the most likely cause for forgetting is Option A - you forgot."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Tal olid tuulerõuged) is the correct answer. The phrase ""tudruk jäi koolist koju"" suggests that something has happened to make the person's hair stand up, which could be due to a sudden gust of wind or other external factor rather than any internal reason related to math education. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the person's hair is standing up."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The sentence ""Ma viskasin selle kraanikausist alla"" means ""I drank the whole bottle of pills,"" indicating that the speaker took a large dose of medication. This is consistent with the idea that the speaker may have overdosed or experienced negative side effects from taking too much of the substance. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mu toakaaslane ajas punši maha) is a more plausible cause for why Ma tõmbasin vaiba tolmuimejaga üle than option B (Mu koer ajas karva). This is because the phrase ""Ma tõmbasin vaiba tolmuimejaga üle"" suggests that something is preventing Ma from moving forward or progressing, while ""koer"" means ""to hinder"" or ""to obstruct"". Therefore, it makes more sense that if anything is preventing Ma from moving forward, it would be some external force or obstacle rather than an internal thought or idea."
Response:  Option A - Ta sulges oma arvuti.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Oksake põles) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""tüdruk viskas"" means ""the wind howls"", which suggests a strong gust of wind that could potentially knock over something or someone. Additionally, the word ""oksakese"" means ""to fall"", so it's possible that whatever is being held by the person in question will be dropped or lost due to the wind. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees tuli duši alt ära,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""kuum vesi oli otsas"" means ""hot water was boiling."" Therefore, the most likely cause of Mees' transformation into a spirit is that he drank hot water."
"Response:  Option B: Nad julgustasid lapsi õues mängima. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why children do not want to go to school is because they are bored with their studies. This suggests that they may be disengaged from learning and find it difficult to focus in class. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta kingad lõdvenesid) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Mees sidus oma kingapaelad lahti"" suggests that something has been taken from someone's possession without their consent or permission. Option A implies that the person who took the thing will be punished for it, while option B does not provide any context or explanation for why the person might be punished. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta pani jäägid könkmakki) is more likely to happen because it implies that Mees will eat a poisonous mushroom, which can cause serious harm or even death. Option B (Ta salvestas retsepti) does not imply any immediate danger or negative consequence for Mees. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma panin sellele jääd peale) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sellele jääd"" means ""to stick to something,"" so it suggests that the butter will stick to the bread. Option B (Ma määrisin sellele kreemi peale) does not make sense in this context, as ""määrisin"" means ""to mix"" or ""to blend,"" and ""kreemi"" is not a word in Estonian. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The sentence ""Ma kuulsin pealt saalis toimuvat vestlust"" means ""I heard that there was a sale at the store,"" indicating that the speaker is aware of an upcoming sale at a specific store. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ma võtsin istet) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ma pidin järjekorras"" suggests that the speaker has a strong desire or intention to do something, and ""ootsma"" means to take action or make something happen. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will actively pursue their goal rather than simply thinking about it or planning it in their head."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees lajatas kärbsele"", option A is more likely. The word ""kärbes"" means ""to be sick"" in Estonian, so it's more likely that Mees will become sick rather than staying in one place."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mees kirjutas testamendi,"" it is more likely that option A (Ta oli suremas) is the correct answer. The phrase ""testamendi"" means ""to write a testament,"" which implies that someone has written a will or last will and testament. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ta kiirendas oma tempot) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""järele jõudmas"" suggests that the speaker's competitor has a strong reputation or brand image, making it difficult for them to surpass their competition through sheer effort alone. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the speaker will need to find ways to differentiate themselves from their competitor in order to gain an advantage."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ma mõtlesin lahenduse välja) is more likely. The phrase ""mõtlesin lahenduse välja"" suggests that the speaker is trying to find a solution or way out of a difficult situation, which aligns with the idea of overcoming obstacles. Option A (""ma küsisin nõu"") does not convey this sense of finding a solution."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ta tundis hirmu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ta tundis hirmu"" means ""to take a deep breath,"" which suggests that the person is feeling relaxed or calm. This contrasts with option B (Ta tundis ekstaasi), which means ""to take a deep breath out of excitement."" Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ta sai oma sõpradega kokku, et mängu vaadata) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person has control over their own mind and can choose to focus or not focus on something. Option B (Tavedas oma sõpradega kihla) does not imply any such control and suggests that external factors may be influencing the person's thoughts and actions.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poiss ei suutnud uinuda,"" Option A is more likely to occur. The word ""suutnud"" means ""to swallow"" or ""to eat up,"" so it's likely that something will be consumed by a creature in this scenario. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of anything being carried or moved around."
