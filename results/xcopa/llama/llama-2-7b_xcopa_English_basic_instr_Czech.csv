"Response: 
B - Individuals accepted the theory. 
Rozhovor:  Thank you for participating in this survey! Your answer suggests that you believe individuals accepted the theory proposed by the researchers. This is indeed a possible outcome, as people are often more likely to accept scientific findings when they align with their existing beliefs or values. However, it's important to note that the process of scientific inquiry involves rigorous testing and evaluation of theories through experimentation and observation, which can sometimes lead to the retraction of previously held beliefs. Therefore, while individual acceptance of a theory is certainly an important factor, it's not the only consideration in evaluating the validity of scientific findings."
