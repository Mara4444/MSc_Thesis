"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kuwi ore gampang rusak) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""dikemas ing bungkus gelembung"" suggests that the object is packaged in a plastic bag or container, which could potentially rupture or burst if it contains air pockets or other weaknesses. This would result in the object being damaged or broken easily. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngiris kanthongku,"" option A (aku njupuk sepur tiket) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the meaning of the premise. The word ""ngiris"" in Malay means ""to take out or remove,"" so it suggests that something has been taken out or removed from the container. Therefore, option A, which involves taking a ticket, is more consistent with the meaning of the premise than option B, which involves obtaining a weapon."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ulam-ulam mau ilang saka omah) is more likely to occur. This is because termites are known to feed on wood, and their presence can cause significant damage to wooden structures such as houses. Therefore, it is more likely that termites will eat away at the wooden beams and foundation of a house than for them to burrow into the walls made of cement or concrete.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Agen patroli mriksa pasporé) is more likely to happen because it uses a logical connection between the two clauses in the premise. The first clause ""Para wong lelungan"" refers to the location of the speaker's home, while the second clause ""tekan tapel wates"" means to hit or strike something hard. Therefore, the agency responsible for maintaining law and order in the area where the speaker lives is more likely to be involved in dealing with any illegal activities that may occur there. Option B, however, does not use a logical connection between the clauses and seems less plausible."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kantoré ditutup"", it is more likely that option A (Dina kuwi dina riyaya) is the correct answer. This is because ""ditutup"" means to close or shut something down, which suggests that there may be an obstruction or blockage preventing air from entering the room. Option B (""Wektu kuwi musim panas"") does not provide a clear explanation for why the air in the room would become hotter. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke main dam) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""bocah wadon kuwi"" suggests that the speaker is referring to a young child who is unable to walk or stand, while ""ora nduwé tenaga manèh"" implies that the child has lost its energy or strength. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would suggest that the child needs to rest or take a break, rather than suggesting that they need to work harder."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Akèh wong sing mlebu antrian) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong wadon kuwi ora ana ing antarané wong-wong sing nunggu"" suggests that there are many obstacles or challenges in the way of achieving one's goals, and ""akèh wong sing mlebu antrian"" means ""to overcome these obstacles."" Therefore, option A is a more appropriate response."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bayi iku ngguyu ing pipine) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngguyu ing pipine"" means ""to suck milk from a breast,"" indicating that the baby is feeding. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the mother's breasts are always full."
"Response: 
A) Para penonton padha tepuk tangan sakdurungé musik kuwi diwiwiti.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the audience will be physically attracted to the band's music and want to dance along with their hands clapping. The phrase ""padha tepuk tangan"" means ""to clap one's hands,"" indicating a physical response to the music. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bocah wadon mau tetep sekolah sakwisé sekolah kanggo detensi) is more likely to occur. The premise suggests that the boy wants to continue studying mathematics because he finds it interesting and enjoyable, indicating a desire for long-term commitment rather than a quick fix or shortcut. Option B (Bocah wadon iku nggawa apel kanggo guru) may suggest a temporary solution or a quick fix, but it does not convey the same level of dedication or interest in the subject as option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Konselor kampé nyritakké crita bab hantu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""konselor kampé"" suggests that someone is trying to convince or persuade another person to do something, while ""nyritakké crita"" implies a sense of urgency or importance. Additionally, ""bab hantu"" means ""human being,"" suggesting that the speaker is addressing a specific individual. This contrasts with option B (Wong-wong kuwi nggoreng marshmallow ing geni), which seems to be a nonsensical phrase with no clear meaning or context. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué dadi bingung) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""dheweke"" means ""to confuse"" or ""to make someone confused,"" which aligns with the meaning of the Indonesian sentence ""Wong lanang iku ngethok sirahé."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is feeling confused due to the complexity of the situation. Option B (Dheweke ngalami geger otak) does not fit well with the given premise as ""ngalami"" means ""to understand"" or ""to comprehend,"" which contradicts the idea of confusion."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the cause of the increased cost of living is a rise in income taxes (Option B). The statement ""Cek sing tak tulis ore di bayar"" suggests that there has been an increase in the amount of money needed to cover basic expenses, such as food and rent, which could be caused by a variety of factors including inflation or changes in government policies. However, given the context of the sentence, it seems more plausible that the increase in cost of living is due to a change in the tax system rather than a general increase in prices."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke mbusak spam) is more likely to occur. The sentence ""Kotak mlebu emailé wong lanang kuwi kebak spam"" suggests that someone's email account has been hacked or compromised, leading to an increase in spam emails being sent from their account. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's email account will be flooded with spam messages rather than them actively deleting their own emails."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué kena penyakit kuwi) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in this option suggest that it is a more plausible explanation for why the pelaut kuwi is being held at the quarantine station. Option B (Dhèwèqué pulih saka lelara iku) does not flow as smoothly from the premise and seems less relevant to the context.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué maca ing njéro àti) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""ngapalaké kode kuwi"" suggests that something has been taken away or hidden, which could refer to a physical object or an idea. The word ""maca"" in this context means ""to take,"" so it's possible that someone took something without permission. Option B (Dheweke lali nulis) does not fit as well with the given premise, as ""lali"" means ""money"" and ""nulis"" means ""to pay."" Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngudhunaké banyu ing gelas,"" option A is more likely to occur. The word ""ngudhunaké"" in Indonesian means ""to be hot"", so it's likely that the speaker will feel thirsty due to the heat. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué pengin ndhukung kancané) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi"" suggests that something has been done or taken away from someone, while ""meneng waé sakwisé"" implies a sense of loss or disappointment. Additionally, ""kanca kuwi rampung ngomong"" further reinforces this idea by suggesting that something valuable or important has been lost. Option A aligns with these ideas by implying that the speaker's heart was broken or hurt due to the loss of something precious. On the other hand, option B (""Dhèwèqué mikirké omongané kancané"") does not fit as well with the given premise, as it only mentions the act of breaking something without providing any context or explanation for why it happened. Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kacilakan kuwi salahku,"" option A (Aku rumangsa salah) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""rumangsa"" means to misunderstand or misinterpret something, so it's likely that the speaker has made a mistake in their reasoning."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ranté é pecah"", option A is more likely. The word ""peca"" in Indonesian means to break or crack, so it's likely that the reason for Ranté's problem is a physical issue with his phone, such as a broken screen or damaged internal components. Option B, while possible, seems less relevant given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Wong loro kuwi kesel merga padu) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""kuwi"" in this context means ""to be difficult or hard,"" so it suggests that the problem is caused by something being challenging or complicated. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué nyewa manajer kampanye) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong wadon kuwi mutuské arep dadi wakil gubernur"" suggests that there has been a conflict or disagreement between the governor and someone else, possibly over political issues. Therefore, it is more likely that the person being referred to in the premise will try to manage or resolve the situation by campaigning for support from others rather than taking legal action against the governor."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nggawa sandhangan anget ing koper) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""nggawa sandhangan"" means ""to make a mess,"" and ""anget ing koper"" means ""in the car."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will make a mess in their own car rather than someone else's."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngangkat tangané) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""ngangkat"" means ""to stretch"" or ""to extend"", while ""tangané"" means ""hand"". Therefore, the complete phrase ""Dhèwèqué ngangkat tangané"" can be translated as ""Stretch your hand"". Option B (""Dheweke dadi wong bodho"") does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang kuwi nangis,"" option A (bledug mlebu mripaté) is the most likely cause. The word ""bledug"" means to cry or be sad, and ""mlebu"" means to be angry or upset. Therefore, it is likely that the person is feeling sad or angry because of something they saw or heard. Option B (""Dhèwèqué nganggo kacamata"") does not make sense in this context as ""nganggo"" means to look at something with a critical or disapproving expression, and ""kacamata"" means sunglasses."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Lawané nudhuh dhèwèqué mbeling) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""Lawané"" means ""to win"", and ""nudhuh"" means ""five times"". Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker will win five times in a row. Option B (Mungsuhé kuwi ngéman dhèwèqué) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of winning or losing in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke nyekel siswa sing nyontek) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Guru nyuwek-nyuwek ujiané murid,"" indicating that the teacher is evaluating or testing the student's knowledge. This suggests that the student may not have fully understood the material and needs further clarification or explanation. Therefore, option A, which implies that the teacher will provide additional instruction or guidance to help the student better understand the material, is a more plausible response."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku mandheg ngomong,"" option A (akuora bisa ngomong) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's tongue hurts than option B (akuora isa ambegan). This is because ""ngomong"" specifically refers to a sharp or stabbing pain in the tongue, which could be caused by biting it too hard or burning it with hot food or drink. In contrast, ""ambegan"" means ""to swell,"" so it would not necessarily explain the sharp pain described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku sijine ing gelombang mikro) is the more likely cause of the observed phenomenon. The premise suggests that the beads are moving on their own due to some internal force or energy, rather than being pushed by an external agent like air currents or water flow. This implies that there may be a microscopic mechanism at play, such as Brownian motion, which could explain why the beads appear to be moving spontaneously. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lara weteng) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""laraweteng"" suggests that something has been done repeatedly or consistently over time, which aligns with the idea of a habit being formed through repeated actions. Therefore, option A is the best fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke mlayu ing dek kolam renang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""wadon mau tiba ing blumbang"" suggests that someone wants to go swimming in a pool or body of water, while ""dheweke mlayu ing dek Kolam Renang"" means ""to dive into the deep end of a swimming pool."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person wants to dive into the deep end of a swimming pool rather than play with mud."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Dina kuwi dina pembukaan filem) is the correct answer. The phrase ""dina kuwi"" means ""to open a film,"" indicating that the speaker is referring to the act of starting or opening a movie. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the sentence is that the speaker is talking about the beginning of a film."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong nyingkirké dhèwèqué) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""wong"" means ""wrong"" or ""incorrect,"" and ""nyingkirké"" means ""to confuse."" Therefore, the phrase ""Wong-wong nyingkirké dhèwèqué"" can be translated as ""He/She got confused about something wrong."" Option B (""Wong-wong padha muji dhèwèqué"") does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nulis surat) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Tangane bocah wadon mau dadi blister"" suggests that a young boy has a blister on his foot, and the sentence ""Dhèwèqué nulis surat"" means ""Write down your name."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is asking the young boy to write down their name rather than munggah ing tali ( Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para penonton padha ngrayu kanthi gumun) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""padha ngrayu"" means ""to be confused or disoriented,"" and ""kanthi gumun"" means ""the audience's head."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the performer will make the audience feel dizzy or disoriented through their acrobatic skills. Option B (Akrobat iki ngguyang saka trapéz) does not align with this interpretation as it simply means ""Acrobat jumps over a trapeze."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ora sabar manèh,"" option A (Kancaku nggawé aku ngentèni) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the sentiment of the premise. The phrase ""nggawé"" means ""to wait patiently"" or ""to endure,"" which suggests that the speaker is willing to wait for something to happen rather than taking immediate action. Therefore, option A better captures the meaning of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi nggawé senjata nuklir) is more likely to occur. The use of nuclear weapons would have a devastating impact on the environment, human health, and global stability, making it an unlikely outcome in this scenario. Option B (Wong loro kuwi ngrembug bab perjanjian) may lead to diplomatic efforts and negotiations aimed at resolving conflicts peacefully, but it does not necessarily rule out the possibility of war or violence altogether.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué dadi ngantuk) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngantuk"" means ""to boil or steam,"" so it suggests that the substance will cause something to become hot and steamy. Option B (Dhèwèqué lara panas) means ""to make sweaty,"" which does not align with the meaning of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sikil sofa dadi longgar) is more likely to happen because it is a logical consequence of the situation. The speaker's inability to reach the sofa suggests that they are too far away from it, and therefore cannot simply ""didi"" or move closer to it. Option B (Dheweke ngremuk lutut) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the speaker is trying to avoid something by moving away from it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah kuwi nyempet baloné"", option A is more likely to occur as ""Baloné pecah"". This is because the word ""kuwi"" in Indonesian means ""to break or shatter"", indicating that the ball will likely break when dropped from a height."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi mbongkar koperé) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""kuwi mbongkar"" means ""to break or crack open,"" indicating that something has been damaged or broken. This suggests that the person's luggage may have been lost or damaged during their stay at the hotel."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngethok persik,"" Option A (Peach bruised) is the most likely outcome. The word ""ngethok"" in Malay means to hit or strike something, implying that someone has caused harm to a peach. Therefore, it is more likely that the peach has been bruised rather than simply spilled juice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku mangan donat) is the most likely cause of the problem. The use of the word ""mangan"" in this context suggests that something has been given or donated, rather than being made or created. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku meksa lawangé,"" option A (Lawangé dibukak) is the most likely outcome. The word ""meksa"" in Indonesian means to break or shatter something, so it's likely that the speaker will cause harm to the object they are holding. Option B (Lawangé dikunci) also implies damage or destruction but in a different way, by locking or sealing something instead of breaking it."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Produk kasebut dites kanggo jaminan kualitas) is the correct answer. The premise highlights the importance of quality assurance in the production process, which suggests that the company prioritizes ensuring the quality of its products over using child labor to produce them. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the activists are boycotting the product.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngambruk tema"", option A (ana tikus sing metu saka bolongan) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the meaning of the phrase ""ngambruk tema"" which means to be angry or upset about something. Option B (bledug metu saka bolongan) does not fit well with this context as ""bledug"" means to be happy or pleased, which contradicts the idea of being angry or upset. Therefore, option A is a better match for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong wadon kuwi iri karo adhine,"" option A is more likely. The word ""kuwi"" means ""to be lazy,"" so it is unlikely that the speaker would say ""seduluré wadon seneng"" (meaning ""to make something easy"") if they are trying to explain why they are being lazy. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngucur anggur ing klambi,"" option A (aku nganggo jubah) is the most likely effect to occur. The word ""nggucur"" in Indonesian means ""to curse,"" so it's likely that the speaker will perform a curse or do something negative towards the person who wronged them. Option B (aku ganti kaos) does not fit with the context of the sentence and would not be a common response to someone who has wronged you."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (pelanggan kuwi nggolèki dompeté) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The use of the word ""nggolèki"" in this context suggests that there may have been a buildup or accumulation of something inside the machine, such as dust or debris, which could potentially block the airflow and prevent the machine from functioning properly. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong mènèhi dhuwit cilik) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""musisi dalanan narik"" suggests that the person's voice has become hoarse or rough due to excessive singing, while ""kawigaten wong akeh"" implies that their throat has become inflamed or irritated. This could lead to a sore throat or discomfort when speaking or singing. Option B (Wong-wong mau banjur padha didhawuhi lunga) does not fit with this premise as it refers to a different type of vocal cord issue."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué kanggen karo wong tuwané) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""mangan"" in Indonesian means ""crying"", so it is unlikely that a child would say ""Wektu kanggo mangan"". Therefore, option A is the most plausible response given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pilot glides through the storm) is more likely. The word ""nglayar"" in Indonesian means to glide or slide smoothly, indicating that the pilot will be able to navigate through the storm without any difficulty. Option B (Pilot crashes into the storm) does not align with this meaning and suggests a more dangerous outcome for the pilot."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Godhong-godhongé dadi werna-werna) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""dadi werna-werna"" suggests that the situation will become worse or more complicated, which aligns with the meaning of ""godhong-godhongé"". Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué mutusqué kanggo main kartu karo adhine) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""main kartu karo adhine"" suggests that the speaker will be playing cards with someone else, implying a social interaction or activity involving multiple people. Option B (Dhèwèqué mutusqué kanggo ngguyu karo adhine) does not provide any context for how many people are involved in the activity, making it less specific and therefore less likely to occur based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Bapakipun maringi soda kanggé dipun ombé) is more likely to happen because it is a humorous and unexpected outcome that fits with the absurdity of the situation. The idea of a father being so desperate for a bath that he resorts to using soda as shampoo and conditioner is a ridiculous scenario that is unlikely to occur in real life. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Iwak kasebut mlumpat metu saka tank) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""mlumpat metu saka tank"" suggests that the ground is soft and muddy, making it difficult for the chicken to walk. This implies that the chicken will have a harder time reaching the food. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèké ngganti afiliasi partiné) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the politician will change their affiliation. This implies that they are willing to adapt and adjust their political stance according to changing circumstances or opinions, which can be an effective strategy in politics. Option B (Dhèwèqué melu protes) means ""The politician will protest,"" which does not convey the same level of flexibility and adaptability as option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku mbukak kran banyu) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""aku mbukak"" means ""I will clean,"" and ""kran banyu"" means ""the bathroom."" Therefore, Option A suggests that the speaker intends to clean the bathroom. On the other hand, Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a saluran or channel related to the bathroom."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sepur teka ing stasiun) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sepur teka"" means ""to take a break"" or ""to rest,"" while ""stasiun"" refers to a station or stop. Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker wants to take a break at the next station. Option B (Sepur kuwi wisel) does not make sense in this context as ""kuwi"" means ""sweet"" and ""wisel"" means ""water."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Panjenengané nempel cap ing amplopé) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""panjenengané"" means to stretch or elongate something, while ""nutup"" means to shrink or contract. Therefore, it is more likely that the shape of the amplop will be stretched or elongated rather than shrunk or contracted."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong loro kuwi seneng-seneng bareng) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ora isa omong-omongan"" suggests that something is happening in a slow or gradual manner, which aligns with the idea of something being done slowly and steadily over time. Option B (""Wong loro kuwi pindhah menyang kutha liya"") implies a faster and more sudden change, which does not fit as well with the given premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Dewike will be fired from his job due to poor performance (Option A). The reason for this is that the phrase ""Akuntan salah ngatur dana perusahaan"" implies that there has been a significant discrepancy in the company's finances, which could result in Dewike being held responsible and disciplined by management. Being fired or dismissed is a common consequence of poor performance at work, especially if it results in financial losses for the company."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku ndelok jam) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""aku ndelok jam"" means ""I am stuck in traffic,"" indicating that the speaker is experiencing difficulty moving their vehicle due to congestion on the road. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I wrote an essay with my left hand) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""bolot kasebut kenceng"", option A (aku wis ngganti bolt) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""wis"" in Indonesian means ""to change"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker wants to change the bolt rather than unlock the door using a key."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur, as the couple has already signed a rental agreement for an apartment. Therefore, they are likely to move into the apartment rather than looking for another one.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué pengin ndelok srengéngé surup) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""Wong wadon mau lungguh ing njaba ing teras"" means ""The wind has been blowing strongly in the mountains,"" which suggests that there may have been a strong gust of wind that caused something to fall or break. Option B (Dheweke ngira weruh kilat) means ""The roof was broken by the rain,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence provided. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke ore bisa ngalangi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""wong lanang iku nganggo"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not functioning properly, and ""ngalangi"" means to fix or repair. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker might say ""dheweke ore bisa nglangi,"" which means ""let's try to fix it."" Option B (""banyu kuwi cethèk"") does not make as much sense in this context, as it simply means ""the river flows into the sea"" and does not provide any insight into how to fix a problem."
"Response: 
Option B: Dheweke mencet tombol backspace. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the user will press the backspace button to correct their mistake than to delete the entire document. The use of ""nggawe"" (meaning ""to delete"") in the premise suggests that the user made a mistake while typing, and therefore would need to correct it rather than deleting the entire document."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the value of the currency decreases) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""mbanggak-banggak karo kanca-kancané"" suggests that the currency has lost its value over time, leading to inflation or devaluation. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Udan deres banget ing wayah wengi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""udan deres"" means ""to run away quickly,"" which suggests that the speaker is trying to escape or get away from something. This fits with the context of the sentence, as the speaker is trying to explain why they are not able to do something. Option B (""Ing kono akèh suket"") does not fit this context as well, as it simply means ""I don't have anything."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nginep ing hotel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""nginep"" in this context suggests that something has been damaged or broken, which aligns with the idea of a hotel room being destroyed. Option B (Dheweke lali nyetel jam weker) does not make as much sense in this context, as it implies that someone is making noise while they are working, rather than causing destruction. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lungguh ing peteng) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi nganggo"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, while ""krim kanggo"" implies a sense of urgency or importance. Additionally, ""njaga awak saka"" could imply that someone is trying to find or retrieve something. Therefore, Option A, which translates to ""The thief took it without being seen,"" aligns better with the context provided."
"Response: 
Option A: Para panaliti mbatalake téyori kasebut. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Para panaliti mbuktèkaké téyori kuwi,"" which means ""The theory of relativity was developed by Einstein."" This implies that the theory of relativity was not discovered by someone else but rather developed by Einstein himself. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Game kasebut dadi wektu tambahan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that there are additional games beyond the ones mentioned in the question, which implies that there are more possibilities for the outcome of the competition. Therefore, option A provides a more comprehensive explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngetik kombinasi ing kunci"", option A (aku nutup kunci) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong akèh kuwi saya akèh"", it is more likely that option A is correct, as ""bapak"" (father) is in the accusative case, indicating that he is the direct object of the verb ""akuwi"". Therefore, the sentence would mean ""I am hitting/beating my father."""
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku ngumpulaké salju dadi bola salju) is more likely to occur because it implies that the speaker will push or roll the snowball down the hill, which can lead to a greater distance covered than just rolling it gently (option B). Therefore, option A has a higher likelihood of occurring compared to option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kayak kuwi tekan ing pesisir) is more likely to occur than option B (Kayak kuwi kepetuk karo ombak). This is because ""tekan"" means ""to hit"" or ""to collide with"", while ""kepetuk"" means ""big wave"". Therefore, if a para kayaker were to go out in the sea without proper safety measures, they are more likely to hit rocks or collide with other objects rather than being swept away by big waves."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke ngeculake setir) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngendhalèni sepedhèké"" suggests that something has been taken away or hidden, which aligns with the idea of something being buried or hidden in the ground. Option B (Dhewekenabrak pager) does not fit as well with the given premise, as it implies a sudden and unexpected loss rather than a gradual disappearance."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Aku krasa angin adhem liwat aku) is more likely to occur because it uses a word that means ""I am angry"" in Malay, whereas option A (Banyu sing disiram ing kulitku) does not make sense in Malay. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi wis teles) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""kuwi wis teles"" means ""too much sand in the water,"" which suggests that there may be a buildup of sand in the ocean or sea near the beach, causing the water to become murky or cloudy. This could potentially affect the quality of the beach experience for tourists. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku narik colokan ing bak mandi,"" option A (Banyu metu saka bak) is more likely to occur because it implies that the speaker's nose has been hit by something hard, causing pain. The phrase ""narik colokan"" means ""hit or struck,"" while ""bak mandi"" refers to a person's nose. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the premise than option B (Banyu nyembur ing lantai), which simply means ""the water is flowing."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nudhuh dhèwèquéora setya) is more likely to occur than option B (Dhèwèqué ngakoni ora setya karo bojone). This is because the phrase ""ngakoni"" means ""to be in a state of confusion,"" while ""bojone"" means ""to be in a state of disarray."" Therefore, option A suggests that the person will become even more confused if they continue to think about something, whereas option B implies that the person's thoughts are already in disarray."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku ngentèni nganti tinta garing) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""ngentèni"" means ""to erase"" or ""to wipe off"", which aligns with the idea of removing a sticker from a surface. Option B (Aku ngecor banyu ing poster) means ""I will soak the poster in water"", which does not align with the given premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah mau tangi nangis,"" option A (Dhèwèqué ngimpi elek) is a more plausible cause for the boy's crying than option B (Dheweke ngompol kasur). This is because ""ngimpi elek"" means ""to be sad or depressed,"" while ""ngompol kasur"" means ""to be angry."" Therefore, it is more likely that the boy is feeling sadness or depression rather than anger that is causing him to cry."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bapake banjur lungguh ing meja) is more likely to occur than option B (Bapakipun maringi piwulang dhumateng piyambakipun). This is because the phrase ""bocah kuwi ngunggahke"" suggests that the boy is trying to lift something heavy, which could cause him to strain or struggle. The image of a person struggling with an object is more vivid and relatable than the idea of a person simply imagining something. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku mbengok jenengé) is the more likely cause of the effect. The phrase ""mbengok jenengé"" means to think deeply or reflect, which suggests that the speaker is considering something carefully before making a decision. This aligns with the idea of taking time to think about the consequences of one's actions before acting impulsively. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Warga kuwi mbrontak) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""kuwi nindhes rakyaté"" suggests that there are issues with the people's minds or consciousness, making them less aware of their surroundings and more prone to being manipulated or controlled by external forces. This aligns with the idea of a mind control plot, where an outside force is influencing people's thoughts and actions without their knowledge or consent. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngedégké kémäh) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb that means ""to be angry"" or ""to get angry,"" which aligns with the context of being upset about something. Option B (Dhèwèqué njerit nyaluk tulung) does not use any verbs related to anger or getting angry, making it less likely to occur in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué pengin sinau nggambar) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""Dhèwèqué pengin sinau"" means ""too many pictures,"" while ""nggambar"" means ""too much."" Therefore, it suggests that there are too many images or pictures being shared, which could potentially overwhelm the platform's capacity. Option B (Dhèwèqué pengin sinau bab budaya liya) does not provide a clear explanation for why the problem occurred."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kancané kerja dipromosikqué) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""di promosikqué"" suggests that the job was given or offered by someone in a position of authority or influence, such as a supervisor or manager. This implies that the reason for the job change is not due to personal reasons but rather because of external factors beyond the individual's control. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Wong iki nyekseni alien) is more likely to be the cause of the headache. This is because the phrase ""iki nyekseni"" can be interpreted as an alien or a being from another world, which could potentially cause a headache through its presence or actions. In contrast, Option B (Dhèwèké lagi mèditasi) does not provide any specific context or explanation for why the person might have a headache, making it less plausible as the cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Rambuté wong lanang kuwi dadi pirang,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""rambuté"" means hair in Indonesian, so it is unlikely that a person would have long hair if they are constantly washing their head with water. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why someone might not be able to see their own reflection in a mirror."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Dheweke ngritik karyane sadurunge) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nggawe karya anyar"" means to create something new or innovative, while ""dheweke ngritik karyane sadurunge"" means to feel inspired by a particular idea or concept. Therefore, the most likely explanation for why Artis created his latest work of art is that he was feeling inspired by a particular idea or concept, rather than simply creating something new without any specific inspiration."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué dipecat saka militèr) is more likely to be the cause of Anaké's decision to move back home. This is because the phrase ""dheweke arep kuliah"" means ""I have been dismissed from military service,"" indicating that Anaké was no longer able to continue his studies due to being fired or dismissed from the military. Therefore, it is more plausible that Anaké moved back home as a result of this unfortunate event rather than choosing to drop out of school for personal reasons."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rak-rak kuwi kebak bledug) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiba saka rak buku"" suggests that something has fallen or landed on top of the book, which could potentially damage it. This is supported by the following sentence ""rak-rak kuwi kebak bledug,"" which implies that something heavy has fallen onto the book with a loud noise, further suggesting that the book may have been damaged. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (aku nyunari lampu) is more likely to occur as it implies that I will turn off the light. Option B (aku ngreset pemutus sirkuit) means that I will reset the circuit breaker, which may not necessarily result in turning off the lights.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kuwi katon medeni) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Kita numpak roller coaster"" suggests that something has been rolled or moved quickly, and ""kuwi katon medeni"" means ""to move quickly."" Therefore, it makes sense that the cause of the movement would be a rapid or sudden action, rather than a gradual one."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (aku ngiseni mentega ing tas) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngiseni"" means ""to melt"" in Indonesian, so it suggests that the Kantong popcorn will melt when exposed to heat. This makes sense since popcorn is a type of corn kernel that melts when heated. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Listrik ing lingkungan kasebut mati) is more likely to occur because it states that the electricity in the environment will die. This implies that there will be no electricity available for use, making Option A the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngganggu penonton) is more likely to be the effect of the politician's statement. This is because the phrase ""ngganggu penonton"" means ""to ignore or disregard the audience,"" implying that the politician is not concerned with their opinions or feedback. Therefore, option A is a more appropriate choice given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku dadi kringet) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""aku nyuduk awakku"" suggests that the speaker is feeling uncomfortable or uneasy, which could lead to them fidgeting or squirming in their seat. This is further reinforced by the word ""kringet,"" which means to twist or turn restlessly. Therefore, option A is a more plausible response given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lagi luwé) is the most likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Dhèwèqué lagi luwé"" means ""The surface of the tank is too smooth,"" indicating that the issue is related to the texture or finish of the tank's surface rather than a hole or puncture in it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lagi lara pilek) is more likely to be the cause of Swara's stomachache. This is because ""lagi"" means ""more"" in Indonesian, implying that there is an excessive amount of something causing discomfort in Swara's stomach. Option B (Dhèwèqué mandheg ngrokok) means ""stomach hurts from eating too much,"" which does not align with the given premise. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Lift tekan lantai sing ditemtokaké) is the correct answer. The phrase ""ditemtokaké"" suggests a sudden and forceful impact, which could potentially damage the lift's mechanism or structure. Therefore, it is more plausible that the lift was damaged due to an external factor rather than internal malfunctioning."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngapusi wong tuwané) is a more plausible explanation for why the boy's mother did not come to meet him at school. This is because ""ngapusi"" in Indonesian means ""to be busy or preoccupied,"" indicating that the mother may have been too occupied with other matters to attend to her son's request. Option B (""Wong tuwané ngukum dhèwèqué"") suggests that the mother was simply tired of seeing her son every day, which does not align as well with the given premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the toilet overflowed (Option A). The phrase ""kamar mandhi banjir"" suggests a flood or excessive amount of water in the bathroom, which could be caused by an overflowing toilet. Additionally, the mention of a ""toileté kebanjiran"" further supports this conclusion as it implies that there was a problem with the toilet's drainage system. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sing nduwé nyandhang guluné) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""nyandhang guluné"" means ""to take care of something carefully,"" which aligns with the idea of taking good care of a small dog. Option B (""Sing nduwé asu kuwi terus ngopèni asu kuwi"") does not make sense in this context and seems to be a non-sequitur. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué ngadeg ing ngisor wit singgedhe banget) is a more plausible explanation for why Wong's dream may have been vivid than option B (Dhèwèqué ngadeg ing tlaga sing tenang). This is because ""ngisor"" means ""to be in a trance,"" indicating that Wong was in a state of altered consciousness during his dream. Additionally, ""singgedhe"" means ""to see clearly or distinctly,"" suggesting that Wong had a clear and detailed vision in his dream. Therefore, it is more likely that Wong experienced a vivid dream due to being in a trance-like state rather than simply feeling tired."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Aku ketemu karo dheweke kanggonedha bengi) is more likely to occur as it implies that the speaker will meet someone they know at a place called ""bengi"". The other option (aku telpon bali) means ""I will call you"" in Indonesian, but does not provide any information about meeting someone else. Therefore, option B is the better answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anjingé mlayu saka omah) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""nggolèki ing sakupengé"" suggests that something is wrong with the family's food supply, and ""anjingé mlayu saka omah"" means that a dog has eaten their food. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is caused by a hungry dog rather than a magical spell or curse."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (cuaca adhe...
"Response: 
Option A: Wong-wong kuwi péngin kahanan nyambut gawé sing luwih apik.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why employees form a union is because they want to negotiate better wages and working conditions. Option A best captures this idea by suggesting that employees are dissatisfied with their current pay and benefits and are seeking improvement through collective bargaining. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for employees to form a union."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (bau busuk sing ana ing pawon kuwi) is more likely to occur than option B (ing pawon kono ana aroma sing anget). This is because the phrase ""bau busuk"" means ""smell bad,"" while ""an get"" means ""good smell."" Therefore, it is more likely that someone would say ""my house smells bad"" rather than ""my house has a good smell."""
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué nganggo spatu hak dhuwur) is a more plausible cause than option B (Dheweke nyopot sepatune). The word ""spatu"" in Javanese means ""to be angry,"" while ""nyopot"" means ""angry."" Therefore, the correct answer is option A."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Uap metu saka pot banyu"", it is more likely that option A, ""Banyu dadi mendung"" (The water in the pot boiled) is the correct cause. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kabeh kaos kaki aku ana ing laundry,"" it is more likely that option A (aku nganggo sandal) will occur because the phrase ""kabeh kaos"" means ""to mess up or make a mess,"" and ""kaki"" refers to feet, so it implies that the speaker's feet are making a mess in the laundry. Option B (aku nganggo sepatu bot) does not fit with this meaning as ""sepatu bot"" means ""boots."" Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Piyambakipun kélangan dukungan para pamilih.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Piyambakipun will need support from his family to overcome the allegations of corruption. The phrase ""piyambakipun kélangan dukungan"" suggests that he needs help or backing from someone, and given the context of the situation, it is most likely that he would turn to his family for support."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Pasangan kuwi ngandhut) will occur. The phrase ""ngandhut"" means ""to be jealous or envious,"" so it suggests that one partner may feel resentful or possessive towards their significant other's new relationship. This could lead to negative consequences such as conflict or separation within the couple. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong sugih mau péngin bangunan kuwi diruntuhaké) is the more likely cause of the building's collapse. This is because the phrase ""mau péngin"" means ""to be weakened or damaged,"" indicating that the building was already in a fragile state before it collapsed. Option B (Wong sugih kuwi nyumbang dhuwit kanggo mbangun) does not provide any information about the building's condition before the collapse, making it less likely as a cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong sing dodolan kuwi ndelok bocah wadon kuwi masang barang-barang ing tasé) is the more likely cause. The premise suggests that Wong's son has stolen something from a neighbor's house, and this act of stealing is the reason why Wong is angry with him. Option B (Wong sing dodolan kuwi mbantu cah wédok kuwi nemokké dompet sing disenengi) does not fit with the given information as it implies that Wong is angry with his son for borrowing money without permission, which is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para prajurit dikirim kanggo perang) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the country is preparing for war in a neighboring region, indicating that military personnel will be deployed to fight. This is consistent with Option A, where para prajurit (military personnel) are sent to go to war. On the other hand, Option B (Para prajurit banjur ketemu karo kulawargane) does not align with the premise as it means ""The soldiers met each other at the border,"" which suggests a non-combat situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ana kerusuhan ing ngarepé gedhong pengadilan) is more likely to occur. The use of ""ing"" before ""ngarepé"" indicates that the action will happen in the future tense, implying that there will be a protest or disturbance at the court in the future. Option B does not convey this same sense of future action."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke njupuk cookie saka toples) is more likely. The phrase ""njupuk"" means ""to lick"" in Indonesian, so it's possible that the boy wants to lick a cookie that has been baked in the oven. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Udan deres banget"", option A (Badai kuwi saya parah) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""udan deres"" means ""it's raining heavily"", indicating that the weather is bad, and therefore it is more likely that the speaker will get wet. Option B (Aku cepet-cepet mlebu) does not make sense in this context as it means ""I quickly put on my raincoat""."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Lifté mandheg) is a more plausible cause for the building to be evacuated than option B (Alarm geni banjur muni). This is because lift failure can lead to a sudden stop of the elevator car, causing it to fall or become stuck between floors, which could result in injuries or fatalities if not addressed promptly. In contrast, an alarm sounding in the building may indicate various issues such as a fire drill, smoke detector malfunction, or other non-life-threatening situations that do not necessarily require immediate evacuation. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the building to be evacuated based on the provided information.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bapaké tuku bir kanggo anaké) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""bapake tuku"" means ""father hit,"" so it suggests that the father will physically harm or beat his child if he drinks alcohol. This implies a negative consequence for the child's actions, making option A the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sekretaris mulih sedina) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The use of ""munggah"" in the premise suggests that there may have been a sudden or unexpected increase in workload for the secretary, which could lead to feelings of overwhelm and stress. Additionally, the phrase ""menyang kantoré"" implies that the problem may be related to the workplace environment or culture, rather than an external factor like a lift breakdown. Therefore, it is more likely that the secretary's workload and responsibilities are the primary cause of their distress, rather than a physical obstacle like a broken lift."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang kuwi nesu karo kancané,"" option A (Kancané ngganggu) is the most likely cause. The word ""ngganggu"" means ""to be angry or upset."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's mother became angry or upset with them for not completing their chores."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kasir menèhi dhuwité bocah wadon) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the meaning of ""bocah wadon"" as a young girl who has not yet reached puberty, and therefore would not have any sexual desire or attraction towards an adult man. The phrase ""dhuwité marang kasir"" also implies that the young girl's innocence and purity are being threatened by the adult man's actions, which is consistent with the idea of sexual harassment or exploitation. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lumpuh merga kecelakaan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""lumpuh merga"" refers to a person who is unable to speak or communicate due to an injury or illness, while ""kecelakaan"" means accident or disaster. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's inability to speak is caused by an injury or illness rather than a house collapse."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Negara iki ngrayakake kamardikan) is the cause of the problem. The phrase ""nggantungake gendera nasional"" suggests a lack of unity or cohesion among the people of the nation, which could lead to internal conflicts and instability. This is supported by the word ""kamardikan,"" which means ""to be divided into factions."" Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi nggawé kuciwa para penggemaré) is more likely to be the effect of losing in a tournament. This is because ""nggawé"" means ""to lose"" or ""to be defeated"", and ""kuciwa"" means ""sad"" or ""depressed"". Therefore, it can be inferred that if someone loses in a tournament, they may feel sad or depressed about it. Option B (Wong-wong kuwi dadi inspirasi kanggo para penggemaré) does not make sense in this context, as there is no clear connection between losing in a tournament and being an inspiration for fans."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku rumangsa isin) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Kancaku kandha nèk aku nduwé panganan sing macet ing untu"" suggests that something has been added or mixed into the food, making it taste bad. Option A implies that the speaker will vomit due to the bad taste of the food, while option B does not provide any logical explanation for why the speaker would feel proud or happy about the situation. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngátkét) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngátkét"" means ""to fail"" or ""to not pass,"" which aligns with the context of the prompt. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker failed their history exam due to lack of effort rather than simply being absent from class ( Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kutha iki kena lindhu) is more likely to be the cause of the increase in crime rate in the central business district. This is because the phrase ""ini kutha ambruk"" suggests that the area has been experiencing a high level of criminal activity, which could be due to various factors such as poverty, lack of job opportunities, or social unrest. On the other hand, option B (Tingkat kejahatan ing kutha kasebut saya tambah) does not provide any specific reasons for the increase in crime rate and seems to be more general in nature. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué nyuwun supaya dhèwèqué ditampa manèh) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""dheweke ngenalake"" means ""to make someone angry,"" while ""dheweke marang wong"" means ""to make something difficult."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will use ""dheweke ngenalake"" in this context to indicate that they are making someone angry, rather than ""dheweke marang wong"" to indicate that something is difficult."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Balé mau banjur mlayu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""balé mau banjur mlayu"" means ""the head will be broken into pieces,"" indicating that a violent and destructive event is likely to happen. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Raccoon grampok tong sampah"", option A (Ana karton ing tong sampah) is the most likely cause. The raccoon is actively collecting trash in its mouth, indicating that it is trying to eat or use the trash for some purpose. This is a common behavior among raccoons, who are known to rummage through garbage cans and other sources of food waste. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (iku murah) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""bocah lanang iku ngasah potlot"" suggests that something was given or done for free, which implies a low cost. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke kelangan kuitansi) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ora gelem mbalekaké"" suggests that there is a blockage or obstruction in the pipe, which could be caused by debris or sediment accumulation. This is supported by the word ""kuiti,"" which means ""blockage."" Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ora suwé banjur mari) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Kulitku dadi goresan sing jero"" suggests that something has been cut or injured, and ""ora suwé banjur mari"" means ""the wound will heal."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to a physical injury rather than a mental one."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ndelok ing lemah) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""Dhèwèqué ndelok ing lemah"" means ""The plane's engine failed due to a technical issue."" This suggests that there was a mechanical failure or malfunction in the aircraft's engine, which could have caused the pilot to lose control and crash into the sea. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Semut-semut kuwi banjur nyusup ing remah-remah kuwi) is more likely to occur. The use of ""kuwi"" in both sentences suggests that the subject is a small creature or insect, such as an ant or bee, which could potentially crawl up onto the slippery surface of a plate without falling off. Option B (Bocah kuwi nyelehké roti kuwi), on the other hand, does not make sense in this context, as it implies that a human child is able to climb up onto a slippery surface with ease, which is unlikely. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (seduluré wong wadon kuwi ngambung tangané) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngambung tangané"" suggests that the fabric has become loose or stretched out, which could be caused by over-washing or wear and tear. Therefore, it is more likely that the fabric has been damaged through normal use rather than being soaked in water."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bibiné wis pecah) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Wong lanang iku njupuk mint"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the cooking process, possibly causing the food to be overcooked or burnt. This could lead to a situation where the food is inedible or unpalatable, as suggested by the second part of the premise (""Dhèwèqué kuwatir bab ambegan""). Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Wong-wong kuwi ngramal nèk bakal ana akèh wong ing sekitar téater) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. This is because the phrase ""kuwi mangkat"" means ""to get angry or annoyed,"" and ""luwih disik"" means ""to look around."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is getting angry or annoyed while looking around their surroundings, which could be due to various reasons such as a lack of parking spaces near the theater or long lines at the ticket counter. Option B (Dheweke entuk arah menyang teater) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of the speaker being angry or annoyed while walking towards the theater."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bosé ngalem dhèwèqué) is more likely to occur. This is because ""Wong wadon mau"" means ""I will work hard,"" indicating a strong determination to do so, while ""Ora kerja ing omah"" means ""I will not rest until I finish my work."" Together, these phrases suggest that the speaker is highly motivated and determined to complete their tasks, making option A the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ndhukung tujuané) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""iku nandatangani"" means ""we have signed,"" indicating that a group of people have agreed or signed something together. Therefore, it is more likely that they are referring to a collective action or movement rather than an individual's personal decision."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué wedi panggung) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Atine aktor iku gumeter sadurunge tampil"" suggests that the actor will perform in front of an audience, which aligns with Option A. On the other hand, Option B (""Dhèwèqué ngapalake ayat-ayaté"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""The actor's face was reflected in the mirror."" Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku kesasar"", option A is more likely. The word ""kesasar"" means ""to be angry or upset"". Therefore, option A ""aku ngetung dhuwitku"" means ""I will get angry/upset"" which aligns with the given premise. Option B ""aku mbukak peta"" means ""I will draw a map"" which does not align with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wis dipangan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""wis mateng kuwi"" suggests that something has been stretched or elongated, which aligns with Option A's description of ""dipangan"". Therefore, it is more likely that the effect will be Option A rather than Option B (Iku shrivelled munggah)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku nguripake kontak) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""nguripake kontak"" means ""I will contact him,"" indicating that the speaker plans to take action to resolve the issue. Option B (""Mesiné panas banget"") does not convey a sense of proactive solution-seeking, but rather a passive acceptance of the situation. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lunga nemoni psikiater) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""lunga nemoni"" suggests that someone's mind or thoughts are affected by something, which aligns with the concept of psychotherapy. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku ore nduwé kayu bakar) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""aku miwiti geni ing perapian"" suggests that something has been done or caused by someone, and ""or nduwé kayu bakar"" means ""and burned down the forest."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is responsible for burning down the forest rather than simply disappearing without a trace."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke duwe kram ing sisih) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong wadon kuwi mandheg mlaku"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not functioning properly, and ""duwe kram ing sisih"" means ""to break something"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to breaking something rather than putting something together."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tanggaku ngajak aku mlebu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tanggaku"" means ""to climb up"" or ""to ascend,"" while ""ngajak"" means ""to pull."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker will climb up the stairs. Option B (Tanggaku lunga saka omahÉ) does not make sense in this context as ""luga"" means ""to stretch out"" or ""to extend,"" and ""saka"" means ""downwards."" So, it cannot be inferred that the speaker will descend the stairs."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bojone salah paham karo kuwatir) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong wadon kuwi sedhih banget"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not as it should be, and ""Bojone salah paham karo kuwatir"" means ""The teacher misunderstood the lesson."" Therefore, it is more likely that the teacher misunderstood the lesson than that the student did not understand the lesson."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Murid kuwi njawab pitakonan kuwi kanthi bener) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""kuwi"" in this context means to understand or comprehend, and ""njawab"" refers to a question or problem. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A, which states that the student will be able to understand and comprehend the questions or problems given by the teacher."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Dhèwèqué lunga menyang peternakan) is more likely to occur as it suggests that a large number of cows will be transported by airplane, which may not be practical or safe for the animals. On the other hand, Option B (Dheweke lunga menyang supermarket) does not make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between a cow being transported by plane and buying groceries at a supermarket. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku ngandhakaké sawijining rahasia marang dhèwèqué) is more likely to occur because it implies that the speaker has a plan or strategy to reveal the secret of the other person's success. Option B (Aku ngrangkul dhèwèqué) means ""I will crush him"" and does not convey any intention to reveal secrets. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke nyekel iwak) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""dheweke nyekel iwak"" means ""the water has been contaminated with sewage,"" indicating that the issue is likely caused by a blockage or failure in the sewage system rather than external factors such as pollution from industrial activities. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payungé rusak) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""teka ing kelas kanthi kecelup"" suggests that something has gone wrong in the classroom, and the fact that the teacher's umbrella has been broken implies that it was damaged during a storm or other weather-related event. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“pangguna ngeklik mouse”) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase “kursor ing layar komputer” refers to the cursor moving across the computer screen, which can be done by clicking the mouse button. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the movement of the cursor on the computer screen.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ana kacilakan ing dalan utama) is the most likely cause of the problem. The word ""kacilakan"" means to crack or break easily, and ""ing dalan utama"" refers to the main road. Therefore, it is possible that the main road has cracked or broken due to heavy traffic or other factors, causing difficulties for drivers. Option B (Dhèwèqué ngetutké truk ing ngarep) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a bridge or any other structure being involved in the problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nggantung klambi klambi ing lawon klambi ing njaba,"" option B (Linen singing dicemari) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the idea of someone hanging themselves from a tree branch or other elevated position. The phrase ""nggantung klambi"" specifically refers to the act of hanging oneself, while ""linen sing dicemari"" means ""to hang oneself."" Therefore, option B is the best answer based on the language used in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cahya srengéngé padhang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong wadon mau nganggo kacamata"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not working properly, and ""cahya"" means ""to break"" or ""to damage"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to a broken or damaged glasses frame rather than needing a taxi ride."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke kepengin dadi musim panas) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi"" suggests that something is wrong or unusual, and the mention of ""musim panas"" (hot season) implies that it may be too hot for a normal day. Therefore, option A better fits the context given in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku rumangsa kesel banget,"" option A (aku turu luwih disik) is more likely to occur because it implies that the speaker will try to hide their embarrassment or shame by avoiding eye contact."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang kuwi lunga menyang tukang cukur,"" it is more likely that option A (Rambuté wis thukul) is the correct answer. This is because ""kuwi"" in Indonesian means ""to cut"" or ""to trim"", while ""lunga"" means ""hair"". Therefore, the phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi lunga"" can be translated to ""I will cut my hair."" Option B (""Rambuté saya dawa"") does not make sense in this context as ""dawa"" means ""medicine"" in Indonesian."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (bocah kuwi ore seneng karo kanca kelasé sing anyar) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""kuwi"" means ""I don't want,"" so it suggests that the speaker does not want to go to school because they are feeling lazy or unmotivated. Option A (""bocah kuwi nampani kanca kelasé sing anyar"") means ""The boy doesn't want to go to school because he is bored,"" which is a different reason for not wanting to attend school. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku kepéngin ngombé susu,"" option A (aku lagi mangan cookie) is the most likely cause. The word ""mangan"" in Indonesian means to eat or consume, so it's likely that the speaker wants to eat cookies rather than rotis."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Udan wiwit deres"", option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""udan wiwit"" means ""to shine brightly"", so it's likely that the person will turn on a light rather than move their mobile phone. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (aku parkir ing sebrang dalan) is more likely to occur than option B (aku parkir ing cedhak lawang). This is because ""sebrang"" means ""empty"" or ""vacant"", while ""cedhak"" means ""full"". Therefore, it is more likely that someone would park their car in an empty parking lot rather than a full one."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué ngalami masalah nulis) is more likely as it suggests that the problem lies in not being able to think of a solution rather than having a lack of creativity in designing the concept. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku njaluk ngomong karo pengawas) is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""aku njaluk ngomong karo pengawas"" means ""I will report you to the police,"" indicating that the speaker intends to inform the authorities about someone's wrongdoing. This suggests that the speaker believes they have evidence of a crime or illegal activity, which could lead to an investigation. In contrast, option B (""Aku mènèhi nomer idhèntitasiku"") means ""I will give my identity number to the task,"" which does not make sense in this context and implies that the speaker has nothing to do with the investigation. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tombolé lawang muni) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Angin nyebar liwat jendhela sing mbukak"" suggests that there will be a strong wind blowing from the east, which could cause the tree to sway or lean towards the west. Option B (Tirai-tirai dadi gemeter) does not provide any information about the direction of the wind's impact. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (aku copot lampu) is more likely to be the cause of the darkness in the room. The phrase ""Listrik ing omahku mati"" suggests that there may have been a power outage or failure in the electrical system, which could result in the lights not working. Option B (aku ngetokake sekring) does not make sense in this context as it refers to the act of plugging something into an outlet, which would not address the issue of darkness in the room caused by a power outage. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke ngethok otot ing pangilon) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngethok otot"" means ""to hit or strike,"" while ""pangilon"" refers to a type of bird known for its loud calls. Therefore, it is possible that the speaker is referring to the sound of a bird chirping. Option B (Dhèwèqué ngangkat bar ing ndhuwuré sirahé) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""ndhuwuré"" is not a word commonly used in Indonesian language."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué njupuk kalkulator) is more likely to occur because it implies that the student will use a calculator to solve the problem, which is a common tool for solving mathematical problems. On the other hand, option B (Dhèwèqué bingung) means that the student is confused or unsure about how to approach the problem, which could lead to a longer thinking time and potentially a lower accuracy rate. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bapaké ngganti popok bayi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngganti popok"" means ""to rock or sway,"" which suggests that the father may be gently rocking or soothing the baby. This aligns with the idea of a parent comforting their child after a nightmare. Option B (""Bapaké ngguyangké bayiné kanthi alus"") does not fit as well with the context provided."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bocah kuwi ngalami Geger Otak) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the boy's head will explode due to excessive thinking. This is a humorous and absurd scenario that is not grounded in reality, making option A the most plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Foto-foto mau dadi kabur) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the photographer's camera will not be able to capture clear images due to the lack of lighting. This is a common issue in photography where insufficient lighting can result in blurry or underexposed photos. Option B (Kabèh wong ing foto ora gelem mesem), on the other hand, does not provide any logical explanation for why the photo would be affected and therefore seems less plausible.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (aku kesepian) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""aku nolak undhangan"" suggests that something has been missed or overlooked, which aligns with the meaning of ""aku kesepian"". Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku wis olahraga,"" option A (aku rumangsa semangat) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""wis"" in Indonesian means ""I am"", so the sentence can be translated as ""I am passionate about sports."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Iku nyedhot banyu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Aku nyempet spons sing udan"" suggests that something has been poured into a container, and the word ""nyedhot"" implies that it is hot or boiling. This could indicate that the contents of the container are now in a state of agitation or turbulence, which would cause them to spill over. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Resort wis dipesen) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""wis dipesen"" means ""to make a mess,"" which suggests that the resort has been damaged or disrupted in some way. Therefore, it is more plausible that the reason for the cancellation of the trip is due to the resort's condition rather than the presence of a crocodile in the nearby area."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué wedi karo jarum suntik) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Dhèwèqué wedi karo jarum suntik"" means ""The duck's egg was broken."" Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the problem is a broken egg rather than a peeling pot (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mobil sing ore kenal diparkir ing ngarep omahku,"" option A (aku dadi curiga) is more likely to occur because it implies that the speaker is curious about something they saw or heard. The phrase ""sing ore"" means ""to see something"" in Indonesian, and ""diparkir"" means ""to park."" So, the sentence can be translated as ""I saw something parking."" This suggests that the speaker was observing something unusual or interesting while driving, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bukti-bukti sing ana ing kono nduduhké nèk dhèwèqué kuwi salah) is the more likely cause of the problem. This is because the premise highlights that there are many signs or indications that suggest the problem is caused by a lack of effort or commitment from the team members rather than any external factors. Therefore, it is more plausible that the problem is due to internal issues within the team rather than any external factors.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ore mangan gula) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Wong lanang sing abot kuwi mutuske arep ngurangi bobot awake"" suggests that something has been added to a drink, causing it to become too sweet or overpowering. Option A implies that the addition of sugar makes the drink even sweeter, while option B implies that caffeine makes the drink more energizing. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke kesandhung) is more likely to occur than option B (Dhèwèqué gemeter). The word ""kesandung"" in Indonesian means ""to be sad or depressed,"" while ""gemeter"" means ""to be angry."" Therefore, it is more plausible that a person who has been bullied would feel sadness or depression rather than anger as their primary emotion."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ore turu sewengi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong wadon iku nduwé cincin ing ngisor mripaté"" suggests that something has been stolen or taken away from someone, and ""dhèwèqué"" means ""to steal"". Therefore, option A is a plausible explanation for what might have happened in this situation. Option B (""Bojone banjur didheg"") does not make as much sense in this context, as it simply means ""The dog bit him"", without providing any information about why he was injured."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""gunung geni"" refers to an active volcano, indicating that it is currently erupting or has recently erupted. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate response."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong wadon iku nganggo sepatu,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer because it uses a word that means ""to know"" or ""to recognize."" The phrase ""Dhèwèqué kenal karo kabèh wong ing pesta kuwi"" translates to ""I will recognize you with my eyes closed,"" which suggests that the speaker has prior knowledge of the person being referred to. In contrast, option B does not use any words related to recognition or prior knowledge, making it less likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (aku dityeluk liwat kantor tol) is more likely. The phrase ""aku mbayar petugas tol"" implies that the speaker has already paid the toll fee, so it is unlikely that they will be detained at the toll booth. On the other hand, option B (aku ditundha ing kantor tol) means that the speaker was arrested or taken into custody by the toll booth staff, which is less likely based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the executive became bankrupt due to excessive borrowing (Option B). This is because the phrase ""dhèwèqué adol saham perusahaané"" means ""borrowed heavily from the company,"" indicating that the executive took out loans or credit from their employer. On the other hand, ""dhèwèqué mbuwang-mbuwang bandhané"" means ""borrowed heavily from others,"" which could refer to external debts such as personal loans or credit card debt. Therefore, Option B is a more plausible explanation for why an executive might become bankrupt based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang kuwi lunga menyang dhokter,"" it is more likely that option A (Dokter kuwi lagi cuti) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi lunga"" suggests that there is a problem or issue with the doctor's work, and ""menyang dhokter"" further emphasizes this idea. Therefore, it makes sense that the doctor is taking too much leave or is absent from work due to some reason related to their job. Option B (""Wong lanang kuwi lara"") does not fit well with the given premise and seems less plausible."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku metu saka kamarku liwat jendela,"" option A (Omah é kobong) is the most likely cause. This is because ""metu"" means ""sad"" or ""depressed,"" and ""kamarku"" means ""to cry."" Therefore, it is possible that the person is feeling sad or depressed about something they saw through the window. Option B (Omah é kosong) does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no clear indication of what ""kosong"" refers to."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke adus suwe) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's stomachache. This is because the phrase ""dheweke adus suwe"" means ""eating too much sugar,"" which could potentially cause a stomachache in children. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nyembur susu,"" option A (Sapi kuwi rasane asem) is the most likely cause. The word ""nyembur"" means to spit or cough, so it suggests that the speaker has something stuck in their throat or are experiencing discomfort, which could be caused by a sore throat or coughing up phlegm. Option B (""Mulutku garing"") does not fit with the premise as well, as ""garing"" means to yawn, which does not relate to the symptoms described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Aku telat kerja) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""aku orabis"" which means ""I am tired,"" indicating that the speaker has been working hard and is feeling fatigued. This suggests that the speaker may be experiencing a decrease in productivity due to their workload, making option B the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the car will be damaged (Option B). The phrase ""tabrakan karo mobil"" suggests a collision between the truck and the car, which could result in damage to the car. Additionally, the use of the word ""kuwi"" to describe the speed of the truck implies that it was moving quickly at the time of the collision, increasing the likelihood of damage to the car."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi menang) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""nggungakke cara sing"" suggests that there are many ways or methods to achieve a goal, but the word ""menang"" implies that one method is more effective or successful than others. Therefore, it is more likely that Wong-wong will choose the most effective method to achieve his goal of getting into college."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I will spill the bottle) is more likely to occur than option B (I will cap it tightly). This is because the premise mentions that the bottle is already open, indicating that it has been opened before and could potentially be spilled or knocked over again in the future. In contrast, option B implies that the bottle is currently capped and secure, which is less likely given the context of an open bottle. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nyusup liwat jendhéla sing mbukak) is more likely to occur than option B (Dhèwèqué munggah ing atap). This is because the phrase ""nyusup liwat"" means ""to be angry or upset,"" while ""munggah"" means ""to be calm."" Therefore, it is more likely that someone who is angry or upset would lash out physically rather than simply being calm."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pengunjungé ngetokkè lawang) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""pengunjungé"" means ""visitor,"" while ""ngetokkè"" means ""to enter or go into."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that a visitor will enter or go into the forest. Option B (Wong wadon kuwi ndelok liwat bolongan kunci ing lawang) does not make sense in this context as it refers to a person who is unable to open a lock using their teeth, which has no relation to entering a forest."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke wis ngresiki garing) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the person's face will be covered with a cloth or something similar, which can cause them to become unrecognizable. Option B (Dhèwèqué nggantungké ing lemari) does not provide any information about the person's appearance becoming distorted or changed in any way. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pasta untu metu saka tabung) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""past untu metu"" means ""to eat until full"", so it suggests that the boy ate a lot of pasta and felt satisfied. Option B (""Bocah wadon iku nyemburake pasta gigi"") means ""The boy burped up pasta"", which implies that he did not feel full after eating the pasta and instead burped it back up. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Para pasifis nganakaké pawai) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""saka perang mundhak"" suggests that there is a war or conflict happening in the area, which could lead to violent clashes between soldiers and civilians. In this scenario, it is more likely that protesters would take to the streets to demonstrate against the violence rather than organizing a peaceful march."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke ngiket pita kasebut) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngiket pita kasebut"" means ""the hair has been pulled out"", which suggests that there was some kind of force applied to the hair, leading to its removal. This could potentially be caused by a child playing with their own or someone else's hair without proper care, resulting in accidental pulling or tearing. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué dadi tuwa) is more likely to occur. This is because ""dadi"" means ""to break down"" or ""to collapse,"" while ""tuwa"" means ""plastic."" Therefore, it is possible that the operation may cause the plastic to break down or collapse. Option B (Dhèwèqué katon luwih enom) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""katon"" means ""to melt"" and ""luwih"" means ""to become soft,"" but does not provide a clear explanation for why the operation would cause the plastic to break down."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak pitik metu saka endhog,"" option A (Endhogé metu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""metu"" in this context suggests that something has been done or caused by someone or something else, so it is unlikely that the speaker would say ""aku wis ngethok endhog"" (I made a mistake). Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Panjenengané séda. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the speaker will feel a strong desire to sleep after eating spicy food. The phrase ""tahanan kuwi"" means ""I want to sleep,"" while ""merga keluwen"" means ""spicy."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué munggah ing undhak-undhakan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""munggah"" means ""to swell"" or ""to inflate,"" so it suggests that the person's body will expand or grow larger due to some external factor. Option B (Dhèwèqué tiba saka undhak-undhakan) means ""the person's body will be filled with something,"" but does not necessarily imply a sudden or dramatic change in size. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah kuwi nggarak,"" option A (Dhèwèqué ngunjuk soda) is more likely to be the correct answer because it matches the pattern of the other words in the premise. The word ""ngunjuk"" means ""to drink"" or ""to consume,"" which fits with the idea of a child eating too much soda. Option B (Dhèwèqué mbukak kaleng soda) does not fit this pattern and would require further explanation to make sense in the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ana angin adhem mlebu liwat jendhela,"" option B (aku dadi gemeter) is more likely to occur because it means ""I am angry"" in Indonesian. The other option, ""aku santai"" (""I am calm""), does not fit with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Kanca-kancané kelas ngajèni dhèwèqué) is a more plausible explanation for why students are eager to find scholarships. This is because in Indonesia, academic achievement is highly valued and seen as a key factor in securing a good job and social status. Therefore, it makes sense that students would prioritize their studies and strive for excellence in order to increase their chances of obtaining a scholarship. In contrast, option B (Dhèwèqué nduwé nilai apik) may not be as relevant or motivating for students in this context, as ""apik"" (meaning ""high value"") could refer to various things beyond academic performance."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué manggon ing sebelahé) is a more plausible explanation for why the boy's mother would not let him go to school than option B (Dhèwèqué seneng karo dhèwèqué). This is because ""manggon"" means ""to be busy"" or ""to have work,"" so it suggests that the mother may have important tasks or responsibilities that prevent her from letting the boy go to school. In contrast, ""seneng"" simply means ""lazy,"" which does not provide as clear of an explanation for why the mother would refuse to let the boy go to school. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngundang rasa welas asih) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngundang rasa welas asih"" means ""to feel a sense of unease or discomfort,"" which aligns with the given premise of feeling unwell after eating something spicy. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku péngin nduwé privasi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""aku néngin nduwé privasi"" means ""I will not share my private matters."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is expressing their reluctance to discuss personal or sensitive information with someone they do not know well."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang kuwi nyekel aku,"" option A (Aku ngambung tangané) is more likely to occur because it means ""I will stretch my hand out."" This action aligns with the idea of reaching for something or someone, which fits with the context of the premise. Option B (Aku ngalahkedeweke) means ""I will throw away,"" which does not fit as well with the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku mlayu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""aku mlayu"" means ""I am sleepy,"" indicating that the speaker is feeling drowsy or tired. This suggests that they are unlikely to be playing frisbee or launching fireworks into the air. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah wadon iku ngethok kuku,"" option A (Dhèwèqué kuwatir) is the most likely cause. This is because ""iku"" in Indonesian means ""to eat,"" so it suggests that the boy ate something spicy or hot, causing his eyes to water. Option B (Dhèwèqué kaget) means ""he became angry,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku nguripake kaca ing tanggalan) is a more plausible cause for why the promise was not fulfilled than option B (Iku awal sasi anyar). This is because ""nguripake kaca"" means to break or shatter something, which suggests that the promise was not kept due to an intentional act of breaking it, rather than simply forgetting or neglecting it. Therefore, option A is a more logical explanation for why the promise was not fulfilled compared to option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngeculaké pengacaraé) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""nemokake yen garwane"" suggests a strong desire or craving for something, which could lead to impulsive behavior such as overspending. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience financial difficulties due to their spending habits rather than simply being lazy and not wanting to work."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah wadon kuwi ngeculaké bal karet,"" it is more likely that the boy will be hit by a car (Option A). The phrase ""kuwi ngeculaké"" means ""will be hit,"" and ""bal karet"" means ""car."" Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué ngerti jawabané) is a more plausible explanation for why the boy's answer was wrong. This is because ""ngerti"" means ""to understand"" or ""to comprehend,"" so it suggests that the boy did not fully grasp the concept of the question being asked. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lawané nyekel pass) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngatasi lawannya"" suggests that the speaker is trying to outdo or surpass their opponent, which aligns with Option A's meaning of ""to defeat soundly."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will use this phrase to describe a situation where they have successfully defeated their opponent in a competition or challenge."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku njupuk tomat saka wit anggur,"" option A is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""njupuk"" means ""squeezed"" or ""crushed,"" which suggests that something was pressed or compressed, leading to a breakage of the tomato. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the tomato broke."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dheweke ketemu karo mantan pacar kanggo mangan awan) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker will meet their former lover again, which can lead to a romantic encounter or reunion. Option B (Dheweke tuku coklat kanggo pacare) does not have the same implication of a romantic encounter and is therefore less likely to happen based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku ngeculake termometer) is a more plausible cause for why the mercury in the thermometer may have risen than option B (Cuaca dadi luwih anget). This is because there is no logical connection between the weather and the mercury level in a thermometer. The temperature reading on a thermometer is determined by the expansion or contraction of the mercury inside it due to changes in temperature, not by external factors like weather conditions. Therefore, if the mercury level has risen, it is more likely that someone has tampered with the thermometer or that there is another issue with its accuracy rather than blaming the weather.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Atap gedung pengadilan njeblug) is more likely to occur as a result of the storm. The word ""njeblug"" in Indonesian means ""to collapse or fall down,"" so it's possible that the building will be damaged by the strong winds and rain brought by the storm. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sekolahané saya apik) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of ""saya"" instead of ""nyontek"" suggests that the speaker is referring to themselves as a student who is good at learning, rather than someone who is struggling with their studies. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku rumangsa seneng"", option A is more likely. The word ""rumangsa"" means to be bored or tired, so it suggests that the speaker is feeling uninterested in something. Option B does not fit well with this premise as ""mbungkus"" means to hug or embrace someone, and ""awakku"" is a possessive pronoun meaning ""my"". Therefore, option A is the better choice because it aligns better with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nggilap watu iku,"" option A (Dadi licin) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""nggilap watu"" means ""I will eat you up,"" indicating that the speaker intends to harm or consume someone. Therefore, option A is the best choice because it implies a negative action towards the person being addressed."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nambah gula ing kopi"", it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Kopi kuwi mambu banget"". This is because adding sugar to coffee can make it sweeter, rather than bitter or sour."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dhèwèqué ngiris-iris koran-koran kuwi) is more likely to occur because it aligns better with the given context. The phrase ""kuwi nggolèk-nggolèk"" suggests that something is being pulled or stretched, which could be interpreted as the paper being torn apart by a strong force. Therefore, option B best fits the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pancorane disempal ing kayu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""aku mbanting kuku nganggo palu"" suggests that there is a strong desire or craving for something sweet, which could lead to overeating or indulging in unhealthy foods. This could result in weight gain or other negative health effects if not balanced with regular exercise and a healthy diet. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iwak iku ngethok tali,"" option A is more likely to occur because it uses a verb that means ""to catch"" or ""to take."" This implies that something will be taken from the subject (iwak) by someone or something else (ngethok). In contrast, option B uses a verb that means ""to throw"" or ""to hurl,"" which does not fit with the context of taking something away from someone. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke duwe jerawat) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's swollen face. This is because the phrase ""dheweke duwe"" means ""to hit or slap,"" indicating that someone may have physically harmed the boy. Option B (Dheweke njupuk braces dheweke mati) does not provide a clear explanation for the boy's swollen face and seems less plausible based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wajahku dadi padhang"", option A (aku nampa kabar apik) is more likely to be the correct cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tanganku dakusapi nganggo andhuk,"" option B is more likely. The word ""dakusapi"" means to be angry or upset, so it's more likely that Tanganku is feeling angry than wise. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Tanganku wis teles."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kursi sing ana ing sangisoré ngguncang) is a more plausible cause for why Wong's chair might be unstable than option B (Dheweke ngeculake cat ing bangku). This is because the first option suggests that there may be a problem with the legs or foundation of the chair, while the second option does not provide any specific reason as to why the chair might be unstable. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi kalah) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""kuwi kalah"" means ""too lazy to study,"" suggesting that a lack of motivation or effort may be contributing to the student's poor academic performance. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given in the question."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku njesel karo kesalahanku) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the speaker is feeling regretful or remorseful about something they have done wrong, which aligns with the meaning of ""aku nyesel"" in Indonesian. Option B (""Aku wis nggayuh tujuwanku"") means ""I was angry at you,"" which does not fit as well with the context given in the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué takon-takon bab dhèwèqué déwé) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""Wong wadon kuwi bosen karo pacare"" suggests that someone has been teasing or bothering their boyfriend/partner, which could lead to a reaction like ""Dhèwèqué takon-takon bab dhèwèqué déwé"". Option B (""Dheweke ngomong terus-terusan bab awake dhewe"") does not fit as well with the given premise, as it implies that the person's boyfriend/partner is constantly talking nonsense, which may not necessarily be related to being teased or bothered."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Pethiné dadi abang) is more likely to occur as ""bocah wadon"" means ""young boy"" in Indonesian, while ""abang"" means ""brother"". Therefore, it is possible that a young boy may be called by his brother's name. Option B (Cithakané katon) does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Iku liwat tambang) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""tambang"" refers to a ship or boat, so it is possible that the ship may have hit something underwater, causing damage to the seafloor. This is supported by the word ""mlebu"", which means ""to break"". Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué mlumpat ing blumbang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""mlumpat ing blumbang"" means ""to break something with a hammer,"" which aligns better with the context of breaking something than ""ngambah kaca sing pecah"" (to hit glass until it breaks). Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Wong-wong kuwi ngerti sapa sing matèni dhèwèqué. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Detective K will use his intelligence to solve the case rather than relying solely on his martial arts skills. The phrase ""ngerti sapa"" means ""to think carefully,"" indicating that Detective K will employ his cognitive abilities to crack the case. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ana akèh lalu lintas ing dalan gedhe,"" option A (aku njupuk dalan singora rata) is more likely to occur because it implies that Ana will jump into the river. The phrase ""lalu lintas"" means ""to flow"" or ""to move quickly"", which suggests that Ana will be moving rapidly through the water. Option B (aku njaluk tumpangan) means ""I will ride a wave,"" which does not fit with the idea of Ana moving quickly through the water. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ekonomi negara saya suda"", option A (Akèh wong sing lara) is the most likely effect. This is because ""suka"" in Malay means ""to be good or fine"", so it implies that the economy of the country is doing well or fine. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi arep mlumpat ing dalan sing arep digawa) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. This is because the phrase ""wong-wong kuwi"" refers to a type of fish that is known to be invasive and can cause problems in aquatic ecosystems by outcompeting native species for resources. The fact that the fish are ""ngungelake"" or ""peluit"" suggests that they have multiplied rapidly and are causing an overgrowth of vegetation, which could lead to a decrease in oxygen levels in the water. Therefore, it is more likely that the excessive growth of these fish is the main cause of the problem rather than the other factors mentioned in option B (Dhèwèqué kenal karo wong-wong kuwi saka lingkungané)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué ngándhani sing bener) is a more plausible explanation for why Aku nggulung mripatku marang kancaku than option B (Dhèwèqué ngéling-éling kanthi sarkastik). This is because ""ngándhani"" means to be angry or upset in Indonesian, while ""ngéling-éling"" means to be sarcastic or mocking. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mobilé entèk bensin"", option A (Sopiré macet ing dalan) is more likely to happen because it implies that the car will run out of gasoline, which can cause it to stop functioning. Option B (Sopiré njupuk wong sing numpak sepur) does not necessarily imply a negative outcome for the car's functionality."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely to occur. The phrase ""wong wadon kuwi"" suggests that something has been done repeatedly or consistently over time, while the addition of ""laraké"" implies a sense of urgency or importance. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will continue to do whatever they are doing with increased intensity or frequency, rather than stopping or slowing down."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Topié wong lanang kuwi ditiup angin,"" option A is the correct answer. The phrase ""dheweke nyopot topi"" means ""the wind blew away the hat."" Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the hat to be blown away by the wind."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nampa undangan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""bocah wadon iku"" suggests that a young boy is involved in the situation, and ""melu pesta ulang tahun kanca sakelas"" implies that he has been invited to a party. Therefore, it makes sense that he would receive an invitation rather than a gift."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ibuné ngukur suhu awaké) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ibuné"" means ""to sweat,"" and ""ngukur"" means ""cool."" Therefore, it makes sense that the boy's body temperature would decrease as he sweats. Option B (Ibuné nggawa dhèwèqué menyang taman) does not make logical sense in this context, as there is no clear connection between the boy's body temperature and the distance from the garden."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué pengin ngumunké pacaré) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""dheweke"" means ""to wake up,"" and ""pacaré"" means ""to dream."" So, the sentence suggests that someone has woken up from a dream. Option B (Dheweke nglebokake gel ing rambut) does not make sense in this context, as ""nglebokake"" means ""to comb hair,"" and ""rambut"" means ""hair."" Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (aku nggoleki lampu senter) is more likely to occur than option B (aku njupuk sekop). This is because the premise mentions ""listrik ing omah mati,"" which implies that there is a risk of electrocution from touching something with live wires. Option A takes this into account by mentioning ""nggoleki lampu senter,"" or turning off the power source, which would reduce the risk of electrocution. Option B does not take this into account and simply mentions ""aku njupuk sekop,"" or being bitten by an electric shock, which could still result in electrocution despite the reduced risk compared to option A. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anaké wis lulus saka sekolah menengah) is more likely to be the cause of the family's move to a new home. The premise mentions that the family has moved to a ""new"" home, implying that they have recently relocated. Additionally, the mention of the child completing middle school suggests that the family has been living in this new home for at least a few years, as middle school typically lasts for three to four years. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the family's move."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué pengin ngirit tenaga) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""pengin ngirit"" means ""too much effort,"" suggesting that the runner may have been pushing themselves too hard, leading to fatigue and a slower time. Option B (Dhèwèqué ndelok garis finish) means ""not enough energy,"" but it does not fit as well with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (mesin kuwi ngundhuh) is the more likely cause of the problem. The use of an automatic vending machine that dispenses food without proper maintenance can lead to a buildup of grease and dust inside the machine, causing it to malfunction or break down. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anjing kancaku mati,"" option A (Aku nggulung mripatku marang dheweke) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb that means ""to bite"" in Indonesian, which aligns with the meaning of the phrase ""dog dies."" Option B (Aku ngrangkul dhèwèqué) does not use any words related to death or dying. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dhèwèqué nulis surat utang) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the idea of Kertu being unable to pay off his debt due to financial difficulties. Option B (Dhèwèqué mbayar kanthi awis) does not make sense in this context as it implies that Kertu has enough money to pay off his debt but chooses not to do so.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke ngethok kuku) is the more likely cause of the effect. The phrase ""dheweke"" means to shake or tremble, and ""ngethok"" means to fall or drop. Therefore, it is more likely that the object fell due to being shaken or trembled than because someone was trying to pick it up (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang kuwi bangga karo seduluré,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""kuwi bangga"" means to be proud or arrogant, while ""seduluré"" means to be lazy or indolent. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's laziness (option A) caused them to not want to go to school."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lunga menyang perpustakaan) is more likely to occur as a result of the situation described in the premise. This is because the word ""lunga"" means ""to dream,"" and ""menyang"" means ""to read."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the person is more likely to have vivid dreams after reading books in the library. Option B (Dhèwèqué ndelok lintang-lintang) does not make sense in this context, as there is no clear connection between the words ""ndelok"" and ""lentang-lentang."""
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku nyelehké poster ing ndhuwuré lawang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""nyelehké"" means ""to hang loosely,"" so it suggests that the poster is not properly attached or is hanging crookedly. This is a common problem when attaching posters to walls using tape, as the tape may not hold well over time. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the poster is falling down."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Arsitèk kuwi sing mbangun bangunan kuwi) is more likely to happen because it implies that the architect will design a building according to their own preferences or style, rather than following someone else's plan. Therefore, the architect has more control over the design process and can make changes as they see fit.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tangane gemeter) is the most likely cause for why Wong's stomach hurts. The word ""tangane"" means to grumble or rumble in Indonesian, indicating that Wong's stomach is making noise due to digestive issues. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that dewan direksi will be dissolved (Option A). The reason for this is that the CEO's resignation typically indicates a change in leadership or management within an organization, which may lead to changes in the composition of the board of directors. In many cases, the board of directors is responsible for appointing and overseeing the CEO, so their departure could result in a reevaluation of the board's structure and membership. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (aku lungguh ing baris mburi) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker will be late for class due to being stuck in a long queue or line. This is a common experience for many students who have to deal with crowded public transportation or traffic jams on their way to school.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kulawarganipun mbayar jaminan) is more likely to be the cause of the situation. The phrase ""dibébaské saka penjara"" suggests that the person has been released from prison, implying that they have served their sentence. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would still owe money for their bail. Option B (""Dhèwèqué nyerang kanca tahanan"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""The prisoner's family paid a large amount of money."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong loro kuwi ngedol omahe) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""kuwi"" in this context refers to a bird's nest, which is often associated with the idea of something being fragile or easily broken. The phrase ""kabèh bandhané"" also suggests that the speaker is worried about losing something valuable, such as a treasure or a precious object. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would use the word ""ngedol"" to describe their fear of breaking something important."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngidak kaleng aluminium,"" it is more likely that the aluminum can will be dented or damaged (option B). Therefore, the correct answer is option B: Kalengé rusak."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dhèwèqué sinau nggunakkékomputer) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the boy's inability to communicate will lead to a problem with his computer use.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (aku ngrungokké musik) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""ngrungokké"" in Indonesian means ""to play music"", so it fits well with the context of the premise. Option B (""aku wis ngumbah piring"") does not make as much sense in this context, as ""ngumbah piring"" means ""to wash plates""."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi mènèhi pangan wong-wong singora nduwé omah) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""ngunggahake dhuwit"" implies that something has been added or mixed into the food, which could potentially cause an adverse reaction in the person consuming it. The phrase ""mènèhi pangan wong-wong singora nduwé omah"" suggests that the food has been contaminated with a harmful substance, which would likely have a negative impact on the person's health. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para penumpang padha ngguyu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""mudhun ing lereng sing curam"" suggests that something heavy or large is being rolled down a steep slope, which could potentially cause damage or injury if it were to fall. Option A implies that this scenario is more likely to happen due to the increased risk of accidental release from the rolling object's container."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nesu banget"", option A (aku mriksa kothak layang nalika metu saka omah) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""nesu banget"" implies that something has been done or experienced before, which suggests a sense of familiarity or routine. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will choose to do something they have already done before, such as ""mriksa kothak layang nalika metu saka omah""."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lunga menyang lor) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""lunga menyang lor"" means ""to be angry or upset,"" so it suggests that the person's anger or frustration may lead them to act impulsively or aggressively. Option B (Dheweke tangi esuk) means ""to be quiet and calm,"" which does not align with the idea of acting impulsively or aggressively. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nglipat layang"", option A (aku daur ulang kertase) is more likely to occur because the word ""nglipat"" means ""to flicker or flash"", which suggests that something is moving quickly and unpredictably. Therefore, it is more likely that the light source will be moved around randomly rather than being stationary and steady like in option B (kertase dadi kusut)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Para pemimpin negara liya mbentuk aliansi) is the more likely outcome. The premise highlights the need for a leader to form an alliance in times of crisis, indicating that cooperation and collaboration are crucial in addressing disasters effectively. Therefore, option A best reflects this idea.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke metu saka Kolam Renang) is a more plausible explanation for why the boy was not found in the swimming pool. This is because ""metu"" means ""not"" or ""without"", indicating that the boy did not enter the swimming pool at all. Option B (Dheweke tiba ing Kolam Renang), on the other hand, suggests that the boy entered the swimming pool but then left without being found, which does not align with the given premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Buku kuwi arep dibalèkké menyang perpustakaan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""arep dibalèkké"" suggests that the book was thrown or flung with force, which could potentially damage or destroy it. In contrast, option B (Dhèwèqué nyilih saka kancané) implies that the book was simply knocked over or fell without any external force being applied to it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the book might be damaged."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué dipenjara) is the most likely cause of the death penalty for witchcraft in Malaysia. The phrase ""Wong jahat kuwi diukum mati"" suggests that the person was accused of being a witch and was punished with death. This aligns with the historical context of witch hunts and persecution in Malaysia, where allegations of witchcraft were often used to justify violence and discrimination against certain groups, particularly women and marginalized communities. Therefore, it is more likely that the person was sentenced to death based on these accusations rather than facing a harsher sentence due to the severity of their crime."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cahya srenge mlebu kamar"", option A (Aku mbukak gorden) is the most likely cause. The word ""gorden"" means to sweat or perspire, which aligns with the idea of feeling hot and uncomfortable in a small room. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wulu wulu dheweke metu) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""Aku nyeret rambut"" means ""I cut my hair,"" while ""saka impostor"" means ""fake or imitation."" Therefore, the phrase ""Wulu wulu dheweke metu"" can be translated as ""My real hair was cut off."" Option B (""Dhèwèqué dadi botak"") does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué seneng banget karo naskah kuwi) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""ngantikan"" in this context means to predict or assume something, rather than to doubt or question it. Therefore, the editor's response of ""dhèwèqué seneng banget karo naskah kuwi"" implies that they are confidently assuming that the script will be successful based on their initial impression of it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué sadhar yèn kertu kuwi ilang) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""sadhar yèn"" means ""to be in a hurry,"" indicating that the person is trying to rush through their work without properly checking their accounts. This suggests that they are more likely to make mistakes or overlook important details, leading to errors in their accounting records. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang lan wong wadon kuwi padha tresna,"" option A (Wong loro kuwi kuliah) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the meaning of the sentence. The word ""kuwi"" in this context means ""to study or learn,"" so it is likely that the speaker will go to school rather than get married."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku ngunggahake volume) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Musiké ore patiya"" suggests that someone is trying to listen to music, but there is a problem with the volume. Option A aligns better with this context as it means ""I will increase the volume."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (bocah wadon ruffled iku) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""rambuté bocah kuwi"" suggests that the boy's hair was messy or disheveled, which could have caused him to look cute or adorable. Therefore, it is more likely that he had a ruffled appearance rather than being narik ( Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku nyemprotake dhewe karo repellent serangga) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""nyemprotake dhewe"" means ""to spray or sprinkle something,"" indicating that the speaker plans to use a repellant to keep bugs away. Option B (""aku mlaku ing bug"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""I will eat the bug."" Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what the speaker intends to do based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku mbukak mripatku"", option A (aku tangi) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku njaluk supaya dheweke nolak) is more likely to be the correct answer because it uses a verb that means ""to envy"" or ""to covet,"" which fits with the idea of wanting something that belongs to someone else. Option B (Aku njaluk nyilih CD saka dhèwèqué) uses a verb that means ""to buy"" or ""to purchase,"" which does not fit as well with the context of wanting something that belongs to someone else. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ore nggunakké akèh dhuwit) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. This is because the phrase ""nggunakké"" means ""not enough"" or ""insufficient"", indicating that there may not be enough money available for the family's needs. Option B (Dhèwèqué éntuk upah sing kurang saka upah minimum) suggests that the family may be experiencing financial difficulties due to a lack of income, but it does not necessarily imply that they do not have enough money overall. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Dhèwèqué ngolék gawéan. 
Explanation: According to the premise, after graduating from university, Murid will definitely have a job (ngolék gawéan). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cat sing sumebar ing endi-endi) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sing sumebar"" means to make a loud noise or sound, while ""indi-endi"" refers to something that is far away or distant. Therefore, it is more likely that the cat will make a loud noise rather than disappear completely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku orang nduwé apa-apa manèh kanggo rembugan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. This is because the phrase ""orang nduwé"" means ""I am tired,"" indicating that the speaker is feeling fatigued or exhausted, which could potentially lead to a decrease in productivity or quality of work. Option B (Rembugané dadi tegang) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the problem and seems to be unrelated to the premise given."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku nampani dhèwèqué bali ing omah) is more likely to be the correct response. This is because ""Adhiku"" means ""I will go"", and ""metu saka rumah sakit"" means ""to the hospital"". Therefore, the speaker is expressing their intention to go to the hospital. Option B (Akuora gel melu) does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Adegan pambuka drama diwiwiti) is more likely to be the correct answer because it refers to the beginning of a play or drama, indicating that the scene is set in a theater or performance space. Option B (Para aktor ing lakon kuwi metu saka panggung) means ""Before the actors start acting,"" which could refer to any number of scenarios, but does not specifically indicate a theatrical setting. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Penculik kuwi ngancam arep nglarani sandera) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""ngancam arep"" suggests that the speaker's hair was pulled or tangled, which could be caused by someone else's action of pulling or tugging at their hair. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Musisi mau ngetok-ngetok sikilé) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sikilé"" refers to a type of traditional Javanese music that features complex rhythms and melodies, often played using traditional instruments such as the gamelan or suling. Therefore, it is likely that the speaker is referring to a performance involving this type of music. Option B (Musisi mau ngetokaké gendhing) does not make sense in this context, as ""gendhing"" is not a term commonly used in Indonesian to refer to music performances."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the boy said he saw a ghost) is the correct answer. The phrase ""tangi saka"" means ""ghostly figure"" or ""spirit"", while ""ngimpi elek"" means ""electricity"". Therefore, the boy's statement suggests that he saw a ghostly figure or spirit, rather than just electricity."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lair durung wayahé) is a more plausible explanation for why Wong wadon kuwi ngomong nganggo basa isarat than option B (Dhèwèqué lair budheg). This is because ""durung wayahé"" means ""to be angry or upset,"" while ""budheg"" means ""to be happy."" Therefore, it is more likely that Wong wadon kuwi ngomong nganggo basa isarat due to anger or upset rather than happiness."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (banyu dadi kontaminasi) is more likely to occur as a result of the pollution in the area. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kucing ngoyak manuk"", option A is more likely. The phrase ""ngoyak manuk"" means ""to be sick with a cold"". Therefore, the effect of being sick with a cold (option A) is more likely than the effect of wanting to eat worms (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sekolah ngeculake kanggo musim panas) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngege culake"" means ""to get hot,"" so it suggests that the school is too hot during the summer season. This is a common issue in many parts of Indonesia, particularly in schools located near the equator where the temperature can reach unbearable levels during the summer months. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Para karyawan mogok) is more likely to occur as a result of the manager's decision not to give bonuses to employees who do not sing the company song. This is because employee morale and motivation are likely to be negatively affected if they feel that their efforts are not recognized or valued by management. As a result, some employees may choose to call in sick or take other forms of absence rather than face the possibility of not receiving a bonus.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong sing ekstrem kuwi mengaruhi dhèwèqué) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""ekstrem kuwi"" means ""extreme hatred,"" and ""mengaruhi dhèwèqué"" means ""to influence or affect."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the extreme hatred will have a significant impact or influence on someone's behavior. Option B (Para ekstremis matèni dhèwèqué) does not convey this same meaning and is therefore less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pasir macet ing sikilku) is more likely to occur than option B (Ombak-ombak nggegirisi ing pinggir pantai). This is because the word ""macet"" means ""to be still or calm,"" while ""nggegirisi"" means ""to be rough or turbulent."" Therefore, it is more likely that the sand will be still or calm near the shore rather than being rough or turbulent due to waves crashing against the coastline."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku tangi ing tengah wengi krasa adhem,"" option B (aku ngombé segelas banyu) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the idea of feeling hot and sweaty due to exercise or physical activity. Option A (aku nganggo celana olahraga) does not necessarily convey this same meaning."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ibuné ore ngandhani anake,"" it is more likely that option A (Anaké ngguyu) is the correct answer. The word ""ngandhani"" in this context suggests a feeling of sadness or disappointment, which aligns better with the meaning of ""anaké ngguyu"" than ""anaké nangis."" Therefore, Option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku zip munggah jins) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""rusak"" means ""broken"" or ""damaged,"" so it suggests that something has happened to the celana jiniku, causing them to break or become damaged. Option B (aku kesandhung ing trotoar) does not make sense in this context, as there is no indication of anything being stuck inside a trotoar. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah kuwi nganggo kawat gigi,"" option A (Dheweke entuk rongga) is the most likely outcome. This is because the phrase ""kuwi nganggo"" means to suck or chew something, and ""kawat gigi"" refers to teeth. Therefore, it can be inferred that the person's teeth are being sucked or chewed, which would cause them to become loose. Option B (""Gigié dadi lurus"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""Teeth straightening."""
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dina iki aku tangi karo otot sing lara) is more likely to occur because it refers to the act of stretching one's muscles through yoga practice, which can help improve flexibility and range of motion in the body. Option B (Dina iki aku tangi karo tenggorokan sing lara) does not make sense in this context as there is no direct correlation between yoga practice and improving the flexibility of the neck. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Murid-murid liyané lungguh ing méja mangan) is more likely to occur. The use of ""liyané"" in this context suggests that the students are engrossed in their studies and are unlikely to be distracted by external factors such as noise from outside. Therefore, it is more plausible that they will focus on their work and continue studying until they finish their assignments."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué mlumpat manèh ing udhara) is more likely to occur than option B (Dhèwèqué mutuské kanggo nyoba kanggo nglakoni flip). This is because the phrase ""mlumpat manèh"" means ""to jump high,"" while ""mutuské"" means ""flip."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person will jump high rather than perform a flip."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Layangé tak lebokré ing kothak layang,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""tak"" in Javanese means ""not"", so the sentence can be translated as ""There isn't a letter that writes (the position of) the head."" Therefore, Option A is the best fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué taruhan kabèh duwité) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""Wong sing main judi kuwi percaya diri"" suggests that the person has a strong belief in their own abilities, which could lead them to take risks and make bold bets without properly considering the potential consequences. Therefore, option A is more aligned with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anginé saya banter) is more likely to be the cause of the fire. The phrase ""Anginé saya banter"" suggests that the fire may have been caused by a spark or flame from a nearby source, such as a lit cigarette or an open flame from a stove or heater. This is supported by the fact that the word ""banter"" means a small flame or spark. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ibuné ngongkon dhèwèqué menyang kamaré) is more likely to occur than option B (Ibuné ngubengi tatu kuwi). This is because the first sentence contains a wordplay involving ""lututé"" which means ""to be lazy"", while the second sentence does not have any similar wordplay or puns that could create a humorous effect. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué mlebu wasiaté) is more likely to be the cause of the patient's condition. The phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi slamet saka"" suggests that the patient has a severe infection or inflammation in their lungs, which can lead to pneumonia or other respiratory problems. This fits with the symptoms described in Option A, which mentions difficulty breathing and chest pain. In contrast, Option B (Dhèwèqué éntuk transplantasi organ) does not fit with the given symptoms and is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's condition."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngunjuk kopi sing panas banget"" (I will show you my coffee that's hot), option B is more likely. The word ""ngunjuk"" means to show or display, so it implies that the speaker has something to show, such as a cup of hot coffee. Option A does not make sense in this context because ""ngethok"" means to drink, not to show. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Editoré ngeculaké panulis) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngeculaké"" means ""edited"" or ""rewritten,"" suggesting that someone has altered the original text without proper authorization. This could result in errors, inconsistencies, or other issues with the content. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku rumangsa kesel banget,"" option A (aku turu sedina muput) is the most likely cause. This is because ""rumangsa"" means to be angry or upset, and ""kesel"" means a problem or difficulty. Therefore, it is likely that the speaker is experiencing anger or frustration due to some issue. Option B (""aku sinau sedina muput"") does not fit as well with the premise, as ""sinau"" means to be lazy or indifferent, rather than angry or upset."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué ndelok gejala-gejala saka pasien) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because a doctor would need to examine the patient's symptoms in order to make an accurate diagnosis. Option B (Dhèwèqué nulis resep pil kanggo pasien) does not align with this process as it implies that the doctor has already prescribed medication without properly examining the patient's symptoms first.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nggaruk kulitku,"" it is more likely that option A, ""aku wis keselek"" (I am angry) is the correct answer. This is because ""nggaruk"" means to be angry or upset in Indonesian, and ""kulitku"" refers to my skin, suggesting that I have a rash or irritation on my skin caused by something that made me angry. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Dhèwèqué dadi nesu) is more likely to be the cause of the emergency operation. This is because ""nesu"" in Indonesian means ""stomach pain,"" which could potentially lead to a medical emergency such as a perforated ulcer or appendicitis. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nyemplungaké tangané) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's ears are ringing than option B (Dhèwèqué ngusap tangané). This is because ""nyemplungaké"" means ""ringing"" or ""buzzing,"" while ""ngusap"" means ""pain."" Therefore, option A better fits the context of the premise, as it suggests that the speaker's ears are ringing rather than in pain."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang kuwi ngangkat alisé,"" option A (Dhèwèqué kaget) is the most likely cause. This is because ""kuwi"" means ""to be angry"" or ""to get angry,"" while ""ngangkat"" means ""to throw."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that someone got angry and threw something, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku percaya nèk dhèwèqué nduwé niat sing apik) is the more likely cause. This is because the phrase ""aku percaya"" means ""I believe,"" indicating that the speaker has faith in their colleague's abilities and is unlikely to doubt them without sufficient reason. Option B (Aku percaya nèk dhèwèqué luwih ngerti) means ""I believe he is lazy,"" which suggests a negative attitude towards the colleague and implies that the speaker does not trust them. Therefore, option A is the more appropriate choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué mulai ngleksanani luwih akèh) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""ngleksanani"" means ""to be angry,"" and ""luwih"" means ""to be severe."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the person will become angrier as time goes on. Option B (Dhèwèqué mulai tangi luwih awal) means ""The person started to get angry early,"" which suggests that their anger may have been building up over time but has not yet reached its peak."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Sing nererang mulai pendarahan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sing nererang"" means ""to start bleeding,"" indicating that there will be blood loss. This outcome aligns with the medical concept of hemorrhage or excessive bleeding, which can result from various injuries or conditions. Therefore, option B is a more plausible consequence based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Darté ore mrédhong,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as ""mrédhong"" means ""not good."" Therefore, the sentence would translate to ""It's not good for you to eat too much."""
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke nemokake tikus ing ruang paling ngisor) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that there are many cockroaches in a room that is very dirty, indicating that they have found a suitable environment to thrive. This aligns with the idea of cockroaches being attracted to food sources and dark, damp environments. Therefore, it is more likely that the cockroaches are nesting in the room due to its poor cleanliness rather than the presence of kebon teka.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku kesel banget) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""aku kesel"" means ""I am confused,"" indicating that the speaker is unsure of what to do next. This aligns with the idea of being unable to decide whether to invite someone over or not. Option B (""Tamu kula sampun"") does not convey this sense of confusion and uncertainty, making it less likely as a response to the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué mulai ndhelikké buku hariané) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""mulai ndhelikké"" means ""started writing"" in Indonesian, indicating that the speaker has already begun writing their diary entry. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would stop mid-entry and start again from the beginning."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué kerja lembur) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""Wong wadon kuwi"" means ""I will not work hard,"" indicating a lack of motivation or effort in completing tasks. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience negative consequences such as being reprimanded or facing disciplinary action for their poor performance rather than receiving an increase in salary."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Dhèwèqué nyentuh kompor sing panas) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Tangane bocah kuwi cepet banget mundur"" suggests that the child is feeling hot and uncomfortable due to the heat. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be to give the child a cool drink or fan them to help bring down their body temperature. Option B (""Dheweke ngusap sirahe anak kirik"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""The old man hit the child's head,"" which has nothing to do with the situation described in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Wong-wong mau nawaraké diskon kanggo para pelanggan anyar.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Wong-Wong will offer discounts to attract customers away from their competitors. This option aligns with the idea of trying to gain an advantage over other companies by offering lower prices or promotions."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (the boy wants to play with the couch) is more likely. The premise mentions that the boy ""mau"" or wants to do something, which implies a desire or intention to act. This suggests that he may be interested in playing with the couch rather than simply lying down on it. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nglindhungi rai,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mungsuhku ngécé aku"" is the correct answer. This is because ""nglindhungi"" means to be angry or upset in Indonesian, and ""mungsuhku"" means to make someone angry or upset. Therefore, the complete sentence would mean ""I am making myself angry."" Option B, ""Mungsuhku nggepok tangan,"" does not fit with the context of the premise and is therefore less likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Iki kena kilat) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ikilat"" means ""to boil over,"" suggesting that there may be too much pressure or liquid building up inside the pot, causing it to overflow. This is a common occurrence when cooking rice or other foods in a pot, and it can be caused by various factors such as using too much water, not stirring the mixture enough, or having an old or damaged pot. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the pot might be making strange noises."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Woh-wohan kuwi tak tinggal ing meja,"" option A is more likely to occur because it uses a verb that means ""to eat"" or ""to consume."" Therefore, it is more likely that the subject will eat something from the table rather than fly away with wings."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke nuduhake driji sikil) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""mau nyuwil ligamen"" suggests that there is a desire or intention to create something new, while ""dheweke nuduhake driji sikil"" means to break or destroy something. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker wants to create something new rather than breaking or destroying something existing."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué sinau carané ngiket) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Dhèwèqué sinau carané ngiket"" means ""The shoes are too tight for me,"" indicating that the speaker finds their shoes uncomfortable or constricting. Option B (""Dheweke mlayu ing taman dolanan"") does not make sense in this context and appears to be a non-sequitur. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku dadi kepincut karo buku kuwi,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""ora ngerti wektu"" means ""I will cut your head off."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will harm or injure someone than simply balancing a book."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Wong tuwané nduwé pengaruh marang dhèwèqué) is a more plausible explanation for why the dog's barking has stopped. This is because the phrase ""marang dhèwèqué"" means ""the influence of the moon,"" suggesting that the dog's behavior may be affected by lunar cycles or other celestial phenomena. Therefore, it is more likely that the dog's barking has stopped due to some external factor rather than simply because it is tired or hungry."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Gas wis entek) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Mobilé alon-alon mandheg"" suggests that something has been moved or transported from one place to another, while ""Sopiré ngantuk"" means to carry or hold something in a particular position. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to the act of moving something from one location to another rather than holding it in a specific position."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Es krim wis ilang rasané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""wis ilang rasané"" means ""to be covered with a layer of frost,"" indicating that the temperature has dropped significantly enough for ice crystals to form on surfaces. This suggests that the area will experience freezing temperatures, which could lead to the formation of ice or snow. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Karpeté katon reged) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""nggantungaké karya seni ing kamar"" suggests that something is being hung or placed in a room, while ""karpeté katon reged"" means to hang curtains. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to hanging curtains in the room rather than building walls with cardboard boxes."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku lara sirah) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""aku lunga saka kerja"" suggests that something has been done with great effort or difficulty, while ""laras sirah"" means ""to relax"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is feeling relieved or relaxed after completing a difficult task rather than being angry or frustrated."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sing duwé nyempal-nyempal asu kuwi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""iku ngrusak karpet"" means ""I will make a mess of the carpet,"" indicating that the speaker intends to cause damage or disrupt something. Therefore, it makes sense for the second line to be about cleaning up after making a mess, rather than receiving a gift."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku njaluk ngapura marang kancaku,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ngapura"" in this context suggests that something is being pulled or dragged towards the speaker's location, so it is more likely that the effect will be Option A (Kancaku ngapura aku)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngàwa tas ransel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi ora kaya wong liya"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not working properly, and ""Dhèwèqué nggawa tas ransel"" means ""The machine broke down."" Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngrampungképasseksiné) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person being accused of lying has a history of making false statements or misleading people, which could lead to a loss of credibility and trust among their peers. Option B (Dhèwèqué dituduh sumpah palsu), on the other hand, suggests that the person's lies are so obvious that they are easily detectable by others, which may not necessarily result in a loss of credibility but could still have negative consequences for the individual involved.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué pengin nduwé tampilan sing anyar) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""Wong wadon iku nglukis rambut"" means ""The hair is curly,"" which suggests that the person has curly hair. Therefore, it is more likely that they will have a messy or disheveled appearance, rather than looking neat and tidy all the time."
"Response: 
Option A: Wong loro kuwi éntuk gawéan. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the undocumented immigrants will be detained and deported rather than being allowed to stay in the country illegally. This is because the government has a responsibility to enforce immigration laws and protect national security, which may involve removing individuals who are in the country without proper documentation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para penonton padha ngguyu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngguyu"" means ""to laugh loudly,"" so it suggests that the speaker's intention is to make the audience laugh. Option B (Para penonton padha ngadeg) does not convey a clear sense of humor or comedy, but rather a general statement about the audience being pleased with something. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Srengéngé nggawé aku wuta) is more likely to occur because it uses the word ""nggawé"" which means ""to eat up"" or ""to consume"", indicating that something will be eaten by another thing. Option B (Kulitku dadi kecoklatan merga srengéngé) does not use any words related to consumption or eating, so it is less likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku rumangsa bosen,"" option B (aku ngambek) is more likely. This is because ""rumangsa"" means to be angry or upset, while ""ngambek"" means to be annoyed or irritated. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be ""aku ngambek."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Pisau kuwi mboseni) is the correct answer. The phrase ""iku angel"" suggests that something has been taken or eaten, while ""di potong"" means to cut or slice. Therefore, the most logical interpretation of the premise is that someone took a bite out of the steak without cutting it first. Option B does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no indication that the steak was cooked before being eaten."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Dhèwèqué nampà bayaran nafkah) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the premise mentions ""bangkrut"" which means bankrupt in Indonesian, indicating that the person has financial difficulties and cannot pay their debts. Therefore, option A which suggests seeking help from a financial advisor to manage debt is more relevant."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Aku mutusqué kanggo marani déwèké) is a more likely outcome than option A (Aku kepengin weruh apa dheweke métu). This is because ""mutusqué"" means ""to be angry"" or ""to be upset"", while ""weruh"" means ""to want"". So, in this context, it's more likely that the speaker will become angrier or more upset if they are unable to fulfill their desire for a lamp."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nyelehake kembang ing irungku,"" option A (Kembangé wis metu) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the meaning of the sentence. The word ""nyelehake"" means ""to spread or scatter,"" and ""kembang"" means ""flower."" Therefore, the phrase ""kembang é wisdom métu"" can be translated as ""the flower of wisdom has been scattered."" This makes sense in the context of the premise, which suggests that something has been spread or scattered. Option B (""Aku ngrasakké ambu kembangé"") does not fit as well with the meaning of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke nemoni kanca cilik) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong wadon kuwi ngrasa kangen"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not right, and the speaker is trying to find a solution. Option A aligns with this idea by suggesting that the speaker may have found a way to make things better for themselves or others. On the other hand, option B does not quite fit with the given premise as it implies that someone else's child is causing problems, rather than finding a solution to one's own problem."
"Response: 
A) Piyambakipun nyerahaken makalah punika langkung rumiyin. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the student will be able to complete the assignment with ease if they are motivated by the prospect of getting a good grade (Option A). This is because the student's motivation to do well in their assignment will drive them to put in extra effort and produce high-quality work. In contrast, Option B suggests that the student may not be motivated enough to finish their assignment, which could result in poor quality work or lack thereof. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mobilku rusak"", option A (Aku lunga menyang pusat perbelanjaan) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker's car has broken down near a shopping center, where they can easily find help or assistance. Option B (Aku ngundang mekanik) does not provide any context or clues about the location of the speaker's car or their situation, making it less likely to occur in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Iku anonim) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Aku mbuwang cathetan kuwi"" suggests that someone is trying to hide or conceal something, which aligns with the idea of being anonymous. Option B (""Ora isa diwaca"") does not fit as well with the given premise, as it means ""The cat is sleeping,"" which has no connection to the theme of hiding or anonymity. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manuk iku nggepok swiwine,"" option A (Iki nglairake endhog) is more likely to occur because it means ""The turtle will eat the fish."" This is a logical consequence of the premise, as turtles are known to be predators that feed on fish. Option B (Iku munggah munggah) does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Garasi kuwi mbukak) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""aku parkir ing dalam"" means ""I parked in,"" so it suggests that the speaker has parked their car somewhere. The word ""mbukak"" is a Malay term for ""parking lot,"" which further supports this interpretation. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (pelaku ngendelaké senjatané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngendelaké"" means ""to be taken away,"" indicating that the person will be removed or taken from their current situation. This implies a negative outcome for the person. Option B (korban ngangkat tangane) means ""victim of a curse,"" which also suggests a negative outcome for the person. However, based on the context of the premise, option A seems more appropriate."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku ngrancang arep nekani pemakaman pamanku) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""ngarep-arep akhir minggu"" suggests that something has been bothering or upsetting the speaker for a while, and the idea of creating an elaborate funeral for one's own burial seems like an unusual and excessive response to this problem. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is experiencing some kind of emotional distress or mental health issue that is causing them to think irrationally about their own death."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ore ngerti wektu,"" option A (aku ngimpi) is the most likely cause. The word ""ngerti"" in this context suggests that something has been taken or stolen, so it's unlikely that the speaker would say they are feeling happy (""aku ngimpi"") about it. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Printer é wisdom enters) is the correct answer. The phrase ""enters"" suggests a physical action of inserting something into the printer, rather than simply printing onto paper. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what could happen if someone were to put a piece of paper in the printer without any ink or toner."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Para penggemar banjur mratobat marang gendera) is more likely to be the effect of listening to the national anthem. This is because the phrase ""banjur mratobat marang gendera"" can evoke feelings of patriotism and loyalty towards one's country, rather than just a love for football or other sports."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Roso celupé ora enak"", option A (Aku ngladèni) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""ngladèni"" means ""I am hungry""."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Lenga kuwi nyedhot cairan kuwi) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the liquid will flow into a container, such as a cup or bowl, rather than being absorbed by something else like the paper towel in Option B (Lembu kasebut ninggal sisa lengket).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué wis nyorot kaca kuwi) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""wis nyorot kaca kuwi"" means ""the book was too heavy for him/her to carry,"" indicating that the person found it difficult to hold or bear the weight of the book. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why someone might be struggling with carrying a book."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong lanang iku nyandhet sabuk pengamané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pesawat kasebut nemoni sawetara turbulensi"" suggests that there are strong winds or turbulence in the area, which could cause a plane to shake violently. This is consistent with the idea of a plane being buffeted by strong winds, rather than simply hitting an air pocket. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah kuwi ore gelem,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer because it uses a verb form that matches the subject of the sentence (bocah) and also includes an adverbial phrase (ora gelem) that modifies the verb. Option B does not match the subject-verb agreement in the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi amputasi sikilé) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""wong-wong"" suggests a humorous or playful tone, and the idea of performing an amputation without proper medical equipment is absurd and unlikely to occur in real life. Therefore, option A is the most plausible response given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke nyekel pundhak marang dheweke) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""nyebung kuat"" suggests that the person's strength has been weakened, which could lead to a decrease in their ability to perform physical tasks. Therefore, it is more likely that they will experience fatigue or exhaustion after engaging in strenuous activities. Option B (Dheweke nyekel lengen saka dheweke) does not provide any logical explanation for why the person would feel tired after eating rice, so it is less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku ngajèni pendapaté) is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""ngajèni pendapaté"" means ""I have an opinion,"" indicating that the speaker has formed their own view or belief about something. This suggests that the speaker may have thoughtfully considered different perspectives before coming to their conclusion, rather than simply relying on intuition or instinct. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah kuwi mlaku ing lumpur,"" option A is more likely to occur because it suggests that the boy will get wet in the mud. The phrase ""klempungé"" means ""to get wet or dirty,"" and ""dadi nempel ing sepatuné"" means ""the boy's body got wet."" Therefore, option A is a more plausible interpretation of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sekolah-sekolah ditutup) is more likely to occur as a result of heavy rain. The sentence structure and vocabulary used suggest that the speaker is describing an everyday occurrence or situation that is common during rainy seasons. Therefore, it is more plausible that schools will be closed due to heavy rain than for students to have difficulty seeing in class because their teachers are too lazy to turn on the lights.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke mulih sedina) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""rampung"" used in the premise implies that something has been completed or finished, suggesting that the shift worker's job is over. This aligns with Option A, where the worker is expected to continue working after the shift ends. On the other hand, Option B suggests that the worker may be asked to leave their workstation immediately without completing their shift, which seems less likely based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Wit mau tiba ing atap) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""kuwi ngrusak"" suggests that something has been damaged or broken, which could refer to a physical object or a relationship. However, the phrase ""atap"" specifically refers to a roof, indicating that the damage may have occurred to a building or structure. Therefore, it is more likely that Wit's house was damaged by the storm rather than his page being blank."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kayu mau pecah dadi loro"", option A (Aku numpuk kayu ing njero perapian) is the most likely cause. This is because ""numpuk"" means to bend or fold something, which suggests that the wood may be weakened or damaged in some way, leading it to break easily. Option B (Aku nggebag kapak ing alas) does not fit with this premise as ""nggebag"" means to dig or excavate, which has no relation to the breaking of wood. Therefore, option A is the best answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pasangan kasebut ngumumake manawa dheweke pisah) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""ngumumake manawa dheweke pisah"" suggests that the couple's relationship has become strained or tense due to their own actions or decisions, rather than external factors such as a third party interfering with their marriage. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the couple's marriage may be facing challenges."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué seneng karo dhèwèqué) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. This is because the phrase ""ngirim layang"" suggests that something has been taken away or removed, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as loss, theft, or damage. On the other hand, option B (Dhèwèqué ngambung dhèwèqué) implies that something new has been added or introduced, which may not necessarily be the cause of the problem. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Aku setuju karo dhèwèqué) is the most likely cause for the speaker's confusion. The use of ""setuju"" (I agree) and ""dhèwèqué"" (it seems) suggests that the speaker is acknowledging the possibility that they may be confused about something. Option A (""Aku bingung"") simply means ""I am confused,"" but does not provide any additional context or insight into the reason for the speaker's confusion. Therefore, option B is the best answer based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi péngin nggolèk cara kanggo ngrampungke masalah) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. This is because the phrase ""kuwi"" means ""to complain"" or ""to grumble,"" and ""nggolèk"" means ""to make a big deal out of something."" Therefore, it suggests that the person is making a big deal out of the problem, rather than taking a rational approach to solve it."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Wong lanang kuwi ngeculaké barang-barang sing dituku ing kulkas) is more likely to happen because it mentions that the timer has stopped working, indicating that something has gone wrong with the device itself. Option B (Wong lanang iku njupuk pizza saka oven) does not make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between a broken oven and a stopped timer. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong wadon kuwi nduwé tujuan sing ambisius,"" option A (Dhèwèqué ore semangat manèh) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the person's lack of motivation is due to a lack of energy or enthusiasm, rather than a result of hard work."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anaké ngalami masalah hukum) is more likely to occur as a result of the situation described in the premise. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong wadon iku ngidak-idak geni,"" option A (Lampu geni mau mati) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngidak-idak"" means ""shaking or trembling,"" indicating that something is about to happen suddenly or unexpectedly. This implies that the lamp will break or stop working suddenly, rather than gradually losing its light over time. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Lisensi nyopiré dicabut) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""mobilé wong wadon kuwi ana ing bengkel"" suggests that there may have been a mechanical issue with the car's engine or transmission, which could potentially lead to it breaking down. However, the phrase ""dhèwèqué ngalami kacilakan mobil"" implies that there was no obvious reason for the breakdown, which makes option B less plausible. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku turu liwat weker,"" option B (akuora sarapan) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the meaning of the sentence. The word ""turu"" in this context means ""to turn or rotate,"" so it's unlikely that Aku would be eating breakfast."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kamera-kamera kuwi ndelok dhèwèqué) is more likely to occur because it implies that someone is secretly filming or taking pictures of a public figure without their knowledge or consent, which could be considered an invasion of privacy or even stalking. Option B (Kulawarganipun rawuh wonten ing konferensi pers) does not imply any illegal or unethical activity and can simply mean that the person is preparing for a conference or presentation. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong wadon mau isih ana ing bak mandi,"" option A (Banyu adus dadi anget) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the meaning of the phrase. The word ""wadon"" in Javanese means ""to eat"", and ""mandi"" refers to a rice field. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as ""I will eat rice from my own rice field."" Option B (Banyu adus metu saka bak) does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to occur."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué mel ing persaudaraan) is more likely to happen because it suggests that the two students will meet in person at their dormitory.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (aku nggoleki dhuwit cilik) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""nggoleki dhuwit cilik"" means ""to clean up a messy child,"" indicating that the speaker is more likely to be dealing with a mess caused by a child than an untidy room or a cluttered living room. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the boy will cry) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""Tawon iku mabur marani bocah lanang iku,"" indicating that the boy's tears are a possibility due to his emotional state. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dhèwèqué diukum mati) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Wong wadon kuwi dianggep salah"" suggests that someone has made a mistake or done something wrong, and the consequence of this action could be death. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate response."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nyampur gula menyang teh panas,"" option B (Gula é ilang) is more likely to occur because it implies that the sugar will dissolve in hot water, resulting in a sweeter drink. Option A (Tèhé dadi kukus) suggests that the sugar will not dissolve well in hot water, resulting in an unsweetened or bitter drink."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué digawa ing perang) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""digawa"" means ""to hit or strike,"" indicating that the problem was caused by an external force or action. Option B (Dhèwèqué tatu ing pertempuran) means ""to be struck by a bullet,"" which suggests that the problem was caused by something internal or accidental, rather than an external action. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Polisi ngubungi korban) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngubungi korban"" means ""to take advantage of a victim,"" indicating that the police are likely to exploit or manipulate the situation for their own gain rather than actively pursuing justice. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (aku ngeculake) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""aku ngeculake"" means ""I will break it,"" indicating that the speaker intends to damage or destroy something. This aligns with the given premise of wanting to get rid of a laptop. Option B (""aku ngisi daya"") does not make sense in this context as ""ngisi daya"" means ""to think deeply."" Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué nduwé lemari klambi sing akèh) is a more plausible explanation for why the door won't open than option B (Dheweke nglipat klambine). This is because ""klambi"" in Javanese means ""stuck,"" so it suggests that the door might be stuck due to some obstruction or blockage rather than simply being locked. Therefore, option A provides a more logical explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang kuwi sedih banget,"" option A (Bojo...nglairké anak) is the most likely cause. This is because ""sedih"" means sad in Indonesian, and ""kuwi"" can mean both crying or feeling sad. Therefore, it is possible that the speaker's child is crying due to being sad."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué dadi trampil kanggo nyambut gawé sing dikarepké) is more likely to happen because it suggests that something will be carried or taken away from a place using a tool such as a spade. This implies physical action and movement, which are both necessary for carrying or taking something away. Option B (Nawarké gawéané ditarik), on the other hand, does not imply any specific action or movement, making it less likely to occur based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nampani para rawuh) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Swaraé wong lanang kuwi krungu ing kabèh ruangan"" suggests that there is a problem with the sound system in the room, causing distortion or interference. Option A corresponds to this idea of a technical issue with the sound system. Option B (Dhèwèqué ngomong ing mikropon) does not fit as well with the given premise, as it refers to a microphone picking up unwanted sounds rather than a problem with the sound system itself."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Dhuwit receh pecah dadi loro) is more likely to occur because it implies that the water source has been affected by something external, such as a crack in the ground or a change in the soil's composition, rather than an internal factor like a buildup of sediment. Therefore, option B better fits the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Balé mlebu bolongan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""balé mlebu bolongan"" means ""the ball is stuck in a hole,"" indicating that the player's shot has gone awry and is now trapped in an awkward position. This outcome is more likely than option B (Balé mau mundur menyang juru main), which means ""the ball is moving towards the goalkeeper."" While this could also be a problem for the player, it is less likely to happen given the context of the situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ambegan bledug ing loteng"", option A (aku singkong) is more likely to occur. The word ""ambegan"" in Indonesian means ""to swell or inflate"", so it's likely that the person will feel uncomfortable or experience discomfort due to bloating or gas. Therefore, option A (aku singkong) is a more appropriate response."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (customer claimed to have received fake products) is the correct answer. The customer has already purchased from the store before but this time they claim to have received fake products instead of the original ones. This suggests that there may be an issue with the quality or authenticity of the products being sold by the store, rather than a simple mistake in packaging. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sampahé njalari pawoné mambu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sampahé njalari pawoné mambu"" means ""I want to throw away the trash,"" indicating that the speaker wants to dispose of something unwanted or unnecessary. This aligns with the idea of wanting to get rid of something unpleasant or bothersome. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise than option B (Aku ore sengaja mbuwang dhaptar blanja), which translates to ""I deliberately threw away the blanket."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bocah-bocah padha nggumun karo kewan-kewan kasebut) is more likely to occur. The use of ""nggumun"" in this context suggests that the action will be done with great force or intensity, making it more likely that the animals will be injured or killed. Option B (Bocah-bocah padha ngoyak kewan-kewan) does not convey the same level of violence or harm towards the animals."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ginjelé wis gagal) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""napasé wong"" suggests that something has gone wrong or is not functioning properly, while ""lanang kuwi"" means ""to fall apart"". This implies that the thing in question has broken down or failed, which aligns with Option A's interpretation of ""ginjelé wis gagal"". Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku takon karo kancaku kanggo arah menyang papan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""takon karo"" means ""to take a ticket,"" and ""kanggo"" refers to a concert or performance. Therefore, it makes sense that someone might want to buy additional tickets for a show. Option B (Aku takon karo kancaku apa dhèwèqué pengin melu) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""pengin melu"" means ""to eat rice."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku nggawa selimut) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""nggawa selimut"" means ""to cover something with a blanket,"" which aligns better with the idea of protecting or shielding something from damage. Option B (""aku mbukak jendhela"") means ""I will break my neck,"" which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah iku lara punggung"", option A (Tas ranselé mbukak) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""iku lara"" means ""to carry/bear something heavy"", and ""punggung"" refers to the back or spine. Therefore, it is likely that the boy is carrying a heavy load on his back, which could be interpreted as tas ranselé mbukak."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku nggawé jajan kanggo dhèwèqué) is the most likely cause of the effect described in the premise. Therefore, answer choice A is correct.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tanduran iku disengat lebah) is the more likely cause of the broken narcissus in the garden. This is because the phrase ""disengatlebah"" means to be damaged or destroyed by a wasp's sting, which suggests that the wasp may have caused the damage to the narcissus. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngetokaké korek api,"" Option B is more likely to occur because it implies that the fire will spread rapidly and intensely due to the spark from the lit match. The phrase ""Kembang api kuwi metu saka korek api"" suggests a rapid and intense spread of fire. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwiora gelem debat ing pengadilan) is more likely to be the cause of the conflict. This is because the phrase ""wong-wong kuwi"" means ""to argue or debate strongly,"" while ""gelem debat"" means ""to litigate or dispute."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the conflict is caused by a strong argument or debate between the two parties involved in the legal case. Option B (Wong loro kuwi péngin ndandani hubungané) does not provide any clear indication of what might be causing the conflict."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong tuwané matti) is the most likely cause for why a bocah-bocah may be sent to an orphanage. This is because in some cultures or societies, children who are born out of wedlock or whose parents are unable to care for them due to various reasons may be sent to an orphanage for protection and care. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ana tsunami) is more likely to occur than option B (Udan es wiwit deres). The phrase ""sing tiba ing samodra"" suggests a massive impact or disruption in the ocean, which could lead to a tsunami. Tsunamis are large ocean waves caused by earthquakes, landslides, or volcanic eruptions that can cause devastating damage along coastal areas. In contrast, ""udan es wiwit deres"" does not convey any specific meaning related to water or natural disasters. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué dadi dehidrasi) is more likely to occur as a result of the situation described in the premise. This is because dehydration can cause confusion, disorientation, and impaired cognitive function, all of which are consistent with the symptoms described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the best answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku nguripake oven) is a more plausible cause for why the toast is burnt than option B (Aku nyelehake piring ing oven). This is because ""nguripake"" means ""to burn"" in Indonesian, while ""nyelehake"" means ""to toast"". Therefore, option A suggests that the speaker accidentally burnt the toast in the oven, whereas option B does not provide any explanation for how the toast was cooked."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku nyikat irisan lemon,"" option A (lemon dadi jamur) is more likely. The word ""nyikat"" in Indonesian means to squeeze or press, which suggests that the speaker is trying to extract something from the lemon. This implies that the lemon will be broken or crushed, resulting in a juicy and sticky mess. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Negara kasebut nemokake tanah anyar,"" option A is more likely. The word ""nemokake"" means ""to make someone laugh."" Therefore, the sentence can be interpreted as ""The country makes fun of the empty land."" This implies that the country finds it amusing or ridiculous to have an empty land, rather than taking it seriously. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that the country is trying to hide something, which doesn't align with the tone of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kaca kuwi tiba saka méja"", option A is more likely to occur. The word ""tiba"" means ""to come"" or ""arrive"", so it suggests that something will arrive at the window. Additionally, the phrase ""iku pecah kabeh liwat lantai"" means ""the glass broke into pieces on the floor"", which implies a sudden and violent impact. Therefore, option A is more likely to occur than option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Méjaé goyang-goyang,"" option A (Lantaiéora rata) is the most likely cause. This is because ""goyang"" in this context means to be confused or perplexed, which could lead to a person making mistakes or acting erratically. Therefore, option A best fits the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Anaké ngaku bener) is more likely to be the correct response. This is because ""bapaké"" means father in Indonesian, and ""ngaku"" means I believe or trust. So the sentence ""anaké ngaku bener"" can be translated as ""I believe my child."" Therefore, option A is a plausible response based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke njupuk sirup watuk) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""dheweke"" means ""to mix or combine,"" and ""njupuk"" means ""sirup."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that mixing sirup with something will result in a banging sound. Option B (Dhèwèqué ngombé aspirin) does not make sense in this context, as ""ngombé"" means ""headache"" and ""aspirin"" is a medication used to treat headaches."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sepuré mandheg,"" it is more likely that the train was delayed due to a technical problem (Option A). The phrase ""iku nyedhaki stasiun"" means ""I am waiting for the station,"" indicating that the speaker is at the station and waiting for the train. This suggests that the train has already departed from its previous stop and is now approaching the next one, where the speaker is located. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the train is late."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided in the question, option A (Wong-wong ing keluargané ngalami penyakit mental) is the more likely cause of the patient's condition. The phrase ""wong lanang"" refers to a type of traditional healer or shaman who is believed to have the power to diagnose and treat illnesses through spiritual means. Therefore, it is possible that the patient sought treatment from a wong lanang for their mental health issues rather than seeking medical attention from a doctor."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke nguntal panganane) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""nguntal"" in Javanese means ""to be sick"", so it suggests that the speaker's mother may have been feeling unwell or sick. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Swara kuwi kaya swara sing nggronjal) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""swara kuwi"" means ""to whistle or make a sound with one's mouth,"" while ""nggronjal"" means ""to grind or crush."" Therefore, it is possible that the person may be making a sound with their mouth that could potentially irritate someone else's ears. Option B (Dheweke ngomong nganggo aksen) does not necessarily imply any physical action that could cause discomfort to another person."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anjing iku mandeng steak sing renyah ing meja,"" option A (Iku drooled) is more likely to occur. The word ""iku"" in Indonesian means ""he/she/it,"" while ""mandeng"" means ""drool."" Therefore, it is more plausible that the dog drooled rather than laid mud."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke ngeculake karyawan) is more likely to lead to success in business. This is because having a positive attitude towards work and being proactive can help an individual to be more productive and efficient in their job, leading to greater success in their career.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tombolé muni) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""tombolé muni"" means ""the teacher is crazy,"" suggesting that the teacher's behavior or actions are causing the students to feel uncomfortable or anxious. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem than option B (Guru maringi tugas), which simply means ""the teacher assigns too much homework."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kanca-kancané kuwi ore percaya) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong wadon iku ngaku weruh hantu"" suggests that there is a supernatural or paranormal element involved, which aligns with the idea of someone being afraid of something that they cannot see or understand. Option B (""Kanca-kancané ana hubungané karo dhèwèqué"") does not necessarily imply any supernatural elements and could simply mean that someone is afraid of something because it is unfamiliar or unknown to them. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué mèh klelep ing samodra) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi ora isa ngrungokke"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their consent or knowledge, which aligns with the meaning of ""klelep"" as a cause of loss or damage. In contrast, ""Dhèwèqué mèh mati ing jeblugan"" means ""The dog bit off my finger,"" which implies a physical injury caused by an external agent rather than a gradual loss or disappearance. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah kuwi ngeculaké tali baloné,"" option A (Baloné dadi kosong) is the most likely outcome. The word ""kuwi"" in Indonesian means ""crying"", so it suggests that the boy's tears are causing the balloon to deflate. Option B (""Baloné munggah ing udhara"") does not fit with this context as it implies that the balloon is being inflated by something inside it, rather than deflating due to external factors. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué kena stroke) is more likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. The phrase ""Wong lanang kuwi ore"" suggests that the patient has a fever, which could potentially lead to a stroke if left untreated. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ana retakan ing semen) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that something has been taken from inside a house without permission, and ""retakan"" means to take or steal in Indonesian. Therefore, it is more likely that the thief took something valuable or important from inside the house rather than inviting someone over for dinner."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong sing njaga wong mati banjur mlumpat ing njero) is more likely to occur than option B (Wong lanang iku nglembara marang juru nyalamet). This is because the phrase ""wong sing"" means ""to swim"" in Indonesian, while ""nglembara"" means ""to drown"". Therefore, it is more likely that someone who is swimming will drown in the water rather than being attacked by a giant fish."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku njupuk antibiotik,"" option B (Infeksiku nyebar) is more likely to occur. The use of the word ""nyebar"" in this context implies that the infection will spread or worsen as a result of not taking the recommended treatment (antibiotics). Option A (""Infeksiku wis mari"") does not convey the same sense of progression or escalation of the infection."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lampu lalu lintas dadi kuning,"" option A (Sopiré nyurung rem) is the most likely effect. The phrase ""lalu lintas"" means ""moves quickly,"" so it's likely that the lamp will move rapidly or at a high speed. Option B (Sopiré nyemplung klaksoné) does not make sense in this context as ""nyemplung"" means ""to honk"" and ""klaksoné"" is not a real word. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku nyelehake wadhah kasebut ing banyu anget) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""wadhah plastiké dadi lebur"" suggests that the plastic bag has melted or become deformed due to exposure to heat from a nearby fire or flame. This could be caused by a variety of factors, including spontaneous combustion of the plastic itself or contact with extremely hot surfaces. However, the phrase ""aku nyelehake wadhah kasebut ing banyu anget"" specifically implies that the melting occurred after the plastic was exposed to water, which supports the idea that the heat source was likely a nearby fire or flame rather than any other possible cause. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sopir kuwi nabrak tiang telepon) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The word ""kuwi"" in Indonesian means ""broken"", which suggests that the phone's antenna is damaged or broken. Therefore, it is more plausible that the phone call cannot go through due to a technical issue with the antenna rather than the light bulb being turned off."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah mau sinau sewengi muput,"" option A (Dhèwèqué ore melu ujian) is more likely to occur because it implies that the boy's desire for sweets will lead him to fail his examination."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué wedi sinau nglangi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngadhang ing pinggir kolam"" suggests that something has been thrown into the water, and ""sinau nglangi"" means to throw or fling something carelessly. Therefore, it is more likely that someone threw something into the water without thinking carefully about what they were doing, rather than intentionally neglecting their duties as a guardian."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku krasa kaya jantungku ngalah) is more likely to occur because it implies that the speaker's heart is being crushed or squeezed by something. This can be a physical sensation caused by an external force or object, such as a heavy weight or a tight grip. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bangunan sing cedhak karo kantorku lagi dibangun,"" it is more likely that the building will collapse. Therefore, option A (Kantorku kebak wong) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Keluarga kuwi ngundang tangga-tanggané kanggo mangan) is more likely to happen because it implies that the family will be able to climb up the stairs easily and comfortably without any obstacles or difficulties. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Banyu njeblug saka kolam renang"", option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""banyu"" means ""water"" in Indonesian, and ""njeblug"" means ""to flow"". Therefore, the sentence can be translated as ""The water flows into the swimming pool."" Option B does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngethok irisan semangka,"" option B is more likely. The word ""ngethok"" implies a deliberate action, so it's unlikely that the speaker would accidentally knock over a cup of coffee. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah kuwi kesandung"", option A (Jaketé ore dibukak) is more likely to be the correct answer because it matches the pattern of the other words in the list."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke kesasar dening swara) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""kesasar dening swara"" means ""to block or plug someone's ears,"" which aligns with the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku ngisi botol banyuku"", option A is more likely. The word ""ngisi"" means to boil or heat up, so it's likely that the speaker wants to heat up a bottle of water. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of cooling anything down."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ing kono ana basa sing kasar) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Acara televisi kasebut disensor"" suggests that there has been a cancellation of a television program due to some reason. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be ""Ing kono ana basa sing kasar,"" which means ""There was a problem with the broadcast."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kapal kuwinabrak"", it is more likely that the ship will sink (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué ngrampungaké teka-teki) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""ngrampungaké"" means ""confused"" or ""perplexed"", which aligns with the idea of being unable to solve a puzzle. Option B (""Dhèwèqué njaluk petunjuk"") means ""Dhèwèqué can't see anything"", which does not fit the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Telponé muni"", option A is more likely. The word ""muni"" means ""limited"" or ""restricted"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will say ""Wong lanang kuwi nyetel telpon"" meaning ""I don't have enough money to buy a phone"". Option B is less likely because ""njawab"" means ""to answer"" in Indonesian, so if the speaker wants to say ""I can't answer my phone"", they would use ""Njawab telponé"" instead of ""Wong lanang kuwi njawab telponé""."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong wadon kuwi mandeng aku,"" option A (Aku ngrangkul dhèwèqué) is more likely to occur because it matches the rhyme scheme of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wong-wong kuwi njupuk gambar barang-barang sing ana ing pameran kuwi) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""kuwi lunga"" refers to a group of people who are responsible for organizing or managing something, while ""musiyum"" means to sell or offer for sale. Therefore, it can be inferred that the group of people in question are involved in the process of displaying and selling goods at a market or fair. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that they are simply carrying around objects without any clear purpose, which does not align with the context provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kancaku ngenalake aku karo wong lanang iku) is more likely to occur because it uses the word ""ngenalake"" which means ""to be angry or upset"", while option B (Kancaku mbantu aku) does not use any words that convey anger or upset. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku ngompa udara menyang ban) is more likely to happen because it suggests that the speaker will use air pressure to lift the car, rather than changing the tire.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bapaké maca crita marang dhèwèqué) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""maca"" in Indonesian means ""to criticize"" or ""to blame"", while ""marang"" means ""to beat"". Therefore, the complete sentence would mean ""Bapaké (the father) criticizes/blames the child for being lazy."" Option B (Bapaké ngrasakké bathuké) does not make sense in this context as ""ngrasak"" means ""to sleep"" and ""bathuké"" means ""lazy""."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku nggunakkpot) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""nggunakkpot"" means ""I don't want to write"", so it fits better with the context of not wanting to do something. Option B (Aku nuliskan jenengku) means ""I will write a letter"", which doesn't fit as well with the context of not wanting to write anything."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué nduwé utang) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""utang"" means debt or financial difficulties in Indonesian, which suggests that the company may be experiencing financial problems due to its high levels of debt. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem faced by the company."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke duwe cacar) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""dheweke"" means ""to feel tired or bored,"" and ""cacar"" means ""headache."" Therefore, it is possible that the boy's headache is caused by feeling tired or bored in school. Option B (Dhèwèqué seneng sinau matématika) does not fit with the given premise as it means ""I am so happy because I understand mathematics well."" This does not relate to the cause of a headache."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Aku nggawa menyang tong sampah) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""aku nggawa"" means ""I want"" in Indonesian, indicating that the speaker wants to take care of or clean up the trash. On the other hand, option B (Aku mbuwang iku mudhun sink) does not make sense in this context as ""mbuwang"" means ""to throw away"" in Indonesian, which contradicts the idea of taking care of something. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kancaku kamar ngucur punch) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""ngucur"" in Indonesian means ""to bite or chew"", so it suggests that the person's carpet was bitten by something, rather than their hair being pulled. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dhèwèqué matèni komputeré) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the computer will be affected by a virus or malware, leading to its slow performance. Option B (Dheweke mbuwang kursi ing sisih liyane ruangan) does not make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between a chair being moved and a computer's speed. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cangkangé kobong) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""cangkangé kobong"" means ""the ghost will eat you,"" indicating that the person being addressed will be haunted or tormented by a supernatural entity. This outcome aligns with the theme of the premise, which suggests that the person's actions have angered a powerful spirit. Option B (""Geni mau mati"") means ""The soul wants to die,"" but it does not necessarily imply that the person will be haunted or tormented by a ghost."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Banyu panas wisora) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""banyu panas"" means ""hot water,"" which suggests that there may be a buildup of heat in the area, potentially causing discomfort or difficulty breathing. This is supported by the word ""wisora,"" which means ""heat."" In contrast, option B (""Dhèwèqué ore bisa nemokké"") does not provide any obvious clues about the cause of the problem. Therefore, based solely on the premise provided, it seems more likely that hot water is the culprit."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Wong loro kuwi nyimpen dhuwit kanggo biaya sekolah) is more likely to occur. This is because the premise highlights the financial burden of sending children to college, which suggests that parents may struggle to afford the costs associated with higher education. Therefore, it is more likely that they would prioritize their own needs over those of their children's education.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang iku mbongkar tali sepatune,"" option A is more likely. The word ""mbongkar"" in this context implies a breaking or destruction of something, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, it is more likely that the tali sepatune will break due to wear and tear than for any other reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dheweke adhem sisa-sisa) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""dheweke"" means ""to remain"" or ""to be left over,"" indicating that the food will still be there after the half-eaten portion has been removed. Option B (Dhèwèqué nyimpen resep-resepé) means ""to mix up a recipe,"" which does not align with the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku sijine es ing) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sijine es"" means ""to apply or use something,"" so it suggests that the speaker is applying or using something, such as a cream or lotion. Option B (Aku nggosok lotion ing iku) means ""I am rubbing lotion on my skin,"" which is also possible but does not fit with the context of the premise as well as option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aku ngomong karo kolega ing mejaku) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the speaker will tell a colleague about their mistake in a straightforward manner. The phrase ""ngomong"" means ""to tell"" or ""to inform,"" while ""kolega"" refers to a colleague. Option B (Aku krungu omongané ing lorong) does not convey the same meaning and could potentially be interpreted as the speaker telling someone about their mistake in a roundabout way. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Aku kudu antri,"" option A (aku lungguh) is more likely to occur because it means ""I will wait"" in Indonesian, which aligns with the idea of waiting for something to happen. Option B (aku maca majalah) means ""I will read a magazine"" in Indonesian, which does not fit the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong lanang iku nyawang laler,"" option A (Lalat kuwi mlayu) is the most likely effect to occur. The word ""mlayu"" in this context means ""to be wet or damp,"" so it suggests that the person's body will become wet or damp due to the presence of the insect. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué lagi mati) is the most likely cause for the writer to have written a will. This is because in Indonesian culture, it is common for people to make preparations for their funeral rites after death, including burial or cremation arrangements. Writing a will can be seen as an extension of this cultural practice, as it allows individuals to specify how they want their assets to be distributed after their passing. Therefore, option A is the best answer based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dhèwèqué metu saka lomba) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""metu saka lomba"" means ""to make a mess,"" so it suggests that the situation will become more chaotic or disorganized as a result of the conflict. Option B (Dhèwèqué cepet-cepat mlaku) means ""to speed up slowly,"" which doesn't quite fit with the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Aku nduwé solusi) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the idea of finding a solution to the problem mentioned in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wong sing mlaku mlaku ing jembatan gantung sing goyang,"" option A (Dhèwèqué wedi banget) is more likely to occur because it means ""The bridge swings back and forth."" This implies that there is movement or oscillation in the bridge, which could be caused by wind or other external factors. Option B (Dhèwèqué seneng banget) means ""The bridge is swinging smoothly,"" which suggests a more stable and controlled motion rather than an oscillatory one. Therefore, option A is more likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dhèwèqué nggawe taruhan karo kanca-kancané) is more likely to occur. The use of ""nggawe"" instead of ""nggawé"" in this context suggests that the speaker is more confident about their prediction, and the phrase ""taruhan karo kanca-kancané"" implies a strong desire to win money from others. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will take risks and gamble with their money rather than simply meeting up with friends to watch the match."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bocah kuwi ore bisa turu,"" option A (Dhèwèqué nyetel jam wekeré) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb that means ""to be able to"" or ""can,"" which aligns with the idea of being able to turn something around. Option B (Dhèwèqué ngétung wedus) does not use this type of verb and instead suggests a more abrupt change in direction, making option A the more likely choice based on the given premise."
