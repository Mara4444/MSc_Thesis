Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It's easy to break) is the more likely cause. The fact that the items are packed in a plastic bag suggests that they may be fragile or easily damaged, making it easier for them to break if handled roughly or dropped.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tôi lấy một cuống vé) is more likely to occur than option B (Tôi tìm thấy một vũ khí). This is because the premise mentions that the protagonist has a ""lucky bag"" and does not mention anything about finding a weapon. Therefore, it is more plausible that the protagonist will use their luck or resourcefulness to obtain a ticket rather than resorting to violence or weapons."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mối đầy nhà,"" option A, ""Mối biến mất khỏi nhà"" is more likely to occur. This is because the word ""đầy"" in Vietnamese means ""full"" or ""complete,"" indicating that something is present in abundance or completely within a particular space. The phrase ""biến mất khỏi nhà"" means ""to disappear from home,"" suggesting that the thing being referred to has left or disappeared from its original location. Therefore, it is more likely that the thing will leave the house rather than be inside it."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Các nhân viên tuần tra kiểm tra hộ chiếu của họ) is more likely to occur. This is because the premise mentions that the guests have arrived at the border, indicating that they are entering a country or region where immigration control measures are in place. As such, it is more likely that the authorities would check their travel documents, such as passports or ID cards, rather than accusing them of smuggling goods without proper documentation.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the office is closed for lunch break (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Cô chơi cờ đam) is the correct answer. The phrase ""cô gái hết năng lượng"" suggests that the girl has lost her energy or vitality, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as lack of sleep, stress, or overexertion. Playing cards may not necessarily deplete one's energy, unlike activities like dancing, which can require a lot of physical effort and potentially lead to exhaustion. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Cô bước ra khỏi hàng) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the woman lost her place in line, indicating that she was previously standing in a queue or line. Therefore, it is more likely that she stepped out of the line rather than many people joining behind her.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the baby peed on the girl's face) occurred. The premise mentions that the girl has a wet face, indicating that she was exposed to liquid substance, which could be urine if the baby peed on her face.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Khán giả vỗ tay theo điệu nhạc) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""vỗ tay"" in Vietnamese implies a physical reaction such as clapping or dancing along with the music, which suggests that the audience is actively engaging with the performance. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Cô gái bị giữ lại sau giờ học) will occur. The premise states that the girl wants to thank her teacher, but since she has been detained after class, she won't be able to do so right away. This implies that she may not have the opportunity to give the teacher a gift immediately after class ends. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cố vấn trại của họ kể cho họ một câu chuyện ma) is more likely to be the cause of their fear. The mention of a ""cố vấn trại"" suggests that there may be an authority figure or mentor present who is telling them a scary story, rather than simply roasting marshmallows over a campfire."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Anh ấy bị chấn động) is more likely. The phrase ""đập đầu"" suggests a strong emotion or reaction, and the fact that he is unable to move implies that he has been struck by something or someone. This could cause him to be dazed or stunned, leading to the described effects of being chilled and trembling. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tài khoản ngân hàng của tôi trống rỗng) is the more likely cause. The fact that the speaker's bank account is empty suggests that they may have overspent or encountered financial difficulties, rather than receiving a pay raise.
"Response:  Option A (He deleted the spam emails)
Explanation: Based on the premise that his inbox was full of junk emails, it is more likely that he would delete them rather than sending a mass email to everyone. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Anh đã tiếp xúc với dịch bệnh) is the correct answer. The premise states that the protagonist has been isolated, indicating that they have come into contact with the virus. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: Cô quên viết nó xuống. The fact that she cannot remember her own phone number suggests that she may have forgotten to write it down or lost it somewhere, rather than being able to recall it from memory.
"Response:  Option A: Nước làm dịu cơn khát của tôi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, water is being poured into a cup. This means that the amount of water in the cup will increase, making it more likely for the person drinking from the cup to feel refreshed or hydrated (option A). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He wants to support you) is more likely. The man remains silent because he wants to help or support the speaker, rather than thinking about what has been said.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tai nạn là lỗi của tôi,"" option A is more likely. This is because ""lỗi"" in Vietnamese can mean both ""fault"" or "" mistake."" Therefore, option A is a better fit for the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the dây xích bị quấn quanh một lốp xe) is the correct answer. The fact that the dây xích has been cut suggests that there may have been some kind of impact or force applied to it, which could potentially be caused by a foreign object such as a rock or other debris caught around the tire. This is more plausible than option B (a broken link within the chain), as there would not necessarily be any external evidence of a break in the chain itself if this were the case.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They become tired of arguing) is more likely. The passage states that the couple has been arguing for a long time, indicating that they have been exhausted by their disagreements. This suggests that they are unlikely to continue discussing the issue in depth.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She has hired a campaign manager) is more likely. This is because the premise mentions that she wants to run for office, which suggests that she has already taken steps to prepare herself for the election process. Hiring a campaign manager would be an important part of this preparation, as they would help her develop and implement a strategy for winning the election. In contrast, option B (She is making a case before the court) does not fit with the premise, as it implies that she is in legal trouble rather than actively seeking political office.
Response:  Option A (Anh xếp quần áo ấm vào vali) is more likely to happen based on the given premise. The man is predicted to be cold during his trip, so he would pack warm clothes in his suitcase instead of bringing a large one for his travels.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cậu ấy giơ tay) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the context of the situation. The student is expected to raise their hand when asked a question, rather than simply making a noise or doing something irrelevant. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (bụi bay vào mắt ông ấy) is more likely to be the cause of the man's blindness. The premise states that ""Người đàn ông ngấn lệ,"" indicating that he has become blind due to some unspecified reason. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this by stating that ""bụi bay vào mắt ông ấy,"" or dust got into his eyes and caused him to lose his vision. In contrast, option B does not provide any logical explanation for why the man became blind. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (opponent accuses player of cheating) is more likely to happen. The reason being that when a person wins five consecutive games, it raises suspicions among their opponents, leading them to make accusations of cheating. This is a common occurrence in competitive environments where people are often quick to suspect foul play when someone performs exceptionally well without any obvious explanation.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the teacher caught him cheating) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""giáo viên xé bài kiểm tra"" which means the teacher was checking the student's work, suggesting that the teacher had reason to suspect cheating. Additionally, the phrase ""bắt được học sinh gian lận"" implies that the teacher found evidence of cheating, further supporting option A."
"Response:  Option A - Tôi mất giọng (I lost my voice).
Explanation: The premise ""Tôi dừng lại để dừng nói chuyện"" implies that the speaker has stopped talking for some reason. option A, ""Tôi mất giọng"", is a plausible cause for why the speaker has stopped talking, as losing one's voice can make it difficult or impossible to speak. On the other hand, option B, ""Tôi hết hơi"", does not provide a clear explanation for why the speaker has stopped talking."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I put it in a microwave) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the food has been frozen, indicating that it was previously heated or cooked. Placing the food in a microwave would not only melt the ice but also heat up the food further, making it an unlikely choice for Option B (I wrapped it in plastic wrap).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Anh ta bị đau bụng) is the correct answer. The phrase ""giả ốm"" typically refers to a stomachache or digestive issues in Vietnamese, so this is the most plausible explanation for why an employee might be absent from work without a valid reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cô gái rớt xuống bể bơi,"" it is more likely that she jumped off the diving board (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the film received negative reviews) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mọi người cô lập anh) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""cô lập"" means ""to isolate or exclude someone,"" so it suggests that people will distance themselves from the man who has lost weight. This could be due to various reasons such as social pressure, embarrassment, or fear of being associated with him. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô gõ một lá thư) is more likely to be the cause of her hand swelling up. This is because typing can involve repetitive movements that can lead to inflammation or strain in the hands, wrists, and arms. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl's hand swelled up due to overuse or strain from typing rather than climbing a rope.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Acrobat vung lên từ một cái bẫy) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tung hứng"" in Vietnamese implies a sudden and unexpected movement, which aligns with the idea of an acrobat being lifted up from a trap. Option A (Khán giả reo hò trong sự ngạc nhiên) does not convey the same sense of surprise or danger as the premise suggests."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi mất kiên nhẫn,"" option A is more likely. The word ""mất"" in this context implies a loss of patience or temper, so it's more likely that the speaker has lost their cool and needs someone to calm them down rather than waiting for them."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They have developed nuclear weapons) is more likely. The fact that the countries are at war suggests that they have not yet reached a peace agreement, and the development of nuclear weapons would be a significant escalation in their military capabilities.
"Response:  Option A: Ông trở nên buồn ngủ. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the man took a sleeping pill. This means that he will probably become drowsy or fall asleep, rather than experiencing a fever. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Chân ghế sofa bị lỏng ra) is more likely to occur. The woman's weight may cause the seat cushion to sag or become soft, resulting in a sinking feeling. Option B (Cô bầm tím đầu gối) does not align with the given premise as it refers to a different body part entirely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cậu bé blop bóng bay,"" option A, ""Bong bóng nổ"" (The ball explodes) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the wordplay in the premise. The phrase ""blop bóng bay"" can be interpreted as a playful way of saying that the boy's kicking ability is so powerful that he can make the ball fly like a balloon. Therefore, the most logical outcome would be for the ball to burst or explode due to its excessive movement caused by the boy's kicks."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They took out their valuables) is more likely. The fact that they have already checked in to a hotel suggests that they are not in a rush or under time pressure, so it's unlikely that they would be in such a hurry as to leave their valuables behind without checking them first.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi cắn vào quả đào,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Quả đào bầm dập"" will occur. This is because when a tooth bites into an apple, the apple will crunch or burst open due to the pressure applied by the tooth. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Tôi thích ăn ngọt. 
Explanation: The premise states that Tay has become sweet-toothed, indicating a preference for sugary foods. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cánh cửa mở ra) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Tôi đẩy cửa"" implies that someone or something is pushing open a door, which suggests that the door was previously closed but is now being opened. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Các sản phẩm đã được kiểm tra để đảm bảo chất lượng) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""các nhà hoạt động tẩy chay"" which suggests a deliberate effort to remove or eliminate something, in this case, impurities from products. This implies that the products have been tested for quality assurance, rather than being produced through child labor as suggested in option B."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that a mouse will come out of the hole than for dust to blow out of it. Therefore, option A (a mouse comes out of the hole) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Chị cô hạnh phúc) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the phrase ""ghen tị với chị gái"" implies a sense of jealousy or rivalry towards one's sister, which could lead to feelings of insecurity or unhappiness. However, it does not necessarily imply that the relationship between the two sisters has ended or been dissolved, as suggested by option B (Chị gái cô đã ly hôn). Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi làm đổ rượu lên áo,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Tôi đeo tạp dề"" (I put alcohol on my shirt) will occur. This is because the phrase ""làm đổ rượu lên áo"" implies that something has been poured or applied to the shirt, rather than simply changing clothes. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vị khách kiếm trong ví của mình) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""thu ngân"" in Vietnamese means ""to take money,"" so it's possible that the customer took the money from their own wallet rather than giving it to the employee. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the employee was able to open the computer without any issues."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Anh tiễn đám đông đi) is more likely. The phrase ""thu hút mội người"" suggests that a large crowd has gathered around him, indicating that he is the center of attention. Therefore, it is more likely that he will be asked to perform or entertain the crowd rather than being given money by them."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cậu bé khóc với người trông trẻ,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the boy is crying suggests that he is experiencing strong emotions, such as sadness or grief, which are often associated with missing a loved one like a parent. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the boy is crying in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The premise states that radar has detected a storm, indicating that there is a strong wind system in place. Option B indicates that the pilot flew through the storm, which is more consistent with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cây rụng lá,"" option A, ""Lá chuyen màu"" (The leaves change color) is the most likely effect. This is because the word ""rụng"" in Vietnamese means ""to fall off"", so it's unlikely that the leaves would be moving or piling up on the ground."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cậu quyết định chơi một ván bài với chị gái) is more likely to happen. This is because the brother is described as being ""tinh nghịch"", which suggests that he has a mischievous personality, and it's more likely for him to engage in playful and light-hearted activities with his sister rather than trying to impress her."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (bố nó cho nó uống soda) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the child's desire for a treat. The child wants something fun and enjoyable, whereas option B (bố nó dừng xe ở trạm xăng) may not be as appealing or exciting for the child.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Con cá nhảy ra khỏi bể) is more likely to occur. The child throwing food into the pond will attract fish, causing them to jump out of the water to reach the food.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she will change her political affiliation (Option A). The premise states that ""her perspective has shifted,"" indicating a change in her beliefs or values. Joining a protest or demonstration may be a way to express her views, but changing her political affiliation would be a more significant and lasting change."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tôi đổ nước xả vào đó) is more likely to happen because it suggests that water will be drained from the bathtub into another location, rather than being blocked inside the bathtub. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tàu nổ còi) is more likely to occur than Option A (Tàu đến ga). This is because the premise mentions that the passengers have already disembarked, indicating that the ship has reached its destination and the passengers are no longer on board. Therefore, it is less likely for the ship to continue moving towards a new destination.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he pasted a label onto the umbrella) is more likely. The premise mentions that he ""pasted a label"" on the umbrella, indicating that he took an action to attach something to it. Option B (he folded the umbrella) does not align with this action. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They really miss each other) is more likely. The fact that they have been friends for a long time and are used to being close to each other suggests that they value their friendship highly and would be eager to reconnect if they lost touch. It's also possible that they may have had conflicts or disagreements in the past that led to them drifting apart, but ultimately, they still care about each other deeply. In contrast, Option B (They moved to different cities) could also be a reason why they lost touch, but it doesn't necessarily convey the same level of emotional attachment as Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - Cô bị sa thải khỏi vị trí của mình. The reason for this is that mismanaging a company's finances can lead to serious consequences such as bankruptcy or financial difficulties, which could result in termination of employment. It is less likely that she would be granted maternity leave if her actions led to financial problems for the company.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi nhìn đồng hồ,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Tôi nghe tiếng tích tắc"" means ""I hear a ticking sound."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tay tôi bị chuột rút,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""chuột rút"" means ""sucked in"" or ""drawn in,"" suggesting that something has been pulled towards the writer's hand. In this context, it is unlikely that the writer's spouse would be holding their hand, as there is no indication of a physical connection between them. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tôi vặn mỏ lết) is a more plausible cause for why tôi can't sleep than option A (Tôi thay chốt). This is because the phrase ""mỏ lết"" means ""cannot sleep"" in Vietnamese, while ""thay chốt"" simply means ""to change."" Therefore, option B better fits the context of the sentence and is a more logical explanation for why tôi cannot sleep."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Hai vợ chồng chuyển vào căn hộ) is more likely to happen.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô muốn ngắm hoàng hôn) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ngồi ngoài hiên"" suggests that she is sitting outside her house, enjoying the view of the sunset or the sky. This implies a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, which aligns with the idea of wanting to watch the sunset. Option B (""Cô nghĩ mình đã thấy sét"") does not fit as well with this context, as it implies that she thinks she has seen something else entirely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Người đàn ông mặc áo phao,"" it is more likely that option A (Anh ấy không biết bơi) is the correct answer. The phrase ""mặc áo phao"" typically refers to a man wearing a life jacket, indicating that he is in or near water. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would be a lack of water (option B)."
"Response:  Option B: Cô nhấn phím xóa lùi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman accidentally deleted a file while processing a document. Pressing the ""Backspace"" button would move the cursor back one character position, potentially deleting characters or words in the process. Therefore, option B is more likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Cô bị điểm kém) is the correct answer. The phrase ""khoe khoang"" in Vietnamese means to be embarrassed or ashamed, so it is unlikely that she won a contest if she is feeling embarrassed about something."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bãi cỏ lầy lội,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer because it rains at night in Vietnamese culture, which can make the grass wet and muddy."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Cô ở lại đêm trong một khách sạn) is more likely to be the cause of why she forgot her phone at home. It is unlikely that she would forget her phone if she was only sleeping in a hotel room for the night. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh ngồi trong bóng râm) is a more likely cause for why the man applied sunscreen than option B (Anh ấy đã đi đến bãi biển). The premise states that the man is applying sunscreen to protect himself from the sun's rays, implying that he is indoors or in a shaded area where direct sunlight does not reach. In contrast, going to the beach would expose him directly to the sun's rays, making option B less likely as a cause for his action. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Các nhà nghiên cứu rút lại lý thuyết) is more likely. The passage states that ""các nhà nghiên cứu đã chứng được minh lý thuyết,"" indicating that they have provided evidence to support their theory. This suggests that the researchers may not be convinced of their own theory and may withdraw it as a result. Option B (Mọi người chấp nhận lý thuyết) is less likely because there is no indication in the passage that everyone accepts the theory."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the players' mistakes) caused the goal to be disallowed. The premise states that ""Những người hâm mộ la ó,"" indicating that the fans were making noise, which suggests that they were excited or enthusiastic about the game. This could have led to mistakes by the players, such as misjudging a ball or losing control of it, which resulted in the goal being disallowed. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi đóng khóa) is more likely to occur because when you insert a key into a locked door, it means that the door is already closed or blocked by something, so there's no need for the door to be unlocked first. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Người cha đưa cho con trai một ít tiền) is more likely to happen. The reason is that in many cultures, parents are expected to provide financial support for their children, especially during times of hardship or struggle. This can include giving them money or other forms of assistance. On the other hand, Option B (Người cha nắm lấy tay con trai mình) does not necessarily imply any specific action related to financial support.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tôi xúc tuyết ra khỏi đường) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker will move or remove the ice block from the road, rather than becoming a part of it.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Chiếc thuyền kayak gặp một con sóng) is more likely. The premise mentions ""thuyền kayak"" and ""chèo mái chèo,"" indicating that the scene takes place on water. Additionally, the mention of a wave suggests that there may be rough seas or strong winds, which could cause difficulty for the kayakers. Therefore, it is more likely that the kayakers will encounter a wave than reach the shore."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (she crashes into a barrier) is more likely to happen. The reason for this is that the premise states that she lost control of her bike, implying that she was not able to steer it properly. As a result, there is a higher chance that she will crash into something rather than simply letting go of the handlebars.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nước rắc lên da tôi) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""Tôi bật quạt,"" indicating that the person is sweating. Sweat can cause water to evaporate from the skin, leading to a cooling sensation. Option B (Không khí mát mẻ lướt qua tôi) suggests that a gentle breeze is blowing over the person, but it does not directly address the issue of sweating or the resulting cooling sensation. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Những người lướt sóng trở lại bãi biển,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""ướt đẫm"" means ""soaked wet."" Therefore, it is more likely that the people are soaked wet after returning to the beach."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nước rút ra khỏi bồn) is more likely to occur. The word ""rút"" in Vietnamese means ""to pull out"", so it suggests that water will be pulled out of the bathtub rather than vaporized and sent flying onto the floor or walls. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will happen - ""Anh buộc tội cô ngoại tình."" The husband may feel guilty about lying to his wife and may accuse her of being unfaithful as a way to cope with his own guilt and shame. This would create conflict in their relationship and lead to further misunderstandings and hurt feelings."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Tôi đợi mực khô) is the most likely cause of the problem. The fact that the ink has dried suggests that it may have been left out for an extended period of time, leading to a decrease in its liquidity and making it difficult to remove from the poster.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nó gặp ác mộng) is the correct answer. The phrase ""đứa trẻ tỉnh dậy"" means ""the child woke up,"" and ""la hét"" means ""scream."" Therefore, it makes sense that if a child woke up in the middle of the night, they might be scared or frightened, leading to them screaming. This is supported by the fact that many children are known to have nightmares or bad dreams during their sleep, which can cause them to wake up and cry or scream. In contrast, Option B (""Nó làm ướt giường"") does not make much sense in this context, as there is no clear reason why a child would wet their bed unless they had an accident while they were awake."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Bố cậu ngồi xuống bàn) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of a child sitting at a desk in school.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bạn tôi quay đầu về phía tôi,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""quay đầu"" means to turn one's head towards someone or something, so it suggests that the person is facing or looking at the speaker. Therefore, option A is a more appropriate response as it implies that the person is turning their head in surprise or interest towards the speaker."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Các công dân đã tổ chức một cuộc nổi dậy) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the government has been oppressing its citizens, indicating a level of unrest and dissatisfaction among the population. This would be more likely to lead to a violent uprising than simply voting for change.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cậu dựng lều) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the situation described in the premise. The boy is lost in the forest, so he would need to find a way to shelter himself from the elements and potentially dangerous animals. Building a lean-to structure using fallen branches or other materials is a practical solution for this purpose. Option B (Cậu hét lên cầu cứu) does not make as much sense in this context, as there may be no one around to hear him even if he shouts for help.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô muốn học vẽ) is more likely. The premise mentions that the woman wants to learn a new skill, which aligns with Option A. Option B (Cô muốn tìm hiểu về các nền văn hóa khác) does not necessarily imply that she wants to learn a new skill but rather explore other cultures, which could be a separate motivation altogether.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Anh's colleague has been promoted) is more likely to be the cause of his jealousy.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Anh ta bị ảo giác) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Người đàn ông thấy người ngoài hành tinh,"" which implies that the man saw an alien. However, the second option (""Anh ta đang ngồi thiền"") does not align with this premise as it suggests that the man is meditating, rather than seeing an alien. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (he stopped using the hair dye) caused his hair to turn yellow. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cô phê bình công việc trước đây của mình) is more likely. The fact that the artist has created something new suggests that they are reflecting on their past work and evaluating it critically, rather than simply feeling a sudden surge of emotion.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh ấy được xuất ngũ) is more likely to be the cause of the son moving out of his parents' house. This is because in Vietnamese culture, it is common for children to leave their parental home after completing their education or when they get married. Therefore, option A better aligns with the cultural context and social norms of Vietnam.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Các kệ sách phủ bụi) caused the book to fall out of the shelf. This is because dust or dirt accumulated on the shelves can make it difficult for books to stay in place, causing them to fall off accidentally. An earthquake or tremor (Option B), while a possible cause of damage to buildings, is less likely to be responsible for a single book falling off a shelf.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Tôi bật đèn lên) will occur. The reason is that turning on a light switch can easily solve the problem of dim or flickering lights in a house, while installing a new circuit breaker may require more effort and expertise. Therefore, option A is the most plausible solution to the problem.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chúng tôi đi tàu lượn siêu tốc,"" Option A is more likely. The use of the word ""sợ"" (fear) suggests that the experience of traveling at super-high speeds may be intimidating or frightening."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I put baking soda in the bag) is a more plausible explanation for why the bread dough started to rise. This is because baking soda is a common ingredient used in bread making to help the dough rise. It reacts with acidic ingredients in the dough, producing carbon dioxide gas bubbles that make the dough expand. Option B (I heated it in a microwave) does not provide any logical explanation for how the bread dough started to rise.
"Response:  Option B: Dự báo có gió lớn. 
Explanation: The premise states that a tree fell on an electric line, indicating that there was strong wind or gusts of wind that could have caused the tree to fall. Therefore, option B, ""Dự báo có gió lớn,"" is the more likely explanation for why the tree fell on the electric line."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Anh làm khán giả chán) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Diễn giả đã bình luận không chính xác,"" indicating that the speaker did not give an accurate critique of the performance. This suggests that the speaker may have been too harsh or critical in their evaluation, potentially offending or boring the audience. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the audience might be unimpressed with the speaker's critique."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (A drop of sweat forms on my forehead) is more likely to occur than option B (A drop of blood forms on my finger). This is because sweating is a common bodily function that occurs when the body is hot or stressed, while bleeding from a small cut or injury is less common. Therefore, the likelihood of a drop of sweat forming on one's forehead in response to a stressful situation is higher than the likelihood of a drop of blood forming on their finger.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Con cá nổi trên mặt bể,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Nó đói rồi,"" is the correct answer. The phrase ""nổi trên mặt bể"" means ""to float on the surface,"" indicating that the fish is not submerged in water but rather floating above it. This suggests that the fish may have died of hunger or other causes related to being out of water for an extended period. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation than option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh ấy bị cảm) is more likely to be the cause of his hoarse voice. The premise states that ""giọng nói của anh ấy khàn khàn,"" indicating a persistent and severe change in his voice quality, which could be caused by various factors such as overuse, acid reflux, or respiratory issues. However, the mention of him smoking ( Option B ) does not provide enough context to determine if it is the primary cause of his hoarseness. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for his condition."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Thang máy đã đến tầng được chỉ định) is the correct answer. The fact that the elevator has reached its designated floor suggests that it was functioning properly and did not get stuck in between floors.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Cậu nói dối bố mẹ) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""cậu thiếu niên lẻn ra khỏi nhà,"" indicating that the child ran away from home without their parents' knowledge or consent. It is unlikely that the parents would have locked the child in the house if they had not run away. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the child left home."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nước nhà vệ sinh tràn ra) is the cause of the flooded bathroom. This is because the water from the sink and shower would normally drain into the sewer system through a trap, but if the trap is clogged or not functioning properly, the water can back up and overflow into the room, causing a flood. In contrast, Option B (Máy nước nóng bị hỏng) may cause some issues with hot water supply, but it is less likely to result in a flooded bathroom.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Người chủ mặc cho con chó con một cổ áo) is the more likely cause. This is because the premise states that the dog is ""con"" or a puppy, which means it is still young and inexperienced. It is unlikely for an owner to chain their adult dog outside, as this can be harmful to the animal's health and well-being. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the dog is wearing a sweater."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh đứng dưới gốc cây ngổn ngang) is the more likely cause. The image of the man reflected in the water appears to be upside down, suggesting that he is standing underneath a tree with his feet pointing towards the sky. This is consistent with Option A, where the man is standing directly beneath the tree. In contrast, Option B (Anh đứng trên mặt hồ tĩnh lặng) does not provide any clues about the location or orientation of the man's body, making it less likely as the cause for the reflection seen in the water.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tôi gọi lại cho cô ấy) is more likely to happen. The fact that the speaker's girlfriend has not answered their call suggests that she may be busy or unavailable, making it less likely for them to meet up for dinner.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Con chó của họ bỏ nhà ra đi) is more likely to be the cause of their disappearance. The fact that they have been gone for a long time and no one has seen or heard from them suggests that they may have wandered off or got lost, rather than someone stealing something valuable from their home.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the weather is cold) is a more likely cause for feeling short of breath than option B (my stomach feels tight). This is because cold weather can cause constriction of airways, leading to difficulty in breathing. In contrast, a tight stomach may not directly affect one's ability to breathe. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (they want better working conditions) is more likely. The premise states that the employees are forming a union to improve their working conditions, indicating that they are not satisfied with their current work environment. Taking into account the context of many workers seeking better benefits or improved job security, it seems more plausible that the employees would form a union for this reason rather than simply receiving a pay raise.
Response:  Option A (Một mùi thối rữa tràn ngập bếp) is more likely to happen based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Người phụ nữ chật vật bước đi,"" option A (Cô đi giày cao gót) is a more likely cause of her difficulty walking."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nước sôi) is the cause of the water boiling over. This is because as the water heats up, it expands and can reach the top of the pot, causing it to overflow.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Tôi đi dép) will occur because ""all of my clothes"" are in the washing machine, indicating that there are no other items to put in the dryer. Therefore, there is no need for you to go shoes or sandals."
"Response:  Option A - Ông mất sự ủng hộ của cử tri. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the politician's popularity has decreased due to his inability to deliver on his promises. This suggests that he may have lost support from voters who were initially backing him. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will happen, i.e., two wives get pregnant. This is because the society in this scenario is not supportive of same-sex relationships, so it is unlikely that they would be accepted as a couple or have their relationship recognized legally. Therefore, having children through artificial insemination or other means may be seen as a way to circumvent societal norms and create a family despite the lack of recognition for their relationship.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vị triệu phú muốn tòa nhà bị phá hủy) is more likely to be the cause of the situation. The fact that the wealthy man wants to demolish the building suggests that he may have a personal vendetta against it or its occupants, rather than simply wanting to contribute to its construction.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A is more likely to be the correct cause. The fact that the employee saw the girl putting items in her purse suggests that she may have been shoplifting.  
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Những người lính được phái ra chiến đấu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tuần chiến"" suggests a prolonged conflict, and sending soldiers to fight implies that the country is actively engaging in military operations. This is consistent with the idea of a war or conflict between nations. In contrast, Option B (Những người lính được đoàn tụ với gia đình họ) does not necessarily imply a direct connection to the conflict, as it refers to soldiers being reunited with their families."
"Response: 
Option A: Một cuộc bạo loạn đã nổ ra trước tòa án. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that a riot has broken out in front of the court rather than a couple exchanging their wedding vows. The mention of ""tranh cãi"" (controversy) suggests that there is already an issue or conflict present, which could lead to a violent confrontation. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Cô lấy bánh quy ra khỏi bình) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Cô gái ngửi thấy mùi gì đó bốc cháy,"" indicating that she smelled something burning. This suggests that the fire started outside of the oven, rather than inside it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how the fire started."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cơn bão trở nên tồi tệ hơn) is more likely to happen. The sentence ""Mưa đã trót xuống"" means that it has started raining, which could make the storm worse. Option B (""Tôi lao vào trong"") does not fit with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Thang máy ngừng hoạt động) is the correct answer. The fact that the building has been evacuated suggests that there may be a problem with the machinery or equipment inside the building, which could potentially cause an explosion if not addressed promptly. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the fire alarm is sounding.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Người cha mua cho con trai một cốc bia."" This is because the father is trying to help his son by providing him with a drink, rather than punishing or rejecting him. The father's actions suggest that he wants to support his son and be involved in his life, even if the son has a problem with alcohol."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Thư ký đã về nhà) is more likely to be the cause of the lawyer's inability to reach her office. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Bạn anh ngắt lời anh) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the premise states that the man becomes irritable with his friend, indicating a negative emotion towards them. Therefore, it is more likely that he would interrupt or stop talking to them rather than buying them lunch as a gesture of goodwill.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Nhân viên thu ngân quên đưa cho cô gái một biên lai) is more likely to happen. This is because the phrase ""quên đưa"" implies a mistake or oversight on the part of the employee, rather than a deliberate act of stealing. Therefore, it is more likely that the employee accidentally forgot to give the girl the money rather than intentionally withholding it from her."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cô bị liệt trong một tai nạn) is more likely to occur than option B (Cô vào bệnh viện trong cáng). This is because the phrase ""được đưa lên xe lăn"" suggests that the woman was taken to a hospital or medical facility by ambulance, which is more likely to happen in case of an accident or injury rather than just feeling unwell."
"Response:  Option A - Đất nước đang kỷ niệm độc lập. 
Explanation: The fact that people are still flying their national flags outside their homes suggests that they are commemorating their country's independence, which is a recent event. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The losing team's fans are more likely to be inspired by their team than disappointed in them.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tôi cảm thấy xấu hổ) is more likely. The fact that you are feeling embarrassed or ashamed suggests that your situation is not ideal, which aligns with the premise given.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Cậu quên học bài) is more likely to be the cause of cậu's failure in the history exam. The passage states that cậu ""thất bại trong kỳ thi lịch sử,"" indicating that he did not do well on the history test. This suggests that cậu may have forgotten or not studied enough for the exam, rather than being very focused in class."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (A earthquake hits the city) is more likely to be the cause of the building collapsing. Earthquakes are a common natural disaster that can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially in areas prone to seismic activity. On the other hand, while crime rates may fluctuate over time, it is less likely to result in a building collapse. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh cầu xin cô quay trở lại) is more likely to happen. The fact that she has broken up with him suggests that there may be some lingering feelings or unresolved issues between them, making it possible for him to want her back. Option B (Cô giới thiệu anh với bố mẹ) does not necessarily follow from the premise given, as it implies a more dramatic turn of events than what is suggested in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Heads collide) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""Hai đứa đồng loạt thò tay xuống lấy bóng,"" indicating that two people are simultaneously reaching for the ball. As a result, their heads will likely collide with each other rather than the ball moving or rolling away."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (there are different types of trash in the dumpster) is the correct answer. The phrase ""thùng rác"" specifically refers to a dumpster or garbage bin, indicating that there may be multiple types of trash inside. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why someone might find different types of trash in a single dumpster."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It's cheap) is more likely to be the cause of why the boy doesn't have a pencil. The premise suggests that the reason for this is because it's inexpensive, implying that there may not be enough money available to purchase one.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô bị mất biên lai) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""thu ngân từ chối"" suggests that the employee was not paid for their work, which could result in financial difficulties and potentially lead to losing one's job or being unable to pay for basic necessities such as clothing. Therefore, it is more plausible that the employee lost their job due to financial difficulties rather than receiving a defective dress."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Nó để lại một vết sẹo) is more likely. The premise states that the scar is deep, indicating that it has penetrated through multiple layers of skin, leaving a mark or discoloration behind. This is consistent with the definition of a scar, which is an area of damaged skin that heals with a different texture or appearance than the surrounding skin. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Anh đang nhìn chằm chằm xuống đất) is the correct answer. The phrase ""kỳ lạ"" suggests something unusual or supernatural, which aligns with the idea of looking down at the ground in a daze or trance-like state. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the premise than option B (Anh đang nói chuyện với chính mình), which implies a more rational and self-aware conversation."
Response:  Option A (Kiến bò đến vụn bánh) is more likely to happen based on the given premise. The reason is that when a child leaves their toy or belongings in a public place like a living room floor, it's more likely for someone else to find and pick it up than for the child themselves to come back and retrieve it. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Em gái của cô ấy khoanh tay) is the correct answer. The premise states that the woman's daughter is holding a piece of paper, indicating that she may be resistant or unwilling to give it up. Therefore, it is more likely that she will clench her fist rather than start crying.
"Response:  Option A: Môi anh nứt nẻ. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the man has a toothache due to his habit of biting his tongue. This is a common cause of toothaches, especially if you are prone to biting or chewing on your tongue. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (traffic congestion around the theater) is the cause of their lateness. The fact that they are ""running late"" suggests that there is a delay or obstruction in their path to the theater, which could be due to traffic congestion. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“Ông chủ của cô khen ngợi cô”) is more likely to happen. The phrase “khen ngợi” in Vietnamese carries a connotation of praising or admiring someone, which suggests that the boss is pleased with her work. This implies that she has done something good or impressive, which could lead to recognition or reward at work. Option B (“Đồng nghiệp của cô làm thay cho cô”), on the other hand, does not convey the same level of positive evaluation from the boss towards the woman’s work.
"Response:  Option A (He supports their purpose)
Explanation: According to the premise, the man signed his name to the petition of activists. This suggests that he agrees with or supports their purpose, rather than opposing it. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Tim was afraid of the stage) is the correct answer. The premise states that Tim ""came backstage to find his costar panicking,"" implying that something is wrong with Tim's performance or preparation for the show. It does not suggest that he forgot his lines, which would be a more plausible reason for him to go backstage if he were in fact forgetful. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tôi mở bản đồ) is more likely to happen because it does not involve any financial loss or counting of money, unlike option A (Tôi đếm tiền mặt của tôi), which implies a financial loss. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: Nó co rúm lại. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Những quả chín đung đưa dưới nắng,"" which means ""The ripe fruit falls under the sun."" This implies that the fruit will rot or become soft and mushy due to exposure to heat. Therefore, option B, ""Nó co rúm lại,"" which means ""It becomes soft again,"" is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi bật lửa) is more likely to be the cause of the car's problem. This is because ""hỏng"" in Vietnamese can also mean ""to burst into flames,"" suggesting that the car may have caught fire due to an engine failure or other mechanical issue. In contrast, ""động cơ quá nóng"" means ""engine overheats,"" which could indicate a different type of problem altogether. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh đi gặp bác sĩ tâm lý) is more likely to happen. The fact that the man has a headache suggests that he may be experiencing some emotional distress or mental health issues, which can be addressed through therapy with a psychologist. Option B (Anh nằm trên giường vai ngày) does not provide any contextual clues about the man's mental state, and it could simply mean that he is feeling unwell or tired for other reasons.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tôi đã hết củi) is more likely to be the cause of the fire starting in the stove. The premise states that tôi started burning, indicating that a flame or spark was present, but there is no mention of the temperature being cold. Therefore, it is unlikely that the fire started due to the room being cold (option B).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô bị chuột rút ở bên) is more likely to be the cause of the woman stopping running. The premise states that the woman has been running for a long time but suddenly stops, suggesting that she may have experienced an injury or discomfort that caused her to stop abruptly. Option B (Cô có năng lượng trở lại) does not align with this interpretation as it implies that the woman's energy returns without any explanation for why she stopped running in the first place. Therefore, option A is the more plausible cause based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hàng xóm của tôi mời tôi vào) is more likely to happen. The fact that the neighbor invites you into their home suggests a friendly and welcoming attitude, which is consistent with the idea of neighbors being close and supportive in Vietnamese culture. Option B (Hàng xóm của tôi rời khỏi nhà cô ấy), on the other hand, implies a more negative and distant relationship between you and your neighbor, which may not be as common or expected in Vietnamese culture.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Chồng cô hiểu lầm mối quan tâm của cô) is the correct answer. The phrase ""thở dài vì thất vọng"" suggests a deep sadness or disappointment, which could be caused by a misunderstanding in a relationship. Therefore, it is more plausible that the woman's husband does not understand her concerns rather than him proposing to leave her."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B will occur - ""Học sinh ngập ngừng trả lời câu hỏi"". This is because when a student is asked a question, they may become hesitant or unresponsive if they are not confident in their answer or do not understand the question."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Người phụ nữ hết trứng,"" it is more likely that she will go to the hospital (Option A). This is because when a woman experiences symptoms of running out of eggs, such as irregular periods or difficulty getting pregnant, she may seek medical attention from a gynecologist or fertility specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A (Tôi tiết lộ một bí mật cho anh ta) is more likely.  
Explanation: The phrase ""gặp một người bạn cũ"" implies a sense of familiarity or closeness between the two individuals, suggesting that they have a shared history or connection. Given this context, it is more likely that the speaker would reveal a secret to someone they are close with rather than hugging them without any prior explanation."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô bắt được một con cá) is more likely to be the cause of why the woman avoids going near the pond. This is because catching a fish could potentially involve getting wet or coming into contact with water, which may be something that the woman wants to avoid for whatever reason. In contrast, option B (Trông nó thật ô nhiễm) does not provide any specific information about why the woman might want to avoid the pond, and could simply mean that she finds the pond unpleasant or dirty without providing any insight into her motivations.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Chiếc ô của anh bị hỏng) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The premise specifically mentions that ""anh"" has a broken bike, indicating that the issue is with the bike itself rather than something being taken from him. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why ""anh"" cannot attend school."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the user clicks on the mouse) occurred first. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (a traffic accident occurs) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""người lái xe đi đường vòng"" suggests that the driver is traveling in a circular route, which could potentially lead to a collision with another vehicle or obstacle on the road. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause of the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option A - Vải khô.
Explanation: According to the premise, the wet cloth will be exposed to sunlight, causing it to dry out or become khô (dry). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Người phụ nữ đeo kính râm,"" it is more likely that Option A (Ánh sáng mặt trời chói lóa) is the correct answer. The phrase ""đeo kính râm"" suggests that the woman is wearing glasses, which would make her more susceptible to bright sunlight. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why she might be squinting."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh ước đó là mùa hè) is more likely. The man's gaze towards the sky suggests that he is daydreaming or lost in thought, and the mention of ""mùa hè"" implies a warm season with clear skies, which is more common during summer than other times of the year. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the man's behavior."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi cảm thấy kiệt sức,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - Tôi đi ngủ sớm. This is because feeling tired often leads to wanting to rest or sleep."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tóc anh ngày càng dài) is more likely. The premise states that ""the man went to a hair salon,"" implying that he wanted to get his hair cut or styled. It does not suggest that he was trying to grow his hair longer. Therefore, Option B is the better answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Cậu không ưa người bạn mới) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi thèm một ly sữa,"" it is more likely that Option A (Tôi đang ăn bánh quy) is the correct answer. The phrase ""thèm một ly sữa"" suggests a desire for something sweet to drink, which aligns with the idea of eating bread (bánh quy)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Trời bắt đầu mưa,"" it is more likely that Option A will occur - the driver turns on their headlights. This is because the rain suggests a low-visibility environment, making it necessary for the driver to use their headlights to see ahead. In contrast, Option B (the driver slowing down) may not be as effective in improving visibility in heavy rain."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Tôi đậu gần lối vào) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the speaker will park their car near the entrance of the building, which is closer to where they are currently standing than parking on the other side of the street. Therefore, this option is a better fit for the context provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Cô ấy tịt ngòi) is the correct answer. The phrase ""bỏ lỡ thời hạn"" implies that she missed a deadline or time limit, which could lead to her being reprimanded or penalized for not meeting the required schedule. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the situation."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Tôi yêu cầu nói chuyện với quản lí) is the more likely cause. The user has requested to speak with a manager, indicating that they are unhappy with their experience and want to escalate the issue to a higher level of support.
"Response: 
Option A: Chuông cửa reo. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Gió thổi qua cửa sổ,"" there will be a sound produced when the wind blows through the window. This sound can be described as a ""chuông"" or a ""ringing"" noise. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi rút phích cắm đèn) is a more plausible cause for why the lights in my house are flickering than option B (Tôi rất tức giận). This is because flickering lights can often be caused by loose or damaged electrical connections, such as a faulty light switch or a worn-out socket, rather than anger. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh uốn cong cơ bắp trong gương) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that ""Người cử tạ nghiến răng,"" indicating that someone's teeth are being pulled out, which can only happen through dental procedures such as braces or orthodontic treatment. Option B (Anh nâng thanh xà trên đầu) does not make sense in this context, as it refers to lifting a hat off one's head, which has no relation to pulling teeth. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Anh bối rối.
Explanation: According to the premise, the student has tried to memorize information in his head but failed. This suggests that he may feel frustrated or confused (bối rối), rather than simply taking out a computer to help him remember (option A). Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Người cha đã thay tã cho em bé) is the more likely cause of the baby's sleeping soundly. The phrase ""người cha đã thay tã"" means ""the father changed the diaper,"" indicating that the father took care of the baby's basic needs, including changing its diaper, which could help the baby fall asleep peacefully. Option B (Người cha nhẹ nhàng đá đứa bé) does not provide any logical explanation for why the baby would be sleeping soundly."
"Response:  Option B: Cậu bé đã ướt sũng. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl threw a ball of water at the boy, which means that he was likely to get wet. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the images become blurry) is more likely to occur. When a photographer forgets to use an external flash, it can result in underexposed or blurry images, especially if the lighting conditions are not ideal. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome in this scenario.
"Response:  Option A - Tôi cô đơn. 
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker refuses to attend a birthday party invitation, indicating that they are lonely or isolated. This aligns better with option A, as being alone can be a reason for not wanting to attend social events."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi tập thể dục,"" it is more likely that option A is correct - ""I feel energized."" This is because the phrase ""tập thể dục"" typically refers to a form of exercise or physical activity, which would increase one's energy levels rather than causing them to feel anxious or frightened (as suggested by option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nó ngấm nước) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""bóp miếng bọt biển"" suggests that there is a soft, spongy substance in contact with water, which would cause it to absorb or soak up the liquid. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B is more likely. The fact that the resort is located on an island suggests that it may be a remote or isolated location, which could make it difficult for people to find without prior knowledge of its existence. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the group has not been able to find the resort before now.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô sợ kim tiêm) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the young girl has a tattoo, which suggests that she may have gotten it without her parents' consent or approval. This could potentially lead to feelings of fear or anxiety towards her parents, particularly if they are strict or unsupportive of her decision. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A: Tôi trở nên nghi ngờ. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person will become suspicious rather than calling the police. The reason being that the arrival of an unfamiliar car outside their home can be perceived as unusual or even threatening, leading to feelings of unease or paranoia. Therefore, option A is the more plausible response in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that there is evidence related to him. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (he cuts down on sweets) is more likely to lead to weight loss than option B (avoiding caffeine). This is because consuming fewer calories from added sugars can have a greater impact on weight management compared to reducing caffeine intake, which may not necessarily result in significant weight loss.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cô gái bước lên băng,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""bước lên băng"" implies a gradual increase or progression, so it's unlikely that she would suddenly become very tall or rúng (rugged) overnight. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cô thức cả đêm) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman has dark circles under her eyes than option B (Cô đặt con trai lên giường). This is because staying up all night to take care of a sick child would not necessarily result in dark circles under the eyes, as other factors such as fatigue, stress, or lack of sleep could also contribute to this condition. However, if the woman has been crying or experiencing emotional distress due to personal reasons, it is more likely that she will have dark circles under her eyes. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Núi lửa phun trào) is the correct answer. The phrase ""dung nham chảy từ núi lửa"" suggests that there is an eruption or flow of lava from a volcano, which is only possible when a volcano is actively erupting. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cô biết tất cả mọi người trong bữa tiệc) is a more likely cause than option B (Cô muốn rời khỏi bữa tiệc). The premise mentions that ""người phụ nữ đi giày vào,"" indicating that she entered the party, which suggests that she was already present at the event. Therefore, it is more likely that she knows everyone in the party rather than wanting to leave it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she let you go through the toll booth (Option A). The phrase ""cho tôi đi qua trạm thu phí"" implies that she allowed you to pass through the toll booth, rather than detaining or arresting you at the toll booth (as suggested in Option B). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (He has sold his company's stock) is the correct answer. The phrase ""phá sản"" in Vietnamese implies a financial loss or bankruptcy, which aligns with the idea of selling one's company's stock to recover some of the losses. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the CEO might have lost his job."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bác sĩ được nghỉ phép) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the man has gone to see a doctor, which suggests that he may have been feeling unwell or experiencing some medical issue that requires attention from a healthcare professional. It does not provide any indication that he has been diagnosed with a serious illness or condition that would require him to be hospitalized. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the man went to see a doctor.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ngôi nhà bị cháy) is more likely. The phrase ""thoát ra khỏi phòng ngủ"" suggests that something has happened to the house while the person was inside it, causing them to escape through a window. This implies that there may have been an accident or disaster in the house, such as a fire, which would be consistent with Option A. In contrast, Option B (Ngôi nhà trống rỗng) does not provide any specific information about what might have caused the person to leave their bedroom through a window."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cậu tắm lâu) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's wrinkled fingers. This is because prolonged exposure to water can lead to skin dryness and wrinkles, especially in older adults or those with sensitive skin. Option B (Cậu rửa tay bằng xà phòng) may also contribute to wrinkled fingers, but it is less likely to be the primary cause compared to Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi nhổ sữa ra,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Sữa có vị chua"" (The milk has a sour taste) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""nhổ"" in Vietnamese can also mean ""sour."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the speaker's mouth feels sour after drinking milk, which is consistent with the meaning of option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi đã lỡ xe buýt,"" it is more likely that option B is correct, as missing a bus suggests arriving late rather than going to work early."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the car will be damaged (Option B). When a truck collides with a car, the force of impact is typically greater than the force exerted by the car's crumple zone, leading to more severe damage to the car. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that they won (Option A). The sentence ""They organized a contest with benefits for themselves"" implies that they had some sort of advantage or gain from hosting the competition, rather than abandoning it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chai soda rít lên,"" it is more likely that Option A (Tôi lật chai) occurred. The phrase ""rít lên"" suggests a sudden and unexpected movement upward, which aligns with Option A's description of overturning the bottle. In contrast, Option B (Tôi vặn nắp) does not fit as well with the given premise, as it only describes opening or closing the cap without any mention of an upward motion. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cậu bò vào bằng đường cửa sổ) is more likely. This is because a small child may not have the strength or coordination to climb up onto the roof of a house, but they might be able to crawl through an open window or gap in the wall.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Người phụ nữ nhìn qua lỗ khóa ở cửa) is more likely to occur because it implies that the woman is looking through a keyhole at the door, indicating that she is trying to peek inside or spy on something. Option A (Vị khách gõ cửa) does not provide any information about the woman's actions or intentions.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he took it to the laundry) is more likely. The premise mentions that the man dyed his vest, implying that he wanted to clean it before wearing it again. Taking it to the laundry would be the most practical way to do this. Option B (he hung it in his closet) does not necessarily imply that the vest will be cleaned or prepared for wear.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kem đánh răng phun ra khỏi ống) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""bóp ống kem đánh răng"" implies that the girl is squeezing or pressing something into a small opening, which would cause the kem đánh răng (toothpaste) to come out of the opening rather than being nhổ (squeezed) back inside. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Những người theo chủ nghĩa hòa bình đã tổ chức một cuộc biểu tình) is more likely to result in deaths among civilians. This is because a protest or demonstration can potentially turn violent, leading to clashes with security forces and resulting in casualties among both protesters and bystanders. In contrast, a parade or procession is less likely to lead to violence and therefore less likely to result in civilian deaths.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô buộc dây ruy băng) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""giật mạnh dải băng"" suggests that someone or something has pulled or yanked hard on the hair tie, causing it to come loose. This could potentially result in the hair tie getting stuck in the hair, especially if it was not properly secured beforehand. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the hair tie got stuck in the girl's hair."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (he looks younger) is more likely. The premise states that he has undergone plastic surgery, which can often result in a more youthful appearance. Therefore, it is more likely that he will look younger after the procedure than if he were simply an old man.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Một con gà con nổi lên từ quả trứng,"" option A is the correct answer because it suggests that an egg hatched into a chicken, rather than someone or something breaking an egg."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Người tù chết đói,"" option A (He has died) is more likely. The phrase ""người tù chết đói"" means ""a person who dies of hunger,"" so it is likely that the person in question has already passed away due to lack of food or other basic necessities. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Anh ngã khỏi thang) is more likely to occur because it implies that the man has fallen off the ladder, which aligns with the given information. Option A (Anh leo lên thang) does not align with the premise as it suggests that the man is climbing up the ladder instead of falling off it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nó đang ợ,"" it is more likely that Option A (Nó uống một ngụm soda) is correct. The word ""ợ"" in Vietnamese means to drink or consume something, so it makes sense that the child would drink a soda rather than opening one. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tôi rùng mình) is more likely. The phrase ""một làn gió lạnh luồn qua cửa sổ"" suggests a cold wind blowing through a window, which could make someone shiver or feel chilly. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Các bạn cùng lớp tôn trọng cô) is more likely to be the cause of why she received a scholarship. The passage states that ""she was awarded a full scholarship"" and ""her classmates respected her,"" suggesting that it was her academic achievements and personal qualities that earned her the scholarship, rather than just her high score alone. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Cô sống kế nhà cậu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""chọc quê"" in Vietnamese implies a close relationship or living together, so it is more likely that she lives with him rather than having feelings for him."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh gây thương cảm) is more likely to be the reason why the person stole food. The phrase ""người ăn xin"" suggests that the person is hungry and in need of food, and the fact that they stole food implies that they did not have enough money to buy it legally. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person stole food."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi gọi cho bạn tôi để trò chuyện,"" option B is more likely. The speaker feels lonely or isolated, indicating that they are seeking social interaction or connection with someone else."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi bắt tay anh) is more likely to occur than option B (Tôi tát anh ta). This is because ""bắt"" means to grab or seize something, while ""tát"" means to hit someone. In this context, it makes more sense that the man would try to grab the other person rather than hitting them."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Pháo hoa được phóng lên không trung) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tôi cúi xuống"" suggests that something is being lowered or dropped from a height, which aligns with Option A's description of a flower being launched into the air. In contrast, Option B's description of a plastic plate flying up to hit one's head does not fit with the given premise as it implies an object moving in the opposite direction. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cô gái cắn móng tay,"" it is more likely that she is experiencing emotional distress or sadness ( Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Cô lo lắng."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi lật trang lịch,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""lật trang lịch"" means to flip or turn over a calendar page, indicating that a new day has begun. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Option B: Cô xóa câu trả lời của mình. 
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the girl will delete her answer rather than predicting it. The act of deleting an answer suggests a sense of embarrassment or shame, which aligns with the emotional state implied in the prompt."
"Response:  Option B: Đối thủ của anh ta ngã xuống đất. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the player's opponent has fallen down, indicating that they have been defeated. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chúng đã chín) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the mangoes have already ripened and are no longer green. This aligns with the information provided in the premise, which states that the speaker has picked ripe mangoes from the tree. Option B (Tôi tưới nước cho chúng), on the other hand, does not align with this information as it suggests that the speaker is watering the mango trees, rather than picking ripe fruit from them.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Anh gặp bạn gái cũ đi ăn trưa) is more likely to happen. The man wants to take action towards his romantic feelings, and meeting an old girlfriend for lunch is a more concrete and feasible step than buying her a souvenir.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Thời tiết trở nên ấm hơn) is a more plausible cause for why thủy ngân in the thermometer increases. This is because an increase in temperature typically leads to a rise in the boiling point of mercury, causing it to expand upward in the thermometer. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mái of tòa án bị thổi bay) is more likely to occur than option B (Đường cao tốc trở nên băng giá). This is because a tornado is more likely to cause damage to buildings and infrastructure than frost on roads.
"Response:  Option A: Điểm số của anh được cải thiện. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Học sinh được dạy kèm,"" which means that the student has been taught well. Therefore, it is more likely that their score will improve due to their hard work and dedication in studying rather than resorting to cheating during the exam."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi quỳ xuống đất) is a more likely cause than option B (Tôi quấn mình trong chăn). This is because the phrase ""thoải mái"" suggests a feeling of relaxation or comfort, which could be achieved by lying down or resting, rather than wrapping oneself in something tightly. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker feels comfortable."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi đánh bóng đá,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""trở"" (trở nên) in Vietnamese means to become or to turn into something, so it's more likely that the ball will become dull and lose its shine rather than becoming brighter."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cà phê có mùi nồng) is more likely to occur because adding sugar to coffee can enhance its flavor but not change its basic taste profile.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (He cut the paper) is more likely. The phrase ""xáo trộn"" in Vietnamese means to tear or cut something into small pieces, so it's more logical that the man would have cut the paper rather than simply folding or crumpling it."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely to occur. When you hit a nail with a hammer, it is more likely to bend or deform than to sink into the wood. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Người ngư dân kéo con cá vào) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""con cá cắn câu"" suggests that the fish has bitten the hook, indicating that it has been caught. Therefore, option A, where the person pulls the fish in, is a more logical conclusion. Option B, where the person hits the fish again, does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the fish needs to be hit again once it has already been caught."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (She has acne) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""thiếu niên xấu hổ"" (a teenager with a bad complexion), which suggests that the person may have acne or other skin problems. It does not mention anything about tooth loss, which makes Option B less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vẻ mặt tôi sáng lên,"" it is more likely that option A (Tôi nhận được tin tốt) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""Vẻ mặt tôi sáng lên"" suggests a positive change or improvement in one's appearance, which could be caused by receiving good news or having a successful outcome to something. In contrast, option B (Tôi mất kiên nhẫn) does not necessarily imply a positive change in one's appearance."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi lau tay bằng khăn,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Khăn ướt"" (The towel is wet) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""lau"" in Vietnamese means ""to wipe"" or ""to dry"", so if the towel is wet, it would be able to absorb moisture from the face better. Option B, ""Tay tôi ướt"" (My face is wet) does not make sense in this context as the focus is on the towel rather than the face."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the chair slides down under him) is more likely to happen. The man's weight has caused the chair to slide down, resulting in him falling off it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (They lost) is the correct answer. The premise states that the team members are blaming each other for their loss, indicating that they did not perform well or make mistakes during the game. Therefore, it is more likely that they actually lost rather than the coach canceling practice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tôi hối hận về lỗi lầm của mình) is more likely. The use of the word ""lỗi lầm"" (regret) suggests that the speaker has made a mistake or error in the past, which aligns with the idea of feeling remorseful. In contrast, option B (Tôi đã đạt được mục tiêu của mình) implies that the speaker has achieved their goal, which does not necessarily imply regret or remorse."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Anh hỏi cô những câu hỏi về bản thân cô ấy) is more likely to be the cause of her becoming bored with their dates. By asking personal questions about herself, he may come across as intrusive or insensitive, leading to a lack of connection and interest in future dates.  
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Má có đỏ) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""Cô gái nở một nụ cười"" suggests that the girl is happy or smiling, which could be interpreted as a sign of good health or well-being. Therefore, it is more likely that she will have a rosy complexion rather than her money being revealed suddenly."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tàu địch nổ tung,"" it is more likely that Option A (it went through a minefield) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh bước vào một vũng nước) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Người đàn ông đâm thủng chân anh,"" indicating that the man was injured in his leg. Stepping into a puddle of water would not likely cause such an injury, but falling from a height or landing awkwardly after being struck by something could potentially result in a broken leg. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (They have discovered the identity of the murderer) is more likely. The fact that they are looking for fingerprints suggests that they are trying to identify a suspect, rather than finding evidence related to the crime scene itself.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Tôi yêu cầu đi nhờ) is more likely to happen. The reason being that when there is a traffic jam on the highway, it is unlikely for someone to ask another person to drive them through the traffic. Instead, they are more likely to find an alternative route or wait until the traffic clears up.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Many people face unemployment) is more likely to occur than option A (Many people get sick). The reason is that a decline in a country's economy often leads to businesses downsizing or closing, resulting in job losses and unemployment. While it is possible for some individuals to become ill due to various factors such as poor healthcare systems or environmental conditions, the likelihood of widespread illness among a population during an economic downturn is lower compared to the impact of unemployment on people's lives.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A is more likely. The phrase ""suýt chạy vào"" suggests that the children are in danger of being hit by a car, which is a common occurrence in busy urban areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that they were almost run over while crossing the street than that they were rescued from their neighborhood."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cậu ấy nói với tôi sự thật) is more likely. The use of the word ""tròn"" in the premise suggests a sense of sincerity or directness, which aligns better with Option A's interpretation that cậu ấy will tell me the truth. In contrast, Option B's interpretation relies on a more indirect and vague phrase (""một nhận xét mỉa mai""), which could potentially be misleading or ambiguous. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Xe hết xăng,"" it is more likely that Option A will occur - the driver will be stranded on the road due to running out of gasoline."
"Response:  Option A: Đứa bé được sinh ra. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Người phụ nữ đi đẻ,"" it is more likely that a baby will be born rather than the woman becoming sick. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Bên ngoài trời có gió) is a more plausible cause for why the man's hat was blown away than Option A (Anh cởi mũ). This is because the phrase ""bên ngoài trời có gió"" implies that there is strong wind or gust of wind outside, which could easily blow an object like a hat away. In contrast, Option A does not provide any explanation as to how the man's hat was blown away, leaving it unclear whether he simply removed his hat or if another factor was involved. Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, Option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Cô nhận được lời mời) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Mother takes him to the park) is more likely. The premise states that it's too hot for the boy, indicating that he may not be comfortable or able to play outside in such weather. Taking him to a cooler place like a park would provide relief from the heat.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh ấy muốn gây ấn tượng với buổi hẹn hò của mình) is the more likely cause for why the man sprayed water on his hair. The premise suggests that he wants to impress someone during a date, which implies that he is trying to look presentable or attractive. Therefore, it is more likely that he sprayed water on his hair to make himself feel more confident or to enhance his appearance for the date. Option B (Anh bôi gel lên tóc) does not align with this reasoning as there is no indication in the premise that he applied gel to his hair.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Tôi nhặt một cái xẻng) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker has access to a candle or lighter, which can provide light in the dark room. Option A (Tôi tìm đèn pin) does not imply any specific source of light other than a flashlight, which may not be readily available in this situation. Therefore, Option B is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Người mẹ vừa sinh đôi) is more likely to be the cause of the family moving into a larger house. This is because the premise mentions that the family has just had twins, indicating that there are now two additional children in the household who require more space. Option A (Người con trai tốt nghiệp cấp ba) does not provide any information about an increase in the number of children or a need for more space, making it less likely as the cause of the move.
"Response:  Option A: She wants to conserve her energy. 
Explanation: The premise states that she's running at a slow pace, indicating that she may be trying to save energy for some reason. This is more plausible than option B, as there isn't any obvious reason why she would suddenly stop running when she sees the finish line."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Máy phun ra tiền thối) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The premise states that the boy's robot arm has a mind of its own and randomly sprays money everywhere, suggesting that there may be an issue with the machine itself rather than something external like a stuck bag of chips. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Tôi tròn mắt nhìn anh) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""tròn mắt nhìn"" means to stare at someone with a fixed gaze, indicating that the speaker is intensely focused on the person they are looking at. This reaction is more appropriate for a situation where someone has just died, as it shows that the speaker is deeply affected by the loss. Option B (Tôi ôm anh) means to hug someone, which may be a more comforting response in some situations but does not necessarily convey the same level of intensity or shock as Option A."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he wrote an IOU (Option A). This is because an IOU is a written promise to pay back a debt at a later date, whereas paying with cash (Option B) would not be practical or feasible in this scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh cắt móng tay) is more likely to happen than option B (Anh bị dập ngón chân). This is because cutting off one's own finger is a more extreme and unlikely action compared to being hit with a stick, which could potentially occur in real life as a form of punishment or retribution. Therefore, option A is the better answer based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Anh trai của anh ấy đã cãi nhau với bố mẹ) is the more likely cause. The fact that the man feels proud of his brother's success suggests that there may have been a rift or conflict between the two brothers in the past, which could be the reason for their different paths in life.
"Response: 
Option B: Cô nhìn những vì sao. 
Explanation: The premise states that the girl wants to learn about the solar system, which suggests that she will look at the stars rather than go to a library. Therefore, Option B is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Tôi đặt tấm áp phích phía trên cánh cửa) is the more likely cause. This is because placing a poster above a doorway would be a common location for advertising or promotional materials, as it is easily visible to anyone entering or leaving the room. In contrast, attaching a sticker to the back of a poster may not be as effective in reaching its intended audience.
"Response: 
Option B: Kiến trúc sư đã điều chỉnh các kế hoạch. 
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the architect has modified the plans rather than building a new structure from scratch. The phrase ""kiến trúc sư đã điều chỉnh các kế hoạch"" implies that the architect has made adjustments to an existing plan, rather than creating a completely new one. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tay anh run run) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""anh đánh rơi"" means ""he threw away,"" so it implies that something was thrown or lost. Running after something that has been thrown away would not make sense, therefore option A is a better fit for the context."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hội đồng quản trị đã giải thể công ty) is more likely. The reason for this is that if the CEO has resigned, it is unlikely that the board of directors would find a replacement for him immediately. Instead, they may choose to dissolve the company or liquidate its assets.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tôi đến gần bục giảng) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker has moved closer to the teacher's desk, indicating a greater level of engagement with the lesson. Option A (Tôi ngồi ở hàng ghế sau) suggests that the speaker remains seated at the back of the classroom, which may indicate a lower level of participation in the lesson.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Gia đình anh trả tiền bảo lãnh) is more likely. The fact that the man has been released from prison suggests that he has served his sentence and is now free to reintegrate into society. It is unlikely that he would resort to attacking a fellow inmate, as this could lead to further legal troubles and harm his chances of rehabilitation. Therefore, option A is the most plausible cause.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: Ngôi nhà của họ bốc cháy is the correct answer. The phrase ""mất hết đồ đạc"" suggests a sudden and extensive loss of belongings, which could be caused by a fire in their home. This is a more plausible explanation than Option A: Họ đã bán căn nhà, as selling one's house would not result in such an extensive loss of possessions."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi dẫm lên lon nhôm,"" option B is more likely. The word ""dẫm"" in Vietnamese means to step on or press something hard, which suggests that the lon was subjected to a strong force that caused it to break or be crushed. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the context of the premise."
"Response: 
Option B: Cô học được kỹ năng giao tiếp. 
Explanation: The premise states that the girl joined a debate club, indicating that she learned how to communicate effectively through debating. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Tôi nghe nhạc) caused the improvement in my mood. Listening to music has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health and well-being, including reducing stress and anxiety levels.

Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They have organized a charity auction) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Các hành khách cười khúc khích) is more likely. The word ""cười"" in Vietnamese means to laugh or smile, so it's likely that the passengers are enjoying themselves rather than shouting in fear."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tôi kiểm tra hộp thư khi rời khỏi nhà) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Anh dậy sớm) is more likely. The man wants to watch the sunrise, so he needs to wake up early to do so. Option A (Anh đi về phía bắc) does not directly relate to watching the sunrise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi tái chế giấy) is more likely to occur than option B (Giấy nhăn). This is because the word ""tái"" in Vietnamese means ""to recycle,"" indicating that the speaker plans to reuse or repurpose the paper rather than simply discarding it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible interpretation of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Các nhà lãnh đạo của các quốc gia khác đã thành lập một liên minh) is more likely to occur as a result of the disaster. The formation of an alliance among leaders of different countries suggests a coordinated response to the crisis, rather than simply sending aid from one country to another.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Cậu ngã xuống bể) is more likely. The fact that the boy's clothes are wet suggests that he has fallen into the water, rather than simply stepping out of it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sắp đến hạn trả lại cho thư viện) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Anh ta bị kết tội giết người) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""bị xử tử"" suggests that the person has been sentenced to death, which is a common punishment for murder in many legal systems. Therefore, it is more likely that the person was convicted of murder rather than being imprisoned."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi mặt nắng chiếu vào phòng) is a more likely cause than option B (Tôi mở khóa cửa). This is because the sunlight entering the room through the window is a more direct and obvious explanation for why the door might be unlocked than opening it with a key. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tóc giả của cô ta văng ra) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""tôi kéo tóc kẻ mạo danh"" means ""I will pull out your fake hair,"" indicating that the person being addressed has artificial or false hair. Therefore, it is more likely that their real hair will be revealed rather than them getting a headache."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Biên tập viên viết lại một câu trong bản thảo) is a more likely cause for why ông may have changed his mind about the proposal. This is because biên tập viên are responsible for revising and editing written content to improve its clarity, coherence, and overall quality. If an editor were to revise a sentence or paragraph in a proposal, it could potentially change the meaning of the original text and lead to a different interpretation. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô nhận ra thẻ bị mất) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""thẻ tín dụng của mình"" suggests that the woman's credit card has been lost or stolen, rather than simply expiring. Therefore, option A is the better choice."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi tăng âm lượng) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the music is too soft to hear, indicating that it needs to be amplified or increased in volume.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Cô bé xoa xoa đầu cậu bé) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Tóc của cậu bé dựng lên,"" which implies that the boy's hair was standing up or messy. Choosing Option A allows us to infer that the girl gently combs or brushes the boy's hair, straightening it out."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Tôi tự xịt thuốc chống côn trùng) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that using a pesticide to kill the cockroach would be a more logical solution than stepping on it, as it would eliminate the problem in a more humane and efficient manner.
"Response: 
Option A: Tôi tỉnh dậy. 
Explanation: The premise ""Tôi mở mắt"" suggests that something has awoken or opened up, implying a sudden change or realization. Option A, ""Tôi tỉnh dậy,"" better fits this context as it means to wake up or become aware of something, which aligns with the idea of an unexpected revelation or understanding."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tôi yêu cầu anh ta vặn nhỏ lại) is more likely to occur. The speaker wants the other person's music collection to be smaller so that they can have a better chance of finding something they like. This suggests that the speaker is interested in acquiring the other person's music collection, rather than simply borrowing one specific album.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (Anh ấy kiêm được ít hơn mức lương tối thiểu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""sống trong nghèo khổ"" suggests that the family's financial situation is difficult, and they may not be able to afford basic necessities such as food and shelter. Therefore, it is likely that the father has to work multiple jobs or take on odd jobs to make ends meet, resulting in him earning less than the minimum wage."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Anh theo đuổi một sở thích) is more likely. The phrase ""sinh viên tốt nghiệp đại học"" suggests that the person has recently graduated from college, and therefore may be looking to pursue their passion or interest rather than immediately seeking employment."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sơn văng khắp nơi) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""trộn sơn vàng và sơn xanh"" suggests that both colors are being mixed together, resulting in a uniform yellowish-green color throughout the painting. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the conversation became tense) is more likely. The fact that the speaker has changed the subject suggests that they are trying to avoid a difficult or uncomfortable topic, which could lead to a tense atmosphere in the conversation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anh tôi được xuất viện,"" option A is more likely. This is because ""xuất viện"" means to be discharged or released from a hospital, indicating that the person has completed their treatment and is now free to go home. Therefore, option A, ""Tôi đón anh về nhà,"" is the most appropriate response."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""The curtain opens,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the curtain has opened suggests that the play has begun, implying that the actors are now performing on stage. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kẻ bắt cóc đe dọa làm hại con tin) is more likely to be true. The fact that the kidnapper has threatened to harm the hostage if their demands are not met suggests a higher level of aggression and desperation, which could lead to dangerous consequences for the hostage. Option B (Kẻ bắt cóc đã tự thả con tin) is less likely, as there is no indication in the premise that the kidnapper has released the hostage.
"Response:  Option A - Nhạc sĩ gõ chân. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""a sound that echoes throughout the stage,"" it is more likely that a percussion instrument such as a drum was used to create the sound rather than a wind instrument like a flute. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A (The child woke up from a nightmare)
Explanation: The premise states that the parents are in a hurry to get into their child's room, suggesting that something urgent has happened. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation by stating that the child woke up from a nightmare, causing them to be scared or upset. This option is more likely than Option B, as it takes into account the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she was born deaf (Option B). The phrase ""người phụ nữ giao tiếp bằng ngôn ngữ ký hiệu"" suggests that she communicates through sign language, which is commonly used by individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing."
"Response:  Option B: Các vụ mùa bị diệt vong. 
Explanation: The premise states that a drought occurs in a certain area. This can lead to crop failures and famine, making option B (các vụ mùa bị diệt vong) more likely than option A (nước trở nên ô nhiễm)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the cat will chase after the bird (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Trường học đóng cửa vào mùa hè) is more likely to be the cause of the girl's transfer. 
Explanation: The premise states that the school is closed during summer vacation, which suggests that the girl may have transferred schools due to the closure of her previous school. This is a more plausible reason for a transfer than the second option, which does not provide any specific explanation for the transfer."
"Response: 
Option B: Các nhân viên đã đình công. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the employees will go on strike rather than the owner appointing a new manager. The reason for this is that the employees are unhappy with the current working conditions and wages, and going on strike is their way of protesting and demanding better treatment from the company. Therefore, Option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Những kẻ cực đoan ám sát anh ta) is more likely. The phrase ""chống lại những kẻ cực đoan"" suggests that the leader is resisting or fighting against extremists, implying that they are a threat to him. This implies that the extremists have taken violent actions against the leader, such as assassination. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Sóng vỗ dọc bờ biển. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""Tôi đi chân trần trên bãi biển,"" indicating that the person is walking barefoot on the beach. As a result, option B, ""Sóng vỗ dọc bờ biển,"" or the waves washing against the shore, is more likely to occur as it is a natural phenomenon associated with being on a beach. Option A, ""Cát dính vào chân tôi,"" or sand getting stuck in one's feet, may also occur but is less relevant to the context of being on a beach."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Tôi mặc thêm quần bó sát) will occur. The reason for this is that putting on an extra layer of clothing can help to keep a person warm, especially if they are feeling cold in their current attire. Drinking a glass of water may provide some temporary relief from feelings of coldness, but it is unlikely to have a lasting impact on keeping a person warm throughout the night. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Con trai cô nhếch mép) is the correct answer. The phrase ""người mẹ ôm con trai"" implies a close relationship between the mother and son, and the use of the word ""nhếch"" to describe the son's behavior suggests that he may be acting in a way that is not typical or expected for him. Therefore, it is more likely that the son is experiencing some emotional distress or discomfort rather than simply being playful or energetic."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi kéo khóa quần jean lên) is a more plausible cause for the hole in the jeans than option B (Tôi vấp trên vỉa hè). This is because pulling on the waistband of the jeans with force is more likely to result in a hole than stepping on something sharp that could puncture the fabric. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cậu có một lỗ sâu răng) is more likely. The premise states that ""cậu bé đeo niềng,"" indicating that the child has dentures or false teeth. This implies that there may be a gap or hole in the child's mouth where their natural teeth are missing, rather than their teeth becoming straight. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The sentence ""Hôm nay tôi thức dậy với một cơn đau họng"" suggests that the speaker woke up with a sore throat, which could be caused by overexertion or straining during exercise at the gym. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Các sinh viên khác ở bàn ăn trưa cảm thấy bị bỏ rơi. 
Explanation: The phrase ""thầm qua lại"" in the premise suggests that the girls are whispering to each other, indicating a sense of secrecy or exclusivity. This creates an atmosphere where others may feel left out or excluded from their conversation. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as the other students at the table may feel uncomfortable or neglected due to the girls' private chat."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Nó quyết định thử làm một cú lật) is more likely to occur. The child's decision to try a flip suggests that they are willing to take risks and explore their surroundings, which aligns with the idea of a curious and adventurous spirit.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Bưu điện xúc tiến bức thư) is more likely to happen because it implies that the letter will be delivered faster than usual.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Anh về nhà rỗng túi) is more likely to happen. The premise states that con bạc rất tự tin, indicating a high level of confidence in their gambling abilities. This suggests that they are unlikely to lose all their money at once, but rather will gradually lose it over time due to their consistent gambling habits. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Những cơn gió trở nên mạnh hơn) is the more likely cause for the fire spreading rapidly through the forest. The wind becomes stronger, causing the flames to spread faster and farther, leading to a larger area of damage. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mother kicks him out of the room) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the theme of discipline and consequences for misbehavior in traditional Asian cultures.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tôi cắn phải lưỡi) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person's tongue comes into contact with something hot, causing burns or irritation. Option B (Tôi bị bỏng lưỡi) does not provide enough information to determine whether the person will experience a burn or just discomfort.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Nhà văn tránh có sự thiên vị trong những câu chuyện của cô) is the more likely cause for why the editor is hesitant to accept the writer's work. The premise suggests that the editor has a personal bias against the writer's style or tone, rather than simply missing an important deadline. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi cảm thấy kiệt sức,"" option A is the more likely cause. The phrase ""kiệt sức"" means ""exhausted"" or ""fatigued,"" indicating that the speaker has been feeling tired for an extended period of time. Option B, ""Tôi đã ngủ cả ngày,"" means ""I have slept all day,"" which would not explain why the speaker feels exhausted. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She has diagnosed the patient's symptoms) is more likely. The passage states that ""the doctor has diagnosed the patient's symptoms,"" indicating that she has identified the specific conditions or illnesses causing the patient's discomfort. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Nó ướt mồ hôi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Tôi gãi da,"" which means ""I am angry,"" the cause of the anger is most likely due to something that makes one's face sweat. Option A, ""Nó ướt mồ hôi,"" which means ""It's hot outside,"" is a plausible reason for someone to be angry, as being in a hot environment can make people feel irritable or frustrated. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Anh mất bình tĩnh) is more likely to be the cause of the man's condition. The premise states that the man has undergone an emergency surgery, which could have caused him to become unconscious or lose his balance. Option B (Anh bị đau tim) does not align with the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Anh khoanh tay) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that when a person's arm swells up, it can become difficult or impossible to move their hand freely. Therefore, if the man in the scenario cannot move his hand due to the swelling, it is more likely that he has actually raised his hand rather than trying to wipe away something from his face.
"Response:  Option A: Anh ấy ngạc nhiên. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Người đàn ông nhướng mày,"" which means ""The man was surprised."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tôi tin rằng anh ấy có ý tốt) is a more likely cause for why the colleague's apology was insincere than option B (Tôi nghĩ anh ấy đã có thể suy nghĩ tốt hơn). This is because the premise suggests that the speaker believes their colleague has good intentions, rather than simply thinking they could have thought better. Therefore, it is more likely that the colleague genuinely apologized but did not express themselves well enough, rather than simply pretending to be sorry out of habit or convenience.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Anh bắt đầu tập thể dục nhiều hơn) is more likely to lead to him quitting smoking. Explanation: The premise states that the man has been smoking for years but wants to quit. Taking up exercise can help reduce stress and provide a healthier alternative to smoking. By increasing physical activity, he may be able to manage his cravings better and eventually quit smoking altogether. Option B (Anh bắt đầu thức dậy sớm hơn) does not directly address the issue of smoking and may not have as much impact on his desire to smoke.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cơ thể của kẻ tấn công trở nên vô hồn) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""trở nên vô hồn"" suggests a state of being that is not bound by the laws of physics or reality, implying a supernatural or otherworldly outcome. Option B (Kẻ tấn công bắt đầu chảy máu) does not convey such an unusual outcome and seems more plausible in a real-life self-defense situation."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tầm ngắm của người đàn ông không chính xác) is a more likely cause for why the man missed his target. The premise states that the man has been practicing shooting for years but still misses his target, suggesting that he may not have accurate aim. This could be due to various reasons such as poor technique, lack of focus or concentration, or even an incorrect understanding of the mechanics of shooting. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation than option B (Người đàn ông đã thua cuộc), which implies that the man simply lost the competition without any specific reason.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Anh phát hiện ra chuột trong tầng hầm) is more likely. The fact that the homeowner asks for a ghost to be sent to his house suggests that he believes in the supernatural and may have experienced paranormal activity himself. Therefore, it is more plausible that the ghost would manifest itself as a mouse or other small creature rather than a cat, which is not typically associated with hauntings.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tôi đã quá mệt mỏi để chuẩn bị bất cứ điều gì) is a more likely cause for why I suggested going out to eat dinner with my guest. The sentence implies that I am too tired to prepare anything, which could be a valid reason for not wanting to cook or clean up afterward. Option B (Khách của tôi ở quá lâu) does not provide any information about my state of exhaustion and seems unrelated to the context.
"Response:  Option B: Cô ấy có một cuốn nhật ký mới. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the girl will create a new diary rather than hiding her brother's existing one. The reason for this is that creating a new diary allows the girl to have a fresh start and express her own thoughts and feelings without feeling guilty or invading her brother's privacy. On the other hand, hiding his existing diary may not provide the same sense of freedom and creative expression as starting a new one."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Cô làm thêm giờ) will occur. This is because the premise states that she lacks money for rent, which suggests that she may need to work additional hours to earn more income in order to pay her rent. Working extra hours would be a more practical solution than quitting her job altogether, as it would allow her to continue earning a steady income while also addressing her financial needs.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nó chạm vào bếp nóng) is more likely to be the cause of the child's quick recovery. The heat from the stove could have caused a burn injury that was quickly treated and healed. Option B (Nó vỗ đầu con chó con) does not align with the given information as there is no mention of a dog or any interaction with one. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (They have reduced prices for new customers) will be the chosen strategy to increase customer satisfaction. This is because reducing prices can be an effective way to attract and retain customers, especially if other competitors are offering similar products or services at a lower price point. By offering lower prices, the company may be able to gain more business from new customers and potentially increase their overall revenue.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Cậu bé ném đệm ra khỏi đi văng) is a more likely cause than Option B (Cậu bé kéo một chiếc ghế trên sàn nhà). This is because the phrase ""sàn gỗ bị trầy xước"" suggests that the floor is wet or slippery, making it difficult for someone to walk or stand on it without falling. Therefore, option A, which involves throwing something away from oneself, is a more plausible explanation for why the boy might have fallen."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Tôi che mặt lại,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""che mặt"" means to smile or laugh mockingly at someone, so it suggests that the speaker's enemy is making fun of them. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (it was struck by lightning) is more likely to be the cause of the famous statue being destroyed. The premise mentions that the statue was ""nổi tiếng"" or famous, which suggests that it is a well-known landmark or cultural icon. Lightning strikes are a common occurrence in many parts of the world and can potentially damage or destroy structures made of metal or other materials. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the famous statue was destroyed."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (quả rụng hạt) is more likely to occur. The reason is that a fruit falling from a table onto the floor is more likely to result in the fruit hitting the ground than being covered by flies. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Cô nhón chân) is the correct answer. The phrase ""xé dây chằng"" suggests that something has been torn or cut, which could potentially result in a broken leg if the injury is severe enough. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what might happen to a woman who is hit by a car while running away from her abductor."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nó học cách buộc chúng) is the correct answer. The premise states that the baby's toys are scattered around the room, indicating that they have been played with and are no longer in one place. It is unlikely that the baby would be able to run around the room to pick up all of its toys without any help. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how the baby might deal with this situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The protagonist will forget all about time because they were so captivated by the book that they lost track of reality. This aligns with the idea of being ""cuốn hút"" (captivated) by something in Vietnamese culture."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the father's beliefs are influenced by his mother than vice versa. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It ran out of gas) is more likely. The premise states that ""Chiếc xe dần dần dừng lại,"" which implies that the vehicle gradually came to a stop, suggesting that it had run out of fuel rather than the driver falling asleep at the wheel."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man's taste buds will become accustomed to the flavor of the ice cream (Option A). The phrase ""under the sun"" suggests a prolonged exposure to the same stimulus, which can lead to habituation or desensitization. As a result, the man's taste buds may stop responding to the unique flavor of the ice cream after some time, making it seem less sweet."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Tấm thảm trông bẩn thỉu) is the cause of the messy room. The phrase ""trông bẩn thỉu"" suggests a state of disarray or clutter, which aligns with the idea of a messy room. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Tôi bị nhức đầu. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""Tôi về nhà sớm,"" indicating that something unexpected happened to the speaker. Option A provides a plausible reason for this unexpected event - the speaker got a headache - while Option B does not provide any explanation for why the speaker returned home early. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Người chủ mắng con chó) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The speaker has apologized to the listener, which may have caused the listener to become annoyed or upset. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Anh mang ba lô) is correct. The phrase ""nổi bật trong đám đông"" means to stand out or be prominent in a crowd, which suggests that the man is wearing something eye-catching or distinctive. Ba lô (three pieces of clothing) are typically worn by Vietnamese men as part of their traditional attire, so it's possible that the man is wearing this combination of clothes to make himself stand out. Option B (Anh mặc vest neon) does not necessarily convey the same meaning, as a neon vest may not be as noticeable or attention-grabbing as three pieces of clothing."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Anh ta bị buộc tội khai man) is more likely. The fact that he has been caught lying despite having taken an oath suggests that he may have been coerced or pressured into making false statements.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Người phụ nữ nhuộm tóc,"" option B (Cô muốn hòa nhập) is more likely. The phrase ""nhuộm tóc"" means to dye one's hair, indicating that the woman wants to change her appearance. Therefore, option B is a more plausible cause for why she might want to change her hairstyle."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (They have been deported) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the undocumented immigrants are caught and deported, indicating that they will not be able to find employment legally in the country. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Khán giả bật cười) will occur. The speaker's use of humor suggests that they are trying to make the audience laugh, which would result in a positive reaction such as smiling or chuckling.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi nhìn vào mặt trời,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mặt trời làm tôi mờ mắt."" The wording of the premise suggests that looking at the sun can cause blindness or discomfort to one's eyes."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi khịt mũi) is a more likely response than option B (Tôi ngáp). This is because ""khịt mũi"" means to feel sad or depressed, while ""ngáp"" means to be happy or cheerful. Therefore, given the context of feeling down, it is more likely that the speaker would choose the former option."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the reason why miếng bít tết is difficult to cut is because it has not been cooked enough (Option B). This is because if the bit tet was overcooked or burnt, it would be hard and brittle, making it difficult to cut. On the other hand, if the bit tet was undercooked, it may still be soft and pliable but could potentially be too wet and sticky, also making it challenging to cut. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible explanation for why miếng bít tết is difficult to cut.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (she has received financial support) is the correct answer. The passage states that she ""has been receiving financial support from her family,"" indicating that they have been providing her with money to help cover expenses related to her pregnancy termination. This suggests that option A is the more likely explanation for why she was able to afford the procedure."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi tự hỏi có phải anh ấy đã ra ngoài không) is a more likely outcome than option B (Tôi quyết định ghé thăm anh một chuyến). This is because the premise suggests that the person is wondering if their friend has gone out, implying that they are not sure or certain about their whereabouts. It is less likely for them to decide to visit their friend without knowing whether they are still at home or not.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi đặt bông hoa dưới mũi mình,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Những cánh hoa rơi ra hoa."" When you place a flower under your nose, it is likely that the scent of the flower will be released into the air."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Cô gặp một người bạn thời thơ ấu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the woman feels nostalgic for her past, which suggests that she has happy memories from her childhood or youth. Meeting a childhood friend would likely bring up those fond memories and make her feel even more nostalgic. In contrast, Option B (Cô mắng con) does not necessarily evoke feelings of nostalgia and could potentially have a negative impact on the woman's emotional state.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cậu ấy nộp bài sớm) is more likely to happen.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Xe tôi bị hỏng,"" it is more likely that Option B (Tôi gọi thợ sửa máy) will occur because the speaker needs to get their car repaired."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It's hidden) is more likely. The fact that the note was lost suggests that it may have been misplaced or hidden somewhere, rather than being unable to be read due to a lack of understanding. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Con chim vỗ cánh,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""vỗ cánh"" means to spread wings, which suggests that the creature is flying or about to fly. Therefore, it is more likely that the creature will lay eggs rather than fly upwards."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nhà để xe đã mở) is more likely to be the cause of why I can't find my car. This is because if the parking lot is already full, it would be difficult for me to find a place to park my car, making it unlikely that I will be able to find it. Therefore, Option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tên tội phạm đặt súng xuống) is more likely to occur. The reason being that when a person is under attack or threat of harm, their natural instinct is to protect themselves by getting down or taking cover, rather than raising their hands in surrender. Therefore, it is more likely that the victim would try to avoid the bullet by ducking or hiding, rather than raising their hands in a futile attempt to stop the shooter.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Tôi dự định tham dự đám tang của chú tôi) is the correct answer. The phrase ""chú tôi"" suggests a close relationship with the deceased person, indicating that the speaker is attending a funeral rather than a wedding."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi quên cả thời gian,"" option A is more likely. This is because forgetting time is a common symptom of sleepwalking or somnambulism, which is what the phrase ""mơ mộng"" refers to in Vietnamese. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that option A (the machine has run out of ink) than option B (the machine has run out of paper). This is because the statement ""Các tài liệu in ra không đọc được"" suggests that there is an issue with the printing process itself rather than a problem with the paper supply. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Các cổ động viên đổ xô ra sân. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Sân vận động đã mở nhạc quốc ca,"" it is more likely that the fans will rush onto the field to celebrate than simply waving flags."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tôi dọn nó ra) is more likely to make the soup less spicy. When you stir in something cold like butter or cream, it can help to neutralize some of the heat from the chili peppers, making the soup less spicy. Option B (Tôi bỏ muối vào đó) would not have this effect as salt does not have a cooling effect on hot foods.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (khăn giấy hấp thụ chất lỏng) is more likely to occur. The fact that the speaker has placed a cloth on top of an area suggests that they are trying to absorb or soak up something liquid. Therefore, it is more likely that the cloth will be wet or dampened by the substance rather than being left dry.
"Response:  Option A: Cô đánh dấu trang của mình. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman is being distracted while reading her book. Marking her place is a common action people take when they need to put their book aside for a moment but want to easily return to where they left off. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the man tightens his seatbelt) is more likely. The reason for this is that when a plane encounters turbulence, it is common for passengers to tighten their seatbelts as a precautionary measure to prevent injury or harm. On the other hand, looking out of the window may not necessarily provide any additional safety benefits during turbulence, especially if the pilot is already taking appropriate actions to navigate the aircraft through the rough air. Therefore, option A is the more likely response in this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Cô bé bỏ mặc cậu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""bỏ mặc"" means to abandon or leave someone behind, which aligns with the idea of a mother leaving her child alone in the forest. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (They cut off her leg) is the correct answer. The premise states that the doctors gave the patient a fake limb, which suggests that they may have performed surgery to remove the real limb. Therefore, cutting off the patient's leg is the most plausible explanation for why the doctors would give her a fake one.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cô nhún vai nhìn anh) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""khuỷu tay"" suggests that the girl is holding onto something or someone tightly, which implies a strong emotional attachment. Therefore, it is more likely that she will look at him with affection rather than pushing him away."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tôi coi trọng ý kiến của anh ấy) is a more likely cause for why the speaker is seeking advice from someone else. The use of the phrase ""coi trọng"" (to consider or value) suggests that the speaker places importance on the other person's opinion and wants to hear their thoughts on the matter. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bùn dính vào giày cậu) is more likely. The word ""dính"" in Vietnamese means to stick or adhere, so it's more likely that the mud will stick to the boy's shoes rather than his face."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that people will be evacuated (Option B). The phrase ""trốn dưới lòng đất"" means to hide underground, which suggests a more drastic measure than simply closing schools (Option A). Therefore, Option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Anh về nhà) is more likely. The fact that the employee's shift has ended suggests that they have completed their work for the day and are free to go home. This is in contrast to option B (Anh dọa bỏ việc), which implies that the employee is unhappy with their job and may be considering quitting.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Cây ngã xuống mái nhà) caused the damage to the roof than option B (Cây che bóng sân sau). This is because the weight of a tree branch falling onto the roof can potentially cause significant damage, especially if the branch is large or heavy. In contrast, while a tree branch may cast shade on the backyard, it is less likely to cause direct damage to the roof unless it becomes entangled in the gutters or chimney.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi xếp gỗ trong lò sưởi) is a more plausible cause for why the wood split into two pieces than option B (Tôi vung rìu xuống gỗ). This is because heat can cause wood to expand and become brittle, leading to cracking or splitting along grain lines. Therefore, placing the wood in a hot oven would increase the likelihood of it splitting into two pieces rather than bending downwards under its own weight.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Couple announces they are getting a divorce) is the correct answer. The phrase ""gia đình chúc mừng"" suggests a happy occasion, but the mention of a couple breaking up implies that something sad or unexpected has happened."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Cô thích cậu) is the correct answer. The fact that she sent him a Valentine's Day card suggests that she has romantic feelings for him, which aligns with Option A. There is no indication in the premise to suggest that she is already married to him, which aligns with Option B.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Tôi đã nhầm lẫn) is the correct answer. The speaker seems to be expressing confusion or disagreement with the statement made by the other person, rather than agreeing with it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible response given the context of the conversation.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They want to find a compromise) is more likely. The group of friends wants to find a solution that works for everyone, indicating a desire for compromise rather than making a decision that benefits one person at the expense of others.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Người đàn ông dỡ đồ tạp hóa vào tủ lạnh) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the context of a kitchen where food is being cooked or stored in the fridge. Option B (Người đàn ông lấy pizza ra khỏi lò) does not fit as well into this context since pizzas are typically cooked in an oven rather than taken out of one.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Cô ấy làm việc chăm chỉ) is more likely to happen because it implies that she will put in effort and hard work to achieve her goals, rather than simply relying on luck or being lazy (option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Con trai ông được thừa hưởng gia tài) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""gia tài"" in Vietnamese implies a significant amount of wealth or property that will be inherited by the son after the father's death. This is a common practice in many Asian cultures, including Vietnamese culture, where family assets are often passed down from generation to generation within the same family lineage. Therefore, it is more likely for the son to inherit his father's wealth rather than facing legal problems due to his father's death."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ngọn lửa đã tắt) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""dẫm lên ngọn lửa"" implies that someone or something has stepped onto or near a fire, which could potentially extinguish it. Therefore, the likelier outcome is that the fire has already been put out before the woman steps on it."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (her car has been towed) is the correct answer. The premise states that she was in a store, which suggests that she may have parked her car nearby. If her car had been towed, it would be unlikely for her to return to the store without realizing that her car had been taken. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why she cannot find her car.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi ngủ quên,"" it is more likely that option B: Tôi đã bỏ bữa sáng is true. The phrase ""Tôi ngủ quên"" suggests that the speaker forgot something important, such as breakfast. Therefore, it is more likely that they did not have breakfast rather than preparing or eating it."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Các máy ảnh lóe lên về phía anh) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""bước ra khỏi xe limousine"" suggests that the famous person is getting out of a luxury car, which means they are likely to be surrounded by paparazzi taking photos from all angles. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B, where the family attends a press conference."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nước tắm trở nên bớt ấm) is more likely to occur. The fact that the woman is feeling hot suggests that the water temperature may be too high for her comfort, leading to a decrease in temperature rather than an increase.
"Response: 
Option A: Cậu tham gia một hội anh em. 
Explanation: The premise states that the protagonist wants to meet other students in their school, which suggests that they are interested in socializing with others. Joining a club or organization is a common way for people to meet new friends and connect with like-minded individuals, so option A is more likely to lead to this outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi lật đệm ghế lên,"" option A is the more likely cause. The phrase ""lật đệm"" means to turn over or flip something, which suggests that something has been knocked over or turned upside down. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as someone accidentally bumping into the chair or a strong gust of wind blowing it over. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cậu bé bỏ chạy) is more likely. The premise suggests that something unexpected has happened to the boy, causing him to run away in fear or confusion. Option B (Cậu bé hái một bông hoa) does not align with this interpretation as it implies a deliberate action of picking a flower, which may not be an appropriate response to an unexpected event like a storm.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Cô đã bị xử bắn) is more likely. The sentence ""Người phụ nữ bị kết tội nhẹ"" suggests that the woman was convicted of a minor crime, which would not result in the death penalty. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Option A - Trà nóng.
Explanation: According to the premise ""Tôi khuấy đường vào trà nóng,"" the hot water will cause the coffee grounds to dissolve into a liquid state. Therefore, option A - Trà nóng is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he was injured in battle) is more likely. The phrase ""bước đi khập khiễng"" suggests that the person has been through a difficult or dangerous experience, which aligns with the idea of being injured in battle. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Cảnh sát đuổi theo tên tội phạm) is more likely. The fact that the criminal has escaped from the police suggests that they are trying to evade capture, which means that the police will likely be pursuing them.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Tôi đã đánh rơi nó) is the correct answer. The reason being that if the computer was not turned on, then it cannot be accessed or used, hence the phrase ""không bật lên được"". Therefore, option A better fits the context of the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cô có nhiều quần áo) is more likely. The premise states that there is no longer a place for her clothes in the closet, indicating that she has many clothes. Option B (Cô gấp quần áo của mình) means that she folds or rolls up her clothes, which suggests a smaller number of items. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B: Vợ anh bỏ anh occurs. The man is already feeling sad and depressed, suggesting that he has been through a difficult time in his life. The fact that his wife has left him adds to his emotional pain, making it less likely for him to be happy or content with his current situation. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the lifestyle of a successful man has been taken away) is more likely. The fact that the man has completed his degree suggests he has achieved success in his life, but the phrase ""his lifestyle has been taken away"" implies that something negative has happened to him, such as losing his job or being forced to move back home. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ông chào khán giả) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""vang vọng khắp khán phòng"" suggests that the man's voice echoes throughout the room, indicating that he is addressing a live audience rather than speaking into a microphone. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the coin sinks to the bottom) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A (The ball goes into the goal).
Explanation: According to the premise, when a player kicks the ball towards the goal, it is more likely that the ball will go into the goal than fly backwards towards the player. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi nấc cụt) is a more likely outcome than option B (Tôi hắt xì). This is because the phrase ""hít bụi trong căn gác"" suggests that something has entered or gotten into the room through a small opening, rather than being blown in from outside. Therefore, it is more likely that whatever entered the room will get stuck inside, such as dust or dirt, rather than flying away."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Khách hàng đã sử dụng tiền giả) is the correct answer. The phrase ""thu ngân gọi bảo vệ"" suggests that someone has called for help or protection, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as being in danger or needing assistance. However, the additional information provided in the question states that the khách hàng (customer) had used fake money, indicating that they may have attempted to scam or defraud the bank. Therefore, Option A is the most likely explanation."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Rác is making the kitchen smell bad) is a more likely cause than option B (Tôi accidentally threw away the shopping list). This is because the language used in the premise suggests that something is actively causing an unpleasant odor in the kitchen, rather than simply forgetting where one placed something important.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the children admire the animals) is more likely. The phrase ""gia đình đã đi đến sở thú"" suggests that the family has arrived at a zoo or wildlife park, where they can observe and learn about various animal species. It's unlikely that the children would be chasing after the animals in this context, as they are there to appreciate and respect them from a safe distance. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man's lungs are blocked (Option B). The phrase ""thở của người đàn ông rất to"" suggests that he has difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, which could be caused by a blockage in his airways rather than a non-functional liver."
"Response:  Option B: Tôi hỏi bạn tôi rằng anh ta có thích đi cùng không. 
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that Tôi will ask his friend if he wants to go together rather than asking for directions to the venue. The conversation is more focused on socializing and spending time together rather than practical logistics."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Tôi mang chăn ra) will occur. The reason is that when a machine in the house breaks down, it is usually easier to fix or replace parts of it rather than opening up the entire wall to access the problem area. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Cậu bé bị đau lưng) is the correct answer. The phrase ""ba lô của cậu mở"" means ""Cậu's belly button is open,"" indicating that the baby has an open umbilical stump, which is a common occurrence after birth. This is a more plausible explanation for why the baby might be crying than option B (Ba lô của cậu nặng trĩu), which means ""Cậu's belly button is heavy."" There is no obvious reason why this would cause the baby to cry."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Tôi nướng cho bà ấy một cái bánh) is the correct answer. The phrase ""một món quà"" suggests a gift or present, which could be something edible like a cake or pastry. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker has bought their mother a gift."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Một con ong chích người làm vườn"" (A bee stings a person to make the garden) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that bees are known to create holes in plants and flowers using their stingers, rather than digging or burrowing into soil like ants or moles. Therefore, it is more plausible that the destruction of the garden was caused by a bee's sting rather than the actions of ants or mole."
"Response: 
Option A: Ngọn lửa tắt dần. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Tôi quẹt diêm,"" which means ""I am feeling cold,"" it is more likely that the fire will go out than be created. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They don't want to argue in front of the judge) is the more likely cause. The fact that they have reached a settlement suggests that they are trying to avoid further conflict, rather than preserving their personal relationship.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Cha mẹ của chúng đã chết) is the correct answer. The phrase ""một trại trẻ mồ côi"" suggests a place for orphans, and the fact that the children are there implies that they do not have living parents. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why these children are at the orphanage."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a tsunami has occurred) is more likely to be the result of a meteorite falling into the ocean. Tsunamis are large ocean waves caused by disturbances in the ocean floor or water mass, such as earthquakes, landslides, or meteor impacts. The impact of a meteorite into the ocean would create a massive disturbance that could generate a tsunami wave. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cô trở nên mất nước) is more likely. The phrase ""mất nước"" means to become dizzy or disoriented, which aligns with the physical sensation of being near a venomous snake. Option B (Cô hốt hoảng) means to be frightened or scared, but it does not convey the same level of physical symptoms as option A. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the provided information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lò nướng trở nên nóng,"" option B is more likely. The word ""trở"" in Vietnamese means ""to become,"" so it implies that the temperature of the oven has increased. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi vắt chanh,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Chan bị mốc"" (The lemon gets sour) will occur. This is because the word ""vắt"" in Vietnamese means to press or squeeze, implying that something is being compressed or squeezed, leading to a change in its taste. Therefore, it is more likely that the lemon will become sour rather than lose water."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - Quốc gia bỏ mặc vùng đất.
Explanation: The premise states that the newly discovered land belongs to a nation, but does not specify any actions taken by this nation towards the land. Therefore, it is more likely that the nation will simply ignore or neglect the new territory rather than taking steps to colonize or annex it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Nó vỡ tan khắp sàn nhà) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""lật khỏi bàn"" implies that the cup will be lifted off the table, and since it's made of glass, it may break into pieces if dropped from a height or onto a hard surface like a floor. Option B (Nó đáp xuống một đống đồ giặt) does not provide enough information to determine what might happen to the cup after it's knocked over."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (sàn nhà không bằng phẳng) is the more likely cause of the uneven floor. This is because a non-level floor can cause the table to rock or sway when someone tries to use it, whereas a smooth and flat surface would provide a stable base for the table. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - The son admits to lying. This is because the father has already expressed his disappointment in the son's lies and has made it clear that he does not trust him. In this situation, the son may feel pressure to confess the truth in order to regain his father's trust and avoid further consequences.
"Response:  Option B - Anh uống aspirin.
Explanation: Aspirin is a pain reliever that can help to reduce headaches caused by tension or migraines. It is also an anti-inflammatory drug, which means it can help to reduce swelling and inflammation in the body. On the other hand, siro ho (also spelled ""syrup of figs"") is a traditional remedy for headaches, but it does not have any scientific evidence to support its effectiveness as a pain reliever. Therefore, based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man will choose aspirin over siro ho to alleviate his headache."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the train is delayed due to Option B: It is running behind schedule. This is because the premise mentions that the train is ""running slow,"" which suggests that it is not keeping up with its scheduled pace. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of the delay."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man has a mental health disorder that was inherited from his family (Option A). The premise mentions that the man has undergone therapy, which suggests that he may have been experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition for some time. Inherited mental health conditions are common, and can be caused by genetic mutations or other factors passed down through generations. While Option B also mentions depression as a possible diagnosis, there is no additional information to suggest that this is the most likely explanation for the man's situation.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Cô nuốt thức ăn) is the correct answer. The premise states that the woman is holding her throat, indicating discomfort or pain, which could be caused by eating something. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Giọng cô khàn khàn) is more likely to be effective in conveying the woman's pain. The use of exaggerated facial expressions and body language can help convey a sense of distress or discomfort, making it easier for the audience to understand and empathize with the character's situation. Option B (Cô nói với giọng điệu), while still an effective way of communicating emotions, may not be as impactful as using physicality and expression alone.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the soup will spill (Option A). The phrase ""chảy nước dãi"" in Vietnamese means ""spills water"". Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (she becomes rich) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the woman's business has been successful, indicating that she has become wealthy as a result of her entrepreneurial efforts. Option A (she fires her employees) does not align with this assumption, as it would suggest that the woman's success has come at the expense of others. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the information given in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Chuông reo) caused the students to leave class. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Những người quen của cô liên quan đến cô) is more likely. The fact that the woman claims to have seen a ghost suggests that she has a personal connection to the supernatural event, and therefore her friends and family are more likely to be involved in some way.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he almost drowned) is more likely to be the cause of his loss of hearing. Drowning can cause damage to the inner ear and auditory nerve, leading to permanent hearing loss. It is less likely that he would lose his hearing due to a near-death experience from a explosion or other traumatic event.
"Response:  Option B - Bong bóng bay lên không trung. 
Explanation: The premise ""Đứa trẻ buông dây bóng bay"" implies that the ball is floating in mid-air without any external force acting upon it. Therefore, option B - Bong bóng bay lên không trung is more likely as it suggests that the ball will float upwards into the sky."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (he was struck by a sudden illness) is more likely to be the cause of his inability to speak. The other option, option B (he hitted his head), does not align with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (there is a crack in the sidewalk) is more likely to be the cause of the woman's fall. The mention of ""vỉa hè"" (sidewalk) suggests that the incident occurred outdoors, and the presence of a crack in the concrete could potentially create an uneven surface that might lead to a slip or fall. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the woman's accident."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Người đàn ông làm ướt viên cứu hộ) is more likely to happen. This is because the person jumping into the pool from a high altitude will most likely hit the water with great force, causing splashes and waves that could potentially knock over or drench anyone nearby, including the man trying to save him. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome in this scenario.
"Response:  Option A - Nhiễm trùng hết hẳn. 
Explanation: According to the premise, after taking antibiotics, the infection has been completely cured. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: Tài xế nhấn phanh. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the traffic light has turned yellow, indicating that the vehicle must slow down and prepare to stop. In this situation, it is more likely for the driver to press the brake pedal than to honk the horn. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi ngâm hộp đựnh trong nước ấm) is a more plausible cause for why the plastic box might be melting than option B (Tôi đặt hộp đựng lên bếp nóng). This is because exposure to warm water is more likely to cause plastic to melt than direct heat from an oven. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Tài xế đâm vào cột điện thoại) is more likely to occur than Option B (Tài xế vượt đèn đỏ). This is because hitting a pillar or pole with the car is more likely to result in damage to the vehicle and potential injury to the driver and passengers compared to running a red light. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cậu không làm bài kiểm tra) is more likely. The premise states that Cậu bé học cả đêm, implying that he spends a lot of time studying at night. However, it does not mention anything about him doing well in school or passing his exams. Therefore, it is more likely that he will not do well in the exam, as he may be too tired from studying late at night to perform well.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Cậu sợ học bơi) is more likely. The fact that the child clings to the side of the pool suggests that they may be afraid or uncomfortable in the water, rather than simply being curious about it.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi cảm nhận nhịp tim của tôi) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tôi đưa tay lên ngực"" suggests that the speaker is touching their own chest, which implies a sense of self-awareness or introspection. This is consistent with the idea of feeling one's heartbeat, as it is a common metaphor for emotions or inner experiences. In contrast, option B (Nhịp tim của tôi tăng tốc) does not necessarily imply any sense of self-awareness or introspection, but rather an increase in heart rate due to some external stimulus. Therefore, option A is more likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B will occur - ""Văn phòng tôi trở nên ồn ào."" As construction work nearby can potentially cause a rise in noise levels near my office, making it feel louder than usual."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Gia đình mời hàng xóm qua ăn tối) is more likely to happen. This is because inviting neighbors over for dinner is a common way for families to get to know each other better in Vietnamese culture. It provides an opportunity for them to interact and build relationships in a relaxed setting.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Người bơi nhảy xuống hồ bơi) is the more likely cause. The reason being that water splashing up from the bottom of a pool or lake can be caused by various factors such as wind, waves, or even just movement in the water, but it is less likely to occur when someone jumps into the water from above. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi vô tình nuốt hạt dưa) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""vô tình"" means ""unintentionally,"" so it's unlikely that Tôi would intentionally swallow a whole lemon. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Áo khoác của cậu không kéo khoá) is the cause of the situation. The fact that the boy's coat did not pull him back suggests that he may have been thrown forward with enough force to hit his head on the ground, rather than simply falling off balance and landing on his face.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cô bị phân tâm bởi tiếng ồn) is more likely to be the cause of her headache. The premise states that she is wearing earplugs, which suggests that she may be trying to block out noise. However, if she were simply banging her head against something, it would not require earplugs. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for her headache.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi đổ nước đầy chai,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""đổ nước"" means to pour or empty water into a container, indicating that the speaker has already consumed all of the water in the bottle. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (It contains coarse language) is a more likely cause for why the TV show was censored. The use of offensive or inappropriate language can be a common reason for content to be edited or removed from broadcasts, especially those intended for a general audience.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (All crew members died) is the most likely outcome. The premise states that the ship sank, implying a catastrophic event that would result in the death of all crew members on board. While it's possible for some crew members to survive a shipwreck by using lifeboats or other safety measures, it's unlikely that everyone would manage to escape such an incident unscathed. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible choice given the information provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cậu giải được câu đố) is more likely. The premise states that the boy feels confused by the puzzle, indicating that he may not be able to solve it immediately. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome.
"Response:  Option A: Người đàn ông cúp điện thoại. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the man's hand is already holding onto something (the phone), so it is more likely that he will drop the phone than pick it up. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi đã ôm cô ấy) is more likely. The use of the past tense in ""đã ôm"" suggests that the action has already occurred, which aligns with the idea of the woman looking at him with a loving gaze. Option B (""Tôi cảm thấy khó chịu"") does not fit as well with this interpretation, as it implies that he feels uncomfortable or awkward, rather than being loved up."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The fact that they are taking pictures of the exhibits suggests that they are interested in documenting them for some purpose, such as creating a record or sharing their experience with others. It is less likely that they would have viewed all the exhibits without taking any photos.
"Response: 
Option A: Bạn tôi giới thiệu tôi với người đàn ông. 
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that you will introduce yourself to the man rather than defend yourself. The man has started a confrontation with you, so introducing yourself may help de-escalate the situation or provide an opportunity for communication. Defending yourself would only escalate the conflict further."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Tôi bơm không khí vào lốp xe."" (I inflate the tire with air.) Inflating the tire with air will make it bigger and increase its pressure, which can help to fix a flat tire. On the other hand, adding gasoline to the tire will not have any effect on fixing a flat tire and could potentially cause an explosion or fire if done improperly. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Cha cô sờ trán cô. 
Explanation: The phrase ""trông tái nhợt"" in the premise suggests that the girl's appearance has changed significantly, making her look unrecognizable. Therefore, option B, where cha cô (the mother) slaps the girl's face, is more likely to be the correct answer as it aligns with the given information."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi sử dụng bút chì) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker has a pen or bút chì available for use. Option B (Tôi ký tên tôi) does not provide any information about whether the speaker has a pen or not, so it is less likely to occur in this context.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anh ta đang mắc nợ) is more likely to be the reason why the man was denied a loan. This is because in Vietnamese culture, being in debt or having a poor credit history is often seen as a sign of irresponsibility or lack of financial management skills, which can make it difficult for individuals to obtain loans from banks or other financial institutions. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the man was denied a loan.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Cô bị thủy đậu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nghỉ học"" implies that she is taking a break from her studies, and the addition of ""thủy đậu"" suggests that something unexpected or unfortunate has happened to prevent her from continuing her studies. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tôi đem nó đến bãi rác) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of the situation. The speaker has already mentioned that they have a lot of trash, so it makes sense for them to take it to the dumpster rather than pouring it down the drain. Option B (Tôi đổ nó xuống bồn rửa chén) does not fit as well in this scenario since it implies disposing of the trash in a different location altogether.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tôi hút bụi thảm,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""hút bụi thảm"" means to suck up dirt or dust, so it's likely that the speaker's roommate is making a mess by spilling something."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Anh ném ghế qua phòng) is more likely to happen because it suggests a sudden and violent action that could be caused by extreme emotions such as anger or frustration. Option A (Anh tắt máy tính) does not convey the same level of intensity or impulsiveness.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cành cây bị đốt cháy) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Người đàn ông ra khỏi phòng tắm) is a more likely cause than option B (Anh ta không tm thấy khăn tắm). This is because the premise explicitly states that the man has left the bathroom, indicating that he has finished his shower or bath. It does not provide any information about whether or not he forgot to bring his towel. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man may have left the bathroom without his towel.
Response:  Option A (Họ dành một quỹ tiết kiệm cho học phí) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the cultural values of Vietnamese parents who prioritize education as a means to secure their children's future. In contrast, option B (Khuyến khích con cái họ chơi bên ngoài) may not resonate with this value system.
"Response:  Option A - Đôi giày nới lỏng.
Explanation: According to the premise, the man took off his shoes, indicating that they were uncomfortable or caused discomfort. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the shoes were loose and caused him discomfort."
"Response:  Option B: Anh lưu công thức nấu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the man only eats half of his meal, so he will not leave any food uneaten in the fridge or freezer. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Tôi chườm đá) will occur. The phrase ""Mắt cá chân của tôi bị sưng"" suggests that there is swelling in my eyes, which can cause discomfort and pain. Chườm đá (rubbing one's eyes) is a common remedy for eye irritation or swelling, so this option is more plausible than Xoa kem dưỡng (applying eye cream)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Tôi tình cơn nghe được cuộc trò chuyện trong hội trường) is more likely. The phrase ""tình cơn"" means ""by chance,"" so it's possible that the speaker overhears a conversation in the hallway without intending to do so. Option A (""Tôi nói chuyện với đồng nghiệp của tôi tại bàn"") implies that the speaker is actively engaging in a conversation with their colleague at their desk, which may not be as feasible or realistic in a busy office environment."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tôi ngồi xuống) is more likely to occur than option B (Tôi đọc lướt qua một tạp chí). This is because waiting in line implies a physical activity that requires one's presence at the location, whereas reading a magazine can be done from anywhere, including while waiting in line. Therefore, option A is more consistent with the context of waiting in line.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Người đàn ông đập ruồi,"" it is more likely that the fly will be affected by Option A (Con ruồi bay đi). When a person swats at a fly, it is likely to cause the fly to move or fly away rather than stay in one place. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (He is about to die) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - Anh bỏ cuộc đua. When a runner feels like they are being closely pursued, they may feel anxious or stressed, leading them to slow down or give up rather than push themselves harder.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Tôi đã đưa ra một giải pháp) is more likely. The speaker has already thought carefully about the issue and has proposed a solution, indicating that they are confident in their answer. Therefore, option B is the best choice.
"Response:  Option B: Anh cảm thấy ngây ngất.
Explanation: The phrase ""bấp bênh"" in the premise suggests that the person is suspended high up in the air, which can cause a feeling of dizziness or lightheadedness (ngây ngất). Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Option B: He has placed a bet with his friends.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man has placed a bet with his friends rather than meeting them to watch the game together. This is because placing a bet involves risking money on the outcome of the match, which can be done remotely or online, without the need for physical interaction. On the other hand, meeting up with friends to watch a game together requires mutual agreement and effort, which may not be feasible if one of the parties does not have access to the necessary technology or resources. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cậu đặt đồng hồ báo thức) is more likely to happen because it provides a logical explanation for why the boy can't sleep. Setting an alarm clock would allow him to wake up at a specific time, which could help him establish a regular sleep schedule and improve his ability to fall asleep. Option B (Cậu đếm cừu) does not provide a clear reason why the boy can't sleep, and counting sheep may not be a reliable method for falling asleep.
