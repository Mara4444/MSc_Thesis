"Response: Б) He traveled with a big suitcase.

Explanation:
The sentence implies that the man is preparing for cold weather by packing warm clothing, which suggests that he has a large suitcase to accommodate all of his belongings.

Response: Б) The student's answers were incorrect.
Response: Б
"Response: Б) I covered it with plastic wrap.

Explanation:
The passage states that ""the frozen food thawed,"" which suggests that the object was exposed to heat or warmth. Option A, ""I put it in the microwave,"" is not a plausible explanation for why the frozen food thawed, as microwaves are not capable of thawing frozen objects. Therefore, option B, ""I covered it with plastic wrap,"" is the more likely explanation, as plastic wrap can help retain heat and cause an object to thaw."

"Response: Б) The customer handed her money. 
Разлог за то да се ово одговорено сматра вероватним јесте следећи:
* У тексту се наводи да су објекти ""cashier"" и ""customer"", што упућује на то да се ради о трансакцији плаћања.
* Опција А не одговара овом контексту јер не каже ништа о плаћању или обележавању новца.
* OPција Б се односи на актуелну ситуаaciju у којој се ""customer"" руши новац, па је ово одговорено сматрати вероватним."

Response: Б) It was snack time.
Response: Б) The pilot flew through the storm.
Response: Б
Response: Б) He decided to play a practical joke on his sister.
"Response: Б) His father stopped the car at a gas station. 
Разлог: According to the assumption, the child had to go to the bathroom, which means that they were on a journey or traveling in some way. Stopping at a gas station is more likely than giving the child a soda to drink while driving, as it would be impractical and unsafe to stop the car just for this purpose."

"Response: Б) I twisted the wrench.

Rationale:
The sentence ""The bolt tightened"" suggests that something is happening to the bolt itself, rather than to a tool used to tighten it. Option B, ""I twisted the wrench,"" is more likely because it implies that the speaker is using a tool to turn the bolt, rather than the bolt simply tightening on its own."
Response: Б
"Response: Б) She thought she saw lightning. 
Разлог за то да се ово одговоре као врло вероватно је у томе што она није на месту где би могла видети сунцеzet, већ на месту где би могла видети светлост која припада облацима или громовњачи."
"Response: Б - The water was shallow.

Rationale:
The sentence ""The man wore a lifejacket in the water"" suggests that he was in danger of drowning and needed protection from the water. Option A is not plausible because if he couldn't swim, he would have been unable to get into the water in the first place. Option B is more likely because it explains why the man wore a lifejacket, which was to protect himself from the shallow water."
Response: Б) She hit the backspace key.
Response: Б
Response: Б) It was full of weeds.
Response: Б) She forgot to set her alarm clock.
Response: Б) He went to the beach.
Response: Б
Response: Б
Response: Б
Response: Б
"Response: Б) I shoveled the snow out of the way.

Explanation:
Based on the context, it is more likely that the speaker shoveled the snow out of the way rather than gathering it into a snowball. Shoveling is an action that is commonly used to remove snow from a surface, while making a snowball is not a practical solution for clearing a driveway. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."

"Response: Б) She took off her shoes. 
Разлог за то да се она одувала на ноге јер су онлајн санчеви били превелики и нису јоj дозвољавали да хода."
"Response: Б) I covered the pot. 
Разлог за то да се steam rose off of the pot of water is that when you cover a pot of water, it traps the heat inside and causes the water to boil, which releases steam into the air. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: Б) I wore boots. 
Разлог:  The sentence ""All my socks were in the laundry"" implies that the speaker did not wear any socks, which is consistent with the option B (I wore boots). Option A (I wore sandals) does not make sense in this context since it suggests that the speaker was wearing sandals while all their socks were in the laundry."

"Response: Б) Crime rates in the city increased.

Rationale:
The passage states that ""the downtown building collapsed,"" which suggests a sudden and unexpected event. Earthquakes are unpredictable and can cause widespread destruction, but they typically occur in specific areas rather than affecting an entire city. Similarly, while crime rates can increase in certain neighborhoods or periods of time, it is unlikely to be the sole reason for a building collapse without any additional context. Therefore, option B (Crime rates in the city increased) is the most likely explanation based on the information provided in the passage."

Разлог за одлуку:  According to the assumption, lava flowed from the volcano, which suggests that it was in an active state and not dormant. Therefore, option B is more likely."

Разлог за то да се ово одговорено може рећи jest that ""cracking an egg"" is a common way for a baby animal to emerge from its shell, and it is not something that would happen naturally or spontaneously without human intervention. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
Response: Б
Response: Б) He fell off the ladder.
Response: Б) He opened the soda can.
Response: Б) I shivered.
"Response: Б) She made good grades. 
Разлог за то јесте да у тексту се наводи ""The student received a scholarship to go to college"", што указује на то да она добила стипендију због добрих оцена. Опција А не одgovara овом текстовом јер није наведено да њена класе респектирале је."

Разлог за то је у томе што ако сте помислили на објект ""tomatoes"", тада су воћем које сте помислили на биле ""ripe tomatoes"" (томате које су зреле), а не воће које сте помислили на било коју врсту воћа или поврћа."
"Response: Б) He bought his girlfriend chocolates. 

Explanation:
Based on the premise, it is more likely that the man bought his girlfriend chocolates as a romantic gesture. This option aligns with the idea of the man wanting to act romantic and buying something special for his partner. Option A does not fit well with this context, as meeting an ex-girlfriend for lunch would not be considered a romantic gesture. Therefore, option B is the most probable choice."

Response: Б) It sailed into the harbor.
Response: Б) He stepped on broken glass.
Response: Б
"Response: Б - I asked for a ride.

Explanation:
Based on the assumption that there was a lot of traffic on the highway, it is more likely that the speaker asked for a ride rather than taking a detour. This is because asking for a ride can be seen as a convenient and time-saving option in heavy traffic conditions."
Response: Б - Many people faced unemployment.
Response: Б

Response: Б) The woman had morning sickness.
Response: Б) It was windy outside.
"Response: Б) She bought a gift. 
Разлог за то да се ово може сматрати вероватнијем од опције А (She received an invitation) јесте што у тексту нема навода да би она добила позив за полагање, већ се спомињу подаци о том кога се десило на рођенданској фетри која су присуствовали. Такође, у тексту се каже да је она купила поклон, а не да јој someone else has given her an invitation."

Response: Б) I picked up a shovel.
Response: Б
Response: Б) She saw the finish line.
Response: Б
Response: Б
"Response: Б) He paid with cash.

Explanation:
The e-mail is about a businessman whose credit card was declined when he tried to make a purchase. Option B is the most likely outcome as paying with cash is a common solution for situations where a credit card is declined. Writing an IOU (Option A) is less likely as it may not be a feasible or practical option in this scenario."
Response: Б) He stubbed his toe.
Response: Б) His brother got accepted into law school.
Response: Б
"Response: Б) I put tape on the back of the poster. 
Разлог за то да се optina B изабрала jest that it is more likely that you would use tape to attach a poster to a wall than to position it above a door."
"Response: Б - The architect adjusted the plans.

Explanation: Based on the assumption that the client approved the architect's plans for the building, it is more likely that the architect adjusted the plans rather than constructing the building. This option better fits the context of the situation and the roles of the parties involved."

Response: Б) He borrowed it from a friend.
"Response: Б) He was convicted of murder.

Response: Б) I studied all day.
"Response: Б) She prescribed pills to the patient. 
Разлози:  This option is more likely because it directly relates to the action of a physician in diagnosing and treating a patient. Options A and B are both important aspects of medical care, but they do not necessarily imply that the physician has made a definitive diagnosis or provided treatment."
Response: Б) It felt itchy.
"Response: Б) He suffered a heart attack. 
Разлози за одговоре:  This option is more likely because the phrase ""underwent emergency surgery"" suggests that the person experienced a serious medical condition, such as a heart attack, which can cause sudden and severe symptoms including chest pain or discomfort. Losing one's temper (option A) is not a life-threatening situation and does not require immediate medical attention."
"Response: Б) He rubbed his arms. 
Разлог за то да се одлучи на овој опцији јесте што у тексту нема информације о томе како би се могао изразити покрет ""flexing"" (избочинавање) коришћењем речи ""rubbed"". Реч ""rubbed"" значи масажирати или простирати руком, а не извођење физичке вежбе попут избочинавања."

"Response: Б) His son inherited his fortune. 

Explanation:
The passage states that the wealthy man ""died of old age,"" which suggests that he was elderly and had lived a long life. This makes it less likely that he would have gotten into legal trouble or inherited his fortune, as these events are more likely to occur later in life. Therefore, option B is the most probable answer."
Response: Б
Response: Б) She got in a car accident.
Response: Б - I missed breakfast.
Response: Б
Response: Б
"Response: Б) He majored in engineering. 
Разлог:  According to the assumption, the college student wanted to meet other students on campus. Majorizing in engineering is unlikely to help him achieve this goal, as it is not a social field of study and does not provide many opportunities for interaction with other students. Joining a fraternity, on the other hand, can provide opportunities for meeting new people and making friends on campus. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."

"Response: Б) I opened the windows.

Response: Б) It was running behind schedule.
"Response: Б) He was diagnosed with depression. 
Разлози за одговоре:  Option B is more likely because it directly answers the question and provides a specific medical diagnosis that can cause mental illness. Option A mentions ""mental illness ran in his family,"" which could be a contributing factor to the man's mental health issues but does not provide a direct answer to the question."
