Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона was crunchy) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я випорозив кишені,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Я знайшов квиток,"" is correct. The word ""випорозив"" in Russian means to vomit or throw up, so it is unlikely that the speaker found a ticket."
"Response:  Option B: Termites ate through the wood in the house.
Explanation: The premise states that termites have invaded the house, indicating that they are present inside the building. Since termites feed on organic matter such as wood, it is more likely that they will eat through the wood in the house rather than disappearing from it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Патрульний агент звинуватив них у contrabande. 
Reasoning: The premise states that the travelers reached the border, indicating that they are in a foreign country. As such, it is more likely that the patrol agent would accuse them of smuggling contraband rather than checking their passports."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (It was a holiday) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that there is no mention of summer or any specific date, which suggests that the office closure could have been due to a public holiday or other event unrelated to seasonal changes.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Вона грала в шашки) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the girl's energy has run out, which could be due to playing a mentally demanding game like chess. Playing a physical activity like jumping rope would not necessarily drain her energy as quickly or in the same way. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the girl's energy ran out.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (more people in line) is the more likely cause for why she lost her place in line.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Дитина слила на її бабник) is the more likely cause for the girl to have grabbed her nose. This is because babies are known to produce snot and other bodily fluids that can get all over their faces and clothes, including onto others nearby. Therefore, it's possible that the baby in question may have accidentally smeared its own snot onto the girl's face or nose, causing her to grab at it in discomfort or surprise.
"Response: 
Option A: Публіка плескала під музыку."
"Response:  Option B: Дівчина принесла вчителю яблуко.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl wanted to thank her teacher for helping her understand mathematics. Bringing a gift such as an apple is a common way of expressing gratitude in many cultures. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  Option A (their camp counselor told them a ghost story)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (У нього шок) is more likely. The man hitting his head could cause shock, leading to confusion or disorientation, rather than simply ""being lost in thought""."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Мій рахунок у банку був порожній) is more likely to be the cause of why I didn't receive my paycheck. This is because if one's bank account has no money in it, then they are unlikely to have received a paycheck.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he deleted the spam email rather than sending a mass email to many people. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man was exposed to a contagious disease (Option A). The phrase ""was placed in quarantine"" suggests that he had been infected with something and needed to be isolated for his own safety and the safety of others. This implies that he was not simply ""overcoming"" an illness but rather was actively being treated for one. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вона переказала її собі) is more likely. The girl remembered the code because she repeated it to herself.
Response:  Option A - Вода згасила мою спрагу.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He wanted to support his friend) is a more likely explanation for why the man remained silent when his friend finished speaking. It's possible that he was simply trying to show empathy or understanding towards his friend by remaining quiet rather than responding with words of his own.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I filed a lawsuit) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (У ланцюжку було розбито ланцюг) is more likely. The premise states that ""Церець розвалися,"" indicating that something happened to the chain itself rather than just being wrapped around a shin or having a broken link. Therefore, it is more likely that the chain was damaged or broke due to external forces, such as friction or impact, rather than simply getting wrapped around an object."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They became tired of arguing) is a more likely cause for why the couple decided to compromise. The passage states that they were ""tired of fighting,"" indicating that their arguments had become frequent and exhausting. This suggests that they reached a point where they no longer wanted to continue engaging in conflict and instead chose to find a middle ground."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She testified in court) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він упакував теплий одяг у валізку) is more likely. The man expected to be cold during his journey, so he packed warm clothing in his suitcase. This suggests that he was prepared for a chilly trip.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he lied) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He put on glasses.
Explanation: The premise states that ""У чоловіка витікали сльози,"" which means ""Tears were flowing from the man."" This implies that he was crying or emotional, rather than experiencing physical discomfort or pain. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause - he put on glasses to help him see better in a situation where he needed to be visually alert."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (her opponent felt sorry for her) is more likely. The reason being that winning five consecutive games does not necessarily imply any wrongdoing or cheating by the player. It could simply mean that they are a skilled player who has been able to maintain their form throughout the competition. Therefore, it is more plausible that her opponent would feel sorry for losing to someone as talented as she rather than accusing them of cheating.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вчинтер спіймав студента на шахрайстві) is more likely. The premise states that the teacher was able to catch the student cheating, implying that the student was attempting to deceive or mislead the teacher in some way. This suggests that the student may have been engaging in dishonest behavior, such as plagiarism or falsifying test answers, rather than simply providing incorrect responses. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я втратив голос) is more likely. The speaker has stopped talking to indicate that they have lost their voice, rather than feeling winded or out of breath ( Option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (“Я поклала його в мікрохвильці”) is the correct answer. The phrase “заморожена їжа розморозися” suggests that the food was frozen and then thawed, which would explain why it tasted bad. Placing it in a microwave oven (option A) could have caused the food to heat up unevenly or cook improperly, resulting in an unpleasant taste. Option B (“Я прикрив його пластиковою плівкою”) does not provide any explanation for why the food tasted bad.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (У ньому були судоми в животі) is the correct answer. The phrase ""прикинувся хворим"" suggests that the person has imagined or pretended to be sick, which could be due to stomach pains or discomfort. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person might have been absent from work without a valid reason."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Вона зістрибнула з підводного плата) is more likely. The fact that she fell into a basin suggests that she was not able to walk around it or climb out of it, so the only other option for her to get out would be by jumping from underwater platform.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The tickets were sold out) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Люди йому компліментували.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man lost weight, which may have been a result of him trying to improve his health or appearance. People are more likely to compliment someone who has made an effort to change for the better, rather than isolating them. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Вона напечатала лист) is the more likely cause. The appearance of a girl's hands in a tumor suggests that something external caused their manifestation, such as writing or drawing. This is more plausible than Option B (Вона піднялась на мотузку), which implies that the girl was able to climb inside her own body and emerge from a tumor without any visible means of support.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Глядачі здивовані вітали) is more likely. The idea of a juggler riding a unicycle while eating is unexpected and surprising, which would elicit a positive reaction from the audience.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я втратив терпіння,"" it is more likely that Option A (Мій друг змусив мене чекати) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""змусив"" implies coercion or force, which aligns with the idea of someone making you wait against your will."
"Response: 
Option B: They domoded about a treaty."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he took a sleeping pill (Option A). The premise states that he ""took something"" before going to bed, implying that he intentionally ingested a substance. Taking a sleeping pill would be a common reason for someone to take something before bedtime, whereas having a fever or other illness symptoms ( Option B) may not necessarily cause drowsiness."
"Response:  Option B: Вона пошкодила коліно.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman ""врізалася"" (inserted) into the sofa, implying a forceful action. As a result, it is more likely that she will injure her knee or collarbone rather than just relaxing her leg."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B: балон полетів, is more likely to occur. The premise states that the boy squeezed a balloon, which would cause it to inflate and potentially fly away. It is less likely for the balloon to burst due to the pressure applied by the boy.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They went to the airport) is more likely. The fact that they are packing their bags suggests that they are preparing for a trip or journey, which would involve going to an airport to catch a flight.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я вкусив персик,"" it is more likely that the perishable fruit has been damaged or spoiled (Option A). When you bite into a persimmon, it is unlikely to produce liquid as described in Option B. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Мої руки сталали липкими,"" it is more likely that Option A (Я з'їв пончик) caused the hands to become sticky. This is because eating a pastry can leave a residue or grease on the skin, which could make the hands feel sticky."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я відштовхнув двері,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - the doors will open."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Produkts were produced using child labor) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Пункт выдував пил.
Explanation: The premise states that a hole was dug in the wall, implying that something (a person or an object) has been digging. Therefore, option B, where the point is producing dust, is more likely as it suggests that whatever is digging the hole is also producing dust."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (her sister got divorced) is more likely to be the cause of her jealousy.
"Response:  Option B: Я переодягся.
Explanation: The premise ""Я розлил вино на сорочку"" implies that something liquid was poured onto a shirt, which could result in staining or discoloration of the fabric. It does not make sense to put on an overcoat afterward, as it would be unnecessary and illogical. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Клієнт передав їй гроші) is more likely because it aligns with the context of the situation. The client has been unable to pay for their groceries and has turned to a stranger for help, indicating that they may not have the financial means to cover the cost themselves. Therefore, it is more likely that the client would transfer money from their account to the cashier's account rather than searching through their wallet for cash.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Люди давали йому трохи troхи) is more likely. The premise suggests that the street musician attracted a crowd, and people in the crowd gave him money. This implies that he received financial support from the audience, rather than letting them go.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (he lacked his parents) is the correct answer. The phrase ""плакал до своєї няні"" suggests a close relationship between the child and the nanny, implying that the child's parents are not present or available to comfort him. This supports Option A as the most likely explanation for why the child was crying."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Радарпілота виявившторм,"" it is more likely that the pilot flew through the storm (Option B). The radar of a pilot would detect any nearby storms, making it unlikely for the pilot to fly directly away from them (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дerevo liestevesh"" (The tree is leafing), option A is more likely. The reason for this is that trees typically do not accumulate leaves on the ground, as they fall off naturally during autumn or are blown away by winds. Therefore, it is more likely that the change in color observed is due to the leaves changing colors rather than accumulating on the ground."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he decided to play a trick on his sister) is more likely. The fact that the boy was in a bad mood suggests that he may have been looking for ways to distract himself or lash out, which could lead him to come up with a prank to play on his sister.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (his father stopped the car at a gas station) is more likely. The child complained about needing to go to the bathroom, indicating that they are in a public place rather than at home. Stopping at a gas station would be a more practical solution for this problem than giving the child soy sauce to drink.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Риба вистрибнула з акваріума) is more likely. The child left food in the aquarium, indicating that they are not present to observe or interact with the fish. Therefore, it is unlikely that the fish would swim towards the food. Instead, it is more likely that the fish would escape from the aquarium altogether.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (she took part in a protest) is more likely to be the cause of her changed political views.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I filled it with a drain cleaner) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (the train arrived at the station) is the correct answer. The other option does not provide any relevant information to support the conclusion that the passengers disembarked from the train.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he pressed the wet envelope with his finger (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (they moved to different cities) is more likely. The friends lost touch because they moved away from each other, rather than spending time together in the same city.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she was fired (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я подивися на годинник,"" option A is more likely. The word ""подивитися"" means to look at something, so it's likely that the speaker saw the clock rather than heard it ticking."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""У мене з'їзли руки,"" option B (Ми з дружиною трималися за руки) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I replaced the bolt) is a more plausible explanation for why the car's wheels are stuck than Option B (I turned the steering wheel lock to lock). The reason being that replacing a bolt or nut can sometimes cause a mechanical issue with the vehicle's suspension or brakes, leading to difficulty in turning the wheels. However, turning the steering wheel lock to lock without any other issues would not necessarily explain why the wheels are stuck.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that пара переїхала до квартири (Para signed a contract to rent an apartment). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона хотіла подивитися на захід сонця) is more likely. The fact that she sat on the veranda suggests that she was enjoying the view or waiting for something to happen outside, rather than thinking she saw a lightning bolt.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він не вмів плавати) is more likely. The man was in a life jacket, indicating that he knew how to swim or had some experience with water rescue. If he didn't know how to swim, it would be less likely for him to be wearing a life jacket while trying to save someone else.
"Response:  Option B: Вона натиснула клавішу ""Back Space"".  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman made a mistake in the text processor, indicating that she may have accidentally deleted something. Pressing the Backspace key is a common action when correcting mistakes or deleting content, making it more likely than simply deleting a document."
Response:  Option A (Вона отримала погану оцінку).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Всю ніч лив) is more likely as it implies that the lawn was flooded with water all night long, which could have caused the grass to become muddy or dirty.  
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона провела ніч в готелі) is more likely. The premise states that the woman ""переспала,"" which implies that she spent the night in a different location than her own bed. This suggests that she may have stayed in a hotel or other accommodation for the night, rather than simply forgetting to set an alarm clock. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: He went to the beach.
Explanation: The premise states that the man put sunscreen on his face, indicating that he is going outside or to a place where he will be exposed to direct sunlight. Going to the beach is the most likely option since it provides an opportunity for exposure to sunlight."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Дослідники відкинули теoriю) is more likely. The premise states that ""doslodniki proved a theory,"" indicating that the researchers have successfully supported their claims through scientific investigation. This suggests that they may have found evidence that contradicts or challenges the original theory, leading them to reject it in favor of a new one. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the information given in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Гра пішла в продовження) is more likely. The fact that fans were ejected from the match suggests that there was a disruption or disturbance during the game, which could have led to the match being delayed or postponed. It's less likely that the referee made a poor decision that caused the match to be stopped.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я ввів свою кодировку на замок,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""закрытие открылось"" (closure opened) suggests that something unexpected happened when the code was introduced to the lock, perhaps causing it to open unexpectedly. Option A, ""Я закрыл замок"" (I closed the castle), does not provide any indication of an unusual outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Батько схопив сина за руку) is more likely. The premise states that ""Натовп посилювася,"" indicating a growing crowd or mob, which could lead to a dangerous situation where someone might be grabbed by the authorities."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I picked up snow from there) is more likely. The sentence implies that the speaker gathered snow from a specific location, rather than collecting it in a ball as suggested by option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Каякисты прокатували весла"", option A - ""Каяк досяг берега"" is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option B: She crashed into a parked car.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я inclusion ventilator,"" it is more likely that Option B will occur - ""I felt as if a cool breeze was passing over me."" The wording of the premise suggests that something has been turned on or activated, which would typically produce an airflow rather than water droplets."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They were prowled) is more likely. The premise states that they turned back to the beach, implying that they had been at the beach earlier and returned later. If they were prowled by a shark while at the beach, it would make sense for them to turn back to the beach after being attacked. However, if they saw an octopus while at the beach, there wouldn't be any reason for them to return to the same location.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Water flowed out of the sink) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He confessed to her his infidelity) is more likely. The man feels guilty for cheating on his wife, indicating that he wants to confront the issue directly rather than blaming her for it.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Я чекав, поки чорнило не висахне) is the more likely cause. The fact that the drawing on the poster has been smudged suggests that it was exposed to something wet or oily, which could have caused the ink to bleed or spread unevenly. Option B (Я розлив воду на плакат), on the other hand, does not provide any context that would suggest why the drawing on the poster might be smudged. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the drawing on the poster appears blurry or smudged.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he had a nightmare) is the correct answer. The fact that the child woke up crying suggests that he may have been having a bad dream or nightmare, rather than simply spilling water on his bed.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (his father sat down) occurred. The reason for this is that the action of placing one's legs on a table does not necessarily imply any particular outcome or consequence, whereas sitting down is a more significant event with potential consequences (such as disturbing someone who was already seated). Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based solely on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I waved my hands) is more likely. The phrase ""my friend turned his head in my direction"" suggests that someone or something caused him to turn around, rather than being startled by a sudden noise. Waving one's hands would be a more natural action to take when trying to get someone's attention, especially if they are far away or out of sight."
"Response:  Option A: Громадани підняли повстання.  
Explanation: The premise states that the government was oppressing its citizens, which suggests a high level of dissatisfaction among the population. Pogroms are often associated with widespread unrest and protests, so it is more likely that the citizens will resort to violent means to express their discontent rather than simply registering to vote."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he cried for help (Option B). The fact that he got lost in the forest suggests that he may be scared or injured, and crying for help would be a natural response to this situation. Setting up a trap does not seem like an appropriate reaction to getting lost in the woods.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (she wanted to learn about other cultures) is more likely. The woman's desire to travel abroad suggests that she is interested in exploring new experiences and learning about different cultures, rather than just wanting to improve her painting skills.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his colleague was promoted) is more likely. The passage states that the man was ""envious of his colleague,"" implying that he felt overshadowed or less successful than his coworker. This could lead to feelings of resentment or insecurity, which might motivate him to try harder or seek recognition. However, there is no indication in the passage that his colleague worked longer hours or had a worse work-life balance. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why the man was envious of his colleague."
"Response:  Option A - He had a psychotic episode.
Explanation: The premise states that the man saw alien beings, indicating that he may have experienced some kind of hallucination or delusion. This is consistent with option A, as it suggests that the man's experience was not based in reality but rather a product of his own mind. In contrast, option B does not provide any evidence to support the idea that the man was meditating, and therefore seems less plausible given the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він додав в ньогобілку) is more likely as it suggests that the man added something to his hair to make it bleach, whereas Option B (Ві вклав у ньогошампунь) does not provide a logical explanation for why the man's hair would bleach.
Response: 🔍 Option B: She felt inspired by it.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He was fired from his job) is the most likely cause for Sin's decision to move out of his house. This is because the premise states that Sin has moved away from home, indicating that he no longer resides there. It does not provide any information about him enrolling in college or being in the army, which are the two options provided as possible causes. Therefore, it can be inferred that Sin was fired from his job, leading him to move out of his house.
"Response:  Option B: Землетрус похитував книжкову полицю.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""книги впали з книжкової полиці,"" indicating that something caused them to fall off the shelf. An earthquake (Землетрус) is a natural disaster that can cause books to fall off their shelves by shaking or tilting the bookcase. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause for the books falling off the shelf."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I re-switched the circuit breaker) is more likely to restore electricity in your house than option A (I lit a match). This is because the circuit breaker controls the flow of electrical current in your home's electrical system, and flipping it back to the ""on"" position can potentially reset any tripped circuits and restore power. Lighting a match may not have any direct impact on restoring electricity in your home."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""М їхали на гірські гори,"" it is more likely that Option B is correct - ""Це виглядало весело."" The phrase ""їхали на гірські гори"" suggests a trip or journey to the mountains, which could be an enjoyable experience. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker found the situation amusing rather than frightening."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I nailed him in the microwave) is more likely. The idea of a popcorn bag bursting due to being heated in a microwave oven makes more sense than pouring oil into it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (У прогнозі передбачалося сильний вітер) is more likely. The falling tree is likely to have been blown down by strong winds rather than having come into contact with an electrical line.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he offended the public (Option B). The speaker made comments that were considered inappropriate or insensitive, which could have upset or offended some members of the audience. This option better reflects the idea that the speaker's words may have had a negative impact on others.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (На моєм пальці сформувалася крапля крові) is a more likely outcome than option A (З обличчя мене витікала кропля поту). This is because the premise mentions that the person ""inked themselves with a needle,"" which implies that they intentionally punctured their own skin with a sharp object, resulting in blood flowing from their finger. Option A does not provide any evidence to support this conclusion."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the fish was dead (Option B). The phrase ""RIBA PLVAL ON PVERSURFACE AQUARIUM"" suggests that the fish's body was floating on the surface of the aquarium, indicating that it had died. There is no indication in the premise that the fish was hungry or in need of food. Therefore, Option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A: Він був застуджений.  
Explanation: The man's hoarse voice suggests that he has a cold or flu, which can cause vocal cord inflammation and result in a hoarse sounding voice. This is more likely than option B, as there is no evidence to suggest that the man was recently smoking."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ліфт прибув на призначений поверх) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він збрехав своїм батькам) is more likely. The fact that the protagonist was able to leave home without his parents' knowledge or consent suggests that he may have lied to them about his plans or whereabouts. This is supported by the phrase ""вибрався здома,"" which implies a deliberate decision to leave without permission."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Tualet was overfilled. This is because a full toilet bowl would be more noticeable than a broken water heater or a clogged drain. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the bathroom sink is flooded.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vlasnitsa прикріпила щеняка на ошейник) is more likely. The reason being that a dog would not be able to hold onto its owner's hand without any support, especially if it is a small breed like a Shih Tzu. It is more practical for the owner to use an oxygen collar or leash to keep the dog close by.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він стояв під величезними деревами) is more likely. The fact that the man's reflection can be seen in a body of water suggests that he is near or standing over it, rather than above it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I met her at a dinner) is more likely. The fact that she didn't answer his phone call suggests that she may have been busy or not available to talk, but meeting her for dinner implies that they had planned to spend time together in person.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (their dog ran away) is a more plausible explanation for why the family searched their neighbors' homes than Option B (valuables went missing from their own home). The fact that the family searched their neighbors' homes suggests that they are looking for something specific, such as a lost pet, rather than simply investigating a possible burglary at their own home.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Погода була холодна) is more likely as a cause for seeing one's breath when exhaling. When it is cold outside, the air is denser and can make the breath visible to see. On the other hand, having a pressing chest (Option B - У мене була тискна грудь) may not necessarily affect the visibility of one's breath.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (they wanted to improve their working conditions) is a more likely cause for forming a union than option B (their employer raised their wages).
Response:  Option A: Пах гниіння наповнив кухню.
"Response:  Option B: She took off her shoes.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman was trying to walk with all her might, but she couldn't. This suggests that there was some obstacle or difficulty preventing her from walking, such as uncomfortable or restrictive clothing. It is unlikely that high heels would be the cause of this difficulty, so option A is not a plausible answer. On the other hand, taking off one's shoes could potentially make it easier for someone to walk, especially if they are causing discomfort or pain. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option A - Вода кип'є.
Explanation: According to the premise, ""від горщика з водою піднявся пар,"" which means that steam rose from a pot of water. This suggests that the water in the pot was heated enough to produce steam, which is more likely to occur when the water is boiling (Option A). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Я носив сандалі) is the correct answer. The premise states that all of the speaker's socks were in the washing machine, indicating that they were not wearing any socks at the time. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Він втратив підтримку виборців) is more likely. The argument that the politician's policies are absurd suggests that he has lost touch with reality and no longer enjoys broad public support. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as his policies being unpopular or seen as ineffective, or him failing to address pressing issues facing the country. In contrast, option B (Його звинувачують у корупції) does not necessarily imply a loss of popularity, but rather an accusation of wrongdoing or impropriety.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Пара завагітніла) occurred. The premise states that ""Все не схвалювали заручини пари,"" indicating that there was opposition to their engagement. This could lead to feelings of frustration or unhappiness among the couple's loved ones, which may cause them to distance themselves from the pair or even try to break them up. In this scenario, the couple might decide to keep their pregnancy a secret in order to avoid any further conflict or drama with their families. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Мільйонер видав кошти на її будівництво) is more likely. The fact that the building was dedicated to a millionaire suggests that they had some involvement in its construction or funding, rather than simply wanting it destroyed.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (she removed a baked good from the oven) is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дощ лив з великої сильною дощею,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""посилився"" means ""became stronger,"" indicating that the storm has intensified. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Lift stopped working) caused the building to be evacuated. The fact that the lift stopped working suggests a technical failure or malfunction, which could prevent people from accessing the upper floors of the building. In contrast, Option B (Fire alarm went off) does not provide any specific reason why the building was evacuated, and it could potentially be a false alarm or a different issue altogether. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause for the building to be evacuated based on the given information.
"Response:  Option B: батько вигнав сина з дому.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that the father has become fed up with his son's alcoholism, it is more likely that he would have kicked him out of the house rather than buying him beer. This option better reflects the negative emotions associated with a parent dealing with an adult child's addiction."
"Response:  Option B: Ліфт був непрацюючим.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the advocate went up the stairs to his office, indicating that there was no lift available for him to use. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Вона була паралізована в результаті аварії) is the more likely cause for why a woman was placed in an invalid chair. The premise states that she was ""посаджена в інвалідний стілець,"" which implies that she has been rendered immobile or paralyzed due to some accident or injury. This is a more plausible explanation than Option B (Вона потрапила до лікарні на носилках), as it does not provide any contextual clues about the nature of her condition. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Країна стикалася з економічними труднощами. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""громадяни вивішували nationalni prapori biu their buildings,"" indicating a sense of patriotism and pride in one's country. However, the option B choice provides a more plausible explanation for this behavior - that the country was facing economic difficulties rather than celebrating its independence. This is because people may be more likely to express their patriotism when they feel proud of their country's achievements or when they are faced with challenges that require collective effort and solidarity. In contrast, if the country were already independent and had no external threats, there might be less motivation to display national flags."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They nailed their opponents) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Меньі був соромним) is more likely. This is because the use of the word ""соромний"" suggests that the speaker feels embarrassed or ashamed about having food stuck in their teeth, rather than feeling proud or boastful about it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Він уважно слухав у класі) is more likely. The premise states that the boy failed his history test, implying that he did not put enough effort into studying or paying attention in class.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (У місті стався землетрус) is more likely to be the cause of the building collapse than option B (Рівень злочинности у місті збільшився).

Response:  Option A (Він благав її прийняти його назад)
"Response:  Option B: Their heads collided.
Explanation: According to the premise, both children simultaneously reached out to pull the ball. Since they are in close proximity to each other, their heads are likely to collide when trying to reach the same object at the same time. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Покриття було знято з сміттєвого контейнера) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the trash can was emptied. There is no obvious reason why someone would steal cardboard from a dumpster unless they needed to cover something up.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It was cheap) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the reason for the boy's action of putting an olive in his pocket was because it was cheap, rather than being boring or any other reason. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона втратила квитанцію) is more likely. The fact that Касіяр refused to return the sundress suggests that he may have taken it without her permission or lost it after she gave it to him.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Він дивився на Землю) is more likely.

"Response:  Option B: Дитина відклала хліб.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сестра жінки склала руки) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (“Його губи were розщеплені”) is a more plausible explanation for why the man was unhappy with his breath than Option B (“Він turbuared about an unpleasant smell from his mouth”). The fact that his lips were split suggests that he may have bitten them accidentally or in response to discomfort, rather than simply having bad breath.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They predicted movement around the theatre) is more likely. The text states that they went to the show earlier, implying that they had time to predict the traffic situation beforehand.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (her colleague covered for her) is more likely. The reason being that if the woman's boss praised her for not working, it would be unusual and may raise suspicions. However, if a colleague covered for her without her knowledge or consent, it could be seen as a kind gesture to help her avoid work-related stress or consequences.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Він підтримував їхню справу) is more likely. The fact that the man signed a petition in support of the activists suggests that he agrees with their cause and is willing to take action to help them.

"Response:  Option A: У нього була страх сцені.  
Explanation: The premise states that the actor's heart was racing before his performance, indicating anxiety or fear of performing. This suggests that option A, ""У нього була страх сцені,"" is more likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Розгорнула карту) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (He was eaten) occurred. The idea of someone being pulled towards the sun by mature fruit is absurd and impossible, so it is unlikely that they would actually be zapped into oblivion or transformed into a prune-like state. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible outcome given the premise provided.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (“Я inclusion of the ignition”) caused the machine to break down. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will go to a psychiatrist (Option A). The reason for this is that the injury to his spine may be causing him emotional distress or mental health issues, which a psychiatrist can help treat.

"Response:  Option B: У будинку було холодно.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker burned a fire in the stove, indicating that they were inside a warm building. Therefore, option B, ""У будинку було холодно,"" or ""It was cold at home,"" is the more likely cause for burning a fire in the stove."

The premise states that the woman stopped running, which could potentially lead to muscle fatigue or cramping, particularly in the legs.

Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the woman stopped running.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я постукав у двері сусіда"", it is more likely that Option B: Мій сусід виїхав з дому. This is because if my neighbor had invited me in, I would not have needed to knock on the door."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (“Her husband did not understand her concerns”) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the woman’s husband misunderstood her feelings of disappointment, implying that he may not have fully understood or addressed her concerns. This is a more plausible explanation than Option B (“He kissed her goodbye”), as there is no indication in the premise that this was a farewell moment.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Студентправильно відповів на питання) is the correct answer. The premise states that the teacher praised the student, implying that the student gave a correct response to the question. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she went to the supermarket (Option B).

Going to a supermarket would be the most logical place for her to do so."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я зустрів старого друга,"" option A (Я розкрила йомуsecret) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Жінка зловила рибу) is more likely. The premise states that the woman did not want to fall into the lake, indicating that she was trying to avoid danger or harm. It is unlikely that she would be trying to catch a fish in this situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Його парасолька була розбита) is more likely as a cause for the student's wetness than Option B (Велосипед вкрали). The fact that the student is ""мокрий"" suggests that he was exposed to water or rain, which could have been caused by his umbrella breaking during the storm. It is less likely that someone would steal the student's bicycle in this scenario without him noticing."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Користувач натиснув мишкою) caused the cursor to move. This is because when a user clicks their mouse button, the cursor will move in response.

Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause of the cursor movement based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (На головном шосе сталась аварія) is more likely. The driver made a turn, indicating that they were driving on a main road or highway, where an accident would be more likely to occur than if they were walking behind a truck.
"Response:  Option B: Полотна забарвлені (The towels were coloured).
Explanation: The premise states that the wet white cloth was hung up to dry. This implies that it was not a new or unused item, but rather something that had already been used and gotten dirty. Therefore, it is more likely that the towels were coloured from use rather than being barcoded."
"Response:  Option B: Вона викликала таксі.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman put on her sunglasses, indicating that she was outside in bright sunlight. Therefore, option B, where she called a taxi, is the more likely cause as it suggests that she needed to travel somewhere during daytime when the sun is bright."
"Response:  Option B: He thought it was beautiful.
Explanation: The premise states that the man looked at the night sky, indicating that he was in a state of wonder or appreciation. Option B better captures this idea by suggesting that he found the view beautiful, rather than wishing for something else to be true (Option A)."

"Response:  Option B: His hair grew long. 
Explanation: The premise states that the man went to a barber, implying that he wanted his hair cut or styled in some way. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause - his hair grew long because he did not get it cut at the barber."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option B (Хлопчик не подобався новому однокласникові) is correct. The premise states that the boy was building ""злі"" tricks with his new classmate, implying that he did not like or get along with him."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я жадібно побажав склянки молока,"" option A (Я їла печиво) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Почався дощ,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Водієць увімкнув фары,"" will occur. The reason for this is that turning on headlights is a common action taken by drivers when it starts raining to improve visibility on the road."

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I asked to speak with the manager) is more likely. The premise states that the partner was ""відключений,"" which implies a sudden or unexpected disconnection. Asking to speak with the manager suggests a desire to resolve the issue in a more formal manner, rather than simply providing personal information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Вітер продував через відкрите вікно."", option B (Завіса тремтіла) is a more likely outcome than option A (Дверний дзвінок задзвонив). This is because the wind blowing through an open window would cause the curtains to tremble, but it is less likely that a doorbell would ring due to the wind."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (I broke the fuse box) is a more plausible explanation for why there is no electricity in the house than Option A (I turned off the lamp). This is because breaking the fuse box would directly affect the electrical supply to the entire house, rather than just one light fixture.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він згинув м'язи в дзеркалі) is more likely. The premise states that the person ""згинув"" or bent over, indicating that they may have strained their back or muscles while bending down. This is a common injury that can occur when someone bends or twists their body in an unusual position, especially if they are not used to doing so. It is less likely that the person would accidentally lift a weight above their head with enough force to break it, as this would require significant strength and power. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why the person might be experiencing pain after bending down."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Він збентежився) is more likely. The student was trying to make calculations in his head, but he became confused instead of finding a solution. This suggests that he may have been overwhelmed or frustrated by the task, leading him to become benumbed or disoriented.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I felt energized) is more likely as it aligns with the idea of exercising and feeling invigorated.

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Курорт був на острові) is more likely. The word ""курорт"" in Ukrainian means a resort or spa, and it's commonly associated with beaches or other coastal areas.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she wanted to rebel) is a more likely cause for getting a tattoo as a teenager than option A (she was afraid of needles).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Я сталпідозрілим"" (I became suspicious). The reason for this is that the presence of an unfamiliar machine near one's home can indeed arouse suspicion or curiosity in a person, leading them to investigate further or take precautions."

"Response:  Option B: He avoided caffeine.
Explanation: The premise states that this man decided to lose weight, but it doesn't mention anything about giving up sweets or sugar. It only mentions avoiding caffeine, which could potentially help with weight loss by reducing calorie intake from beverages.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Вона хотіла піти з вечірки) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why she might be wearing inappropriate clothing - to leave the party quickly without drawing attention to herself.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""I came out of my room through the window,"" option A (the house was on fire) is a more likely cause than option B (the house was empty). This is because coming out of a room through a window suggests that there may be an emergency situation, such as a fire, rather than simply leaving the house for any other reason."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він довго прийняв душ) is more likely. The fact that the boy's fingers were cut off suggests a traumatic event or injury, which could lead to long-term psychological distress rather than simply covering his hands in soap.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Молоко було кислим на смак) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker spat out milk than option B (У мене було сухо в роті). The taste of sour milk would be an unpleasant sensation that could prompt someone to spit it out, while dry mouth can have many other causes such as dehydration or certain medications. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option B (Я запізнився на роботу) occurred. The premise states that the speaker missed the bus, which suggests that they were not at their destination when the bus arrived.

The fact that his parents locked him in suggests that they did not want him to leave the house, so it makes sense that he would try to find a way out through a different means rather than going through the front door. Climbing through an open window would be a quicker and less noticeable option compared to climbing onto the roof and entering through a window there.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Жінка загленула через ключі в двері) is more likely. The fact that she ""заглянула"" through the keys suggests a deliberate action, rather than simply knocking or being startled by an unexpected visitor."

Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Холодний струм проник через вікно,"" Option B (Я tremtiла) is a more likely response. The cold current entering through the window would cause the person to shiver or tremble."
"Response:  Option A (Her classmates respected her)
Explanation: According to the premise, the student received a scholarship for college, indicating that she must have demonstrated academic excellence or potential. Therefore, option B (She had good grades) is less likely as it does not provide any insight into why she received the scholarship.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (в повітрі з'явилися феєрверки) is more likely than Option B (Фрісбі піднявся до моєї голови). This is because the appearance of fireworks in mid-air is a more extraordinary and unlikely occurrence compared to a frisbee flying up to someone's head, which could potentially happen through natural causes or human intervention.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дівчина гризла нігті,"" Option A (Вона хвилювалася) is a more likely cause than Option B (Вона була здивована). This is because the word ""gryzla"" in Ukrainian means to bite or chew with the teeth, which implies that the girl was engaging in an action that could potentially be causing discomfort or irritation to her nails. Therefore, it is more likely that she was feeling uncomfortable or anxious about this situation rather than being surprised by it."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They were ripe) is more likely. The premise states that the author gathered peaches from a grapevine, implying that they were already ripe and ready to be picked. It does not mention anything about the author polishing them, which suggests that they were already in their mature state when collected. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: He bought his girlfriend chocolates.

The act of buying chocolates suggests a desire to show affection or appreciation, which aligns better with the idea of being romantic."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Я впав термометр) is the correct answer. The temperature of the thermometer has increased due to contact with a hot object, rather than changes in weather conditions.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the roof of the building sued was damaged (Option A). The sentence ""Дах будівлі суду підірвав"" implies that there has been significant damage to the roof of the building, which is consistent with a tornado passing through the city. On the other hand, while Option B mentions that the path became dangerous due to frost, this does not necessarily imply any structural damage to buildings or infrastructure. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (his grades improved) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я почуavalсь комфортно"", option A is more likely. The word ""почуavalсь"" means to feel comfortable or at ease, so it's unlikely that the speaker would fall onto their knees ( Option B) or burrow themselves into a blanket (Option B). Therefore, option A is the best answer."

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the coffee will smell strongly (Option A). When you add sugar to coffee, it can give off a strong, sweet aroma.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Клинзанурився у дерево) is more likely. The word ""клин"" in Russian means a small nail or rivet, so it's unlikely that it would be used to describe something that has become stuck in a tree. Option B (""Гвоздь заржавился"") also doesn't make much sense in this context, as ""гвоздик"" is a type of fastener commonly used for attaching things to wood, but it wouldn't become rusted or frozen in place without any explanation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Риба вкусила лінію"", option B is more likely. The premise suggests that the fish bit the line, indicating that it was actively engaging with the hook. Therefore, option B, where the fisherman reels in the line, is a more plausible outcome than option A, where the fisherman pulls the fish towards him."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (she has freckles) is the correct answer. The premise mentions that the protagonist is ""сором'язливо ходила до школи,"" which suggests that she may be self-conscious or embarrassed about something related to her appearance. Freckles are a common physical trait that can make people feel self-conscious or embarrassed, so it is possible that this is what the author meant by ""вугрів."" Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Option A: Я отримав гарні новини.
"Response:  Option A: Порушник был мокрым. (The towel was wet.)
Explanation: The premise states that ""Я вытер руки рушником"" (I wiped my hands with a towel), indicating that the speaker used a towel to clean their hands.

"Response:  Option A - Stool under him was swaying.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man lost his balance on the chair, indicating that he was sitting on it. Therefore, option A is more likely as the stool under him was swaying due to his loss of balance. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no reason for him to have spilled paint on the chair."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (They lost their game) is the more likely cause of the situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я schooluv proshcheniya) is more likely. This is because the word ""proshcheniye"" means ""apology,"" which implies that the speaker made a mistake or wronged someone and is now asking for forgiveness. Option B (""Я дошел своей цели"") means ""I reached my goal,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He asked her questions about herself) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that her cheeks will turn red (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Вражеский корабель вибухнул"", option A (He flew over a shaft) is the most likely cause. The word ""вибухнул"" in Russian means ""exploded"", indicating that the ship was destroyed or damaged by an explosion. As there is no mention of the ship entering water, option B (He sank into the sea) is less likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Вінзаннурився в лужу) is the most likely cause of the man's injury. The premise suggests that he was walking when he suddenly fell into a puddle or muddy water, causing him to injure his leg. This is a common occurrence that can happen unexpectedly, making Option A the most plausible choice.
"Response:  Option A (They found a suspect's fingerprints at the crime scene)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the detectives found a suspect's fingerprints at the crime scene rather than finding a weapon. The presence of a suspect's fingerprints suggests that the perpetrator was known to the police or had been in contact with someone who can identify them. This information could lead to identifying the killer and solving the case."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I asked you to pick me up) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Many people were unemployed. 
Explanation: The premise states that the economy of the country has declined, indicating a decrease in economic activity and potential job losses. Therefore, option B, many people were unemployed, is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (They were gathered to fall into the opposite transport) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the swallow was ""охороня на переході"" (guarding at the crossing), indicating that it was protecting something or someone at the intersection. Given that the children were nearby and could potentially be in danger of falling into the opposite transport, it is more likely that the swallow was guarding them rather than recognizing them from afar."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He said something true) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Водівець застряг на дорожі) is more likely. The fact that the driver ran out of gas suggests that they were driving for an extended period of time and may have been unaware of their low fuel level until it was too late. It is less likely that the driver would have stopped to pick up a hitchhiker if they had just run out of gas.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A: дитина народилась (the baby was born).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (На вулиці була вітром) is more likely to be the cause of the hat's flight. The wind could have blown the hat away from the man's head. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона отримала запрошення) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (his mother took him to the park) is more likely. The fact that he felt a hot temperature on his lobe suggests that he may have had a fever or other medical issue, which would be treated by taking him to see a doctor or going to a hospital. Taking him to the park does not seem directly related to this symptom.
Response:  Option A (He wanted to impress his girlfriend).
"Response:  Option B: Я брав лопату.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""У будинку відключили електрику,"" it's more likely that the speaker took a shovel (lopaata) to dig out the electrical box or switchboard in order to restore power to their home. This action makes more sense given the situation than searching for a flashlight (lyhkariik)."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (son finished middle school) is true. There is no mention of twins or multiple births in the premise, so this option is less likely to be true. Therefore, we should choose Option A as the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She saw the finish line) is more likely. The premise states that the marathon runner was moving slowly, indicating that she may have been conserving her energy for the final stretch of the race. This aligns with option B, as a runner would want to conserve their energy for the end of the race when they are close to finishing. Option A does not make sense in this context, as there is no indication that the runner wanted to save her energy for any particular reason.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Машина виплюнула гроші) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation described in the premise. The idea that a machine would vomit money or that a package of chips could get stuck is less plausible than the notion that a coin toss resulted in the car spitting out money. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Я перевернув на нього очі) is the correct answer. The phrase ""мого друга"" suggests a close relationship between the speaker and their friend, and the fact that the dog has died implies that the speaker may have been emotionally affected by its passing. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker would turn to their friend for comfort rather than hugging them."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he wrote a debt letter (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Він підстриг нігті) is more likely. The phrase ""проклятий"" suggests that something negative has happened to him, and cutting his fingernails may be a way of coping with this situation or trying to make himself feel better. It's less likely that he would accidentally stick his finger in a hole while working on something else."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his brother got into a fight with their parents) is more likely. The passage states that the man was ""proud of his brother,"" implying that they have a close relationship. It also mentions that the brother has been ""in trouble"" with their parents, suggesting that there may be tension in their family dynamics. These details suggest that it is more likely that the brother got into a fight with their parents rather than being accepted to law school."
"Response: 🔵 Option B: Вона подивися на зірки.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that the girl wanted to learn about the solar system, it is more likely that she would look at the stars rather than go to a library. The stars are visible in the night sky and can be seen from any location, making it easier for her to observe them. In contrast, going to a library requires physical access to books and resources, which may not be readily available or convenient for everyone. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice given the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Я розмістив плакат над doisries.) occurred. This is because the phrase ""над duasriсами"" specifically refers to placing something above a doorway or entrance, which suggests that the poster was hung vertically and not horizontally like with Option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Archi... (read more)

Question: What is the likelihood of Option A (Architect built the building)?

Answer: Based on the premise, option A (Architect built the building) is the most likely outcome. The client approved the architect's plans for the building, indicating that they were satisfied with them and gave their consent to proceed with construction. Therefore, it is more likely that the architect actually built the building rather than changing the plans."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (He obliterated the spoon) is a more plausible explanation for why the man fell off the table than Option A (His hand was trembling). This is because there is no logical connection between the man's hand shaking and him falling off the table. However, if he had struck or knocked over the spoon with force while trying to get up from it, it could potentially cause him to lose his balance and fall off the table.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Рада директорів знайшла його заміну) is more likely. The fact that the general director resigned suggests that there may be a need for a new leader to take over the company, rather than simply disbanding it entirely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that you sat in the back row (Option A). This is because being late often leads to a rush to find a seat, and sitting in the back row may be a quicker option than making your way to the front of the room.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He attacked his colleague) is more likely. The fact that he was released from prison suggests that he served time for a crime, and attacking a colleague would be an unusual act for someone who has just been released from prison. Option A (His family paid the fine) does not align with this information as it implies that he was released due to financial reasons rather than criminal behavior.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their house caught fire (Option B). The family lost all of their belongings, indicating a sudden and unexpected event such as a fire. Selling one's home (Option A) would not result in the loss of all possessions.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the aluminum can was stepped on (Option A). The reason for this is that an aluminum can is a relatively soft material compared to other objects in a kitchen, such as food or dishes. Therefore, if someone were to step on it with their foot, there would be a higher likelihood of denting or crushing the can than breaking it into pieces (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She learned to communicate) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: I washed dishes. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""my mood improved,"" which suggests that something positive happened to improve one's emotional state. Washing dishes can be a relaxing activity, and it is more likely that option B (washed dishes) than option A (listened to music) as the cause of the improvement in mood."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they conducted an auction (Option B). The phrase ""і зібрали гроші"" implies a financial transaction, and an auction would be a common way to raise money for charity."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Пасажири кричали) is more likely. The phrase ""Вершина зійшла з кругого схилу"" implies a sudden and unexpected event, which could cause panic or alarm among passengers. Therefore, it is more likely that they would cry out in surprise rather than smile."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я был расстроен,"" it is more likely that option A is correct - ""Я перевірила поштову скриньку, коли виходила з дому."" This is because the verb ""быть"" in Russian can have a range of meanings depending on context, but one common meaning is to be upset or annoyed (as in this case). Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would check their mailbox when they were leaving the house, as they may have been feeling anxious about something related to their correspondence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ві рано встав) is more likely. The man wanted to see the sunrise from the east, so he got up early in the morning to do so. Option A (Він поїхав на північ) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of him traveling north.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я склав папір,"" option A (Я переробляв папір) is a more likely outcome than option B (Папір зморщився). This is because the act of folding paper would involve manipulating it in some way, rather than causing it to change shape or form spontaneously without any external influence."
"Response:  Option B: лідери інших країн відправили допомогу.  
Explanation: Given that the nation has experienced a natural catastrophe, it is more likely that other countries will send aid rather than forming a union to address the issue. This option aligns with the idea of international cooperation in times of crisis."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він вибрався з басейну) is more likely. The fact that the boy's diaper was soaked suggests that he had been in the bathtub for some time before getting out, rather than falling into the bathtub accidentally.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вім мав бути повернуний до бібліотеки) is more likely. The student rushing to finish a book suggests that he wants to read it quickly, which implies that he intends to return it to the library once he's done. It's less likely that he would borrow the book from a friend without proper authorization or permission from the library.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he was sentenced to death) is a more likely cause than option A (he was thrown in jail). The premise states that the criminal was executed, indicating that he received the most severe punishment possible under the law. It is unlikely that someone would be thrown in jail without being convicted or receiving any punishment at all. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I opened the shutters) is more likely as it provides a direct explanation for how the sun entered the room. Opening the shutters would allow natural light to enter the room through the windows, whereas opening the door would not have this effect. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Her wig came off) is more likely.
Response:  Option B: He considered the text unclear.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She realized that the card's term of use had expired) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They got married) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I composed my own song) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker has taken action to create their own music rather than simply adjusting the volume of existing music.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Дівчина її зіпсувала) occurred. The phrase ""висувалися волосся"" suggests that the boy's hair was standing up or sticking out in an unusual way, which could be caused by a girl teasing him or pulling his hair. This is a common playful behavior among children, and it is more likely that a girl would do this than to simply pull his hair without any provocation."
"Response:  Option B: Я наступив на жука.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Бурака розчавлювали"", it is more likely that the speaker stepped on a cockroach rather than repressing themselves from swatting at flies. The word ""бурака"" specifically refers to a cockroach in Ukrainian, so this option better fits the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я відкрила очі"", option A (Я прокинувся) is a more likely cause than option B (Я розслаблився). This is because the phrase ""відкрила очі"" implies that something sudden or unexpected happened to the speaker, which could be interpreted as a violent or jarring movement like waking up from a nap or being startled awake. In contrast, ""розслаibliся"" means to relax or unwind, which doesn't necessarily imply a sudden change in state."
"Response:  Option B: Я попросивпозичити у нього компакт-диска. 
Explanation: The premise states that the music was ""дуже гуча"" (very loud), indicating that it was disruptive or disturbing to the speaker's peace. Given this context, it is more likely that the speaker would ask their neighbor to lend them a compact disc rather than requesting them to turn down the volume."
Response:  Option B: He earned less than minimum wage.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Він шукав роботу) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Фарба стала зеленою.
Explanation: The premise states that the artist mixed yellow paint with blue paint, resulting in green paint. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Мені вже не була про що поговорити) is more likely. The speaker changed the topic of conversation without any indication that the discussion became strained or tense.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Я вітав його вдома) is the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker's brother has been released from the hospital, indicating that he may be in a better state of health and therefore more likely to receive a warm welcome from his sibling.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Завіса на сцені підняся,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Почався початкова сцена п'єси,"" is correct."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Похитель погрожував нашкодити заручнику) is more likely. The fact that Поhöтель left the hostage alone suggests that he may have had other motivations for taking her in the first place, such as ransom or revenge. It's less likely that he would simply let her go without any conditions or consequences.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (музикант стукнув по барабану) is more likely because it aligns with the given information that the musician hit something on stage.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Дитина прокинулась кричачи від кошмару) is more likely. The fact that parents rushed to her room suggests that something was wrong or unusual, and it's more plausible that she had a nightmare than she was afraid of looking under her bed.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option B (she was born deaf) is the correct answer. The fact that she communicated through signs suggests that she may have been unable to hear or speak, which would be consistent with being born deaf.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Positions have died) is more likely to occur as a result of drought in an agricultural region. Drought can cause crops to wither and die, leading to significant losses for farmers. Water pollution or contamination may also occur due to drought, but it is less directly related to the initial event of drought in this context. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Кіт погнався за птахом,"" it is more likely that Option A: Пташка polethia (Пташка полетіла) will occur. The cat chasing after a bird implies that the bird has flown away, rather than being caught by the cat."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Школа закінчилася на літо) is more likely as a cause for the change in school. The statement implies that the girl has finished her school year, indicating that it's summer time. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option B: Spsrtakers began to strike. 
Explanation: The premise states that the owners of the factory refused to increase workers' wages, indicating a lack of concern for their employees' well-being. In response, the workers may choose to take collective action such as striking in order to pressure the management into improving their working conditions. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ekstrimists inbuted him) is more likely. The premise states that the leader ""disappointed"" extremists in his country, implying that they had high expectations for him that he failed to meet. This could lead them to resort to violent measures against him."
"Response:  Option B: Хвилі обрушилися на берег.
Explanation: The premise states that ""Я ходив босими по пляжу,"" indicating that the speaker was walking barefoot on the beach. This implies that the ground under their feet is soft and sandy, which could be easily eroded by waves. Therefore, option B - ""Хвилі обрушилися на берег"" (Waves crashed onto the shore) is a more likely outcome than option A - ""Пісок застряг у моїх ногах"" (Sand got stuck in my feet), as it better fits with the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option B (I drank a glass of water) caused the feeling of coldness than option A (I put on my pajamas). This is because drinking water can cause an immediate cooling sensation on the body, especially in warm weather or when someone is already feeling hot. On the other hand, putting on pajamas may not have any direct impact on one's temperature.
"Response:  Option B: Her son cried out. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Maty forced her son to be quiet, implying that he was making too much noise. Therefore, option B, ""Her son cried out,"" is the most likely cause as it suggests that he reacted by expressing his discomfort or frustration at being told to be quiet."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I fastened my dungarees) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that there was a hole in the speaker's dungarees, implying that they were wearing them at the time of the incident. This suggests that the speaker may have accidentally fastened their dungarees incorrectly or overlooked a button, leading to the hole forming. In contrast, Option B (I bumped into a lamp post) does not provide any information about the speaker's clothing or the circumstances surrounding the incident, making it less likely as an explanation for the hole in their dungarees.
Response:  Option B: His teeth became straight.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Сьогодні я прокинуся з болю в горлі) is more likely. The premise states that you ""вправився"" in a trenaжерний зал yesterday, which implies that you performed some form of exercise or physical activity. This could potentially lead to muscle soreness or discomfort, especially if you are new to working out or have pushed yourself too hard. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The other students who were sitting at the table may have felt excluded or left out because of the girl's whispering, leading to a negative impact on their social interactions and overall experience.
"Response:  Option A - Вона знову піднялась у повітюре.
Explanation: The premise states that the child fell onto a trampoline, indicating that she was already in contact with the ground when the situation occurred. Therefore, it is less likely that she would suddenly rise into the air again without any external force being applied to her. Option A better reflects this scenario by suggesting that she got back up into the air after falling onto the trampoline."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Posta delivered the letter) is more likely. The premise states that the letter was placed in a mailbox, which suggests that it was sent through the postal service. Therefore, it is more likely that the letter was delivered by Posta rather than being expedited or moved faster.
Response:  Option A - He became confident.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вітер став сильнішим) is more likely to be the cause of the spreading forest fire. The sentence suggests that the wind has become stronger, which could potentially fan the flames and spread the fire further. Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise than Option B (Підпальників заарештували), which does not provide any logical explanation for how the fire might have spread.
"Response:  Option B: His mother put a bandage on his knee. 
Explanation: The premise states that the child was hit by a train, which suggests that he may have suffered serious injuries, including a broken leg or arm. It is unlikely that his mother would send him to his room after such an incident without providing any medical attention. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A - He signed his will.
Explanation: The premise states that the man has died from a fatal illness, indicating that he is no longer alive to sign a will. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause as it implies that the man had already passed away before signing his will."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I obgarov my tongue) is more likely. The premise states that you drank a gulp of hot coffee, which can cause discomfort or pain in one's mouth, including burning sensations on the tongue. Obgariation, or biting or chewing on one's own tongue, may be a coping mechanism to alleviate this discomfort. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise.
"Response:  Option A: У своїх оповіданнях письменниця уникала упереджености. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the editor released the writer from his duties, suggesting that there was a problem with the writer's work. The fact that the writer avoided bias in her stories suggests that she may have been too lenient or accommodating towards certain groups or perspectives, leading to criticism or backlash. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я спала цілий день) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns better with the emotional state described in the premise. The sentence suggests that the speaker felt tired, which is consistent with sleeping for a long time. In contrast, learning can also make someone feel exhausted, but it may not necessarily lead to feeling asleep for an entire day. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given information.
"Response:  Option A - Вона визначила симптоми хворої. 
Explanation: The premise states that the doctor gave a diagnosis to the patient, indicating that she identified or recognized symptoms in the patient. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я підряпив свою шкіру,"" option A is more likely. The word ""потовидный"" (potovidnyi) means ""itchy."" Therefore, the correct answer is: Option A: Він був потовидний."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (he suffered a heart attack) is more likely. The premise states that he underwent an operation, which could potentially have caused complications such as a heart attack. This is a more plausible explanation than him losing his self-confidence, which is not directly related to the surgery.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Він вигнув руки) is a more plausible explanation for why the muscles of a person's hands have swollen up. This is because ""вивихнутися"" in Ukrainian means to bend or twist something beyond its normal position, which could potentially cause injury or discomfort to the muscles in the hand. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's hands have been forced into an unnatural position, causing them to swell up, rather than being inserted into their bodies through any other means."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він був здивований) is more likely. The fact that he raised his eyebrows suggests surprise or disbelief, rather than disappointment.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я вірила, що його наміри були добрими) is more likely. The speaker assumes that their colleague's intentions were good, rather than believing that they know better. This suggests a more optimistic outlook on the situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he began to wake up earlier. 
Explanation: The man's decision to quit smoking does not necessarily lead to him beginning to exercise more or rise earlier in the morning. While quitting smoking may have some health benefits, there is no direct correlation between this action and increased physical activity or an earlier wake-up time. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Нападник почав кровоточити.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman hit the attacker in the nose, which can cause bleeding. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Чоловік не мав правильної мети) is more likely. The premise states that the arrow missed its target, implying that the man did not have a correct aim or intention. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the arrow missed its target.
"Response:  Option B: У його кімнати була мурашкарня.  
Explanation: The premise states that the owner of the house asked for an exterminator to come to his home, indicating that there was a problem with pests in the house. Option B suggests that there were muroids (a type of ant) in the owner's room, which is a common pest problem. Therefore, this option is more likely than Option A, where the presence of squirrels in the basement would not necessarily require an exterminator."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я был занадто втомленным, щоб чтось приготувати) is more likely. The host was too tired to prepare a meal for their guest, indicating that they were exhausted or fatigued. This is supported by the phrase ""занадто втомленним,"" which emphasizes the extent of their exhaustion."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона почала приховувати щоденник) is more likely. The fact that she caught her brother reading her diary suggests that she values her privacy and personal space, so it's likely that she would take steps to protect her diary from being read again in the future.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона працювала надчасно) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Він торкнувся гарячої плитки) is the more likely cause of the child's hand quickly retreating. This is because touching a hot plate with one's bare hand can cause immediate pain and withdrawal of the hand. On the other hand, petting a fluffy animal like a puppy may not necessarily result in such an immediate response. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (they distributed surveys among clients) is more likely to be effective in measuring customer satisfaction. By collecting feedback through a survey, the company can gather more detailed information about their customers' experiences and opinions, providing valuable insights into how well they are meeting their needs and expectations. In contrast, offering a discount to new clients may not provide as much insight into overall customer satisfaction, as it only affects those who have never done business with the company before.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Хлопчик кинув подушки з дивана) caused the damage to the wooden floor. This is because throwing pillows from a sofa can potentially scratch or scuff the surface of the wood floor. On the other hand, Option B (Хлопчик перетягнув стілець по підлозі) may not have caused as much damage to the floor, as pulling a chair across the floor might not leave as noticeable marks.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я прикривав своє обличчя,"" option A (Мій ворог насміхався мені) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (блискавка) is more likely to be the cause of the statue's destruction than Option B (люди приходять, щоб поклонятися йому). The phrase ""згоріла знаменита статуя"" suggests that the statue was destroyed by fire, which could have been caused by a lightning strike. While it is possible that people may have gathered around the statue after its destruction, the initial cause of the damage is more likely to be a natural event such as a lightning strike rather than human activity."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я залишил фрукты на столе,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Плод выливает семена,"" will occur. This is because the word ""фрукты"" (fruits) in the premise suggests a fruit has been left on the table, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that seeds from that fruit may be scattered or dropped somewhere. In contrast, Option B, ""Мухи направили плоды,"" does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of any insects being present near the fruit."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Вона викрутила лодыжку) is more likely as it provides a clearer explanation for how the ballerina broke the connection. The other option (Вона вказувала пальцями ног) does not provide any logical reasoning to explain why the ballerina would break the connection in this scenario. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Він навчився них зв'язувати) is a more likely explanation for why Schnurki dipped in water. As the premise states that Schnurki ""dipped"" or ""fell into"" water, it implies that he was not able to swim or float, but rather sank due to his size. Therefore, it is more likely that he learned how to tie knots so that he could float better in the water. Option B (Вінбігав по ігровому майданчику) does not provide any logical explanation for why Schnurki would learn how to tie knots."
"Response:  Option B: Я втратив уявлення про час.  
Explanation: The premise states that the book was so captivating that it made her lose track of time. This suggests that she became completely absorbed in the story and lost awareness of the passage of time, which is option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (На него вплинули батьки) is more likely. The man's belief in what his parents believed suggests that he was influenced by them, rather than the other way around.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the car ran out of gas) is the reason for the car's slowing down and eventual stop. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Option B: Смарожене капе з конуса.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man ate ice cream in the sun, which means he was outside in direct sunlight. This increases the likelihood of him getting a sunburn, rather than losing his sense of taste due to eating something cold. Additionally, the phrase ""смарожене капе"" (smoked cap) suggests that the burn is severe enough to cause blisters or sores on the skin, further supporting option B."
"Response:  Option B: Стіни виглядали голими.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Я повісив картини в кімнаті,"" it is more likely that the walls were bare or had no wallpaper, rather than having a dirty carpet."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У меня болила голова) is more likely as a cause for leaving work early. The mention of a headache suggests a physical discomfort that may have made it difficult to continue working. While Option B (Мій босс провів зустріч) could also be a reason for leaving work early, there is no explicit indication in the premise to suggest this as a possible cause. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Vlasnitsa presented a treat to the puppy) is more likely. The reason for this is that the premise states that the puppy was ""забруднявшим"" (lit. ""soiling"") the carpet, implying that it had made a mess. In response, the owner presents the puppy with a treat as a way of rewarding good behavior or to distract from any negative actions. Option A (""Owner scolded the puppy"") does not align with this interpretation, as there would be no need to scold the puppy if it had already made a mess."
"Response:  Option A (Мій друг пробаїв мене).
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker apologized to their friend, indicating that they want to make amends and repair their relationship. This suggests that their friend will forgive them and accept their apology, making option A the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Він нести рюкзак) is more likely to be the reason why he stood out among the crowd. The fact that he had a backpack suggests that he may have been traveling or on a mission, which could explain why he caught the attention of the people around him. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he was accused of perjury (Option B). The fact that the witness lied under oath suggests that there may be consequences for his actions, such as being charged with perjury.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона хотіла нового вигляду) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: They were deported.
Explanation: The premise states that immigrants were caught while unauthorized in the country, indicating that they are in violation of the law. Therefore, it is more likely that they would be deported rather than finding work legally."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Публіка встала) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Сonsole garnered my skin. 
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker looked at the sun, which can cause temporary blindness or discomfort due to looking directly at a bright light source. However, the option B choice suggests that the sun's heat or radiation has actually damaged the speaker's skin, making it more likely that they were exposed to harmful levels of solar energy."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Мені було нудно,"" Option A is the most likely answer. The word ""знурився"" (znurysya) means to feel bored or tired, so the correct answer is ""Я занурив."""
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (стейк був сирий) is more likely to be the cause of difficulty in cutting it with a knife.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (she accumulated a large debt) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Я цікавився, чи він вийшов) occurred. The fact that the light in his friend's apartment was turned on suggests that someone might have been there, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that the speaker checked if their friend was home before deciding what to do next. Option B (Я вирішив відвідатинього) does not fit with this scenario as it implies that the speaker decided to visit their friend without first checking if they were present in their apartment.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я поклала квітку під нос,"" option A is more likely. The word ""зліг"" (zlіg) in Ukrainian means ""fell off"", so it's unlikely that the petals of a flower would fall off just because someone placed it under their nose. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона зустріла друга дитинства) is more likely. The premise mentions ""nostadgium,"" which can be translated to nostalgia in English. This suggests that the woman has a strong emotional response related to her past or childhood memories. Therefore, it is more likely that she will meet an old friend from her childhood rather than express anger towards her children."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Він подав заяву раніше) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Я подзвонив механіку.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Моя машина зламалась"", it's more likely that the speaker will call a mechanic rather than going to a shopping center."
Response:  Option A - Це була анонімно.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Пташка тріщила крилами"", it is more likely that she has laid eggs (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Гараж був відкритий) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Жертва підняла руки) is more likely to occur. The fact that the perpetrator aimed a gun at their victim suggests that they intended to harm or kill them, so it's unlikely that the victim would be able to suddenly raise their hands in a way that deflects the bullet.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я з нетерпінням чекав вихідних) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker has been waiting impatiently for their days off work or vacation. This aligns with the context of a funeral or death, where family members may need time to grieve and attend to personal matters without work-related responsibilities. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible choice given the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я мрівав) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker lost track of time, which could be due to daydreaming or being absorbed in one's thoughts. This suggests that the speaker was not feeling bored or uninterested in their surroundings, but rather lost focus due to internal distraction. Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the printer ran out of ink) than option B (the paper ran out). This is because the document was printed without being read, indicating that there may have been an issue with the printing process rather than the paper supply.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Фанати кинулися на pole) is more likely. The national anthem being played at a stadium suggests that there is an event or competition taking place, and fans may be excited and eager to show their support by rushing onto the field.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (I gave him a sour taste) is correct. The reason for this is that the phrase ""на смак занурення"" means ""a sour taste in his mouth,"" which suggests that something acidic or bitter was given to the person. Adding salt to someone's food would not typically result in a sour taste, so option B is less likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (“From the spill remained a sticky impression”) is more likely to occur. The wording of the premise suggests that the paper towel absorbed the liquid, leaving behind an impression or stain rather than being consumed by it. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A (Вона помітила її сторінку).
Explanation: The premise states that the woman was reading a book when she was interrupted. It's unlikely that she would have re-read the entire book from the beginning after being interrupted, especially if it was just a short interruption. Therefore, option A is more likely, as she would have noticed where she left off in the book."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Чоловік затягнув ремінь безпеки) is more likely. The fact that the plane has entered turbulence suggests that it may be experiencing unexpected movements or changes in altitude, which could make it difficult for a passenger to safely reach their seatbelt. It is less likely that the passenger would be able to see something outside the window during this time without putting themselves at risk of injury.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Дівчина його ігнорувала) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the premise states that the boy ""зачепився,"" which implies that he has done something wrong or annoying, but does not provide any indication of physical violence or aggression from the girl towards him. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl simply ignored him rather than physically retaliating against him."
"Response:  Option A - She was given a prosthetic limb.  
Explanation: The premise states that doctors gave the patient a prosthetic limb, indicating that they amputated her natural leg. This is supported by the fact that a prosthetic limb is an artificial replacement for a missing body part. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона піднісла плечим до нього) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я ціную його думку) is more likely. The speaker values their friend's opinion and seeks their approval, indicating that they value their friendship and respect their judgment. Option B (Я знав, що маю рацію) suggests a sense of confidence or entitlement, which may not align with the tone of the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the boy stepped in mud (Option A). The phrase ""бруд застряг у його взуттях"" means ""mud got stuck in his shoes,"" indicating that the boy's feet got covered in mud while he was walking. This is a common occurrence when playing outside or exploring nature, especially during rainy seasons. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Люди ховалися під землею.
Explanation: The premise states that there was a significant amount of snowfall in the city, which suggests that the weather conditions were harsh enough to warrant people seeking shelter. Hiding underground would be a logical response to such weather conditions, as it provides protection from the cold and potential danger posed by the heavy snowfall. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He threatened to quit his job) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Дерево впало на дах) is the more likely cause of damage to a house. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I threw a axe at the tree) is more likely to have caused the tree to split in two.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Пара оголосила, що вони розлучаться) is more likely. The family gathering to celebrate a new addition to the family suggests that the couple has recently had a baby or adopted a child, rather than announcing their divorce.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Вона його любила) is more likely. The fact that she sent him a valentine's day card suggests that she has romantic feelings for him, rather than simply wanting to kiss him.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я была збентежена) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (they wanted to take a fair decision) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (чоловік розвантажив продукцію в холодильник) will occur as a result of the timer on the kitchen burning out. This is because the man may need to cool down the food in the refrigerator after it has been cooked or warmed up.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She worked very hard) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that she put in a lot of effort to achieve her goals, which could have led to burnout or exhaustion. Option A (She relaxed) does not provide any information about how much effort she put into achieving her goals, so it cannot be inferred whether she worked hard or not.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (his son inherited his property) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пожежі згасли) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (her driver's license was annulled) is the more likely cause of why a woman's car was in the mechanic's shop. This option suggests that there may have been an issue with her driving privileges rather than an accident or other external event.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that you overslept (Option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Камери микали в його напрямку) is more likely to be true. The public figure has just stepped out of a limousine, suggesting that they are in a high-profile setting where media attention is likely. Therefore, it is more probable that cameras will be directed towards them rather than their family visiting a press conference.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вода в ванні стала теплою) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He specialized in engineering) is more likely.  Why? Because the student's interest in meeting other students in the campus suggests that he values social interaction and networking, which may lead him to choose a field of study with more opportunities for collaboration and teamwork - such as engineering.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я шукав трохи) is a more likely cause for why I raised the pillows than option B (Я переобладувала вітальню). This is because raising the pillows does not necessarily involve rearranging the entire living room, but rather adjusting them to one's liking while sitting or sleeping.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Оса poletila до хлопчика,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Хлопчик втік,"" will occur. This is because the word ""poletila"" means ""flew"" or ""flitted,"" indicating a sudden and quick movement, which suggests that the bee may have chased after the boy in pursuit of him fleeing. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (her being sentenced to death) is more likely. The text states that she was found guilty of a serious offense, implying that the punishment could be severe. Additionally, in many societies, crimes such as murder or treason are punishable by death, making this outcome more plausible than a sentence of community service.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Цукор розчиняється) is more likely. When you mix sugar with hot tea, it will dissolve into the liquid, rather than evaporating or becoming infused with the flavor of the tea. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A: He was called to war. 
Explanation: The premise states that the veteran is culturally awkward, implying that he may have had difficulty adjusting to civilian life after serving in the military. Being called to war could be a reason for this, as it would involve him leaving his old life behind and adapting to a new environment with different social norms and expectations. In contrast, being wounded in battle might not necessarily lead to cultural awkwardness, as some soldiers who were injured in combat can still navigate civilian life relatively easily. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the veteran's cultural awkwardness."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Поліція погналися за злочинцем) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ноутбук не incluyлся"", it is more likely that Option A - ""Я ее впала"" (I dropped it) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вона придбала великий гардероб) is more likely. The premise states that the woman's place in her closet has ended, suggesting that she needs more space for her clothes. Buying a large wardrobe would provide her with additional storage space, making it the most logical choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (his wife left him) is more likely to be the cause of his broken heart.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (His proposal for work was cancelled) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Він привітав глядачів) is more likely. The man's voice was clearly audible to the entire audience, indicating that he greeted them rather than speaking into a microphone.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Монета znanula на дно) is more likely to occur. The probability of a coin sinking to the bottom of a fountain filled with water is higher than it breaking into two parts upon impact.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Гравця б'є м'яч у діру"", option B is more likely. The mnemonic device helps to remember this by thinking of the word ""return""."
Response:  Option A - Я выхлюкав.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A - ""Клієнт використовував підроблені гроші"" - is the correct answer. The fact that the client's phone number was found in the store's system suggests that they made a purchase using legitimate funds, rather than attempting to use counterfeit money."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (З-за сміття кухня пахла поганим запахом) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is describing a specific situation where the smell of trash in the kitchen is causing discomfort or inconvenience. This is a common occurrence when food waste or other organic matter is not properly disposed of, leading to unpleasant odors. In contrast, Option B (Я випадково викинула свій список покупок) does not provide any context or evidence to support the idea that the speaker accidentally threw away their shopping list. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise.
Response:  Option A (Діти захоплювалися тваринами).
"Response:  Option B: His lungs were filled with air. 
Explanation: The premise states that the man was ""громко дихав,"" which means he was breathing heavily or rapidly. This suggests that there may be an obstruction in his respiratory system, such as a blockage in his airways or a buildup of fluid in his lungs. It is less likely that his kidneys would suddenly disappear or become invisible without any prior medical issues or symptoms. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for the man's heavy breathing."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I asked my friend for directions to the seat) is more likely. The speaker seems to be focused on finding their seat rather than asking their friend if they want to go with them.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B: ""Я відкрила вікна"" (I opened the windows) will cause the air conditioner in the house to break down than Option A: ""Я принесла ковдри"" (I brought a rug). This is because opening the windows can expose the air conditioner to direct sunlight and heat, which can damage its components and lead to malfunctioning."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that his rucksack was heavy (Option B). This is because the pain in his back could be caused by carrying a heavy load, rather than having an open rucksack.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (It was her birthday) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Пчела укусила садовницю) is more likely. The fact that ""narcisi in the garden were destroyed"" suggests that something sudden and unexpected happened to them, which could be caused by a pest like a bee stinging the gardener. On the other hand, option B (""bilks dug up the onions"") doesn't seem as plausible given the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Полив згасив) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""Я підкинув сірку,"" which implies that something was thrown or projected into the air. As a result, it is more likely that the object will fall back down to the ground than for it to ignite or produce fire. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They didn't want to discuss it in court) is a more plausible explanation for why the two sides were able to reach an agreement. The fact that they were able to come to an understanding without involving the courts suggests that they had a personal stake in finding a resolution outside of legal proceedings.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (their parents died) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the phrase ""were sent to an orphanage"" implies that the children are no longer with their biological parents, which could be due to death rather than being abandoned or neglected by them."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (З’явилося цунамі) is more likely to occur as a result of a meteorite falling into the ocean. The impact of the meteorite would create shockwaves that could trigger a tsunami wave.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she was zapped (Option A). The phrase ""зневоднена"" means ""dehydrated,"" while ""паникувала"" means ""panicked."" Since the premise mentions an ""отруйна змія"" or poisonous snake, it is more likely that the woman was affected by its venom rather than dehydration or panic. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Я inclusion of ducts) caused the pot to become hot. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Option A -  Лімон заплямхнув.
Explanation: The premise ""Я вицілив лимонний клин"" implies that a lemon was squeezed or pressed, resulting in juice being released. This means that the lemon has been damaged or bruised, which is reflected in the word ""заплямхнув"". Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Країна colonized land. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""the country opened up new lands,"" indicating that it expanded its territory by colonizing new areas. This suggests that Option B is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Він розбився по усій підлозі) is a more likely outcome than option B (Ві впали у купу прання). This is because the phrase ""склянка впала з столу"" implies that the glass fell to the floor with force, which could potentially shatter it into pieces. It is less likely that the glass would simply fall into a pile of laundry without breaking first. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Підлога була нерівною) is the more likely cause of the vase collapsing. The unevenness of the floor could have caused the base of the vase to shift or become unstable, leading to its collapse.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (his son confessed to the lie) is more likely. The father's reaction of disbelief and shock suggests that he did not expect his son to admit to lying, and therefore option A is the most plausible outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he took aspirin (Option B) than syrup for cough (Option A). Aspirin is a common pain reliever and anti-inflammatory medication that can help alleviate headaches caused by tension or migraines. Syrup for cough, on the other hand, is typically used to treat respiratory issues such as congestion and coughing, rather than headaches.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він наближався до станції) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (psychiatric disorders were present in his family) is the correct answer. The fact that he was undergoing therapy suggests that he may have been struggling with mental health issues, and the mention of ""his family"" implies that there may be a genetic component to these issues."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she choked on her food) is a more likely cause than option A (she swallowed it). Choking occurs when food gets stuck in the throat and can obstruct breathing, leading to asphyxiation or unconsciousness. It's less likely that someone would simply ""proctovu"" their food without any obvious physical reaction."
Response:  Option A - Her voice sounded hoarse.
Response:  Option A - He was looking at the juicy steak with longing.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she became wealthy (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Звон зазвонив) is more likely as a cause for students to have left class.
"Response:  Option B (Her friends were involved)
Explanation: The premise states that the woman claimed to have seen a ghost, indicating that she believed in its existence. Therefore, option B is more likely as her friends would be more likely to believe her claim rather than being skeptical about it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він ледво не потонув у океані) is more likely. The man's inability to hear suggests that he may have experienced some kind of trauma or injury to his head or ears, which could potentially have caused him to lose consciousness or nearly drown while swimming in the ocean. This scenario is more plausible than Option B (Ві ледь не загинув внаслідування вибуху), as there is no indication in the premise that the man was exposed to a dangerous explosion.
"Response:  Option B - Баlon піднявся у повітря. 
Explanation: According to the premise, a child released the string of an air balloon. As a result, the balloon will most likely rise into the air. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A (insult)
Explanation: The man's inability to speak is most likely caused by an insult, as it is a common result of brain damage or injury such as an insult. This is supported by the fact that the man was unable to speak after his accident, indicating that he suffered some form of brain damage. In contrast, inhaling deeply would not cause long-term speech difficulties. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the man's condition."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (there was a crack in the cement) is more likely to be the correct answer. The mention of ""troтуари"" suggests that the scene takes place outdoors, and the use of the word ""споткнутися"" implies that the woman's body came into contact with something hard, such as a crack or pothole in the sidewalk. Therefore, it is more likely that she hit her head on a crack in the cement rather than being called by someone else."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Спасавець за ним заскоcocked) is more likely. The man falling into a pool with a gun is a dangerous situation that requires immediate attention from a rescuer. It's unlikely that the man would have time to drink anything before being saved, especially if he was unconscious or unable to move after falling in. Therefore, it makes sense for the rescuer to rush in and save him as quickly as possible.
"Response:  Option B: Моя інфекція поширися.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that you took antibiotics, it's more likely that your infection will spread rather than heal. Antibiotics only work against bacterial infections, not viral ones, so taking them after being infected with a virus will not make you feel better and may even lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Водівець натиснув на гальма) is more likely. The reason for this is that when a driver suddenly applies the brakes, it can cause the car to slow down or stop abruptly, which may result in a bright flash of light from the headlights. On the other hand, if the driver simply sped up without applying the brakes, there would be no sudden deceleration and therefore less likelihood of a bright flash of light.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I placed the container on a hot plate) is more likely to have caused the plastic container to melt. This is because placing a container directly onto a heat source, such as a hot plate, can cause it to reach high temperatures quickly and potentially melt or deform. In contrast, pouring water into a container may not necessarily cause it to melt, depending on the material of the container and the temperature of the water.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the driver crashed into a telephone pole (Option A). The reason for this is that the phrase ""машина была в'яжена"" (machine was stuck) suggests that the vehicle became immobilized or entangled in some way, which could potentially result in a collision with an obstacle such as a telephone pole. In contrast, Option B does not provide any specific details about what caused the accident, making it less plausible that the driver ran a red light."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Хлопчик вчися всю ніч,"" it is more likely that he passed the exam. The phrase ""вчися всю ніч"" implies that he studied all night, indicating a strong effort and dedication to preparing for the exam. Therefore, option B (he zapped the exam) is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він боявся навчитися плавати) is more likely. The reason being that the child clung to the edge of the pool because he was afraid to learn how to swim. This suggests a fear or anxiety towards water, which is a common phobia among children. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why the child clung to the edge of the pool.
Response:  Option B: Sercebeatry accelerated.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (У моєму офісі було дуже шумно) is more likely. The fact that there was a building under construction near the office suggests that there were noise disturbances from the construction site, making it more likely that the office environment was noisy.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сім'a запросила сусідів на вечерю) is more likely. The family wants to get to know their new neighbors better, so they invite them over for dinner. This shows a friendly and welcoming attitude towards their sundry neighbors.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Пlovчик занuрився в басейн) occurred. The wording of the premise suggests that water was flowing out of the bathtub rather than into it, implying that someone or something had submerged themselves in the water inside the bathtub. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why water was coming out of the bathtub.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I accidentally bit my tongue) is more likely. The premise states that you tasted something bitter, which suggests that you may have accidentally bit your tongue or another part of your mouth rather than swallowing a seed by mistake.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his kurta was unbuttoned) is a more likely cause of the boy falling than Option B (his shoelaces were undone). The premise mentions that the boy ""споткнувся,"" which implies a sudden impact or collision, rather than a gradual loosening of his shoelaces. Therefore, it is more plausible that he lost balance due to an unexpected bump or jolt, rather than slowly losing his footing because of his laces coming undone."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (she was distracted by the noise) is more likely. The premise states that she inserted earplugs, which suggests a deliberate action to block out sound. It is less likely that she would intentionally pierce her own ears without any prior indication of such behavior.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я випила всю воду) is a more likely cause than Option B (Я тримав її в холодильнику). This is because the premise states that the speaker has filled their cup with water, indicating that they have consumed all of it. It is unlikely that they would then put the empty cup back in the fridge.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (there was vulgar language used) is the more likely cause for censorship of the television show.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Екіпаж потонув) is more likely. The premise states that the ship has been destroyed, indicating that all crew members on board are likely to have perished in the accident. This makes Option A the most plausible outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Він розгадував загадку) is more likely. The premise states that the boy was ""збентежений"" or puzzled by the riddle, indicating that he did not already know the answer. Therefore, it is more likely that he actually solved the riddle rather than simply asking for a hint."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man picked up the phone (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Мені було некомfortable) is more likely.
"Response: 🔍 Option B: They re-examined all exhibits. 
Explanation: The premise states that the group left the museum, indicating that they were not there to take photographs of the exhibits. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that they re-examined all exhibits after leaving the museum."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Мій друг заступися за мене) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Я ввімкнув повітря в шину"" (I inflated the tire) will occur. This is because the premise states that the tire was punctured, which means there may be a leak of air from the tire. Inflating the tire would help to restore some of the lost pressure, but it would not change the fact that the tire is still punctured."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (her father touched her forehead) is more likely to cause her to look pale. When someone touches or strokes a person's forehead, it can cause their skin to become flushed or pale due to increased blood flow to the area. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (“Я використави олівець”) is the correct answer. The use of olive oil as a writing instrument would not produce black ink, but rather a brownish-green color. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він був у боргу) is more likely to be the cause of him being denied a loan.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (У неї була вітряна вітряна) is more likely. The fact that she was left home alone suggests that she may have been responsible for taking care of herself, including doing her own chores or tasks. Having a windy day would not necessarily impact her ability to do these tasks, so it is less likely that she would be excused from school due to bad weather. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she took him to the dumpster (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я підсував килим,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that something was placed or laid down (podsuval) rather than left behind (lishyayut). Therefore, the most likely explanation for why there are stains on the carpet is that someone spilled something, not that a dog left its hair behind."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Він кинув стілець через кімнату) is more likely. The fact that he lost his self-control suggests a heightened emotional state, which could lead to impulsive actions like throwing something through a room.
Response:  Option B - Вогонь згас.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Чоловік вийшов з душу,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""вийшов з душі"" means to lose one's mind or go insane, so it is unlikely that there was no hot water available for a bath. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They delayed their retirement savings to pay for college) is more likely. The parents want their children to go to college, so they are willing to sacrifice their own financial security by delaying their retirement savings in order to fund their children's education.
Response:  Option B - Взуття зносися.
Response:  Option A - He froze the remaining half.
"Response:  Option B: Я наatriled him lemonade.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker's stomach was swollen, which suggests discomfort or pain. Option B provides a humorous explanation for this condition by suggesting that the speaker drank too much lemonade, causing their stomach to become inflated. This option is therefore more likely than Option A, which offers an unrealistic solution of putting ice on the stomach."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I heard a conversation in the hall) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Я переглянула журнал) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a more plausible reason for why the speaker had to wait in line.
"Response: 
Option B: Muha remained at the place.
Explanation: According to the premise, a man asked a fly about something. Since flies are not known for their ability to speak or communicate with humans in any meaningful way, it is highly unlikely that the fly would have responded to the man's question. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Він помер) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will slow down his pace (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Я придумав рішення) is more likely. The use of the verb ""придумав"" suggests a proactive approach to solving the problem, rather than simply asking for permission or waiting for someone else's solution."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Він був в екстазі) is more likely. The use of the word ""екстаз"" suggests a positive emotional state, rather than fear or anxiety as implied in option A."
"Response:  Option B (He made a bet with his friends)
Explanation: The premise states that the man predicted the victory of his team, which suggests that he had some sort of wager or bet placed on the game. Therefore, option B is more likely as it implies that the man made a bet with his friends."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he set an alarm clock (Option A).
