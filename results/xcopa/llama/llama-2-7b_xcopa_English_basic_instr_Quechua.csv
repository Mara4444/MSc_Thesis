"Response: 10-20-30-40-50 (50)

This is a classic riddle from the Riddle Book of Hama, and it has several layers of meaning. Here's how I would translate it into English:

The traveler walked on the shaky suspension bridge. [A]
He felt terrified. [B]
He felt ecstatic. [C]
What did he feel when he reached the other side? [D]
A, B, or C? [E]

So the answer to the riddle is A, because the traveler felt terrified when he was walking on the shaky suspension bridge. Option D is also correct, because the traveler felt ecstatic when he reached the other side. And option E is incorrect, because there are only three options for the answer, not five."
