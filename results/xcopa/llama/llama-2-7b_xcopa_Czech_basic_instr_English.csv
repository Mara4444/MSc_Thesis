Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Našel jsem zbraň) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A: Termity zmizely z domu (Termite disappeared from the house). This is because termites are known to eat away at wood and other cellulose-based materials in a home, but they do not typically disappear suddenly without any trace.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Agentka z hlídky zkontrolovala jejich pasy) is more likely. The premise mentions that cestovatelé dorazili na hranici, suggesting that they have arrived at a border crossing, and an agent from customs control has checked their passports. This implies that the agents are carrying out their duties to monitor and regulate travelers' movements across the border, rather than accusing them of smuggling.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (It was a holiday) caused the office to be closed. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hrála dámu) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""dívce došly energie"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual happened to a girl, and playing a game could be one possible explanation for this event. In contrast, option B (Skočila přes provaz) does not fit as well with the context, as jumping over a rope is not typically associated with sudden bursts of energy in girls. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the provided information."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (More people joined the queue) is a more likely cause for the woman losing her place in line. The passage does not provide any information to suggest that she voluntarily left the queue or was removed by someone else. Therefore, it is more plausible that additional people joined the queue after her, causing her to lose her position.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the child spilled something on her dress than that the child laughed at her dewlap. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Dítě jí pošpinilo plínku.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Diváci tleskali do hudby) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dívka přnesla učiteli jablko) is more likely. The premise states that the girl wanted to thank her teacher for something, which suggests that she had a positive experience with the teacher and wants to show appreciation. Bringing a gift, such as an apple, is a common way to express gratitude in many cultures. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A, where the girl stayed after school due to a punishment.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (their camp counselor told them a story about souls) is more likely to be the correct answer. The mention of a ""táborový poradce"" (camp counselor) suggests that the scene takes place in a summer camp or similar setting, where children are often exposed to stories and activities aimed at teaching them moral lessons or promoting teamwork and cooperation. The idea of a counselor sharing a tale about souls aligns with this context, as it could be used to teach children about the importance of empathy, compassion, or selflessness. In contrast, option B (they roasted marshmallows over a fire) does not provide any clues related to the scenario described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Má otřes mozku) is more likely. The phrase ""praštil se do hlavy"" suggests that the person has been thinking intensely or concentrating heavily, which could lead to a headache or other discomfort in the brain. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (My bank account was empty) is more likely to be the cause of the problem.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Vymazal ten spam"" will occur. This is because the email box was full of spam, so it makes sense that the character would want to delete it rather than sending a mass email."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Byl vystaven této nemoci) is more likely. The sentence implies that the sailor was exposed to a disease while in quarantine, rather than having recovered from one. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that she forgot to write down the code herself (option B). The fact that she remembers having seen the code but not being able to recall it suggests that she may have simply forgotten rather than reciting it to herself.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Voda mi uhasila žízeň) is a more likely outcome than option B (Sklenice se naplnila). This is because the word ""uhasila"" implies that something unpleasant or harmful happened to the speaker's stomach after drinking water, rather than simply filling up a glass with water. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chtěl nabídnout svému příteli podporu) is more likely. The passage states that he was left with silence after his friend ended, indicating a sense of loss or emptiness. Offering support to his friend would be a natural response to this situation, rather than simply thinking about their words.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cítil jsem se provincial.) is a more likely response than option B (-Obvinil jsem ho.). This is because the word ""provinila"" in Czech means to feel guilty or ashamed of something, which aligns with the context of the sentence. Option B does not make sense in this context as it implies that someone else has accused the speaker of something, rather than the speaker feeling guilty themselves."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ten řetěz byl omotán kolem pneumatiky) is a more plausible explanation for why the chain broke than option B (Bylo to zlomené spojení v řetězci). The fact that the chain was wrapped around the tire suggests that it may have been subjected to excessive stress or pressure, potentially causing it to break. In contrast, if the break occurred within the chain itself, there would be no obvious external factor contributing to its failure. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Už se jim nebaví hádat) is more likely. The couple has decided to compromise, indicating that they are willing to find a solution together. Therefore, it is less likely that they would avoid discussing the problem altogether.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (svědčila u soudu) is more likely to occur as a result of her decision to run for public office.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (V kufru si dal teplé oblečení) is more likely. The fact that they are expecting cold weather suggests that they will pack warm clothing in their luggage to prepare for it.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Zvedl ruku) is a more plausible explanation for why the student did not answer the question than option B (Zbláznil se). This is because zvednutí ruky can be interpreted as a nonverbal cue indicating that one does not know or understand something, whereas zbláznění typically refers to a state of confusion or disorientation. Therefore, it is more likely that the student zvedl ruku rather than zbláznil se.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (V očích měl prach) is more likely. The phrase ""had tears in his eyes"" implies that there was something emotional or saddening happening, which would be consistent with having dust or dirt in one's eyes rather than wearing glasses."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (her opponent felt sorry for her) is more likely. The reason being that there is no indication in the premise that her opponent had any reason to accuse her of cheating or that he would even care enough to do so. On the other hand, it's possible that her opponent may feel sorry for losing to her, especially if she was able to win five consecutive matches against him.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chytil studenta, jak podvádí) is more likely as it implies that the teacher intentionally graded the test incorrectly to punish the student for cheating. This is a more sinister motivation than simply giving incorrect answers, which would be the result of carelessness or lack of knowledge.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ztratil jsem hlas) is more likely. The speaker has stopped talking because they have lost their voice, rather than having difficulty breathing or speaking.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Dal jsem ho do mikrovlnky) caused the food to freeze than option B (Zakryl jsem to plastovou fólií). This is because microwaves are a common household appliance used for heating and cooking food, and they can quickly thaw frozen food. In contrast, covering something with plastic wrap may not have enough insulation properties to keep the food from freezing in cold temperatures.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the employee pretended to be sick (Option A). The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it suggests that the employee was able to fool their employer into believing they were ill when they were actually not. This implies that the employee had a good enough understanding of their employer's expectations and work culture to create a convincing cover story. Option B does not provide any specific details or clues that would suggest the employee was faking their illness.
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that she fell into the pool from the trampoline (Option B). Therefore, the answer is Option B.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The movie had a poor opening) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that people isolated them (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Napsala dopis) is more likely as it suggests that the woman wrote a letter, which is a common activity for people to engage in. The other option (Vylezla na provaz) does not make sense given the context of the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Diváci v úžasu křičeli) is more likely. The description of the performer juggling while riding a unicycle suggests that the audience would be in a state of amazement or shock at the skill and coordination required to perform such a feat. Option B (Akrobat se houpal z trapezu) does not align with this premise as it simply describes an acrobat jumping from a trapeze without any additional context.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Můj přítel mě nechal čekat) is more likely to be the cause of the speaker's loss of patience.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that they will choose option A: Vytvořili jaderné zbraně. This is because the context of war suggests a heightened sense of urgency and desperation, which could lead to drastic measures such as developing nuclear weapons. The idea of negotiating a peace treaty may be less likely in this scenario due to the intensity of the conflict.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Měl horečku) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she injured her knee (Option B). The phrase ""narazila do pohovky"" implies a sudden impact or collision, which could cause injury to the knee. It is less likely that the couch would suddenly open up and release its springs, causing her to fall. Therefore, Option B is the better answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chlapci stiskli balónky"", option A (Balónek praskl) is more likely to occur. The word ""praskl"" means ""broke"" or ""went wrong"". Therefore, it is more likely that the children broke the balloons than they let them go."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that they packed their bags (Option A). This is because they have already checked into a hotel room, indicating that they plan to stay there for an extended period of time, rather than leaving immediately after arrival.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kousla jsem do broskyni,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Broskvička je pohmožděná,"" occurred. This is because kousla (a Czech word for ""I threw"") implies a physical action of throwing something into or onto something else, which could result in the broskvička being damaged or broken. Option B, ""Vylil se džus,"" means ""The juice spilled"" and does not necessarily imply any damage to the broskvička."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moje ruce se mi přilepily,"" option A (Snedl jsem koblihu) is the more likely cause. This is because the word ""ruce"" in Czech means hand, so it is unlikely that someone's hands would stick to their mouth without any food or other substance being involved."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dveře se otevřely) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Výrobky were produced through child labor) is a more likely cause of the activists' boycott than option A (Výrobky were tested for quality). Child labor is often associated with exploitation and human rights abuses, and it is possible that the activists are protesting against this practice rather than simply questioning the quality of the products.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vrtal jsem díru do zdi,"" it is more likely that Option A (Z díry se vyplazila myš) is correct. The word ""vrtal"" means to dig or bore a hole into something, so it is reasonable to assume that something inside the wall was affected by this action. The option ""Z díry se vyplazila myš"" (A mouse came out of the hole) makes sense in this context as mice are known to nest in walls and other small spaces."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jeho sestra byla šťastna) is more likely. The passage states that ""Tažena záviděla svou sestru,"" indicating that she was envious of her sister's happiness. This suggests that her sister was happy, which makes Option A the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Změnil jsem si košili) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zákazník si prohledal peněženku) is more likely. The word ""otevřela"" in the premise implies that someone opened a treasure chest or a box, rather than giving money to someone. Therefore, it is more likely that the customer searched through their own purse for something."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Lidé mu dali drobné) will occur. The fact that a street musician attracted a crowd suggests that people were interested in his performance and wanted to show their appreciation by giving him money.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Chyběli mu jeho rodiče) is a more likely cause for why he was crying. The phrase ""chlapci plakají své chůvy"" suggests that children often cry when they are separated from their parents or caregivers, and this is a common reason for toddlers' distress. Therefore, it is more likely that the child in question was missing his parents rather than being hungry or tired."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Pilot flew through the storm) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Listy se změnily barvami) is the more likely outcome. The premise states that ""listy se změnily,"" indicating a change in their appearance or properties, rather than simply accumulating on the ground. This suggests that the color of the leaves has changed, rather than just piling up on the ground. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Rozhodl se, že si udělá ze své sestry legraci) is more likely. The word ""legraci"" suggests that the boy may want to play a prank on his sister, rather than simply playing a game with her using cards."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jeho otec mu dal napít limonádu) is more likely. The premise mentions that the child was complaining about having to go to the bathroom, which suggests that it may be a physical discomfort or need for relief rather than a desire for refreshment or fuel. Giving the child lemonade would not address this issue directly, whereas stopping at a gas station could provide an opportunity for the child to use the restroom.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ryby vyskočily z nádrže) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she changed her political views (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Zapnul jsem kohoutek) caused the washcloth to become stuck in the drain than Option B (Nalil jsem do něj čistič kanalizace). This is because the latter option implies that something was poured into the drain, which could potentially cause a blockage but would not explain why the washcloth became stuck in the first place. In contrast, Option A directly suggests that the speaker's nose was inserted into the drain, which could easily cause a blockage with the washcloth. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vlak dorazil na stanici) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why passengers got off the train. The other option, Option B (Vlak zazvonil), does not provide any information about why the passengers got off the train. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Dal na obálku razítko) occurred. The word ""stiskl"" in the premise implies a gentle pressure or touch, which could potentially cause a small indentation or crease on the surface of the package without actually breaking it open. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Užili si vzájemnou společnost) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was fired from her position. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Slyšel jsem, jak tikají hodiny) is more likely as it matches the context of the sentence better than option B (Chtěl jsem zkontrolovat čas).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mám křeče v ruce,"" option B is more likely. The speaker's statement suggests that they are experiencing muscle spasms or cramps in their hand, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as overuse, injury, or medical conditions like fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis. It is less likely that the speaker wrote an essay by hand themselves, as this would not typically cause muscle spasms or cramps in the hand."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Záska se přitáhla,"" option B (Otočil jsem klíč) is more likely as a cause for the problem."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (the pair moved into the apartment) will occur. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the premise that the city would condemn an apartment, so it is unlikely that this event would happen. On the other hand, moving into an apartment is a common occurrence when people rent housing, making option A the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chtěla sledovat západ slunce) is more likely. The woman's action of sitting outside and watching the sunset suggests that she was interested in observing the natural phenomenon rather than thinking she saw a flash of lightning.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Neuměl plavat) is the most likely cause. The fact that the man had a rescue vest on his body suggests that he was in a situation where he needed to be rescued, but since he couldn't swim, he wouldn't have been able to save himself without the vest. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the man was wearing a rescue vest in the water.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she pressed Backspace (Option B). When a user types an incorrect character or wants to delete one, they typically press the Backspace key instead of Delete. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trávník byl blátivý,"" Option A is the most likely cause - it rained overnight."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zůstala přes noc v hotelu) is more likely. The fact that she overslept suggests that she may have spent the night in a different location than where she left her phone, which could explain why she didn't receive any calls or messages from him.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Seděl ve stínu) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The fact that the man applied cream for tanning suggests that he wants to darken his skin, which would require him to stay in a shaded area to avoid burning or overexposure to sunlight. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the researchers rejected the theory (Option A). The passage states that ""výzkumníci tuto teorii dokázali,"" which implies that they were able to disprove or refute the theory through their experiments. This suggests that the researchers did not accept the theory, but rather found evidence against it. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the game went into overtime) is more likely as the reason for the fans' excitement. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The premise states that ""I added a combination to the lock,"" which implies that the lock was previously locked but can now be opened with the correct combination. Therefore, it is more likely that the lock will open rather than close."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Otec dal synovi nějaké peníze) is more likely to happen as per the premise provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Snow has blocked the path due to accumulated snow (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Shromáždil jsem sníh do sněhové koule.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kajak dosáhl břehu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she lost control of her motorcycle (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Cítil jsem, jak mě přepadá chladný vzduch) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker felt a cool breeze, which is consistent with the idea of wind blowing on their skin. Option A (Na kůži mi posypal vodu) does not fit the context as it implies that water was poured onto the speaker's skin, which is unlikely given the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Byli úplně mokrí) is more likely. The surfers returned to the beach because they were completely soaked from their surfing session, not because they saw a shark.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Voda vyšla z vany) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will accuse her of infidelity (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I waited for the ink to dry) is a more likely cause than option B (I spilled water on the poster). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that his father sat down at the table (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Křičel jsem jeho jméno) is a more likely cause than option B (Mával jsem rukama). This is because the phrase ""otočil hlavu směrem ke mně"" suggests that my friend turned his head towards me, which could be interpreted as a sign of attention or interest. Yelling someone's name would not necessarily result in them turning their head towards you."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Občané se vzbouřili) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will cry out for help (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Chtěla se dozvědět o jiných kulturách) is more likely. The woman traveled abroad to learn about other cultures, indicating that she was interested in broadening her knowledge and understanding of the world beyond her own culture.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his colleague got a promotion) is more likely to be the cause of his jealousy.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man experienced hallucinations (Option A) rather than meditated (Option B). The mention of ""mimozemšťanů"" suggests that the man's experience was not a result of ordinary human perception or cognition, but rather an extraordinary event involving extraterrestrial beings. Hallucinations are a common symptom of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and can also occur under certain medical conditions, such as sensory deprivation or sleep deprivation. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for the man's experience."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Dal do ní bjelidlo) caused the man's hair to turn gray. This is because beard oil or balm can help to moisturize and condition the hair, leading to a healthier appearance and potentially preventing graying. On the other hand, shampoo may not have any significant effect on the color of the hair. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Cítila záchvat inspirace) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Syn was propelled from his home) than option B (he chystal himself to a high school). The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that Syn's departure from home may have been due to some unpleasant or difficult circumstances, rather than a positive decision to pursue higher education.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Police were covered in dust) is a more plausible explanation for why the police station was closed. The sentence ""Knihy spadly z knihovny"" suggests that there has been some kind of collapse or disruption at the library, which could have caused books to fall from the shelves and cover the police station with dust. This is a more logical explanation than option B (Zemětřesení otřáslo knihovnu), as earthquakes are not typically associated with book falls or dust covering police stations. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Zapnul jsem světlo) will occur. The reason for this is that turning on a light switch would be the most direct and obvious action to take in order to restore electricity in a house where it has gone out. Resetting the circuit breaker may not necessarily have an immediate effect on restoring power, especially if there are other issues with the electrical system. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeli jsme na horské dráze,"" it is more likely that option A (Vypadalo to děsivě) is correct. The word ""děsivě"" means frightening or terrifying in Czech, which aligns with the idea of being scared while riding a rollercoaster."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I added butter to the popcorn) is a more likely cause for the popcorn to start popping. The premise suggests that something was added to the popcorn, which could have triggered the popping process. Adding butter would be a common addition to popcorn, whereas heating it in the microwave might not necessarily lead to popping. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Elektrická energie spadla na vedení) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he nudged the public rather than offended them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Z tváře mi kapalo trochu potu) is more likely to occur than option B (Na mém prstu se vytvořila kapka krve). This is because the phrase ""z tváře mi kapalo"" means ""a drop of sweat dripped from my face,"" while ""na mém prstu se vytvořila"" means ""a droplet of blood appeared on my finger."" Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what might happen when someone gets nervous or anxious."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the fish died due to cold (Option B). The phrase ""ryby plavaly na povrchu nádrže"" suggests that the fish were swimming on the surface of a tank or pool, which implies that they are in an enclosed environment where temperature control can be maintained. If the water temperature dropped significantly, it could have caused the death of the fish. Therefore, Option B is the more likely explanation for why the fish floated to the top of the tank."
"Response:  Option A - Měl rýmu. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""Mužův hlas zněl ztuhlý,"" indicating that his voice sounded muffled or distorted. This could be caused by a number of factors, including having a cold or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol. However, it is unlikely that he suddenly stopped smoking, as this would not have a significant impact on the quality of his voice. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Výtah dorazil na určené patro) is a more plausible explanation for why the doors to the elevator opened. Therefore, this answer choice should be selected.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lhal rodičům) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""propašoval z domu"" suggests that the person in question has left their home without permission, which could indicate that they are in trouble or danger. It is unlikely that the parents would have taken them away from their home without a good reason, so it is more plausible that they were forced to leave by someone else."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Koupelna se přetéká) is a more likely cause of the flooded koupelna than option B (Rozbil se ohřívač vody). This is because the fact that the koupelna was ""zaplavena"" suggests that there was an excessive amount of water present in the room, which could be caused by a leak or overflow from the shower itself rather than a breakdown of the heating element."
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Majitel si na štěně dal límec) caused the situation where the dog remained with its owner. The phrase ""si na štěně dal límec"" means ""gave a leash to the dog,"" indicating that the owner took possession of the dog's leash, implying that they are still in control of the dog's movements. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Stál pod rozlehlým stromem) is more likely. The premise mentions a ""odraz,"" which typically refers to an image reflected in water or another smooth surface. Since the scene is described as being under a large tree, it is less likely that there would be enough water present for a significant reflection, making Option A the more plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zavolal jsem jí zpátky) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (their pet has escaped from home) is more likely to be the cause of their concern. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Bylo chladno) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the sentence. The speaker mentions feeling cold when they exhaled, which suggests that the temperature outside was low. In contrast, Option B (Cítil jsem, jak se mi tlačí hrudník) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of external pressure on the speaker's chest. Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that employees formed an union due to a desire for better working conditions (Option A). This is because there is no mention of any increase in salary by their employer (Option B) as a reason for forming the union.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kuchyň zapálila hnilobou) is more likely. The word ""hniloba"" in Czech means spoiled or rotten food, which suggests that there was a problem with the food in the kitchen, leading to a fire. Option B (V kuchyni se rozlévala horká vůně) simply means ""There was a hot smell coming from the kitchen,"" which could be due to many reasons other than a fire caused by spoiled food."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nosila vysoké podpatky) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the sentence. The phrase ""Ta žena se snažila chodit"" implies that she was trying to walk, and wearing high heels would make it more difficult for her to do so. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why she might have been struggling to walk."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zhrnce s vodou vystupovala pára,"" option A (Voda se vařila) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that steam was coming from the water, indicating that it was boiling or evaporating, rather than being covered up by something."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nosil jsem sandál) is more likely. The fact that all of my towels were in the laundry suggests that I was not wearing shoes or boots, as those would have been unlikely to be left with the towels.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he lost support from his voters (Option A). The argument presented suggests that the politician's popularity had declined significantly, indicating a loss of trust or confidence among his constituents. This could be due to various reasons such as policy decisions, personal scandals, or simply a shift in public opinion. In contrast, option B implies that the politician was accused of corruption, which may not necessarily result in a significant loss of support from voters unless there is overwhelming evidence of wrongdoing.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the couple eloped (Option B). The reason for this is that the passage states that ""Všichni nesouhlasili s jejími zasnoubením,"" indicating that everyone disagreed with her engagement. This suggests that the couple went against the wishes of their families and friends by getting married without their approval, which is consistent with Option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Milionář chtěl, aby budovu strhli) is more likely as it provides a clear motivation for why the building was destroyed. The other option does not provide any logical explanation for why the building would be destroyed. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Prodejce viděl, jak si dívka strčila zboží do kabelky) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Vojáci byli znovu spojeni se svými rodinami) is more likely. The fact that the country has declared war on its neighbor suggests that there will be a significant disruption in the lives of the soldiers and their families, making it less likely for them to be reunited with their families during this time.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vypukla vzpoura) is more likely to occur as a result of the controversial decision. Vzpoura represents an extreme reaction to the decision that could potentially lead to violence or unrest in the community. Option B (Pár si před soudní budovou vymězil sliby) does not align with the tone of the premise and seems less plausible in this context.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vzala sušenky z sklenice) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the story. The narrator mentions that there was something burning in the room, implying a fire or smoke, but does not provide any evidence for the other option (Nechala sušenky v troubě). Therefore, it is more plausible that the character took some sweets from a glass rather than leaving them in a trouble.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pršelo como z kapky,"" option A (Bouře se zhoršila) is more likely. The word ""pršelo"" means ""rained"" in Czech, so it's likely that the storm has worsened rather than improved. Option B (""Běžel jsem dovnitř"") doesn't fit with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the elevator stopped working) caused the building to be evacuated. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B will occur - ""Otec vy kopl syna z domu."" The reason for this is that the premise states that the father became angry with his son because of his alcoholism, which could lead to physical abuse or violence. It is less likely that he would buy him a drink as a form of punishment or retribution."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ta sekretářka šla na den domů) is a more plausible explanation for why the lawyer's secretary went down the stairs than option B (Výtah was mimo provoz). This is because there is no indication in the premise that the elevator was out of order or unavailable, whereas it is explicitly stated that the secretary went home. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Prítele ho přerušil) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dívka dala své peníze pokladně) implies that the girl gave her money to a treasure chest or a safe place. Therefore, it is more likely that she received something in return for her money, such as small change or coins. Option B (Pokladník zapomněl dát dívce stvrzenku) means that the treasurer forgot to give the girl a receipt, which is less likely than her receiving something tangible in return for her money. So, the answer is option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Byla paralyzována při nehodě) is more likely. The sentence implies that she was involved in an accident that left her paralyzed, which suggests that she may have suffered a serious injury or trauma. This is more plausible than Option B (Vstoupila do nemocnice na nosítkách), as it does not provide any context for why she would be admitted to the hospital on a stretcher.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Země čelila ekonomickým potížím) is more likely as it suggests that the people are protesting against economic difficulties rather than celebrating independence.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Zklamali své fanoušky) is the correct answer. The team lost the tournament, which suggests that they did not perform well and may have disappointed their fans.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the speaker felt embarrassed (Option A).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Chlapci ztroskotil na zkoušce z historie) is the correct answer. The text states that the boy failed his history test, indicating that he did not pay attention during class or did not study adequately for the exam. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation than option B (Zapomněl se učit), as there is no indication in the premise that the boy forgot how to learn.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Město zasáhlo zemětřesení) is more likely as it provides a specific natural disaster that could potentially cause damage to buildings in the city center. Zemětřesení (earthquake) is a common natural disaster that can cause widespread destruction, especially in urban areas with dense construction. In contrast, Option B (Míra zločinnosti ve městě vzrostla) does not provide a clear or plausible reason for building collapse in the city center.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Prosilo ji,abyho vzal zpátky) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Their heads collided) is more likely to occur than Option A (The ball flew away).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there was a piece of paper in the trash can (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chlapci naostřil tužku,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Bylo to levné"" (It was cheap) is the correct answer. The word ""levný"" means ""cheap"" in Czech, so this option aligns better with the given information."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ztratila svůj účet) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Pokladní odmítla vrátit peníze"" suggests that the speaker's money was taken by a treasury or bank, rather than the clothes not fitting properly. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker cannot get their money back."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Rychle se to uzdravilo) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he was looking at other passengers (Option A). The text does not provide any indication of him talking to himself or gazing at the ground.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that mice scurried across crumbs (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sestra téžky se Zamkl) is more likely. The reason for this is that the word ""zamkl"" in Czech means to lock or shut oneself up, so it makes sense that the sister of the woman who gave her ape-skin capesnik would lock herself up. On the other hand, option B does not make as much sense, as there is no clear indication in the premise that the sister began crying."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Měl roztrhané rty) is a more plausible explanation for why ten men took a mint factory than option B (Bál se špatného dechu). The reason being that having a sore throat may not necessarily prevent someone from taking over a mint factory, whereas having broken teeth might make it difficult or uncomfortable to do so. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, Option A (Předpokládali, that around the theatre there will be traffic) is more likely. The reason for this is that the word ""brzy"" (quickly) used to describe how one person left for the show suggests that they may have been trying to avoid traffic or other obstacles on their way to the theatre. In contrast, Option B (Mají návod, how to get to the theatre) does not provide any indication of why the person might have left quickly. Therefore, Option A is a better fit based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Její spolupracovník ji kryl) is more likely. The phrase ""zůstala doma z práce"" suggests that she was absent from work without permission or approval, which could lead to disciplinary action or negative consequences at her job. Therefore, it is more likely that her colleague covered for her absence rather than her boss praising her."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (supported their cause) is correct. The text states that ""ten men signed a petition activists,"" indicating that they agreed with and supported the activists' cause. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Měl strach ze scény) is more likely. The phrase ""pred his vystoupení třáslo"" suggests that the speaker was experiencing anxiety or fear before their performance, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Rozložila jsem mapu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It was eaten) is more likely. The premise states that the fruit remained on the sun, indicating that it did not get eaten or damaged by any other means. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Motor se přehřál) is a more plausible explanation for why the car broke down because it mentions a specific mechanical issue that can cause a car to break down, whereas option A (Auto se rozbilo) is too vague and doesn't provide any specific details about what might have caused the problem.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B (Několik dní ležel v posteli) will occur. The reason for this is that lying in bed for several days without seeking medical attention can be a common response to an injury, especially if the person is experiencing pain or discomfort. It may also indicate a reluctance to seek professional help or a belief that the injury is not serious enough to warrant medical attention.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zapálil jsem oheň v krbku,"" option A (Došel mi dřevo) is the most likely cause. The word ""dřevo"" in Czech means wood or firewood, so it suggests that the heat from the stove caused a fire to start in the grate. Option B (V domě byla zima) does not provide any information about the cause of the fire."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Má křeče v boku) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Tažena přestala běhat"" suggests that something has stopped her from running, and the mention of cramps in the back (""křeče v boku"") is a common symptom associated with stopping or slowing down physical activity due to discomfort or pain. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Soused me pozval dovnitř."" (My neighbor invited me inside.)"
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jeho manžel nepochopil její obavy) is more likely. The premise suggests that the woman felt frustrated and disappointed with her husband's lack of understanding of her concerns, indicating that he did not take her feelings into account. This is more consistent with Option A than Option B, where the husband physically hurt the woman, which would be a more extreme and unlikely scenario.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (Student správně odpověděl na otázce) is the correct cause. This is because the text states that the teacher praised the student for her answer, indicating that she gave a correct response. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of the situation described in the scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ženě došly vajíčka,"" it is more likely that Option B: Šla do supermarkedu will occur. This is because the word ""došly"" in Czech means ""to lay eggs,"" so it makes sense that the women would go to a place where they can buy food for their babies, such as a supermarket."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Odhalil jsem mu tajemství) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chytila rybu) is more likely. The premise states that the woman avoided going into the lake, but then chytila rybu, indicating that she may have had a reason for avoiding it. It does not suggest that the water was contaminated or any other negative factor. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that he came to class wet because he had a broken umbrella (Option A). It does not make sense that someone would steal his bicycle just for him to come to class wet. 
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Uživatel klikl myši) caused the computer screen to move. This is because clicking a mouse button is a common action used by users to interact with their computers, whereas moving a mouse can also be done through other means such as trackpad or touchscreen devices. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Na hlavní silnici se stala nehoda) is more likely. The sentence ""Řidič sevybral na objížďku"" suggests that the driver was deliberately driving on a scenic route, which implies that he or she was aware of the potential risks involved in such an action. Therefore, it is more likely that the driver encountered an obstacle or hazard while driving on the main road, rather than following a truck from behind."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A: Plocha vyschla (The surface dried). This is because when you hang wet laundry to dry, it will typically dry faster if it is exposed to air rather than being covered or in a humid environment. Therefore, it is more likely that the surface of the laundry would have dried rather than becoming hot due to steam from the washing machine.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sluneční světlo byla jasná) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman put on her glasses. The other option, Option B (Zavolala si taxík), does not provide any obvious reason for why she would need to call a taxi.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muž se díval na noční oblohu,"" option A (Přál si, aby byla léto) is more likely as it suggests that the man wishes for summer weather while looking at the night sky, which is a common association with warmth and sunny weather. Option B (Myšel si, že je to krásné) does not provide any information about the man's thoughts or feelings towards the night sky."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Šla jsem brzo spát) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nechaval si narůst vlasy) is more likely as it implies that the man did not let his hair grow long, but rather kept it short. This aligns with the context of the story where the man's appearance changes after he goes to the barber. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chlapec přivítal svého nového spolužáka) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jedl jsem sušenek) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a specific example of something that can be done with milk, whereas option B (Pečila jsem chléb) does not provide any information about what was made with bread.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Začalo pršet,"" Option A (Řidič zapnul světla) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the driver turned on their headlights, which could help them see better in the rain."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Zaparkoval jsem naproti) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker parked opposite the building, which is closer to the entrance than parking at the entrance itself.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Měla spisovatelský blok) is the correct answer. The phrase ""písařka zmeškala termín"" suggests that she missed or failed to meet a deadline for submitting her proposal, which could be due to writer's block or difficulty in coming up with ideas rather than simply editing what she had already written."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ten spolupracovníci mi zavěsili) is more likely to be the cause of the situation described in the scenario. This is because the number of people involved (ten) suggests a coordinated effort, rather than an individual action like providing one's identification number (which might be done by just one person).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Větr foukal otevřeným oknem,"" option A (Zvonil zvonek) is more likely. The wind was blowing open the window, causing the bell to ring."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Vypnul jsem lampu) caused the power to go out in the house. The reason for this is that turning off a light switch does not typically result in the destruction of an insurance policy or any other significant damage to the home. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the power went out in the house.
Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option A (Změkčil svá svaly před zrcadlem) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's face became flushed than option B (Zvedl tyč nad hlavu). This is because the passage specifically mentions that the man was staring at his reflection in the mirror, which suggests that he may have been adjusting his appearance or practicing facial expressions. The action of lifting a weight above one's head would not necessarily result in a flushed face, whereas making subtle changes to one's facial muscles could potentially lead to increased blood flow and a reddened complexion. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the provided details.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Zmátl se) is more likely. The student may have been confused or frustrated by the problem, leading him to become distracted or disoriented. This could result in him accidentally knocking over his calculator or becoming unfocused during the calculation process.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Otec změnil dítěti plínku) is more likely to be the cause of the child's snoring. This is because a change in the child's nasal passage or airway can cause snoring, rather than gentle tapping on the child's back.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ten kluk měl otřes mozku) is a more likely outcome than option B (Chlapec se namočil). This is because ""otřes mozku"" means ""had a head injury,"" which could be caused by a fall or other accident, while ""se namočil"" simply means ""got wet."" Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened to the boy based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (photos appeared blurry) is more likely to occur. When a photographer forgets to use a flash, it can result in underexposed or blurry photos, especially if the lighting conditions are not ideal. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome in this scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I was alone) is more likely to be the cause of not attending the birthday party. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cvičil jsem,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer because it matches the verb tense and subject-verb agreement in the sentence."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that water will flow out of the wet sponge (Option B). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: Water flows from the sponge.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: ""Hotel was booked"" is the cause of the situation. The sentence implies that there were already guests at the hotel who had reserved a room, making it unlikely that the resort was on an island (Option B). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Chtěla se vzbouřit) is more likely. The fact that she has a tattoo suggests that she may be rebellious or nonconformist, and wanting to rebel against societal norms or expectations aligns with this personality trait.
"Response:  Option A: Začala jsem mít podezření.  
Explanation: The premise states that an unknown car has been parked outside the speaker's home, leading to suspicion rather than immediate action (calling the police). Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the evidence led him in) is more likely. The text states that the criminal ""sám sebe vzdal,"" indicating a sense of voluntary surrender or confession. This suggests that there were already reasons for the criminal to want to turn himself in, rather than simply being caught by surprise without any prior knowledge of the evidence against him. Therefore, option A is more plausible given the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he stopped eating sweets) is more likely to lead to weight loss than option B (he reduced caffeine intake). The premise suggests that he has made a conscious effort to change his dietary habits in order to lose weight, which is more likely to be successful if he stops consuming high-calorie sweets rather than reducing his caffeine intake.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she fell (Option A). The word ""šla"" in Czech means ""went"", so the sentence implies that she went somewhere, possibly onto the ice or a slippery surface, where she lost her balance and fell. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of anyone pushing or throwing her."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ta žena měla pod očima kruhu,"" it is more likely that she stayed up all night (Option A). The phrase ""had a circle under her eyes"" suggests that she was tired or exhausted, which would make it difficult for her to put her child to bed."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Vulcan erupted) is more likely to be the cause of the lava flowing out of the volcano. This is because an eruption is a common occurrence in volcanoes and can result in the release of magma and ash into the atmosphere. In contrast, option B (the dormant volcano was inactive) does not provide a clear explanation for why the lava would be flowing out of the volcano. Therefore, option A is the better answer based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Znám všechny na té párty) is more likely. The woman in the scenario knows everyone at the party, indicating that she is comfortable and familiar with her surroundings. This contrasts with Option B (Chtěla odejít z večírku), where the woman wants to leave the party, suggesting that she may not be as comfortable or enjoy herself there.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Zdržela mě u mýtného) is more likely to happen because it implies that she stopped him from passing through the toll booth.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the director sold his company's shares rather than squandered his wealth. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Doktor was on vacation) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Dům hořel) is the correct answer. The statement ""Vystoupil jsem z ložnice oknem"" implies that something has happened in the house while the speaker was inside, and the fact that the house is burning suggests that a fire may have occurred. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Opláchl si ruce mýdlem) is more likely. The phrase ""Chlapec měl prsty jako ořechy"" suggests that his fingers were covered in a sticky substance, which could be caused by him rubbing his hands with butter or oil. This is more plausible than having a long shower, as it would not require any additional infrastructure like a bathroom or running water."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the milk was sour) caused the speaker's discomfort. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zmeškal jsem autobus,"" it is more likely that Option B: ""Přišel jsem pozdě do práce"" is true. This is because if someone missed a bus, they are likely to be late for work."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the car will be damaged (Option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Team Z manipulated the competition to their advantage. Therefore, Option A (Vyhráli) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Otočil jsem láhev) is more likely as it suggests that the person turned the bottle, rather than breaking it open with a corkscrew.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vleze dovnitř otevřeným oknem) is more likely. The text states that the child was locked out of his house, indicating that there is a door or window that can be opened from the outside. Therefore, it is more likely for the child to try to enter through an open window rather than climbing onto the roof.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Návštěvník zaklepal na dveře) is more likely. The word ""zaklep"" implies a physical action of knocking on something, which suggests that the visitor is trying to get someone's attention or gain entry into a place through direct means. Option B (Žena se dívala skrz klíčovou dírku v dveřích) does not provide any information about the visitor's actions or intentions, only mentioning that the woman was looking through a keyhole. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer based on the provided premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Let it dry) will occur. The reason being that if ten men have put on their clothes, they are unlikely to take them off again just to wash them. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome than option B (Put it in a chest).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ta holka vyplivla zubní pastu) is more likely. The word ""stiskla"" in the premise implies that the girl pressed or squeezed something, which fits better with Option B's description of the girl pulling out a toothpaste from her mouth. Option A does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of a tube or container for the toothpaste to come from."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that pacifists organized a protest rather than a parade. The wording of the premise suggests that there was an increase in the number of civilians who died in the war, which could be seen as a tragic event that would prompt peaceful activism such as a protest. In contrast, a parade may not have been the most appropriate response to this situation. Therefore, option A (protest) is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ona svázala stuhu) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the girl tied the ribbon herself, rather than it being a child who did so.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Vypadal mladší) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Vejce se vylíhlo) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Z vajíčka se vynořilo kuřecí mládě,"" which implies that an egg has hatched and produced a chicken embryo. This process of eggs hatching and producing offspring is a natural biological process in birds, and therefore option A is the most likely choice. Option B (""Rozbil jsem vejce"") means ""I broke the egg,"" which does not align with the premise or the context of the question."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the prisoner died due to starvation (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vylezl po žebříku) is more likely. The text states that ten men lost their balance on a ladder, indicating that they were climbing up or down it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome as it implies that one of the men successfully climbed back onto the ladder after losing his balance. Option B (Spadl z žebříku), on the other hand, suggests that all ten men fell off the ladder simultaneously, which is less likely given the context provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (took a sip of lemonade) is more likely than option B (opened a bottle of lemonade). This is because the premise states that the child ""went to the fridge,"" indicating that it was already in a position to access the contents of the fridge, including any bottles or containers of drinks inside. Taking a sip from an open container would be easier and more straightforward than opening a new one, especially for a young child who may not have the dexterity or coordination to easily open a bottle. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""V okně se vléval studený proud,"" option B is more likely. The word ""trhly"" means to freeze or chill something, so it's likely that the cold current froze Rysy's hair rather than him simply relaxing."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Her classmates admired her) is more likely to be the cause of why she received a scholarship. The passage states that ""her classmates...válili"" her, indicating that they had positive feelings towards her. This suggests that it was not just her academic performance that led to her receiving the scholarship, but also the way she was perceived by her peers."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Byla do něj zamilovaná) is more likely. The fact that she made a sandcastle next to him suggests that she was interested in him romantically or sexually.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Podněcoval k lítosti) is more likely as it suggests that the man's sadness was caused by his inability to afford food, rather than simply not having any money.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chtěl jsem soukromí) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker wants privacy, indicating that they want to talk in private with their friend.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ten muž mi podal ruku,"" it is more likely that Option A (I shook hands with him) is correct."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vzduch se rozjel ohňostrojem) is a more plausible explanation for why the person got hit in the head with a frisbee than option B (Frisbee se mi vrhlo k hlavě). This is because the phrase ""se schoval"" suggests that something was thrown or projected towards the person's head, which could be consistent with a frisbee being thrown by someone else. However, the idea of a frisbee suddenly appearing in mid-air and hitting the person's head without any obvious cause does not seem very plausible. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ta holka si kousla nehty,"" it is more likely that she was frightened (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Zarezerval jsem si schůzku) is the correct answer. The fact that the page has been booked suggests that a meeting or appointment has been scheduled, rather than the beginning of a new month.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B will occur - she will submit a divorce request.  
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the ball bounced (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she deleted her answer (Option B). The phrase ""udělala chybu"" implies a mistake was made, and deleting an answer would be a common way to cover up such a mistake."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeho soupeř chytil přihrávku) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Byly zralé) is more likely as it implies that the plums were already ripe when she collected them from the vine. Option B (Zalejval jsem je) suggests that she picked unripe plums and then ripened them herself, which doesn't fit with the given information.
"Response:  Option A (Na oběd se setkal se svou bývalou přítelkyní).  
Reasoning: The phrase ""Ten muž chtěl být romantický"" suggests that he wants to be romantic, but the option that is more likely given this context is meeting his former girlfriend for lunch. This is because it implies a level of intimacy and connection that buying chocolate does not."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Počasí se oteplilo) is more likely as an explanation for why the thermometer reading rose. The temperature outside has increased, causing the thermometer to read higher than it did before. Option A (I let go of the thermometer) does not explain why the thermometer reading would rise without any external influence.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Střecha soudní budovy vyletěla do vzduchu) is more likely to occur than option B (Dálnice se stala nebezpečně Zamrzlou). This is because a tornado is unlikely to cause ice to form on a highway, but it could potentially lift off the roof of a building.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that his marks improved (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Klekl jsem na zem) is more likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vyleštěl jsem ten kámen,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Začalo to klouzat,"" will occur. This is because the word ""vyleštět"" means ""to hurl"" or ""to throw,"" so it makes sense that the stone would start to roll or move after being thrown. In contrast, Option B, ""Stalo se to lesklím,"" does not make as much sense in this context, as the word ""leský"" means ""smooth."""
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the addition of sugar to coffee made it smell stronger (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he tore the papers (Option B). The phrase ""procházel noviny"" implies that he was reading newspapers, and tearing them would be a more logical action than being injured by them. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the hřebík (nail) sank into the wood (drevo). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Rybář přitáhl rybu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Má pupínek) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the boy doesn't want to go to school, which could suggest that he might have a pet or something else that he cares about more than going to school. Having a pet would require taking care of it, which could explain why the boy doesn't want to go to school. Option B (Sundeli jí rovnátka) does not provide any context that would suggest why the boy doesn't want to go to school.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Můj výraz se rozjasnil,"" it is more likely that Option A (Dostal jsem dobré zprávy) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""rozjasnil"" can be translated to ""cheered up"" or ""became happier,"" indicating a positive change in mood or emotional state. In contrast, Option B (""Ztratil jsem trpělivost"") means ""I lost my patience,"" which does not align with the positive connotation of the original sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ručník byl mokrý) is more likely as it directly relates to the action of dipping one's hands in water. Option B (Moje ruce byly mokré) does not make sense in this context as it would imply that one's own hands were wet, rather than a tool or instrument used for dipping.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Stolička se pod ním chvěla) is a more plausible explanation for why ten men lost their balance on a chair than option B (Rozlil barvu na stoličce). The reason being that the movement of the chair underneath them could be causing it to rock or sway, making it difficult for them to maintain their balance.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Prohrál hru) is the correct answer. The text states that the two players were accusing each other of losing the game, indicating that they are both responsible for their own loss rather than having a common cause such as a cancelled training session.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Lituji své chyby) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the tone of the passage, which expresses regret and self-blame for past mistakes.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zeptal se jí na její osobní život) is more likely to be the cause of her boredom with him. The passage suggests that she has become tired of his constant questions about her personal life and wants some space for herself.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zčervenaly jí tváře) is a more likely outcome than option B (Ukázaly se jí doupě). This is because the phrase ""dívka se usmála"" suggests that she smiled, which could potentially cause her face to turn red. The second option does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of any ducks appearing before or after the girl's smile. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Projel nad důl) is the more likely cause. The explosion of an enemy ship in space would likely result in debris and wreckage falling towards the surface of a planet or moon, rather than entering a port.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (went to the bathroom) is the most likely cause of the man's absence from work. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Option A (Zjistili identitu vraha)
Explanation: The premise states that detectives searched the crime scene for clues, leading them to identify the killer. This suggests that they found evidence at the scene that helped them determine who committed the murder, rather than finding a weapon or other physical evidence. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Požádala jsem o odvoz) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Many people became sick) is more likely. The premise states that the economy of the country has declined, which could lead to a decrease in access to healthcare and an increase in illnesses among the population. Option B (Many people were unemployed) does not necessarily imply a direct link between economic decline and illness.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (They wanted to get into the opposite traffic) is a more plausible explanation for why the child was able to cross the road without getting hit by a car. It is unlikely that the child knew the driver from their neighborhood, as there is no mention of any prior interaction or relationship between them. Therefore, it makes more sense that the child simply wanted to cross the road and got lucky in avoiding the oncoming vehicle.
Response:  Option A (Řekl mi pravdu).
Response: Řidič uvízl na silnici (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dítě byla na světě) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Venku foukal vítr) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the hat flew away. The other option, Option A (Sundej si klobouk), does not provide any clear reason for why the hat would fly away.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dostala pozvánku) is more likely as it suggests that she received an invitation to the party, indicating that someone else took the initiative to invite her.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Jeho matka ho vzala do parku) is more likely. The fact that Chlapec has a hot forehead suggests that he may be feeling uncomfortable or overheated, so his mother taking him to a park where there is fresh air and shade would be a more logical response than measuring his temperature at home.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ten man shaved his beard cologne) is the correct answer. The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is discussing a personal grooming activity, such as shaving one's beard or using cologne, rather than applying gel to one's hair. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the ten men might have been acting strangely.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Hledal jsem baterku) is the correct answer. This is because the premise mentions that there is no electricity in the house, which suggests that the person may be looking for a backup power source such as a battery.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Syn dokončil střední školu) is more likely as it provides a specific example of something that happened after the family moved to their new house. The other option (Matka porodila dvojčata) does not provide any information about what happened after they moved houses. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Viděla cílovou čáru) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the machine broke down) is a more likely cause for the small parts to have fallen out of the box than option B (- The container with nuts and bolts got stuck). This is because the machine breaking down would be a more plausible reason for small parts to fall out of a box compared to a container getting stuck.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Otáčela jsem na něj očima) is the correct answer. The phrase ""pes mého přítele"" means ""my friend's dog,"" so the speaker is referring to a living being. Additionally, the use of the verb ""otáčela"" suggests movement or action towards something, which aligns with the idea of looking at someone. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that he paid cash upfront (Option B) rather than writing a check (Option A). This is because the entrepreneur's credit card was rejected, indicating that they may not have had a good credit history or sufficient funds in their account to cover the payment. Paying with cash upfront would eliminate this issue and ensure that the payment is made in full.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Uřízl si nehty) is more likely to be the cause of the man's misfortune. The phrase ""prokletý"" in Czech means cursed or unfortunate, so it makes sense that the man has been afflicted with ingrown toenails as a result of his own actions. Option B (Ubořil si prst) does not make as much sense in this context, as it would imply that he cut off his own finger, which is an unlikely and drastic action for someone who is simply experiencing ingrown toenails."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jeho bratr se pohádal s jejich rodiči) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the speaker's jealousy towards his brother. The other option (Jeho bratra přijali na právnickou fakultu) does not provide any obvious explanation for the speaker's feelings of envy towards his brother.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dívala se na hvězdy) is more likely. The premise mentions ""sluneční soustava"" which means solar system in Czech, so it's likely that the girl wanted to learn about the stars or astronomy rather than going to a library."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Postavil jsem ten plakát nad dveře) is more likely as it provides a clear context for how the plakát came to be attached to the wall. Option B (Na ten plakát jsem dala páskovou pásku) does not provide any information about how the plakát was attached to the wall. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B will occur - ""Architekt upravil plány"". The wording of the premise suggests that the client rejected the architect's original plans, implying that the architect had to modify or adjust their design in order to meet the client's requirements. This aligns with Option B, where the architect makes changes to the original plan. In contrast, Option A implies that the architect simply built the building without any modifications, which seems less plausible based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that his hand twitched (Option A). The phrase ""muž upustil lžičku"" means ""a man let go of a lie,"" so it suggests that he was holding onto something false or deceptive, rather than physically harming himself by pulling out his own hair. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Správní rada společnost rozpuštěla) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ředitel společnosti odstoupil"" suggests that there has been a change in leadership within the company, which could lead to the dissolution of the management board or council (Správní rada). Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Přistoupil jsem k pódiu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Napadl spoluvězně) is more likely to be the cause of his release from prison. The premise states that he was released from prison, implying that he served his sentence but was not granted early release or pardoned. It is unlikely that his family would have been able to pay a large sum of money for him to be released early, as this would be an unusual and potentially illegal practice in many jurisdictions. Therefore, it is more plausible that he was released due to his own actions, such as attacking other prisoners or threatening violence against guards or staff, which could result in his transfer to a lower-security facility or even his immediate release.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they sold their house (Option A). The reason for this is that the premise states that Rodina lost everything, including their home, but does not mention any incident that could have caused a fire to destroy their house. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how Rodina lost their home.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kontejner was recycled) is more likely. The sentence ""Šlápl jsem na tu hliníkovou plechovku"" implies that something heavy or hard hit the plastic container, which could potentially cause damage to it but not necessarily destroy it completely. Recycling a container suggests that it has been reused or repurposed in some way, rather than being destroyed entirely. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she learned to communicate (Option B). The premise states that ""the girl joined a debate team,"" indicating that she became involved in verbal communication and argumentation. Learning how to use a computer (Option A) would not necessarily improve her ability to communicate effectively in a debate setting."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Poslouchal jsem hudbu) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""moje nálada"" (my mood), which suggests that the speaker's emotional state has improved after listening to music. Option B (Umyl jsem nádobí) does not provide any context or explanation for why the speaker's mood might have improved. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Měli aukci) is more likely to happen because it implies that they had an auction to raise money for charity, rather than simply feeding homeless people.
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that cestující (passengers) were crying rather than chichotli (chattering). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zkontroloval jsem schránku) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he woke up early (Option B). The reason for this is that the premise does not provide any information about the location of the man or his travel plans, so it is unlikely that he would be able to see the sunrise from a northern location. Additionally, the phrase ""vstal brzy"" means ""woke up early,"" which further supports Option B as the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zrecykloval jsem papír) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Vůdcové jiných zemí poslali nouzové pomocné prostředky) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that he slipped and fell into the pool (Option B). The sentence ""Chlapec měl mokré oblečení"" implies that the child was wearing wet clothes, suggesting that they had been in or near water before the incident occurred."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Měla být vrácena do knihovny) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Byl odsouzen за vraždu) is more likely. The premise states that the criminal was executed, which suggests that he committed a serious crime like murder. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Otevřel jsem závěsy) is more likely to be the cause of the sunlight entering the room because opening curtains allows for natural light to enter a room through windows. Opening doors does not necessarily allow for direct sunlight to enter a room in this way. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she will be pleased ( Option B). The word ""plešatá"" in Czech means happy or delighted, so option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ten rukopis mu připadal přesvědčivý) is more likely. The fact that the editor found the manuscript convincing suggests that it was well-written and effectively conveyed its message, rather than being unclear or confusing.
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Uvědomila si, že karta chybí) is the correct answer. The woman realized she had misplaced her credit card, which means she did not have a valid card to use for purchases or payments. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the woman's credit account was closed without notice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Vzali se) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zvedl jsem hlasitost) is more likely to be the correct answer because it addresses the issue of poor sound quality directly by increasing the volume.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ta holka to rozrušila) occurred. The phrase ""stály na hlavě"" suggests that the boy's hair was standing up or sticking out in an unusual way, which could have been perceived as strange or disruptive by the girl. It is less likely that she would pull his hair, as this action would be more aggressive and unlikely to result in a mild reaction like ""rozrušila""."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (I slapped the fly) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the fly was ""rozdrcený,"" which means it was crushed or smashed. Slapping something typically results in physical harm or injury, so it is more likely that the fly was harmed by being slapped rather than using a repellant against it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otevřel jsem oči"", option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Požádala jsem ho, aby to ztlumil) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Vydělával pod minimální mzdu) is more likely. The passage states that the speaker's family lived in poverty, indicating that they did not have a lot of money to spare. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker had to work for very little pay, rather than saving his money.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Student searched for a job) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the student has graduated from university, indicating that they have completed their education and are now seeking employment. Option B (Took a break) does not provide any context or explanation as to why the student would take a break after graduating, making it less plausible than option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Barva se rozstříkala všude) is more likely to occur. The premise states that yellow was mixed with blue, resulting in a uniform distribution of the color throughout the environment. This implies that the color will spread evenly and consistently, rather than changing into another color like green.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Došel mi čas na rozhovor) is more likely as it suggests that the change in topic was intentional and not due to any negative sentiment.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Vítal jsem ho doma) is the correct answer. The brother was released from the hospital, so he would likely be welcomed home with open arms by his family. Giving him a cold shoulder or treating him poorly would not be a typical response to this situation.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Začala se úvodní scéna hry) is correct. The text states that the lights went up and the actors began their introduction, indicating that the play has started.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Únosce pohrozil, that rukojmímu ublíží) is a more likely cause than option B (Únosce nechal rukojmího samotného). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that there was some kind of threat or warning made by the abductor to the hostage, implying that the abduction was not just random but rather intentional and planned in advance. In contrast, option B does not provide any such context or motivation for the abduction.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hudebník si zaklepal nohou) is more likely as it suggests that the musician hit his foot with force, causing an explosion. This is a more plausible explanation than option B (Hudebník bušil na bubny), which implies that the musician was hitting drums excessively hard, leading to an explosion.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dítě se probudilo křičící z noční móry) is more likely. The fact that parents rushed to their child's room suggests that something was wrong or disturbing, which could have been a nightmare or other scary experience for the child.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Narodila se předčasně) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman communicated with sign language than option B (Narodila se hluchá). The fact that she was born too early suggests that there may have been some developmental delays or challenges that led to her using sign language as a means of communication. In contrast, being born deaf does not necessarily explain why someone would use sign language exclusively. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that úroda (harvest) has been affected by the drought rather than voda (water) being contaminated. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kočka honila ptáka,"" it is more likely that Option B: Pták chytil červa (The bird was caught by the cat)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the school is closed for summer) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zaměstnanci štrajkují) is more likely.   
Explanation: The premise states that the owner of the factory refused to increase wages for employees. This suggests a negative relationship between the owner and the workers, which could lead to them organizing a strike to protest the decision. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Extremists had influence over him) is more likely. The premise suggests that the leader was opposed to extremists in his country, implying that they may have had some level of control or influence over him. This is more plausible than Option B (Extremists assassinated him), as there is no indication in the premise that the leader's death was caused by violent means.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that sand was lying on my feet (Option A). This is because the phrase ""Šla jsem bosá na pláži"" implies that the speaker went to the beach, and therefore their feet would have been exposed to the sand. The second option, ""Vlny se rozbíjely podél pobřeží,"" simply describes a natural phenomenon and does not provide any information about the speaker's experience at the beach."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option B (Vypila jsem sklenici vody) will occur as drinking water can help to cool down the body during hot weather or at night when it's cold outside. Option A (Oblékl jsem si tepláky) may provide some warmth but would not necessarily address the issue of feeling cold.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that her son smiled (Option A). The phrase ""utišila svého syna"" suggests that she silenced or calmed him down, which could be interpreted as a soothing gesture rather than an act of violence. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dírka v mých džínach"" (There's a hole in my pants), option A is more likely. The speaker mentions that they have put their trousers on inside out, which could result in a hole being visible on the outside of the garment. This is more plausible than option B, as it would be difficult to get stuck in a hole on the sidewalk without any prior indication of such an obstacle being present."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ten kluk měl rovnátka,"" option A (Má dutinu) is the most likely answer because a dentist's drill would be needed to create a hole in someone's head. Option B (Jeho zuby se narovnaly) does not make sense in this context as it implies that his teeth have become misaligned, which is an unrelated issue."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dneska jsem se probudil s bolestí svalů) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker experienced muscle soreness after exercising yesterday, which is a common side effect of physical activity. Option B (Dneska jsem se probudil s bolestí krku) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of exercise or any other factor that could cause neck pain. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The other students felt left out because they were not invited to join the girl at lunch.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vylezla zpátky do vzduchu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dopis doručil poštou) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vsadil všechny své peníze) is more likely to happen than option B (Šel domů na mizině). This is because the phrase ""sebevědomý"" suggests that the person has a strong sense of self-confidence or arrogance, which could lead them to take risky financial decisions such as investing all their money in something without proper research or consideration. On the other hand, option B does not necessarily align with this character trait, as it implies that the person went home early due to illness, which may not be a result of overconfidence but rather an unforeseen circumstance."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Vítr se zesílil) is the more likely cause of the fire spreading. The sentence ""Lesní požár se rozšířil"" suggests that the fire has already started in a forest and is now spreading, indicating that there was an initial spark or ignition source that set off the fire. The option that best fits this scenario is Option A, as increased wind speed can contribute to the rapid spread of a fire through a forest."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Jeho matka ho poslala do pokoje) will occur. The reason for this is that the premise states that the child cut off its own knee, which suggests a level of self-harm or impulsivity that may not be addressed by simply applying an elastic bandage (Option B). It is therefore more likely that the mother would take her child to a room for medical attention rather than trying to treat the injury herself with an elastic bandage.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (podepsal svou závěť) is more likely to be the cause of why ten men survived a deadly disease. This is because signing one's will is often seen as a way for someone to prepare for their own death or make final arrangements before passing away. It does not necessarily imply that they received a transplant or any other medical treatment.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kousla jsem se do jazyka) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Autorka se ve svých příbězích vyhýbala předsudkům) is more likely as it suggests that the author was actively avoiding societal expectations in her writing, rather than simply making a mistake.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Spal jsem celý den) is more likely to be the cause of feeling exhausted.
"Response:  Option A: Identifikovala pacientovy příznaky.  
Explanation: The premise states that a doctor diagnosed the patient, indicating that the patient exhibited symptoms that led to the diagnosis. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the doctor identified the patient's symptoms rather than prescribing medication without proper evaluation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zatrapil jsem si kůži,"" option A (Byl to pot) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""zatrapil"" means ""to catch"" or ""to trap,"" so it's possible that the speaker accidentally caught their skin on something while moving around. Option B (""Svědí mě to"") doesn't make as much sense in this context, as there isn't any evidence to suggest that the speaker has a personal experience with being trapped."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (lost nerves) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nouzová operaci"" typically refers to a life-saving or emergency surgery, which suggests that something serious has happened to one of the men involved. While an infarct can also be a serious medical condition, it seems less likely given the context of the situation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zmáčkl ruce) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ten muž zvedl obočí,"" option A (Byl překvapený) is a more likely cause than option B (Byl sklíčen). This is because the word ""zvedl"" in Czech means to lift or raise, which could imply that something unexpected happened to him. The word ""sklíčen"" means to be upset or annoyed, but it does not necessarily convey the same sense of surprise as ""prekvapený."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Věřil jsem, že jeho úmysla byla dobra) is more likely. The speaker seems to be expressing a genuine belief in their colleague's good intentions, rather than simply assuming that they know better.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Začal víc cvičit) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Tělo útočníka bylo bez života) will occur. The phrase ""útočník udeřil"" implies a physical attack, and the use of the word ""udeřit"" suggests a violent act. Additionally, the phrase ""bez života"" means ""without life,"" indicating that the person attacked did not survive the assault. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ten muž mířil špatně) is a more plausible explanation for why the man missed his target than option B (Ten chlap prohrál hru). This is because the word ""mířil"" specifically implies that the man was aiming at something, but failed to hit it due to poor aim or other factors. In contrast, ""prohrál"" simply means ""lost,"" without providing any context or detail about how the loss occurred. Therefore, option A provides a more specific and relevant explanation for why the man missed his target."
"Response:  Option A - Našel v suterénu krysy.  
Explanation: The premise mentions that the homeowner asked for an exterminator to come to his house, indicating that there is a problem with pests in the house. Option A suggests that the exterminator found rodents (krysy) in the basement, which is a common place for them to nest. This is a more plausible explanation than Option B, as it is less likely that someone would have a farm of ants in their bedroom."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I was too tired to cook anything) is more likely. The fact that the speaker was too tired to prepare a meal suggests that they may have been feeling fatigued or exhausted, which could be the reason why they didn't invite their guest for dinner as planned.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she will start hiding her diary (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Woman worked overtime to earn extra money for rent. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ditka quickly turned away her hand) is more likely as it suggests that she was trying to avoid something unpleasant or dangerous, such as a hot spoon.  
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Rozdávali zákazníkům průzkum) is more likely to have a positive impact on customer satisfaction. By conducting surveys, the company can gather valuable feedback from their customers, which they can use to improve their products or services. This will increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to long-term success for the business.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the chlapec vyhodil polštáře z gauče) caused the damage to the wooden floor. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zakryl jsem si obličej,"" it is more likely that option A (Můj nepřítel se mi posmíval) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""zakryl jsem si obličej"" can be translated to ""I covered my face,"" which suggests that someone was making fun of or mocking the speaker's appearance. Option B (""Můj nepřítel zvedl pěst"") means ""My enemy raised his fist,"" which does not fit with the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zasažen bleskem) is more likely as a cause for the famous statue to have burned down. The premise mentions that the statue was ""slavna"" or famous, which suggests that it was well-known and highly regarded. It also mentions that it ""shořela,"" which implies that it caught fire suddenly and unexpectedly. While Option B (Lidé ho přišli uctívat) could be a possible reason for people to gather around the statue, it does not explain why the statue itself would catch fire. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the fruit will rot ( Option A). The sentence ""I have left the apple on the table"" implies that the speaker has neglected to properly care for the fruit, leading to its spoilage. Mice may also nibble on fruit, but this is not as likely a cause of rotting as simply leaving it unattended. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ukazovala na prsty) is more likely as it suggests that she pointed to her fingers, which is a common way of indicating something specific or pointing out an object. Option B (Zmáčkla si kotník) does not make sense in this context as ""kotník"" means ""elbow"", so it would be unusual for someone to bend their elbow while trying to indicate something else."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Naučil se je vázat) is more likely. The text states that the children ""rozvázali"" themselves, implying that they were able to untangle themselves, suggesting that they had learned how to tie their shoes. This makes option A a more plausible explanation for why the children are now running around freely without any shoelaces."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vrátil jsem knihu) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that his parents had an influence on him (Option A). The passage states that ""Ten men had the same beliefs as their parents,"" indicating that there was a strong cultural or familial component to their beliefs. It is unlikely that the men's parents would have completely suppressed their own beliefs and instead encouraged those of their children ( Option B). Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (Došelmu benzin) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the scenario that the driver fell asleep or dozed off, which would be the explanation for Option B (Řidič usnul). Instead, the scenario suggests that the car slowed down and eventually stopped due to a lack of fuel, which aligns with Option A.
"Response:  Option B - Z ledovce kapalo (Melted ice from a glacier flowed).  
Explanation: The premise states that ten men licked an ice cube in the sun, implying that it was exposed to warm temperatures. As a result, option B, ""Z ledovce kapalo"" (Melted ice from a glacier flowed), is the most likely outcome as melting of ice from a glacier would be expected when exposed to warm temperatures."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Koberec vypadal špinavě) is more likely to be the cause of the artwork being damaged. The premise suggests that the damage was caused by something dirty or grimy, which could have scratched or stained the paintings. This is a more plausible explanation than Option B (Stěny vypadají holé), as it does not provide any specific details about how the artwork might have been damaged.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Bolí mě hlava) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Odešel jsem z práce dřív"" suggests that the speaker left work early, which could be due to a headache or other discomfort. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option A (Majitel štěně nakřičel).
Explanation: According to the premise, ""štěně poskvrnilo koberec,"" which means that something was stained by dog's urine. As a result, it is more likely that the owner of the dog will scold or punish the dog for this action rather than giving it a present. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Můj přítel mi odpustil) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Nosil batoh) caused the men to stand out in a crowd. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dokončil své svědectví) is more likely. The text states that the witness lied under oath, indicating that they completed their testimony despite lying. Option B (Byl obviněn z křivé přísahy) suggests that the witness was accused of perjury, but this does not necessarily mean that they did not complete their testimony.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chtěla nový vzhled) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (They were deported) is more likely to occur. The premise states that immigrants were caught staying illegally in the country, indicating that they did not have proper documentation or authorization to be in the country. As a result, it is likely that they would be deported back to their home country rather than finding employment in the host country.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that publikum will smile (option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Slunce mě oslepilo) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Já šňupnul) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: The steak was raw. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ten steaks were difficultly cut. This could be due to a number of reasons, including that the knife used was dull or that the meat was not properly stored or handled before cutting. However, if the steak was raw, it would be much harder to cut than if it had been cooked first, making option B the more likely explanation for why the steak was difficult to cut."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B: Nahromadila obrovské dluhy is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zajímalo by mě, jestli je venku) is more likely. The use of the word ""venku"" suggests that the speaker is interested in whether or not their friend is outside, rather than deciding to visit them. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Květiny se z květu shodily) is more likely. The sentence suggests that flowers have fallen off from their stem, indicating a physical change in the plant. Option B (Cítím vůni květin) means ""I smell the scent of flowers,"" which does not necessarily imply any physical change in the plant. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Potkala kamarádku z dětství) is more likely as it aligns with the sentiment expressed in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the student delayed the work (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Šla jsem do obchodáku) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (It was anonymous) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why the recipient could not recall who had sent the message.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pták mával křídly,"" option A (Kladla vajíčka) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""mával křídly"" means ""has wings,"" indicating that the bird has the ability to fly. Therefore, it is more likely that the bird will use its wings to lay eggs in a tree rather than for the bird to lift itself upwards."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A - ""Garáž byla otevřená"" (the garage was open) - caused the car to park on the arrival path. This is because if the garage were full, it would be unlikely for a car to have been able to park there in the first place. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Oběť zvedla ruce) is more likely to occur. The fact that the perpetrator has aimed a weapon at their victim suggests that they are intent on causing harm, and it is unlikely that the victim would be able to successfully deflect or stop an attacker's bullet without any external intervention. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome in this scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Plánoval jsem se zúčastnit pohřbu mého strýce) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Snil jsem) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker mentions that they have lost something over time, which could be a common occurrence for someone who has been daydreaming or spacing out. It's less likely that the speaker would say ""Bylo mi špatně"" (I was badly), as it doesn't fit with the context of losing something over time."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Option A (the ink was not dry) caused the document to be unreadable. This is because the ink not being dry can make the text blurry or illegible, whereas the paper being worn out may not necessarily affect the readability of the document. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Fanoušci se vrhli na hřiště) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Na stadionu hrála národní hymna"" suggests that a national anthem was being played at the stadium, which could inspire fans to rush onto the field in excitement or patriotism."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Já jsem to podal) is correct. The sentence ""Ten dip měl nudnou chuť"" implies that something was added to a liquid, and Option A suggests that the speaker added salt to it. Therefore, Option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B will occur - there will be leapkavé zbytky left after the liquid has escaped from the paper.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Přečetla si tu knihu znovu) is more likely. The woman has been interrupted while reading her book, so it's more likely that she will want to continue reading from where she left off rather than reserving a page for later.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ten muž si přitáhl pás) is more likely. The fact that a man pulled the cord suggests that he took some sort of action to try to stabilize the plane, which is consistent with the idea that he was trying to prevent it from crashing. In contrast, looking out the window does not necessarily imply any action or intent to prevent the crash. Therefore, option A is more likely given the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the girl ignored him (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Amputated her leg) is more likely. The text states that doctors gave the patient an artificial limb, indicating that they amputated one of their legs. This is a common medical procedure for individuals who have suffered severe injuries or illnesses that cannot be treated otherwise. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She slapped him in the face) is more likely to occur as it aligns with the aggressive tone of the sentence. Option B (She pulled her hand away from him) does not convey a violent or aggressive action.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vážil jsem si jeho názoru) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the boy got into mud (Option A). The phrase ""Blázní mu leželo na botách"" means ""Mud was stuck to his feet,"" indicating that he got into mud while walking or playing outside. Option B does not make sense in this context as blázník (blister) cannot be used to describe a facial injury. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that schools will be closed (Option A). The reason being that snowfall of a few centimeters may not necessarily disrupt daily life or require people to seek shelter underground. While some people might choose to stay indoors due to inclement weather, it is unlikely that schools would be completely shut down for such a minor amount of snowfall.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (went home) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Strom spadl na střechu) caused the damage to the house. Therefore, the answer is (A).
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Strčil jsem dřevo do krbu) is a more plausible explanation for why the wood split into two pieces than option B (Zmáčkl jsem sekyrou dolů k dřevu). This is because the act of putting pressure on the wood with a saw from below would not necessarily result in it splitting into two pieces, whereas placing the wood in a bucket filled with water could potentially cause it to break apart due to the force of the water pressing against it. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the couple announced they are breaking up) is the correct answer. The premise states that Rodina (Motherland) congratulated these two couples, implying that something happy or significant has happened to them. However, if the couple were announcing their breakup, this would be a sad event that Motherland might not typically celebrate with congratulations. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the information given in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Líbal se jí) is more likely. The girl sent a Valentine's Day card to a boy, indicating that she has feelings for him. This suggests that he reciprocated her feelings, making option A the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Byl jsem zmatený) is more likely. The speaker was confused by their friend's statement, indicating that they did not fully understand or agree with it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chtěli najít kompromis) is more likely. The friends wanted to find a compromise rather than making a fair decision because they were not able to agree on what to do with the money. This suggests that they prioritized finding a solution that would work for everyone over making a just or fair decision.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""V kuchyni se spustila časovačka,"" Option A is more likely. The man is putting food into a refrigerator, indicating that he is preparing to store or preserve the food for later use. This is consistent with the idea of time passing in the kitchen, as meals are often prepared and stored in advance. In contrast, Option B does not fit this theme as well, as taking a pizza from a truck would suggest an immediate consumption rather than long-term storage."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tvrdě trabajó) is more likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Jeho syn zdědil jeho majetek) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tažena šlapala po plamenech,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""plameny zhasly"" means ""the flames went out."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Vzali jí řidičák) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman's car was in the repair shop. It is unlikely that she would have had an accident and needed repairs without anyone else being involved. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Udělala jsem snídani) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kameras were focused on him) is more likely. The fact that a public figure stepped out of their luxury car suggests that they are someone who is used to being in the public eye and having cameras around them. It's unlikely that his family would hold a press conference without him knowing about it or being involved in some way.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Voda v koupelně se změnila v vlažnou) will occur. The fact that a woman has been staying in the house suggests that there may be some unusual or unexplained change occurring within the home, such as a gradual buildup of moisture in the bathroom. This could lead to mold growth or other issues with the plumbing system, causing the water in the bathtub to become milky or cloudy. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пřipojil se k bratrstvu) is more likely. The student wants to get to know other students at the university, which suggests that joining a fraternity or sorority might be a good way to do so.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hledal jsem drobné) is more likely as it does not require any significant changes to the living room setup, unlike Option B (Přestavoval jsem obývací pokoj), which would involve a lot of work and effort.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ta osa letěla k chlapci,"" it is more likely that Option A (the boy ran away) is correct. The word ""letěla"" in Czech means ""flew,"" so it suggests that something or someone flew towards the boy, implying that he may have run away to avoid whatever was coming towards him."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was sentenced to public service (Option A). The sentence of death (Option B) would be a much harsher punishment for a minor offense like shoplifting.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the cukr (sugar) will dissolve in the tea rather than the tea itself boiling. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ten veteran kulhal) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Byl povolán do války"" means ""He was drafted into the war,"" indicating that he was involuntarily called up for military service. This is a common occurrence during times of war, and it is less likely that someone would be injured in battle if they were not present at the front lines. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Policie se o oběti postarala) is more likely. The fact that the criminal escaped suggests that the police did not take adequate measures to apprehend him or protect the victim. Therefore, it is more likely that the police were unable to prevent the crime from occurring in the first place.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Upustil jsem ho) is the correct answer because if the laptop was not turning on after plugging it in, it could be due to a faulty power source or a blown fuse, rather than a dead battery.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Našla si rozsáhlý šatník) is more likely. The premise mentions that the woman has exhausted the space in her closet, indicating that she may have acquired a large amount of clothing or other items that require storage. It is less likely that she would simply fold and put away all of her clothes without needing additional storage space. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (his wife left him) is more likely to be the cause of his broken heart.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dostal kvalifikaci pro práci, kterou chtel) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Jeho hlas se jasně ozval po celé sále) is the most likely cause. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Pozdравil publikum.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hodil jsem minci do fontány"", option A (Mince se potopila na dno) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the ball went into the hole (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that I breathed in dust on the ground (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Zákazník použil padělané peníze) is the most likely cause. The fact that the security guard was called to the store suggests that something suspicious has occurred, and the use of counterfeit money is a common tactic used by thieves to commit fraud. Therefore, it is more likely that the customer used fake money than left the lights on in the store.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Kvůli tomu odpadky kuchyň páchla) is the correct answer. The fact that the kitchen smells bad suggests that there is a buildup of trash or food waste inside the kitchen, which could be causing the unpleasant odor. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the kitchen smells bad.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Rodina jel do zoo,"" it is more likely that children were admiring the animals (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Selhaly mu ledviny) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Ten muž dychal hlasitě,"" indicating that he was breathing heavily, which suggests that there may be a problem with his respiratory system, such as congestion or inflammation of the lungs or airways. This could potentially lead to overproduction of mucus, which can cause wheezing or difficulty breathing. In contrast, option B (Jeho plíce were occluded) does not provide any specific information about the location or nature of the blockage, making it less plausible as the cause of the man's heavy breathing."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zeptal jsem se svého přítele, where to be) is more likely. This is because the speaker already has a ticket for the concert and wants to know the location of the venue. Option B (Zeptal jsem se svého přítele, would you like to go) does not make sense in this context as it implies that the speaker's friend might or might not want to attend the concert, whereas the speaker already knows they have a ticket and just needs to know where the concert will take place.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Otevřel jsem okna) is more likely to cause a cooling effect in the house than option A (Přinesl jsem přikrývky). This is because opening windows allows fresh air to enter the house, which can help lower the temperature inside. On the other hand, adding blankets or quilts may not have as much of an impact on the temperature, especially if they are already thick enough to keep the occupants warm. Therefore, option B is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chlapec má bolesti zad,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jeho batoh byla otevřený,"" caused his back pain. The premise suggests that something inside the boy's bag was open or unzipped, which could have caused discomfort or strain on his back. Option B, ""Jeho batoh byl těžký,"" does not provide a clear explanation for why the boy has back pain."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Měla narozeniny) is more likely as it provides a specific reason for why the speaker bought their mother a gift. The other option, Option A (Upekl jsem jí dort), does not provide any clear reasoning or context for why the speaker bought their mother a gift.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (zahradník was stung by a bee) is more likely. The reason for this is that bees are known to attack when they feel threatened or provoked, especially in their territory. It is less likely that a vervet would dig up the garden lights without any apparent reason.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: Zá palky se vytvoril plamen occurred. The premise states that ""Získal jsem zápalku,"" indicating that a fire or flame was obtained. This suggests that the fire grew from the spark (or ""zápalka"") rather than dying out. Therefore, Option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option B (Chtěli si napravit svůj osobní vztah) is more likely as the reason for the countries reaching an agreement. The passage states that ""the two sides have been holding secret talks to resolve their differences,"" indicating that they were trying to find a way to improve their personal relationship rather than avoid discussing something at court."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (their parents died) is the correct answer. The phrase ""were sent to an orphanage"" suggests that the children were separated from their biological parents, implying that they had living parents who could no longer care for them. This supports the idea that their parents passed away rather than simply abandoning them."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Došlo k tsunami) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was dehydrated (Option A). The reason for this is that being dehydrated can cause a person to feel weak, dizzy, or disoriented, which are all symptoms mentioned in the premise. On the other hand, zpanikařit does not necessarily imply any specific physical effects, although it could potentially refer to a state of panic or confusion. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice based on the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pece se zahřála,"" it is more likely that option A (Zapnul jsem troubu) caused the pece to heat up than option B (Dal jsem jídlo do trouby). This is because the word ""zahřála"" suggests a gradual heating process, rather than a sudden or external one like adding food to a pot. Therefore, the most likely explanation for why the pece heated up is that someone turned on the stove or fired the fire underneath it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Citron se plísnil) will occur than option B (Citronový střík). This is because the word ""plísnit"" means to wrinkle or fold, which suggests that the citron may have become misshapen or distorted in some way. The phrase ""střík"" means a small stream or trickle of liquid, which does not seem to be related to the premise at all. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Země kolonizovala zemi) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she fell onto the floor (Option A). The phrase ""ze stolu"" implies that she was sitting at a table or desk, and ""spadla"" means ""fell"". Therefore, Option A is the most plausible outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Stůl se chvěje,"" option A is more likely. The word ""chvěje"" implies a vibration or trembling motion, which could be caused by an uneven surface. Therefore, it is more likely that the podlaha (tabletop) was uneven rather than being slippery."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - his son admitted the truth.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Vzal si sirup proti kašli) will have a positive effect on Jeho hlava's headache. Sirups are often used to soothe sore throats, but they may not be effective for treating headaches. Aspirin, on the other hand, is a common over-the-counter pain reliever that can help alleviate headaches caused by tension or inflammation. Therefore, option B (Vzal si aspirin) is a better choice based on this information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vlak zpomalil,"" Option A is more likely. The train slowed down."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he was diagnosed with depression (Option B). The statement ""he had been through therapy"" suggests that he has already received treatment for his mental health issues, which are commonly associated with depression rather than inherited mental illnesses like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Additionally, the phrase ""ten men have gone through therapy"" implies a relatively high incidence of mental health issues among this group, further supporting Option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Polykla jídlo) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Tažena se jí chopila za krk"" suggests that something has been grabbed or seized hold of, which could refer to a physical object like food. Therefore, it is more likely that the woman grabbed onto something edible rather than being struck by lightning."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that her voice sounded hoarse (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the steak will have been cooked (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zbohatla) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zvonil zvonek) is more likely to be the cause of students leaving their classroom. 
"Response: 
Option B: Její známí se s ní spřízněli. 
Explanation: The passage states that ""Tažena's friends were skeptical"" ( Option A), indicating that they did not believe her claim about seeing a ghost. This suggests that they did not share her belief in the supernatural, and therefore are unlikely to have become closer to her as a result of her experience. On the other hand, option B suggests that her friends became closer to her after she claimed to have seen a ghost, implying that they may have been influenced by her belief in something beyond the natural world. Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Málem se utopil v oceánu) is more likely. The fact that he lost his hearing suggests a traumatic event occurred in or near water, such as nearly drowning. This is more plausible than Option B (Málem ho zabila exploze), which implies an explosion caused by some external factor.
"Response:  Option B: Balónek se zvedl do vzduchu.  
Explanation: The premise states that a child released a chain of balloons. This implies that the balloons were attached to each other in some way, and when the child let them go, they were propelled into the air as a single unit. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as it suggests that all of the balloons rose up into the sky together."
"Response:  Option A - Měl mrtvici.  
Explanation: The premise states that ten men lost their ability to speak, which suggests a neurological or physical issue rather than a psychological one. Mrtvici (stroke) is a common medical condition that can result in speech difficulties, making it the most likely cause among the two options provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (V cementu byla trhlina) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Tažena Zakopla"" suggests that something has been buried or hidden, and the mention of a hole in the concrete further supports this interpretation. It is less likely that she heard someone calling her name while walking down the sidewalk, as there are no other clues in the premise to suggest this possibility. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why Tažena Zakopla was found buried in the concrete."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Záchranář skočil za ním) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""skočil do bazénu"" implies that someone jumped into a pool or basin of water, and Option A correctly states that a rescuer will follow them into the water to save them. Option B does not make sense in this context as it suggests that a man submerged a swimmer in water, which is unlikely given the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Moje infekce se rozšířila) is more likely.
Response:  Option A (Řidič zatlačil na brzdu)
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Namáčel jsem nádobku v teplé vodě) is the more likely cause of the plastic bottle melting. This is because exposure to hot water can cause plastics to soften or melt, whereas placing a plastic bottle directly in sunlight may not have the same effect. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
Response:  Option A (driver hit a phone pole)
"Response:  Option A - Vynechal zkoušku.  
Explanation: The sentence ""Chlapec studoval celou noc"" implies that he studied all night long. Therefore, option A, ""Vynechal zkoušku,"" which means ""He failed the test,"" is more likely to be true because it goes against the implied meaning of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the boy was afraid to learn how to swim) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cítil jsem tlukot srdce) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Moje kancelář byla přeplněná) is true. The sentence ""Byla ve výstavbě"" implies that something was being constructed or built, but does not convey any information about noise levels. Therefore, we can infer that the speaker's office was crowded with people, as suggested by Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Rodina pozvala sousedům na večeři) is more likely. The premise suggests that Rodina wants to get to know her new neighbors better, and inviting them over for dinner is a friendly and social way to do so. Option B (Rodina mávala sousedům ze svého dvora) does not align with this idea of wanting to build relationships with her neighbors.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Z bazénu se rozstříkala voda,"" option A (Plavec se ponořil do bazénu) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nechtěně jsem spolkla semínko) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker accidentally mixed something into the melon, rather than intentionally breaking a tooth.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that his mother was an alcoholic (Option A). This is because the phrase ""odpařená"" specifically refers to someone who has become intoxicated due to excessive drinking, which aligns with the idea of a parent struggling with addiction. The second option does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no clear connection between having loose threads on one's body and being an alcoholic."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tažena si dala ušní zátky,"" it is more likely that she gave herself earbuds (Option B). The phrase ""dala ušní zátky"" specifically refers to putting something in one's ears, which aligns with Option B.
