"Response:  Option B: Termites consumed the tree in the house.  
Explanation: The premise states that termites invaded a home, indicating that they were present inside the dwelling.

Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the information provided."
"Response:  Option B: Patrol agent accused them of smuggling.
Explanation: The premise states that the travelers have reached the border, implying that they are in a foreign country or territory. In this scenario, it is more likely that the patrol agent would accuse them of smuggling rather than checking their passports. Smuggling is illegal activity that often involves hiding or transporting prohibited goods across borders without proper documentation or payment of duties. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."

Option A does not provide any information about the duration of time the girl stayed after school."
"Response:  Option A (Their camp counselor told them a ghost story)
Explanation: The premise states that the young campers were frightened, implying that they experienced some kind of fear or unease. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this by suggesting that their camp counselor told them a spooky tale, which could have easily scared the children. On the other hand, option B does not provide any logical reasoning as to why the children would be frightened after burning a zephyr on a bonfire. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (У него сотрясение мозга) is more likely. The man hitting his head could result in a concussion or other forms of brain injury, such as a subdural hematoma or a skull fracture.

Response:  Option A: Я чувствовался виновным.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the chain broke due to a snapped link (Option B). The phrase ""цепь развалилась"" suggests that the chain was already broken or damaged before it came off the bicycle wheel. Option A does not provide any explanation for why the chain might have come off, so it is less likely that it was simply wrapped around the tire."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (they got tired of arguing) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: She gave testimony in court.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman decided to run for office, implying that she faced opposition or challenges along the way. Giving testimony in court suggests a legal battle or conflict, which is more likely than hiring a campaign manager given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Option B - He packed a large suitcase.

"Response:  Option B: He put on glasses.

Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker stopped talking because he lost his voice. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я положил его в микроволновку) is a more plausible explanation for why замороженная еда оттаилась than Option B (Я прикрыл его пластиковой пленкой). This is because microwaves are designed to heat food quickly and evenly, which could potentially thaw frozen food. In contrast, plastic wrap may not be effective in keeping food cold or preventing it from thawing. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (he had stomach cramps) is more likely. The phrase ""pretended to be sick"" suggests that he was faking his illness, which would not be a plausible reason for having stomach cramps. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Оna pыгнула с трамплина) is more likely because it implies that she jumped from a height into the water, which could result in her falling into the pool.

Explanation: The premise states that the man has lost weight, indicating that he has made an effort to improve his appearance. People are more likely to praise him for this achievement than isolate him."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Она напечатала письмо) is a more plausible explanation for why the girl has wolves' claws than option B (Оna залезла на веревку). The idea of a person growing claws instead of hands is not biologically possible in reality, so it is unlikely that this would happen to a real person. However, printing something could be a possibility if she had access to a printer or other means of creating written content. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
"Response:  Option A (Зрители восторженно поддержали его).
Explanation: The premise states that the circus artist juggled while riding a unicycle, indicating that he performed an impressive feat of balance and coordination. It is unlikely that the audience would be equally impressed by the acrobat's trapeze performance, as it may not have been as difficult or challenging as the juggling act. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Мой друг заставил меня ждать) is more likely. The fact that the speaker lost their patience suggests that they had been waiting for someone or something, and the use of the word ""заставил"" implies that this person intentionally made them wait. Therefore, it is more likely that the friend arrived late than that they arrived early."
"Response:  Option B: They signed a treaty. 
Explanation: The premise states that countries are fighting each other but want peace. This suggests that they may be willing to make concessions and find a diplomatic solution rather than resorting to violence or developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, option B (they signed a treaty) is more likely."

"Response:  Option B: Оna повредила колено.  
Explanation: The word ""врезалась"" in the premise implies a sudden and forceful impact, which could potentially cause injury to the woman's knee or other bones in her body. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Шарик улетел.

Explanation: The premise states that they are travelers who have registered in a hotel room, indicating that they are already at their destination and preparing to leave. Therefore, option B, ""they went to the airport,"" is more likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the persek will be bruised (Option A).

Explanation: The premise states that the speaker's hands became slippery after eating something sweet, indicating that option B (loving sweets) is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option B: Я переоделся.
Explanation: The premise ""Я пролил вино на мою рубашку"" implies that something liquid was spilled onto a shirt, which could cause it to become stained or discolored.

"Response:  Option B: He sent them away.
Explanation: The premise states that the street musician attracted a crowd, but then he ""отослал"" (sent) them away. This implies that he did not receive any money or tips from the people in the crowd, and instead chose to send them away. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the pilot uplifted from the storm (Option A).

"Response:  Option B: Листья накопились на земле.  
Explanation: The premise states that the tree dropped its leaves, indicating that some of the leaves have accumulated on the ground. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for what happened to the leaves."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he decided to make a joke with his sister) is more likely. The fact that he was in a bad mood suggests that he might be looking for ways to lighten up or distract himself, rather than engaging in an activity that requires concentration and effort like playing cards. Making a joke with his sister could be a way for him to momentarily forget about his negative feelings and have some fun together.
"Response:  Option B: His father stopped the car at a gas station.
Explanation: The premise states that the child complained about needing to go to the bathroom, indicating that they are in a vehicle with their father. Therefore, option B, where the father stops the car at a gas station, is more likely as it provides an opportunity for the child to use the restroom. Option A, where the father gives the child a drink of gazirovka, does not address this issue directly and may not provide the necessary relief for the child's discomfort."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Рыба плыла к еде) is more likely. The child sprinkled fish food into the aquarium, indicating that the fish are hungry and would be attracted to the food. Therefore, it is more likely that the fish will swim towards the food rather than jumping out of the aquarium.
"Response:  Option B: Она participated in an act of protest. 
Explanation: The premise states that the woman's political views have changed, indicating a shift in her beliefs or values. Participating in an act of protest is a common way for individuals to express their dissatisfaction with current events or policies, making option B the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B occurred - ""Я налила в неесточную смесь"".

"Response:  Option B: Мы с женой держались за руки.  
Explanation: The premise mentions that the speaker has cramps, which suggests that they are experiencing physical discomfort or pain. Holding hands with their wife is a common way to provide emotional support during difficult times, so it is more likely that this is the cause of the speaker's sudomotor activity (sweating) rather than writing an essay by hand."
Response:  Option A (Я заменил болт).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Городская администрация закрыла квартиру) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Оna хотела посмотреть закат) is more likely. The fact that she sat outside on the balcony suggests that she was enjoying the view of the sunset, rather than thinking she saw a lightning strike.
"Response:  Option B: Вода была мелкой.
Explanation: The premise states that the man was in a life jacket in water, indicating that he was able to float or stay afloat without sinking. If the water were too deep for him to stand or swim in comfortably, it would be unlikely for him to have been able to remain atop the water while wearing a life jacket. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: She pressed the Backspace key.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman made a mistake in the text editor, indicating that she intended to delete something. Pressing the Backspace key would indeed delete the last character typed, making it the most likely option given the context of the situation."
"Response:  Option A: Она получила плохую оценку.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the girl received a bad grade than that she won a contest. The premise mentions that the girl was bragging to her friends, which suggests that she may have been proud of her achievement, but not necessarily something positive like winning a contest. Instead, it could be something negative like receiving a poor grade, which would explain why she might be boasting about it to her friends."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Тrava was dirty,"" option B (He was full of weeds) is a more likely cause than option A (It rained at night). The word ""trava"" in Russian implies that it refers to something that has been trodden or walked upon, suggesting that it may have become dirty through contact with foot traffic or other sources of dirt. In contrast, option A does not provide any specific information about how the area became dirty, leaving open the possibility that it could have simply rained at night without affecting its cleanliness. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the area was dirty."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she forgot to set her alarm clock (Option B). This is because waking up in a hotel room suggests that she may have been away from home for an extended period of time and forgotten to bring her usual alarm clock with her. Additionally, forgetting to set an alarm clock is a common mistake that many people make, especially when they are traveling or away from their usual routine.
"Response:  Option B: Он пошел на пляж.

"Response:  Option A: Игра перешла в овертайм.  
Explanation: According to the premise, fans of a game are brawling over it, suggesting that there is some kind of competition or tournament going on.

"Response:  Option B: Father grabbed son's hand.
Explanation: The premise ""Толпа усилилась"" (The crowd grew stronger) suggests that there was a growing sense of urgency or intensity in the situation, which could lead to a physical confrontation. option B, ""Father grabbed son's hand,"" is more likely because it implies a sudden and forceful action taken by the father to protect his son from an unknown danger."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I cleared the snow from the path) is more likely. The sentence ""Снег перекрывал подъезд"" implies that there was a lot of snow covering the entrance, making it difficult or impossible to access it. Therefore, clearing the snow from the path would be a more practical solution than collecting snow into a ball."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Каяк достиг берега) is more likely. The premise states that каякисты grebli на веслах, indicating that they are using a kayak to paddle through the water. This means that the kayak will be traveling in a straight line until it reaches land, making option A the most likely outcome. Option B (Каяк попал в волну) suggests that the kayak has been tossed by a wave or current, which would not align with the given premise.
"Response:  Option B: Она врезалась в забор.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl lost control of her bicycle. Since she did not mention anything about letting go of the handlebars, it is more likely that she crashed into a fence or a wall rather than simply losing control of the bike."
"Response: 
Option B: Я почувтел, как прохладный воздух проходит мимо меня."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Они были промокшими) is more likely. The premise states that серферы returned to the beach, implying that they had been away from it for some time, possibly due to being wet or having seen an apex predator like an shark. Given this context, it is more plausible that they were indeed wet from surfing rather than having seen an apex predator.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вода вытекла из ванны) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He confessed to her about his infidelity.
Explanation: The premise states that he feels guilty for cheating on his wife, indicating that he has already engaged in the behavior and is now experiencing remorse. Therefore, option B is more likely as it aligns with the character's emotional state and motivations based on the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I poured water on the poster) is more likely to be the correct answer because it would help to dissolve or wash away the black substance that has been smeared onto the poster.

"Response:  Option B: He wet the bed.
Explanation: The premise states that the child woke up to cries, indicating that he or she had an accident during the night by wetting the bed. This is a common occurrence in young children who are still learning bladder control, making option B the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Его отец сел за стол) occurred. The fact that the boy put his legs on the table suggests that he was sitting or standing near the table, and therefore his father could have sat down next to him. It is less likely that the father would be giving lectures while sitting at a distance from the boy.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I waved my hands) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""my friend turned his head in my direction,"" indicating that he was facing away from me beforehand, so I would need to use some action to get his attention, such as waving my hands. Crying out someone's name (Option A) might not have been necessary or effective in this situation."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A: Grazeny ustroi revoljucija (Grazians staged a revolution) will occur. The premise states that the government has been oppressing its citizens, which could lead to frustration and anger among the population, ultimately resulting in a violent uprising or revolution. This outcome is more consistent with the given premise than Option B: Grazhenzy zaregistrovalis for voting (Grazians registered to vote), which does not necessarily imply any significant change in the political situation.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he raised his hand (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She wanted to learn about other cultures) is more likely. The woman's desire to travel abroad suggests that she is interested in exploring new experiences and learning about different cultures, rather than simply wanting to improve her art skills.
"Response:  Option B: His colleague worked late.
Explanation: The premise states that this person was jealous of his colleague, implying that they were in competition with each other. Working late suggests that the colleague may have been putting in extra effort to impress their boss or get ahead in the company, which could be a source of resentment for the first person. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of the person's jealousy."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (he had hallucinations) is more likely. The man's claim of having seen aliens suggests that he may have experienced some kind of psychological or neurological event, such as a hallucination, rather than actually encountering extraterrestrial beings.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (It looked fun) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I warmed it up in the microwave) is a more likely cause for why the sumak started to unravel. The premise mentions that the sumak began to loosen, implying that it was previously tightly sealed. If the sumak had been left out in the open or exposed to heat, it could have caused the fabric to weaken and become less secure, leading to the loose threads. In contrast, option A (I poured oil into the bag) does not provide any explanation as to how this action would affect the sumak's condition. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Электричество в раione вышло) is more likely. The falling tree has caused a power outage in the area, which suggests that there may be an issue with the electrical infrastructure. While option B (Прогноз предсказывал сильный ветер) could also cause damage to trees or power lines, it does not directly explain why the electricity went out in this specific location.
"Response: 
Option B: He offended the audience.
Explanation: The premise states that Speaker made politically incorrect comments, indicating that he may have said something insensitive or hurtful to a particular group of people. This could be considered offensive and would likely cause an adverse reaction from the audience. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."

Explanation: The premise states that the speaker has poked themselves with a pencil, which would cause bleeding rather than sweat to form on their face. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."

"Response:  Option A: Он был простужен.  
Explanation: The man's hoarse voice could be due to a cold or flu, rather than him having quit smoking. This option is more likely given the context of the situation."
"Response:  Option A: Лифт прибыл на назначенный этаж.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Двери лифта открылись"", which means that the doors of the lift opened. This implies that the lift arrived at its designated floor, as it would not have been able to open its doors if it were still in transit or stuck between floors. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Он солгал своим родителям) is more likely. The fact that the teenager ""выскользнул"" out of home suggests that he may have intentionally lied to his parents in order to escape or avoid something. This is a common behavior among teenagers who want to assert their independence or rebel against authority figures. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B, as there is no indication in the premise that the teenager's parents would punish him for simply leaving the house without permission."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Туалет переполнен) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Владелеc надел на щенка ошейник) is more likely. The reason being that an oшейник is a common piece of equipment used to restrain or leash a dog, whereas holding a dog on a povoadkа (Option B) is not a typical practice for pet owners in Russia.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Он стоял под огромным деревом) is more likely. The premise mentions a ""голям"" tree, which suggests that the setting is outdoors and in nature, rather than near water or overlooking it.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I met her at a dinner) is more likely. The fact that he missed her phone call suggests that they are in a relationship or have some kind of connection, so it's likely that he would want to see her in person rather than just calling her again.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Погода была холодной) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the speaker saw their breath when they exhaled.
"Response:  Option A: They wanted to improve working conditions. 
Explanation: According to the premise, workers created a union because they wanted to ""improve their working conditions."" This suggests that they were not satisfied with their current job conditions and sought to make changes through collective action. It is less likely that their employer would voluntarily increase their wages without any external pressure or incentives. Therefore, option A is the more plausible cause for why workers formed a union."
Response:  Option A: Запах гниения заполнил кухню.
"Response:  Option B: She took off her shoes.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman was trying to walk with great difficulty, suggesting that she may have been experiencing discomfort or pain while walking.

"Response:  Option A - Вода кипела.
Explanation: The premise states that a par appeared from a cauldron of water, indicating that the water in the cauldron boiled or vaporized, resulting in the appearance of the par. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it suggests that the water in the cauldron was hot enough to produce steam, which rose and formed the par."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Все мои носки были в прачечной"", it is more likely that Option A - ""Я носил сандаalias"" - is correct. The word ""носки"" (socks) implies that there were multiple pairs of socks in the dryer, while the word ""сапоги"" (boots) would suggest only one pair of boots was in the dryer. Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise."

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that пара will become pregnant (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Миллионер хотел, чтобы здание снесли) is more likely. The fact that the building was dedicated to a millionaire suggests that he had some sort of connection or ownership interest in it, which could have led him to want it torn down for various reasons. Option B (Миллионер пожертвовал средства на его construction) does not provide any indication of why the millionaire would want the building demolished.
"Response:  Option A (Продавец видел, как девушка положила товар в сумочку).

"Response:  Option B: Солдаты воссоединились со своими семьями.
Explanation: The premise states that the country has declared war on a neighboring territory, indicating a conflict situation. In this scenario, it is less likely for soldiers to be sent to war as they would be focused on defending their own country's borders rather than attacking another territory. Therefore, option B, where soldiers reunite with their families, is more plausible."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Перед зданием суда начался бунт) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Она оставила печенье в духовке) is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for why the girl would smell something burning if she left a pie in the oven.

"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A - ""Лифт перестал работать"" (The lift stopped working) is the correct answer.

"Response:  Option B: Father kicked son out of the house.
Explanation: The father's anger towards his son's alcoholism is understandable, but kicking him out of the house may not be an appropriate or effective solution to address the problem. It could lead to further isolation and harm for the son, rather than encouraging him to seek help and support. Therefore, option B is a more likely outcome in this scenario."
"Response:  Option B - Лифт был неиспаранным.
Explanation: The premise states that the lawyer ""поднялся по лестнице в свой кабинет,"" indicating that there was no lift available for him to use. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of his situation."
"Response:  Option B: His friend bought him dinner.
Explanation: The premise states that the man became angry with his friend because he (the friend) bought him dinner. This implies that the man did not expect or want to be given food by his friend, hence becoming angry. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of the man's anger."
"Response:  Option B: Кассир забыл дать девушке квитанцию.  
Explanation: The premise states that the girl gave her money to the cashier, but there is no mention of a receipt or any other proof of payment. Therefore, it is more likely that the cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt than for the cashier to have given her a fake one."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Оna was paralyzed in a car accident) is more likely. The phrase ""посадили в инвалидное кресло"" suggests that the woman has been confined to a wheelchair for an extended period of time, which is consistent with being paralyzed from an injury such as a car accident. It is less likely that she would be using a wheelchair if she had recently entered the hospital on foot or by ambulance."
"Response:  Option B: Страна столкнулась с экономическими трудностями. 
Explanation: The premise states that citizens are taking down their national flag from their homes, indicating a decline in the country's economic situation or political stability. This is more likely to be caused by an economic crisis than a celebration of independence."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Они вдохновляли своих поклонников) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Я чувствовал гордость.
Explanation: The premise states that someone suggested that food got stuck in your teeth, which could be embarrassing for you. Therefore, option B (feeling proud) is a more likely response."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he forgot to study) is more likely. The boy failing his history exam suggests that he did not prepare adequately for the test, which could be due to forgetting to study rather than being inattentive during class.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Землетрясение обрушилось на город) is the most likely cause of the building collapse in the city center. Earthquakes are a common natural disaster that can cause widespread destruction, including collapsing buildings. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Он умолял ее принять его обратно) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Their heads collided.
Explanation: The premise states that two children simultaneously reached out to grab a ball, implying that their heads would collide if they were to meet in mid-air. This outcome is more likely than option A, where the ball would simply fly away from them without any physical interaction."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (В мусорной корзине был картон) is more likely. The premise mentions that the raccoons searched through a trash can, indicating that they were looking for something inside it. Since cardboard is a common item found in trash cans, it's more likely that the raccoons were searching for this specific item rather than just the kiosk being covered with garbage.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It was cheap) is more likely. The reason being that the word ""дешево"" in Russian means ""cheaply"", so it suggests that the boy's action of shutting the pencil case was done at a low cost or expense."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Оna потеряла свою квитанцию) is more likely. The fact that the cashier refused to return the money suggests that there was a problem with the transaction, such as the woman losing her receipt. It's less likely that the clothing didn't fit because the cashier would have simply returned the money without questioning it further.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (Он оставил шрам) is correct. The word ""поцарапание"" in Russian means ""scratch,"" so it is likely that the speaker has been scratched or injured in some way, resulting in a scar."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (He was talking to himself) is more likely. The passage states that ""strange glances"" were thrown his way by other passengers, indicating that they found him unusual or suspicious behavior. Talking to oneself in a public place can be seen as strange or odd behavior, making option B more plausible than option A."
"Response:  Option A - Muaves were crawling to the crumbs. 
Explanation: The premise states that a child left crumbs on the floor, implying that there are food scraps available for insects like ants or cockroaches (not muaves) to feed on. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the muaves are crawling towards the crumbs, rather than option B where the child has cleaned up the hlel."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сестра женщины сжала руки) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He was worried about an unpleasant smell from his mouth.
Explanation: The premise states that the man took a coin, but it doesn't provide any information about his appearance or behavior. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause as it suggests that he was concerned about something related to his mouth rather than his face."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They overslept) is more likely. The phrase ""пораньше"" suggests that they woke up earlier than expected, which could be due to oversleeping. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why they are running late."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (her colleague covered for her) is more likely.  Why? Because the premise states that she didn't come to work, implying that something unexpected happened or that she was unable to attend. It is unlikely that her boss would praise her in this scenario, as it would be unusual for someone to miss work without a valid reason. On the other hand, if a colleague were to cover for her absence, it could be seen as a kind gesture to help her avoid any consequences or repercussions from her boss or others at work.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He supported their cause) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He remembered his lines.
Explanation: The premise states that the actor's heart was racing before his performance, indicating anxiety or nervousness. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including forgetting one's lines. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the actor's heart racing."
"Response:  Option B: Я развернул карту.
Explanation: The premise ""Я был потерян"" implies that the speaker was lost or disoriented, which could lead to confusion about their surroundings and potentially cause them to misplace something important like a map. Therefore, option B - ""Я развернул карту"" (I unfolded the map) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker tried to find their way back using a map."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Его съели) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Двигатель перегрелся) is more likely. The premise mentions that the machine broke down, which could be caused by overheating of the engine. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the machine stopped working.
"Response: 
Option B: He lay in bed for several days."
"Response:  Option B: В доме было холодно.  
Explanation: The premise states that the fire in the stove has gone out, indicating that there may not have been enough heat in the room to keep the fire burning. Therefore, option B, ""In the house it was cold,"" is a more plausible explanation for why the fire went out than option A, ""I ran out of wood."""
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У нее судороги в боку) is more likely. The premise states that the woman has stopped running, which could be due to a medical condition such as a side stitch or heart problems, both of which can cause shortness of breath or pain in the side. These symptoms are more likely to occur than simply having fainted or overbreathed, which are the alternatives suggested in Option B.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Моя соседка ушла из дома) is more likely. The fact that I knocked on my neighbor's door suggests that someone was home, so it is unlikely that they would have left their house without warning. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ее муж неправильно понял ее беспокойство) is more likely. The woman's sigh of disappointment suggests that her husband did not understand her concerns, rather than him kissing her goodbye.
"Response: 
Option A: Студент правильно ответал на вопрос."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She went to the supermarket) is more likely. The premise implies that she has run out of eggs at home, so it makes sense for her to go to a store where she can buy more eggs rather than going to a farm.
"Response:  Option B: I hugged him.
Explanation: The premise states that you met an old friend, which implies a positive interaction. Hugging someone is a common way to express affection or warmth towards them, making option B more likely than option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Оna поймала рыбу) is more likely. The premise mentions that the woman avoided getting into the lake, suggesting that she was trying to avoid something in the water rather than being infected by it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (his zinc was broken) is more likely. The student came to class wet because he had been caught in a sudden rain shower while riding his bike to school. This is a common occurrence in many places, especially during rainy seasons or near bodies of water. It's less likely that someone would steal a student's bicycle just before class, as it would be an unusual and illegal act. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the student arrived at class moist.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Пользователь нажал на мышь"" - is the correct answer. The movement of the cursor on the screen suggests that the user has interacted with the computer through a mouse click or other input device, rather than physically moving the mouse itself."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (На главной дороге произошла авария) is more likely. The phrase ""водитель сделал обход"" suggests that the driver took a detour or made an illegal turn to avoid the accident on the main road. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the driver decided to take a different route."
"Response:  Option A - Belongings dried up.
Explanation: The premise states that the protagonist hung wet laundry to dry, implying that it has been left there for some time to air dry. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome as the laundry would have already dried up by the time the story takes place."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Солнечный свет был ярким) is more likely to be the correct cause for why she put on her sunglasses. The sun was shining brightly, making it necessary for her to wear sunglasses to protect her eyes from the glare.
"Response:  Option B: He thought it was beautiful.
Explanation: The premise states that the man was looking at the night sky, indicating that he was in a contemplative mood. Option B better captures this idea by suggesting that he found beauty in the night sky, rather than wishing for something else to happen (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option B, ""I didn't sleep all night,"" is the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker felt exhausted, which could be caused by a lack of sleep."
Response:  Option A - Он отрастил волосы.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (мальчик не любил нового одноклассника) is more likely. The fact that the boy pretended to be mean to his new classmate suggests that he may have had negative feelings towards him, rather than being friendly or welcoming.
"Response:  Option A - Я ел печенье (I ate cookies).
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker is thirsty for milk, but there is no mention of eating anything related to milk like cookies or cereal. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the driver turned on their headlights (Option A). The reason for this is that turning on the headlights would provide better visibility during a rainstorm than turning around (Option B), which would not affect the visibility in any way. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (I parked opposite) is correct. The sentence ""Парковка здания была пустой"" implies that there were no cars parked near the building, which means that the speaker had to park somewhere else, such as opposite the building. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (writer's block) is more likely. The fact that the writer didn't deliver the project on time suggests that she may have been experiencing a creative block or lack of inspiration, rather than simply editing her draft.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I provided my identification number) is more likely to be the cause of the partner hanging up the phone. This is because providing one's identification number may be a requirement for verifying one's identity in certain situations, such as when calling a business or organization. It is less likely that asking someone to speak with their boss would result in them hanging up the phone without further explanation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ветр дул через открытое окно"", option B (Занавески дрожали) is more likely. The wind blowing through an open window would cause the curtains to tremble, not a phone call or someone knocking on the door."
"Response:  Option B: I turned off the main switch.
Explanation: The premise states that the electricity in your home has been turned off, indicating that the main switch was probably turned off. This is a more common reason for an electrical outage than accidentally turning off a lamp or tripping a circuit breaker. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: He lifted a barbell above his head.  
Explanation: The premise states that the heavyweight lifter burst out laughing, indicating that he was amused by something. Lifting a barbell above one's head is a common weightlifting exercise, so it is more likely that the heavyweight lifter was doing this when he burst out laughing rather than bending over in front of a mirror to admire his muscles."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He got confused) is more likely. The student was trying to do calculations in his head, but he became confused instead of successfully completing them. This suggests that he may have been struggling with mental math or had difficulty understanding the problem, rather than simply using a calculator as an aid.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Отец поменял пеленку ребенку) is more likely. The fact that the child has a new pacifier suggests that someone else may have given it to him, rather than his father changing it himself.
Response:  Option B - Мальчик промок.
"Response:  Option B: На фотографиях все отказывались улыбаться.  
Explanation: The premise states that the photographer forgot to use the flash, which means that the lighting in the photos was insufficient. As a result, the faces of the people in the photos are likely to be underexposed and dark, causing them to appear unsmiling or even blank-faced. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Я был за городом.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker declined an invitation to a birthday party, indicating that they were not present at the event. Since the speaker was not present, it is more likely that they were away from the location of the party, hence option B."
"Response:  Option A: Я чувствовался энергичным.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker was engaged in sports, which can be a physically demanding activity that requires energy and endurance. Therefore, option A, feeling energized, is the most likely cause for the speaker's state of being."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he absorbed water (Option A). The premise states ""Я выжала влажную губку,"" which implies that she squeezed a wet sponge, not that water came out of him. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Курорт был на острове.  
Explanation: The phrase ""на острове"" suggests that the resort is located on an island, which makes it more likely that the passengers are stranded there due to bad weather or other unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Она боялась iggl) is more likely. The reason for this is that tattoos are typically associated with a deliberate and conscious decision to mark one's body, rather than something that someone would be afraid of. Additionally, the idea of being ""afraid"" of an tattoo needle does not make much sense, as it is a medical procedure that is performed under sterile conditions by trained professionals using proper equipment. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why a teenager might have a tattoo."
"Response:  Option B: Я вызвала полицию.  
Explanation: Given the premise that an unfamiliar car has been parked outside the speaker's home, it is more likely that they will call the police to report the situation rather than become suspicious themselves. The presence of a strange vehicle in their neighborhood could be perceived as a potential threat or security risk, prompting them to contact law enforcement for assistance."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Доказательства указывали на него) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He avoided caffeine.
Explanation: The premise states that the person wants to lose weight, but it doesn't mention anything about giving up sweets or sugary foods. It only mentions avoiding caffeine, which could potentially help with weight loss due to its diuretic effects. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A: Оna поскользнулась.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl stepped onto the ice, which means she was walking on it. Therefore, option A is more likely as she would have slipped or skated on the ice rather than dangling (option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She didn't sleep all night) is a more plausible explanation for why there are dark circles under her eyes than Option B (She put her son to bed). The premise suggests that she hasn't slept well, which could be due to various reasons such as stress, insomnia, or other health issues. It's less likely that she would purposely keep her son awake in order to have dark circles under her eyes.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вулкан взорвался) is more likely. The premise states that lava flowed out of a volcano, indicating an explosive eruption. This is consistent with Option A, as an explosive eruption would result in the release of magma and ash from the volcano. In contrast, Option B (Вулкан был неактивным) implies that the volcano was not active, which does not explain why lava flowed out of it. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Оna knew everyone at the party) is more likely. The premise states that she wore a new pair of shoes to the party, indicating that she wanted to make an impression or stand out in some way. It's unlikely that she would wear a new pair of shoes if she didn't want to be noticed by anyone at the party. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She beheaded me at the tollbooth) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He squandered his fortune. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the director of a company has lost all their money through reckless spending or poor financial management, indicating that they have squandered their fortune rather than sold their shares."
"Response:  Option B: Человек почувёл себя плохо.  
Explanation: The premise states that a man went to see a doctor, indicating that he may be feeling unwell or experiencing some medical issue. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Дом был в огне) is more likely. The fact that the speaker ""вышел из спальни через окно"" suggests that there was a dangerous situation in the house, such as a fire, which would explain why they left through the window rather than going out through the door. Option B (Дом был пуст) does not provide any information about the state of the house or the reason for the speaker's departure."
"Response:  Option B: Он обеспенял руки мылом. (He washed his hands with soap.)
Explanation: The premise states that the boy's fingers became stiff, indicating that he had been exposed to something that caused rigidity or hardening of the muscles. Washing one's hands with soap can cause this effect, as it can dry out and irritate the skin, leading to stiffness or hardening of the fingers. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Молоко было кислое) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker spat out milk than option B (У меня уста были сухими). The premise suggests that the milk was sour or unpleasant to drink, rather than simply being too dry in the mouth. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Option B: Опоздал на работу.
Response:  Option B - Машина разбилась.
"Response:  Option A: Они победили.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the team deliberately rigged the competition in their favor, which means they are likely to have won it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Я скрутил крышку.  
Explanation: The premise states that the bottle of soda is shaking, indicating that it has been opened. Since the cap is not mentioned to be loose or twisted, it is more likely that the person accidentally screwed off the cap while handling the bottle, causing it to shake. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (He climbed up to the roof) is more likely. The reason being that there is no indication in the premise of any means for him to pass through an open window. On the other hand, the possibility of him climbing up to the roof is higher as it provides a direct path for escape.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Женщина заглянула в дверь через отверстие от ключа) is more likely. The phrase ""постепенно заглянула"" suggests a gradual movement towards the door, which implies that she was not immediately visible through the keyhole. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He hung it in his closet) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Девочка выплюнула зубную пасту.
Explanation: According to the premise, a girl squeezed out toothpaste from a tube. This means that she must have put pressure on the tube, causing the toothpaste to come out. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the girl spat out the toothpaste rather than the toothpaste coming out of its own accord."
"Response:  Option B: Пацифисты провели парад. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the number of civilian casualties has increased significantly due to war. This suggests that there may be a larger presence of military forces in the area, which could lead to an increase in clashes with civilians. In this scenario, it is more likely that pacifists would organize a protest or demonstration to raise awareness about the conflict and its impact on innocent lives rather than holding a parade."
"Response:  Option B: Лента выглядела как у ребенка.  
Explanation: The premise states that the girl pulled a thread from her hair, implying that she was playing with it or handling it in some way. It is unlikely that she would have tied the thread into a knot, so option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option B: He looked younger.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Яйцо вылупилось) occurred. The premise states that ""из яйца выросло куриное цыпленок,"" which implies that the chicken hatched from an egg. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how the chicken came to be."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he died (Option A). The premise states that the prisoner was starving himself, which can lead to serious health complications and even death if left untreated. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He fell from the ladder) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Он глоток соды) is more likely. The child has swallowed a whole bottle of drain cleaner, which can be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if ingested in large quantities. It's unlikely that the child would have simply opened a container of drain cleaner without their parent's knowledge or supervision.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Я дрожал) is more likely. The cold air flowing through the window would cause the person to shiver or tremble.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (her classmates respected her) is more likely to be the cause of why she received a scholarship to college.  
Explanation: The premise states that the student received a scholarship to college, indicating that they demonstrated exceptional academic achievement or potential. It is unlikely that the student received a scholarship solely based on their classmates' respect for them, as this would not necessarily reflect their academic abilities. Therefore, Option A is more plausible."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She lived next door to him) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why she would have seen him often. Option B (She was in love with him) does not provide any specific reason for their frequent interactions beyond mere speculation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (У него не было денег) is more likely as the reason why the homeless man stole food. The premise states that he was hungry, implying that he did not have enough money to buy food. Therefore, it is more plausible that he resorted to stealing rather than relying on charity or feeling sorry for himself.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я хотела уединения) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the speaker called a friend to talk, which implies a desire for social interaction rather than solitude.
"Response:  Option B: Я ударил его.
Explanation: The premise states that a man extended his hand to me, indicating a friendly or peaceful gesture. However, option B suggests an aggressive response, such as hitting him, which is less likely given the context of the situation. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Я ударил его."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Фейерверки запускались в воздух) is more likely than Option B (Фрисби поднялся вверх к моей голове).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Она волновалась) is more likely as it aligns with the emotional state of a child who has just bitten their nails.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я записала встречу в календарь) is more likely as it provides a specific action that could have caused the calendar to be turned over. Option B (Это было начало нового месяца) does not provide any information about why the calendar was turned over, making option A a more plausible explanation.
"Response:  Option B: He filed for divorce.
Explanation: The husband discovered that his wife was cheating on him, which would be a significant reason for filing for divorce. It's unlikely that he would fire his lawyer without taking any further action to address the situation."
Response:  Option A: Мяч отскочил.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Она стерла свой ответ) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Его соперник перехватил пас) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the player has caught his opponent, implying that the opponent was in possession of the ball at some point, and therefore could have been intercepted by the player. Option B (Его противник упал на землю) does not necessarily imply that the opponent was in possession of the ball beforehand, so it is less likely to occur based on the given information.
"Response:  Option A - Они были созревшими.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker pulled ripe tomatoes from a grapevine. This implies that the tomatoes were already mature and ready to be harvested, rather than needing water or care to grow. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: He bought his girlfriend chocolates.
Explanation: The premise states that he wanted to be romantic, which suggests that he may have taken some effort to impress or surprise her. Buying chocolates for someone is a common romantic gesture, making option B more likely than option A."
"Response:  Option B: Погода стала тепнее.
Explanation: The premise states that the mercury in the thermometer has risen, indicating a rise in temperature. This is more likely to be caused by an increase in ambient temperature rather than dropping the thermometer. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (На шоссе опасно ледяное) is more likely. The phrase ""tornade has hit the city"" implies that there will be significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, including roofs collapsing or windows shattering. However, a lethal ice patch on the road would not necessarily cause widespread destruction. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the premise provided."
Response:  Option A: His grades improved.
"Response:  Option A (Я опустился на колени).
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker felt comfortable, which suggests a relaxed state of being. Option A better fits this description as it implies a physical action that would help the speaker feel even more relaxed and at ease."
Response:  Option B: Она стала блестящей.
"Response: 
Option B: Кофе был сладким.
Explanation: According to the premise, я добавил сахар в кофе (I added sugar to coffee). This implies that the coffee became sweeter as a result of adding sugar. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - He broke the papers.
Explanation: The premise states that the man ""перетасовал"" (perezatsoval) the papers, which means he crushed or broke them. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B: Ногть ржавела.
Explanation: The premise ""Я ударил по гвозду молотом"" implies that a forceful impact was applied to the nail with a hammer. As a result of this impact, the nail may have bent or deformed, but it is unlikely to get stuck in the tree. On the other hand, the option ""Гвоздь застрял в деревне"" suggests that the nail got stuck in the wood after being driven into it, which is a more plausible outcome given the premise provided. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Рыбак затащил рыбу) is more likely. The word ""укусила"" in the premise implies that something bit or attacked the line, so it's more likely that a fish bit the line than the fisherman reeling it in."
"Response:  Option B: Она сняла брекеты.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the boy was embarrassed to go to school because he had braces. Therefore, option B (she took off her braces) is a more plausible cause for why he would be less embarrassed to go to school."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я с лицом в восторге,"" option A (I received good news) is more likely as it suggests a positive emotion such as joy or excitement, whereas option B (I lost patience) does not align with this emotional tone."
"Response:  Option B: Мои руки были мокрые.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker has wiped their hands with a towel, implying that they were dirty or wet. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause - the speaker's hands were moist."
"Response:  Option B: He spilled paint on the chair.
Explanation: The premise states that the person lost balance while sitting on a chair. This could be caused by many factors such as slippery floor or uneven surface but it's unlikely to be caused by the chair itself moving under him without any external force applied. Therefore option B is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (they lost their game) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я пожалел о своей ошибке) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The man's constant talking about himself suggests that he may be boring his date with too much information about himself, rather than asking her questions to get to know her better.
Response:  Option B: У нее появились ямочки.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Корабль врага взорвался"", option A (Он прошел мимо шахты) is more likely. The explosion of an enemy ship suggests that it was attacked or damaged in some way, making it unlikely that he passed by a shaft without noticing anything out of the ordinary."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (he stepped on broken glass) is more likely. The premise mentions that he ""проколол"" himself, which means he pierced or punctured his own skin. This could only happen if he accidentally stepped on something sharp, like broken glass. Therefore, Option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Они нашли оружие на месте преступления.
Explanation: The premise states that detectives searched the crime scene for fingerprints, indicating that they were looking for evidence related to the identity of the perpetrator. Since finding weapons at a crime scene is often an important piece of evidence in criminal investigations, option B is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I asked for a ride) is more likely. The premise states that there were many traffic jams on the highway, making it difficult to drive through them. Asking for a ride would be a more practical solution in this situation than trying to find an alternate route.
Response:  Option B: Many people have become unemployed.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (they were planning to board a train) is more likely. The guard's warning suggests that he has spotted children attempting to cross the tracks without proper supervision or safety measures in place, which could be dangerous. It does not necessarily imply that they are from his area or that he recognizes them personally.
"Response:  Option B: He made a sarcastic remark.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker turned their eyes towards their friend, indicating that they are paying attention to them. However, the option B choice provides a sarcastic explanation for why the speaker is looking at their friend, suggesting that they may be mocking or making fun of their friend rather than genuinely interested in them. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Водитель застрял на дороге) is more likely. The fact that the driver has run out of gas suggests that they have been driving for some time and may have gotten stuck in traffic or encountered another obstacle that prevented them from stopping to refuel earlier. Therefore, it is more likely that the driver will be stranded on the road than that they will pick up a hitchhiker.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ребенок родился) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: На улице было ветрено.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Шляпа у него улетела,"" which means that his hat flew away from him. This implies that there was a strong gust of wind, which is option B. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Оna получила приглашение) is more likely. The premise states that the girl was present at a party to celebrate her classmate's birthday, indicating that she received an invitation to attend. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Его мать took his temperature) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A (He wanted to impress his girlfriend).
Explanation: The premise states that the man sprayed himself with cologne in order to make an impression on his girlfriend. This suggests that he was trying to impress her, rather than simply using the gel on his hair. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Я took a shovel.  
Explanation: The premise states that the electricity in the house was turned off, indicating that there may be an issue with the power supply or distribution system. Taking a shovel suggests that the speaker plans to investigate or fix the problem themselves, rather than simply finding a flashlight to light their way."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B: Мать родила близнецов is more likely. The family has recently moved into a larger house, indicating that there are now more people living in the household. This suggests that either the parents or one of their children have had a baby (or babies), as having multiple children at once is less common than moving to a larger home for other reasons. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause based on the information given.
"Response:  Option B: Она видела финишную черту.  
Explanation: The premise states that the marathon runner continued to run at a slow pace, indicating that they have already reached the finish line. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause - she saw the finish line."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Machine spat out a test) is more likely. The premise mentions that the boy went through an automatic teller machine, implying that he inserted his card and entered his PIN code to withdraw cash. If the machine had spit out a test instead of cash, it would be unexpected and unusual behavior for the machine. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Я перевернул глаза на него) is the correct answer. The phrase ""перевернул глаза"" means to stare or glare at someone in a menacing way, indicating anger or hostility towards the person. This reaction is more consistent with the emotions of someone who has just lost their pet than Option B (Я обняла him), which implies a more comforting or empathetic response."
"Response:  Option B: He paid cash.
Explanation: According to the premise, the businessman's credit card application was rejected. This suggests that he may not have had access to a credit card or may not have wanted to use one for some reason. Therefore, it is more likely that he paid cash rather than writing a check."
"Response:  Option B: Он ударился ногой.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man was cursed, implying that something bad happened to him. Option B suggests that he struck himself with his foot, which could be a result of frustration or anger, making it a more plausible explanation for why the man was cursed."
"Response:  Option B: His brother was accepted into law school.
Explanation: The premise states that the man ""grew up with a sense of pride"" about his brother, implying that they have a close relationship. Therefore, option B, where the brother gets accepted into law school, is the most likely cause for the man's pride."
"Response:  Option B: Она посмотрела на звезды.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that the girl wanted to learn about the Solar System, it is more likely that she would look at the stars rather than go to a library. The stars are visible in the night sky and can be seen from anywhere, whereas a library may require her to physically go there to access information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I stuck a sticky note to the back of the poster) is more likely. The fact that the poster has been attached to the wall suggests that it was placed there intentionally, rather than being accidentally knocked onto the wall. Additionally, the use of a sticky note implies a deliberate action, rather than simply having the poster blown or pushed onto the wall.
"Response: 
Option B:Architect changed plans."
"Response:  Option B: He licked the spoon.
Explanation: The premise states that a man dropped a spoon, implying that he was holding it with his hand. If he had been dropping something else, such as a book or a toy, then option A would be more likely. However, since the premise specifically mentions a spoon, it's more likely that he accidentally licked it instead of his hand shaking."
"Response:  Option B: Council of directors found a replacement. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the general director submitted his resignation, indicating that he left his position voluntarily. Therefore, it is more likely that the council of directors will find a replacement rather than dissolving the company entirely."
"Response:  Option B: Я подошел к трибуне.
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker overslept and arrived late for class. As a result, it is more likely that they would approach the lectern from behind rather than sitting in the back row. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he attacked a fellow inmate) is more likely to be the reason for his release from prison.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Their home burned down) is more likely. The family lost all their belongings, indicating that they no longer have a place to live or any possessions left. This suggests that their home was destroyed in a fire, rather than them selling it.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the aluminum can was crushed (Option B). When you step on an aluminum can, it will deform and potentially break open due to the pressure of your foot. This is because aluminum is a soft metal that can be easily dented or crushed. In contrast, food preserved in a tin can is typically stored under high pressure to prevent spoilage, so it is less likely to burst open when stepped on. Therefore, Option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She learned to communicate) is more likely. The premise states that she joined a debate team, indicating that she has become more confident in her ability to express herself verbally. This suggests that she may have improved her communication skills rather than learning how to use a computer.
"Response:  Option B: I washed dishes.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Мое настроение улучшилось,"" which means ""My mood improved."" This suggests that something positive happened to improve the speaker's mood. Washing dishes is a chore that is often associated with relaxation or meditation, so it is more likely that option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Option B: Они провели аукцио
"Response:  Option B: Пассажиры кричали.  
Explanation: The premise states that Gorka has fallen into a deep hole, implying a dangerous or frightening situation. Therefore, it is more likely that the passengers would be screaming in fear rather than giggling."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я был в ярости"" (I was in a rage), option B is more likely. The speaker locked the door when they left the house, indicating that they were in a state of anger or frustration."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He early) is more likely. The man wanted to watch the sunrise, so he got up early to do so. Option A (He went north) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the man traveled north to see the sunrise.
Response:  Option A - Я переработал бумагу.
"Response:  Option B: Лидеры других стран прислали срочную помощь.  
Explanation: Given that the nation has been through a natural disaster, it is more likely that other countries would send immediate aid to help with relief efforts rather than forming a union to address the aftermath. This option better aligns with the scenario presented in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Он вылез из басейна) is more likely. The fact that the boy's clothes are wet suggests that he has recently gotten out of a body of water, such as a bathtub or a swimming pool. It is less likely that he would have fallen into the water accidentally while playing outside. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the boy's clothes are wet.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Его должны были вернуть в библиотеку) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He was convicted of murder) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я открыл шторы) is more likely as it directly relates to the sunlight entering the room through the windows. Opening a door would not have the same effect.
"Response:  Option B: Она пополыла.
Explanation: The premise ""Я потянула обманщика за волосы"" implies that someone was deceived or tricked in some way. The word ""пополыла"" (po-polys'a) means to blow a raspberry at something or someone, which is often used as an expression of disbelief or mockery. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Option A: He found a convincing manuscript.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (she understood that the card's expiration date had been reached) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Они поженились.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Мужчина и женщина влюбились,"" it is more likely that they got married than that they were in college together. The idea of a romantic relationship leading to marriage is a common trope in many cultures, while the connection between college and marriage is less direct."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I composed my song) is more likely. The speaker mentions that they are not able to hear the music because it's too weak, suggesting that they are trying to listen to something but can't make out the details. This implies that they have some level of musical knowledge or interest, as they are attempting to listen to music despite its poor quality. Given this context, it seems more plausible that the speaker would try to create their own music rather than simply turning up the volume.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Девочка вытащила его) is more likely. The premise states that the boy's hair has come out, implying that something external caused it to happen, such as another person pulling or tugging on his hair. Option A (Девочка его разозлила) does not provide a clear explanation for why the boy's hair would come out.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Я распылил себя репеллентом от насекомых) is the correct answer. The phrase ""загвозденная"" suggests a state of confusion or disorientation, which could be caused by an insect repellent. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker is feeling this way."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я открыла глаза"", option A (Я проснулся) is a more likely cause than option B (Я расслабился). This is because opening one's eyes typically requires waking up from sleep or some other state of unconsciousness, rather than relaxing."
Response:  Option B: Я попросил у него took his disc.
"Response:  Option B: He earned less than minimum wage.
Explanation: The premise states that His family was poor, indicating that he did not earn enough to support his family financially. Therefore, option B is a more plausible cause for why he could not afford anything."

Option B: He took up a hobby."
Response:  Option B: Краска became green.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Мне не о чем был говорить) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I greeted his return home) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Занавес на сцене поднялся,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Началась открывающая сцена пьесы,"" is correct."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Похититель угрожал причинить вред заложнику) is a more plausible cause for why the hostage complied with the kidnapper's order. The fact that the hostage was left alone suggests that the kidnapper may have threatened or intimidated him/her in some way to get cooperation. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Option B: Musician stomped his foot. 
Explanation: The sound of a loud thud or stomp is more likely to be caused by a musician stomping their foot than tapping it with their nose. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A (Ребенок проснулся от кошмара и кричал.) 
Explanation: The premise states that parents rushed into their child's room, suggesting that something was wrong or disturbing. It is more likely that the child woke up from a nightmare or bad dream, causing them to cry out in fear, than they were afraid of looking under the bed."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option B (she was born deaf) is the correct answer. The fact that she communicates through signs suggests that she may have difficulty hearing or being heard by others, which aligns with the idea of being born deaf.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Urogaev has perished) is more likely to occur than option A (Water became contaminated). This is because a drought can lead to water scarcity but may not necessarily result in water pollution. However, if there is no rain for an extended period of time, plants will begin to wither and die, leading to crop failure and loss of agricultural productivity. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the premise provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Кошка гонялась за птицей"", it is more likely that Option A: Птица улетела will occur. The wording of the premise suggests that the cat was chasing after a bird, implying that the bird is capable of flying away. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Оna переехала в другой город) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the girl changed schools. The other option, school letting her go for summer, does not provide a clear reason for the change.
"Response: 
Option B: Работники began a strike.
Explanation: The owner of the factory refused to raise workers' wages, leading to a strike by the employees. This option is more likely because it aligns with the situation described in the premise, where the workers are taking collective action to address their grievances."
"Response:  Option B: Экстремисты убили его.  
Explanation: The leader of a country was hostile towards extremists in his land, indicating that he did not support their ideology or actions. However, given the context of violence and aggression displayed by extremist groups, it is more likely that they would resort to violent means to eliminate him rather than influencing him through peaceful means."
"Response:  Option B: Волны обрушились на берег.
Explanation: The premise ""Я ходил босиком по пляжу"" implies that the speaker was walking barefoot on the beach. This means that they were in close proximity to the water's edge, making option B (Waves crashed onto the shore) a more likely outcome than option A (Sand stuck to their feet)."
"Response:  Option B: Я выпил стакан воды.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker woke up in the middle of the night feeling cold. This could be due to a sudden drop in body temperature, which would make them want to drink something warm or hot to regain their body heat. Water is a common choice for this purpose, so option B is more likely than option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that her son smiled (Option A).
Response:  Option B: Я spo... (trophy)
Response:  Option A - Caries (tooth decay) is a more likely outcome for a boy who has been eating breadcrumbs than straightening of his teeth (Option B).
"Response:  Option B: I woke up today with a sore throat.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker trained in a sports hall yesterday, which suggests physical exertion or strain. Waking up with a sore throat is a common symptom of overexertion or dehydration, making it a more likely outcome than muscle soreness."
"Response:  Option B: Other students felt left out.
Explanation: The premise states that one student was whispering to another in a back-and-forth manner during lunch. This implies that there were other students present at the lunch table who could potentially feel left out or excluded from the conversation if they are not included in the dialogue. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Оna снова поднялась в воздух) is more likely. The child landing on a trampoline suggests that they are in an environment where there is potential for upward movement, rather than downward or sideways motion. Therefore, it is more likely that the child will try to fly again rather than attempt a flip.
"Response:  Option B: Почта ускорила письмо.
Explanation: The premise states that the letter was placed in a mailbox, implying that it will be delivered through regular postal service. However, option B suggests that the post office has accelerated the delivery of the letter, making it more likely to arrive sooner than expected. Therefore, option B is the better answer."
"Response: 
Option B: He returned home with nothing."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the wind became stronger (Option A). The sentence ""Лесной пожар распространился"" suggests that the fire spread rapidly, which would be consistent with a strong wind blowing embers across the forest. It is less likely that the perpetrators were delayed or stopped (Option B), as this would not explain why the fire spread so quickly. Therefore, Option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Option B: His mother bandaged his wound.
Explanation: The premise states that the child removed the skin from his knee, which suggests that he may have suffered an injury or wound. In this scenario, it is more likely that his mother would bandage or treat the wound rather than sending him to another room. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A (Он подписал завещание)
Explanation: According to the premise, the man survived a fatal disease. This means that he was in a life-threatening situation and had a chance of dying. Therefore, option A, where he signed a will, is more likely as it implies that he knew his time was limited and wanted to prepare for the aftermath of his death. Option B does not provide any insight into why the man might have undergone an organ transplant, and therefore seems less relevant to the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Я обжёг язык.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker has ingested a hot coffee, which would cause their tongue to burn or blister. This effect is more likely if the speaker had oblged their tongue with hot coffee rather than biting it."
"Response:  Option A: Писательница избегала предубеждений in her stories. 
Explanation: The premise states that the editor fired the writer, suggesting that their work was not up to par. However, option A suggests that the writer avoided biases in her stories, which could have contributed to the editor's decision to fire them. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the editor might have fired the writer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я спал весь день) is a more likely cause of feeling exhausted than option B (Я весь день учился). This is because sleeping can be a common way to recharge and relax, whereas studying can be mentally demanding and tiring.
"Response:  Option B: Она прописала пациенту таблетки. 
Explanation: The premise states that the doctor gave a diagnosis to the patient, indicating that the doctor has identified a specific medical condition or illness affecting the patient. Therefore, option B, where the doctor prescribes medication for the patient, is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я поцарапал кожу,"" option A (""Он был потным"") is a less likely cause than option B (""Это было зуд""). This is because the word ""поцарапал"" implies that something was scratched or rubbed against the skin, which could potentially cause irritation or redness but would not necessarily result in swelling or pus. In contrast, option B (""Зуд"") specifically refers to an inflamed or infected area of the skin, which is a more likely outcome of scratching or rubbing against the skin. Therefore, option B is the better answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (У него был сердечный приступ) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He was rubbing his hands.
Explanation: The word ""пук"" in Russian means ""to rub"", so it's more likely that he was rubbing his hands rather than bending or curling them."
Response:  Option A: Он был удивлен.
Response:  Option A - I believed his intentions were good.
Response:  Option B: Он начал просыпаться раньше.
"Response:  Option B: Нападаший начал кровоточить.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman hit the attacker in the nose, which can cause bleeding. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A: У него была неправильная цель.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the arrow missed its target. This suggests that the problem was not with the shooter's aim but rather with the target being incorrect or misidentified. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: В его комнате была муравьиная ферма.
Explanation: The premise states that the homeowner asked for an extremist to come to his house, implying that he has a personal reason or agenda for wanting one there. It's unlikely that he would have a muarium farm in his room, as it wouldn't be related to his request for an extremist. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Мой гость задержался) is more likely. The fact that the host was too tired to prepare something suggests that they had been busy or overworked, which could have caused them to be late in hosting their guest. This aligns with option B, where the guest has been delayed due to unforeseen circumstances.
"Response:  Option B: У нее новый дневник.  
Explanation: The premise states that the girl found her brother reading her diary, implying that she had a personal and private space where only she could access her thoughts and feelings. If there were another diary available for her to start writing in again, it would defeat the purpose of having a secret diary in the first place. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Оna уволилась с работы) is more likely.
Response:  Option B: He petted the dog on the head.
"Response: 
Option B: They distributed a survey among clients."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (мальчик перетащил стул по полу) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the wooden floor got scratched. The other option, Option A (мальчик сбросил подушки с дивана), does not provide a clear reason for how the scratches occurred.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я прикрыл лицо,"" option B is more likely. The reason for covering one's face could be to hide one's identity or to avoid being recognized by someone who might want to harm them. Therefore, option B (Мой враг поднял кулак) is a more plausible explanation than option A (Мой враг насмехался надо мной), as it implies physical aggression or violence."
"Response:  Option A: His statue was struck by lightning. 
Explanation: The premise states that the famous statue burned down, indicating that it was struck by something hot or flammable, such as a lightning bolt. This is more likely than option B, where people come to read him, as there is no indication in the premise of any large gathering of people near the statue."
"Response:  Option B: Muhi onvaidnili fruktami. (Muhi have invaded the fruit.)
Explanation: The premise states that I left fruits on the table, implying that they are still present and accessible to insects like muhi. Therefore, option B, where muhi have invaded the fruit, is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Оna указала пальцами ног) is more likely as it suggests that she pointed her toes rather than screwing her leg.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he ran around the playground) is a more likely explanation for why his diapers came undone than option A (he learned how to fasten them).
Response:  Option B: Я потерял чувство времени.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (his parents' influence) is more likely. The man believed in the same thing as his parents, indicating that he was influenced by them.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the driver's fuel ran out) is the correct answer. The machine slowed down and eventually stopped, indicating a loss of power, which could be caused by running out of fuel.
"Response:  Option B: Мороженое капало из конуса.  
Explanation: The premise states that a person ate ice cream on the sun, which is not possible in reality as ice cream would melt instantly due to the extremely high temperatures of the sun. Therefore, option B, where the ice cream capsizes from a cone, is more likely to occur than option A, where the ice cream loses its taste."
"Response:  Option B: Стены выглядели голыми.
Explanation: According to the premise, the artist hung works of art in the room. This implies that the walls were bare or unadorned beforehand, as there would be no need to hang anything if they were already covered in artwork. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Мой босс провел совещание.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker left work early, which suggests that they may have had a meeting or appointment with their boss. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the speaker's departure from work."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The owner will probably reward the dog with a treat rather than scold it.
"Response:  Option A - Мой друг простил меня.  
Explanation: The premise states that you apologized to your friend, indicating that they may have forgiven you. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Option B: He was in a neon jacket.
Explanation: The premise states that this person stood out among the crowd, implying that he was dressed differently from everyone else. Neon clothing is often bright and eye-catching, making it a more likely reason for why this person would stand out than carrying a backpack."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He was accused of perjury) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She wanted a new look) is more likely. The premise mentions that she ""покрасила"" her hair, which means she colored or dyed it. This suggests that she was looking to change her appearance, rather than trying to infiltrate society. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they were deported (Option B). The premise states that immigrants were caught illegally residing in the country, indicating that they did not have proper documentation or authorization to be in the country. As a result, it is likely that they would be subject to deportation proceedings.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Зрители засмеялись) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A - Солнце ослепило меня. (The sun blinded me)
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker watched the sun, implying a close proximity to it. Option A better fits this context as ""ослепило"" means ""blinded"" or ""dazzled"", indicating that the speaker was affected by the intense light of the sun. Option B does not convey the same meaning and seems less plausible in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Мне было скучно,"" Option A (Я задыхалась) is a more likely response than Option B (Я зевал). This is because the word ""скучно"" implies a feeling of boredom or unease, which could lead to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Нож был тупым) is more likely. The author implies that the knife was dull, making it difficult to cut through the steak.
"Response:  Option B: She accumulated large debts.
Explanation: The premise states that a woman declared bankruptcy, indicating that she was unable to pay her debts. This suggests that she had accumulated significant debt over time, rather than receiving alimony or other financial support. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Я думал, он вышел) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that if there were flames in his friend's apartment, it would be unlikely that he would not have noticed or taken action to leave the building immediately. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пельмени сошли с цветка) is more likely. The word ""положил"" in the premise implies that something was placed under someone's nose, which could potentially cause discomfort or irritation, leading to the peas falling off. Option B (""Я почувтел запах цветка"") does not provide a logical explanation for why the peas would fall off."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Женщина почувствовала ностальгию,"" option B is more likely. The woman is likely to feel nostalgia for something or someone from her past rather than meeting an old friend."
"Response:  Option B: He presented work not complete.
Explanation: According to the premise, the student delayed working on the paper, indicating that he did not finish it in time. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Я вызвал механика.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Птица развеяла крылья"", it is more likely that she spread her wings. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Гараж был открыт) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Жертва подняла руки) is more likely to occur. The fact that the perpetrator aimed a gun at their victim suggests that they intended to harm or kill them, so it is unlikely that the victim would be able to raise their hands in time to deflect the bullet.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я планировал присутствовать на похоронах моего дяди) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A: Я мехтала.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker lost their sense of time, which suggests that they were in a dream-like state or daydreaming. This aligns better with option A, as it implies a mental state rather than an emotional one."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the printer ran out of ink) than option B (the printed document has run out of paper). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Option B: Фаныбросились на поле. 
Explanation: Given that the national anthem was being played at a stadium, it's more likely that fans would rush to the field in excitement rather than turn towards a flag."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I added salt to it) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: От разлива остались липкие следы.
Explanation: According to the premise, the paper towel absorbed water, but there are no traces of it having been consumed by the liquid. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome as there will be residual stickiness left behind after the water has been absorbed by the towel."
"Response:  Option B: Она перечитала книгу.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman was interrupted while reading a book, which suggests that she had been engrossed in her reading and did not want to be disturbed. Given this context, it is more likely that she would continue reading from where she left off rather than marking her place and returning to the book later. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (мужчина посмотрел в окно) is more likely. The man looking out the window suggests that he was distracted from his seatbelt and may have been checking for any external factors causing turbulence, rather than simply tightening his belt.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Девочка его вставила) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (they amputated her leg) is more likely. The passage states that doctors gave a patient an artificial limb, indicating that they had previously removed one of her natural limbs. This suggests that she was born without a limb or lost it due to injury or disease, rather than simply having her life monitored by doctors.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she will raise her hand (Option A).
Response:  Option A - I valued his opinion.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Грязь прилипла к его обуви) is more likely. The boy stepped in mud, which means his shoes got covered in it, not his face.
"Response:  Option B: Люди прятались под землей.  
Explanation: The premise states that several centimeters of snow have fallen in the city, which is a relatively small amount of snowfall compared to other weather events like blizzards or heavy snowstorms. It's unlikely that schools would be closed due to such a small amount of snow, as it wouldn't disrupt daily life significantly. Instead, people might choose to stay indoors or take precautions to avoid venturing outside during the snowy weather, such as hiding underground. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he left work early (Option A). The sentence ""Смена работника закончилась"" implies that a change in worker has occurred, and Option A provides a plausible reason for this change - that he went home early. Option B does not provide any logical explanation for why the worker would leave his job. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Option A (Дерево упало на крышу).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дерево разделилось пополам"", option B is more likely. The reason being that a tree cannot split itself in half without any external force or intervention. Therefore, it is unlikely that the speaker of the riddle would have been able to physically harm the tree enough for it to split in two halves. Option A, where the speaker has stacked wood in the fireplace, does not provide an explanation as to how the tree was divided into two halves."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Пара объявила, что они расстаются) is the correct cause. The family gathering to celebrate the couple's anniversary suggests a positive occasion, but the fact that they are announcing their separation implies a negative outcome. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Он ей нравился) is more likely. The fact that the girl sent a valentine to the boy suggests that she has feelings for him, and therefore Option A is the most plausible outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я была в замешательстве) is more likely. The phrase ""я кивнул головой"" suggests that the speaker was taken aback or surprised by their friend's statement, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They wanted to take a fair decision) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Мужчина выгрузил продукты в холодильник) is more likely. 
Response:  Option B: Она много работала.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (his son inherited his wealth) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пламя погасло) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (her driver's license was revoked) occurred. The premise states that she was in a workshop, suggesting that she may have been there for work or personal reasons rather than driving. Therefore, it is less likely that she would have been involved in an accident that resulted in her driver's license being revoked.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я проспал будильник,"" it is more likely that Option B: Я пропустил завтрак."
"Response:  Option A: Камеры успыхивали в его направление. 
Explanation: Given that the public figure has just stepped out of a limousine, it is more likely that cameras will be flashing in his direction as he makes his way to whatever event or location he is attending. This is because paparazzi and other photographers are often present at such events and will eagerly snap photos of famous figures as they arrive."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вода в ванне стала теплой) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (он вступил в братство) is more likely. The student wants to meet other students in the campus, but joining a fraternity does not necessarily provide an opportunity for him to do so. On the other hand, specializing in engineering may give him access to different social circles within the university. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Я переустраивала гостиную.
Explanation: The premise ""Я подняла подушки с дивана"" suggests that something was moved or rearranged in the living room. Translated to English, it means ""I lifted the cushions off the sofa."" This could be a sign of cleaning or organizing, but not necessarily searching for something specific. Therefore, option B - ""Я переустраивала гостиную"" (I was redecorating the guestroom) is the most likely cause based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Мальчик сбежал) is more likely. The premise states that Оса полетела к мальчику, implying that the boy was present in the area where the butterfly flew to. Therefore, it is unlikely that he sorowed a flower (option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (she was sentenced to death) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B - Сахар растворился.
Explanation: According to the premise, the sugar has been mixed with hot tea, which means that it will dissolve in the liquid. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: He was wounded in battle. 
Explanation: The premise states that he was called to war, implying that he served in the military during a conflict. Being wounded in battle is a common occurrence in war, making it the more likely cause for his disability."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the police will pursue the criminal (Option B).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Я уронил him) is the correct answer. The fact that the laptop will not turn on suggests that there may have been physical damage to the device, such as a dropped or broken screen, which could prevent it from functioning properly. It is less likely that simply recharging the battery would cause this issue. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the laptop does not include itself.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has folded her clothes) is a more likely cause than Option A (She has purchased an extensive wardrobe). The premise suggests that the woman's current storage space is no longer sufficient for her belongings, implying that she may have accumulated too much clothing over time. It is less likely that she would purchase a new wardrobe to accommodate these items, as this would be an expensive solution. Instead, it is more probable that she will simply fold or organize her existing clothes to make better use of the limited space available.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""У него было разбито сердце,"" Option B (his wife broke up with him) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""разбито сердце"" suggests a deep emotional pain or trauma, which could only have been caused by his partner leaving him."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He became a qualified specialist for that work which he wanted) is more likely.
Response:  Option B - He spoke into a microphone.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Монета опустилась на дно) is more likely to occur. The reason for this is that a coin dropped into water will generally sink to the bottom of the container or pool due to its weight and buoyancy. It's less likely to break apart upon impact with the water. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome in this scenario.
Response:  Option A - The ball went into the hole.
"Response:  Option B: Ячихнул.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker inhaled dust on the attic, which suggests that they were doing something physical like crawling or climbing up to the attic. This means that option B, ""Ячихнул,"" which translates to ""I sneezed,"" is a more likely response given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Клиент использовал поддельные деньги) is more likely. The fact that the cashier called security suggests that there may have been an attempt to defraud the store, which aligns with Option A. Option B (Клиент оставил включенные фары) does not necessarily imply any wrongdoing or fraudulent activity.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Из-за мусора кухня воняла) is more likely. The fact that the kitchen smells suggests that there is a buildup of trash or food waste in the area, which could be causing the unpleasant odor. It is less likely that the speaker accidentally threw away their shopping list, as this would not explain why the kitchen smells.
Response:  Option B: Дети гонялись за животными.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that his lungs were filled with something (Option B). The fact that he was unable to breathe quietly suggests that there was an obstruction in his airways, such as a blockage or fluid buildup, rather than a problem with his kidneys.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I asked my friend how to get there) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Я открыл окна) is more likely to cause a drop in temperature in the house than option A (Я принесла одеяла). This is because opening windows allows cold air from outside to enter the house, causing the temperature inside to decrease, while bringing an odeya does not have any direct impact on the temperature.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Его рюкзак был открыт) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's back pain. The premise states that the boy's rucksack was open, indicating that it may have been left unzipped or undone, causing the contents to shift and put pressure on his back. This is a more plausible explanation for back pain than Option B (У него был тяжелый рюкзак), as having a heavy rucksack does not necessarily cause back pain unless the weight is distributed unevenly or the straps are too tight.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (This was her birthday) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (садовника укусила пчела) is more likely. The fact that the narcissuses in the garden were destroyed suggests that there was some kind of external force at work, rather than a deliberate action taken by the gardener themselves. While it's possible that the gardener could have accidentally damaged the plants while digging, it seems more likely that an outside factor such as a bee sting would have caused the destruction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я забил спичку"", it is more likely that Option A - ""Пламя потухло"" - will occur. This is because when you put out a matchstick (or any other flammable material), it will eventually stop burning. Therefore, the likelihood of the fire reigniting from the extinguished matchstick is low, making Option A the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They didn't want to discuss this in court) is more likely. The fact that they reached an agreement suggests that they were able to find common ground outside of a legal setting, which may indicate that they did not want to continue fighting their differences through the courts.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Their parents died) is more likely to be the reason why the children were sent to an orphanage. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Proизzóшло цунами) is more likely to occur as a result of a meteorite falling into the ocean. The impact of a large meteorite could potentially trigger a tsunami wave by displacing a significant amount of water from the ocean's surface. This is because the energy released by the meteorite's impact would be sufficient to create a large disturbance in the ocean, leading to a chain reaction that could generate a tsunami wave. In contrast, option B (Начался град) is less likely to occur as a result of a meteorite falling into the ocean, as it would not have the same level of energy release or displacement of water necessary to cause a storm.
"Response:  Option B: Она запаниковала.  
Explanation: The premise states that the tourist was poisoned by a venomous snake, which would cause her to panic or become agitated. Therefore, option B is the most likely response."
"Response:  Option A (Я inclusion of ducts). 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Печь became hot,"" implying that something caused the oven to heat up. In this case, option A is more likely as it states that ""I turned on the stove."" This implies that the speaker directly caused the oven to heat up, making it a more plausible explanation for why the oven became hot."
"Response:  Option A - Liamon became sour. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""I squeezed a klin out of lemon,"" which implies that the lemon has been affected by the action of squeezing it. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the lemon has become sour after being squeezed."
"Response: 
Option B: Страна colonized land.
Explanation: The premise states that ""страна открыла новые земли,"" which means that she discovered or opened new lands. This implies that the country expanded its territory by colonizing new lands, rather than leaving her own land. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option B: He landed in a pile of laundry.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the stool shifted due to a uneven surface (Option A). The phrase ""поштовхнулся"" suggests that the stool tilted or moved unexpectedly, which could be caused by an irregularity in the surface beneath it. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Option A: His son confessed to lying.
Explanation: According to the premise, the father caught his son in a lie, indicating that the son was not truthful about something. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome, as the son will likely admit to lying rather than trying to cover up the lie or convincing the father of his innocence."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he took an aspirin (Option B) than a cough syrup (Option A). Aspirin is commonly used to relieve headaches caused by tension or migraines, while cough syrups are typically taken for respiratory issues such as coughs or congestion.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Он приближался к станции) is more likely as it provides a specific location that can be easily verified through observation or further investigation. The other option (Мы отстаем от графика) does not provide any concrete information about the train's location or progress.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he had a family history of psychological disorders (Option A). The mention of ""терапия"" suggests that he was seeking treatment for an underlying mental health issue, which could be related to a genetic predisposition or environmental factors such as trauma or stress. While depression can also be a possible cause, without additional context, it seems less likely given the focus on therapy."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Она задохнулась едой) is more likely. The woman grabbed her throat, indicating that she choked on something she ate, rather than swallowing it whole.
Response:  Option A - Her voice sounded hoarse.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he was slicing (Option A). The word ""сливал"" in Russian means to slice or cut something, so this option is a better fit for the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Option B: Она became rich.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman's business venture was successful, which means she made a profit or became wealthy. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Звонок зазвонил) is more likely to be the cause of students leaving class. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Option A (Ее знакомые выразили скептицизм)
Explanation: The premise states that the woman claimed to have seen a ghost, but her friends expressed skepticism. This suggests that they did not believe her claim, which is more likely than them being related to her. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he almost died in an explosion) is more likely than option A (he lost his hearing). The premise specifically states that he ""almost died,"" implying a life-threatening event occurred, which aligns better with option B. Option A does not convey the same level of danger or severity as option B."
Response:  Option B: Шарик поднялся в воздух.
"Response:  Option A (У него был инсульт).
Explanation: The premise states that the person has lost the ability to speak, which suggests a neurological event such as an insult. This is more likely than option B, where the person simply inhaled deeply without any context or explanation for their sudden loss of speech."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (there was a trechina in the cement) is more likely to be the cause of the woman's fall. The mention of ""troтуар"" suggests that the incident occurred outdoors, and the presence of a crack or trechina in the cement could have caused her to lose her balance and fall. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the woman's fall."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Спасатель прыгнул в воду после него) is more likely. The fact that the man threw a cannonball into the pool suggests that he was not concerned about getting wet himself, so it's reasonable to assume that he would have jumped in after the rescuer if necessary. Option B (Мужчина напоил спасателя) does not fit with this scenario as there is no indication that the man offered the rescuer any alcohol.
Response:  Option A - Моя инфекция прошла.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the driver pressed the brake pedal (Option A). The yellow light indicates that the driver has to stop, so it's reasonable to assume that they applied the brakes to slow down or come to a stop.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I placed the container on a hot plate) is more likely to have caused the plastic container to melt. The heat from the hot plate would have been sufficient to cause the plastic to soften and potentially melt. In contrast, option A (I soaked the container in warm water) may not have provided enough heat to cause significant melting of the plastic.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the driver ran a red light (Option B). The premise states that the machine ""messed up,"" implying an error or malfunction occurred, rather than suggesting that the driver was distracted by something else. Additionally, the mention of a telephone pole suggests that the crash may have been caused by the driver's failure to stop at an intersection, which is consistent with Option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he passed the exam (Option B). The premise states that he studied all night, implying that he was preparing for an important event such as an exam. Additionally, the use of the word ""all"" suggests that he put in a significant amount of effort, which would increase his chances of passing."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Он боялся учиться плавать) is a more likely cause for why the boy held onto the pool ladder. It suggests that the boy may have been afraid or hesitant to learn how to swim, rather than having a rescuer nearby.
Response:  Option A - Я почувтил сердцебиение.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (В моем офисе было шумно) is more likely. The fact that there was a construction site nearby suggests that there would be noise in the office due to the building work.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Семья махала соседям со двора) is more likely. The family wants to get to know their new neighbors better, but instead of inviting them over for a friendly gathering, they decide to scare them off by honking their horns and making noise from outside their house. This behavior is not very welcoming or neighborly, and it's unlikely that the new neighbors would feel comfortable approaching the family after such an unfriendly introduction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Из бассейна вспыхнула вода"", option A (Пловчик нырнул в бассейн) is a more likely cause than option B (Плаватель плавал в бассейне). This is because the word ""высплышала"" suggests that water suddenly erupted from the bathtub or pool, implying that something sudden and unexpected happened, such as a person jumping in. Option B does not provide any explanation for why there would be an explosion of water."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Я случайно сломал зуб) is more likely. When you bite into a raw carrot, it's unlikely that you would accidentally swallow a seed or break a tooth. However, it's possible to accidentally bite your tongue or inside of your cheek while eating a raw carrot, which could result in minor injuries like bleeding or irritation. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (his shirt buttons were undone) is a more plausible cause for why the boy stumbled than Option A (his coat was unbuttoned). Therefore, the answer is B.
"Response:  Option B: У нее прокололи уши.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman put a bandage on her ears, indicating that she had them pierced. This is a common practice among people who have their ears pierced, and it is unlikely that they would be distracted by noise to the point where they forget about it. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A (Я выпил всю воду).
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker filled their bottle with water. If they then drank all of it, that means they have consumed the entire contents of the bottle, making option A the most likely cause. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of storing the water in a refrigerator."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (В нем содержался вульгарный язык) is the correct answer. The passage states that the television show was ""subject to censorship,"" which suggests that there were content restrictions or limitations placed upon it. This could potentially include language deemed offensive or inappropriate for broadcast, which would be consistent with Option A."
Response:  Option B: Экипаж столкнулся с пиратами.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (He solved the puzzle) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Звонил телефон"", option A (Мужчина повесил трубку) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Я обнял ее) occurred. The use of the word ""пялилась"" (pulled herself onto me) suggests a physical action, and option A implies a more intimate and affectionate response to this action, whereas option B does not convey such an emotional reaction."
"Response:  Option B: Они посмотрели все экспонаты.  
Explanation: The premise states that the group left the museum, indicating that they were not interested in photographing exhibits but rather wanted to see everything on display. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option B: Мой друг встал за меня.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я всасывал воздух в шину) is more likely to cause a blowout than option B (Я поменял передачу на велосипеде). This is because adding air to a tire that has already gone flat will not fix the problem but rather make it worse by causing the tire to burst. On the other hand, changing the transmission of a motorcycle would not affect the condition of the tire. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ее отец читал ей сказку) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Я использовал карандаш) is correct. The use of a pencil would result in a smudge or erasure of the ink, rather than simply signing one's name.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Он был в долгах) is more likely as it provides a clear reason why the man was denied credit.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У нее была ветрянка) is more likely. The reason for this answer is that a fever is a common illness that can keep someone from going to school. It is more plausible than option B (Ей нравилось учить математику), as it is not a typical reason for missing school.
"Response:  Option A (Я выбросил его на свалку).
Explanation: The premise states that the trash can was full, indicating that the speaker discarded the item in a waste bin or dumpster rather than returning it to its original location or giving it away to someone else. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Option A (Мой сосед пролил пунш)
"Response: 
Option B: He threw a chair through the room."
"Response:  Option B: Огонь потух.  
Explanation: According to the premise, a girl threw a twig into the fire. Since the twig burned in the flames, it's unlikely that the entire fire would have extinguished as a result of this action. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Горячей воды не было) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the man ""вышел из души,"" which implies a sudden and unexpected departure from his body. It is unlikely that he would have forgotten to bring hot water with him if he had planned to take a shower outside of his soul. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the man did not take a shower."
"Response:  Option B: Они поощряли своих детей играть на улице.  
Explanation: The parents wanted their children to attend college, but they did not save money for education. Instead, they encouraged their children to play outside as a way of spending time together and bonding as a family. This suggests that the parents prioritized quality time with their children over saving money for college."
Response:  Option B - Оbuv' изнашивалась.
"Response:  Option A: Он заморозил остатки.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the man ate half of his meal and then froze the rest. This suggests that he did not save the leftovers or make any notes about the recipe, but rather simply put them in the freezer for later consumption. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A (Я наложила на него лед.)
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker's loody was oversized, implying that it had grown too large for its intended purpose. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this by suggesting that the speaker put ice on the loody to shrink it back down to size. On the other hand, option B does not make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between rubbing butter on a loody and making it smaller. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Я говорил с коллегой за своим столом) is the correct answer. The premise states that the door to the office was opened, indicating that someone entered the office. If the speaker had been talking with a colleague at their desk, they would have noticed the person entering the office and could not have been unaware of their presence. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B.
"Response:  Option B: Я просмотрел журнал.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker had to stand in line, which suggests that they were not able to sit or engage in any other activity while waiting. Therefore, option B, ""I read a magazine,"" is more likely as it allows for the possibility of the speaker passing the time by reading something while standing in line."
Response:  Option B: Muha remained still.
"Response:  Option A: Он умирал.  
Explanation: According to the premise, he wrote a will, indicating that he had passed away."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will uptempo his pace (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I came up with a solution) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He was in awe.
Explanation: The premise states that the traveler was walking across a swaying suspension bridge, which could be an intimidating experience for some people. However, the word ""awe"" suggests that the traveler was instead feeling a sense of wonder or amazement at the sight before him, rather than fear or discomfort. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: He made a bet with his friends.  
Explanation: The phrase ""he predicted the team's victory"" suggests that he had inside information or a good feeling about how the game would turn out. This implies that he made a bet with his friends, as people often make wagers based on their predictions of the outcome of sports games."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he set up an alarm clock (Option A).
