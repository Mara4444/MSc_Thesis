Explanation:  It's much more likely that dust would blow out of a newly drilled hole than a mouse would crawl out.

This type of question tests your ability to make logical deductions based on limited information. In this case, the fact that the child woke up screaming suggests that he may have had a bad dream or a frightening experience.

B) Gave him a hug.

Response: 2 (It looked contaminated)
Response:  Option A (His umbrella was broken)
"Response:  Option A - The user clicked the mouse. 
Reasoning: When a user clicks the mouse, it causes the cursor to move on the screen. Shifting the mouse does not directly affect the cursor's movement. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."

Explanation:  Since the parking lot was empty, it's more likely that I parked near the entrance rather than across the street."
Response:  Option A - Writer's Block.

Explanation: When a tornado passes through an area, it can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, but it also brings with it strong winds that can create dangerous conditions on roads and highways.

Response:  Option B - The mother gave birth to twins.
Response:  Option A - She wanted to conserve her energy.
Response:  Option B - The bag of chips was stuck.
