"Response:  Based on the premise ""Varet var förpackad i bubbelfolie,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Den var skör,"" is the correct answer. The word ""skör"" means fresh or ripe in Swedish, which fits with the idea of food being packaged in airtight plastic wrap. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tömde fickorna"", it is more likely that Option A: Jag hittade en biljett was chosen. This is because the phrase ""tömde fickorna"" implies a sense of emptiness or lack of contents in one's pockets, which would make it unlikely to find something like a weapon (Option B) hidden there. Instead, it seems more plausible that the speaker found a small item such as a ticket (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that termites ate through the wood in the house (Option B). The phrase ""invaded the house"" implies that termites entered the home and began consuming the wooden structure from within. This is consistent with the behavior of termites, which feed on cellulose-based materials like wood. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The patrol agent accused them of smuggling, indicating that they were trying to bring something into the country illegally.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It was a holiday) is more likely as there is no mention of summer in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan var slut på energi,"" option A (Hon spelade dam) is more likely as it suggests that she was tired or exhausted, which could be related to playing a game of chess. Option B (Hon hoppade rep) does not make sense in this context as jumping rope would not typically cause someone to feel drained of energy."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Fler människor kom in i kön) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the woman lost her place in line due to other people entering the queue, indicating that there were additional individuals joining the line, making it longer and pushing the woman further back.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Flickan klämde i näsan"" means ""The girl cried in her nose,"" indicating that she was crying and making a noise with her nose. It does not suggest that she was salivating or smutting someone's clothing. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Publiken klappade tillsammans med musiken) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Flickan took an apple to her teacher) is more likely. The phrase ""ville tacka"" means ""to take revenge,"" so it's likely that flickan wanted to give her teacher a gift rather than staying after school for punishment."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (their leader told a ghost story) is more likely to have caused the young campers to feel scared.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Han slog i huvudet"", option A (He went blank in his head) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mitt bankkonto var tomt) is the correct cause for why checken jag skrev var inte betald. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he deleted spam emails (Option A). The premise states that his email inbox was full of junk mail, indicating that he had a lot of unwanted messages cluttering up his inbox. Deleting these messages would be a common solution to deal with this problem. Sending out mass emails, on the other hand, is less likely given the context provided.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han exponerades för sjukdomen) is correct. The sentence ""Han satt i karantén"" implies that he was placed under quarantine or isolation due to exposure to a disease, rather than recovering from one. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hon reciterade den för sig själv) is the correct answer. The fact that she ""memorerade"" the code suggests that she repeated it to herself rather than writing it down, making Option A a more plausible explanation for how she retained the code."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A is more likely. The sentence ""Jag hällde vattnet i glaset"" means that water was poured into a glass, so it is more likely that the glass became full rather than the water disappearing. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He wanted to offer his friend support) is more likely. The man remained silent because he wanted to provide emotional support to his friend who had just finished speaking.
"Response: 
Option A: Jag kände mig skyldig. 
Explanation: The correct answer is Option A because the premise ""Olyckan var mitt fel"" means ""Misfortune was my fault,"" which implies that the speaker feels guilty or responsible for the misfortune. Therefore, option A is a more appropriate response to the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, option A (Kedjan var insvept runt ett däck) is a more likely cause for why the chain went wrong than option B (Det var en bruten länk i kedjan). This is because the phrase ""insvept runt et däck"" suggests that the chain was wrapped around something, which could potentially cause it to break or malfunction. In contrast, ""en bruten länk"" simply means ""a broken link,"" which does not provide any specific details about what might have caused the problem. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information given in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De tröttnade på att gräla) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She anlitade a campaign manager) is more likely. The premise suggests that the woman decided to run for office, which would require her to hire a professional campaign manager to help her with strategy, messaging, and other aspects of the campaign. It does not suggest that she would go through the legal process of filing a lawsuit in order to become eligible to run for office. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han packade varma kläder i resväskan) is more likely. The man packed warm clothing in his suitcase, indicating that he was prepared for cold weather during his trip.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He did a stupid fall) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Stycket kom in i ögonen) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something external entered into the eyes, rather than just putting protective glasses over them.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hennes motståndare anklagade henne för fusk) is more likely. The fact that she won five matches in a row suggests that her opponents may have been suspicious of her performance and accused her of cheating as a result.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han fångade studenten som fuskade) is more likely as it suggests that the teacher caught a cheating student, rather than simply giving an incorrect answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag förlorade min röst) is the correct answer. The statement ""Jag stannade för att sluta prata"" suggests that something unexpected happened to prevent the speaker from continuing their conversation, rather than suggesting a physical discomfort or pain that would lead to Option B (Jag fick ont om andetag)."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag la den i mikrovågsugnen) caused the food to become frozen. This is because microwaves are a common kitchen appliance used for heating up food quickly, but they do not have enough power to thaw or freeze food. Therefore, if the food was placed in the microwave, it would likely remain frozen rather than thawing out. Option B (Jag täckte den med plastfolie) does not provide any explanation as to why the food became frozen, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Han had magvärk) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Anställd låtsades sjuk"" suggests that the person was pretending to be sick, which could be a cover for a variety of reasons, including needing a day off work or wanting to avoid an unwanted task. However, the specific reason given in the premise is that he had magvärk, which is a common illness that can cause stomach pain and discomfort. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hon sprang på pooldäcket) is more likely as it provides a clearer explanation for how the girl ended up in the pool than option B (Hon hoppade från springbrädan). The sentence ""Flickan landade i poolen"" implies that she was already in the air before entering the water, which makes sense if she had jumped from the diving board but not necessarily if she had simply fallen into the pool from the deck."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Det var premiär för filmen (The movie premiered) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Biljetterna är slut"" suggests that the movie has already been released and is now sold out, indicating a successful premiere."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that people isolated him.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man has lost weight, which may be perceived as a negative change by some people. As a result, they may distance themselves from him or treat him differently, leading to social isolation. In contrast, people are more likely to offer compliments or positive feedback when someone loses weight, especially if it is seen as a desirable change. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan's hands were blown,"" option A (she wrote a letter) is more likely as it does not involve any physical action that could result in her hands being blown. Option B (she climbed up a rope) would be more likely to result in her hands being blown away by the wind."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Akrobaten svängde from a trapez) is more likely. The premise mentions that the acrobat was juggling while riding a unicycle, which suggests that he/she was performing an aerial act such as swinging or flying from a trapeze. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tappade tålamodet"", it is more likely that option A (Min vän fick mig att vänta) is the correct cause. This is because the phrase ""tappade tålamodet"" implies a loss of patience or impatience, which could lead to waiting for someone else to arrive rather than arriving oneself."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They forhandled frame a treaty) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han blev sömnig) is more likely. The premise states that the man took a sleeping pill, which would cause him to become drowsy or fall asleep. Option B (Han had fever) does not align with this premise as it suggests an unrelated medical condition.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Soffans ben lossnade) is more likely to occur as a result of the woman hitting the couch. This is because the impact of her body against the couch could potentially cause damage to the cushions or even break them, leading to a loss of support for her back. Option B (Hon har blåmärken i knät) may also be possible, but it is less likely given the limited information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken klämde i ballongen"", it is more likely that option A, ""Ballongen knäckte"" (The balloon broke) will occur. This is because the word ""klämde"" in Swedish implies a strong force or impact, which could potentially cause damage to the balloon. Option B, ""Ballongen flöt iväg"" (The balloon flew away), does not align with the given premise as there is no indication of any movement or action involving the balloon."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (De åkte till flygplatsen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Persikan är blå) is more likely to be true than option B (-Det spilldes juice). This is because the premise provides a specific statement about the color of persimmons, which is a factual claim that can be verified through observation or experimentation. In contrast, option B does not provide any information about the likelihood of something happening, but rather presents an excuse for why something might have happened. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the provided premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mina händer blev klibbiga"", option A (Jag åt en munk) is the more likely cause. The word ""klibbiga"" means sticky in Swedish, so it's unlikely that someone had a sweet tooth and got their hands stuck together as a result."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tryckte på dörren"", it is more likely that option A will occur - the door will open."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Produkterna tillverkades med barnarbete) is more likely to be the cause of the activists' boycott.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A mus kröp ut ur hålet) is more likely. The premise mentions that a hole was dug in the wall, which suggests that something or someone entered through it. Since mice are known to be able to squeeze through small openings, it's more likely that a mouse would emerge from the hole rather than dammit blowing out of it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (her sister was happy) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I changed my shirt) is more likely. The premise states that ""Jag spillde vin på min skjorta,"" which means ""I spilled wine on my shirt."" This implies that the speaker's current clothing state is stained with wine, so it would be more practical to change into a different shirt rather than putting on an extra layer of clothing like a forklift."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kunden genomsökte plånboken) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why Kassan would open her cash register. It makes sense that she would check the customer's wallet to see if there are any notes or money inside. On the other hand, Option B (Kunden gav henne pengar) does not provide a clear reason why Kassan would open her cash register without any prior indication of the customer giving her money.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Han skickade bort folkmassan) is more likely. The premise states that Gatumusikern locked himself in a room with a crowd of people, indicating that he was unable to escape or remove them from the room. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would have sent them away.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den lilla pojken grät till sin barnvakt,"" option A (Han saknade sina föräldrar) is the more likely cause for why the little boy cried to his babysitter. The premise suggests that the boy was emotionally attached to his babysitter, indicating that he missed or longed for his parents' presence. Option B (""Det var snacktid"") does not provide any context or reason as to why the boy would cry to his babysitter, making it a less plausible explanation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Pilot flew through the storm) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trädet tappade blad"", it is more likely that option A: Bladen became colored."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he decided to make a joke with his sister) is more likely. The fact that he was in a bad mood suggests that he might be looking for ways to lighten the atmosphere or distract himself from his negative feelings, which could involve making jokes or playing pranks on someone close to him like his sister.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hans far gav honom en läsk att dricka) is more likely. The premise suggests that Barnet was feeling unwell due to having to go to the bathroom, so his father giving him a drink of water would be a reasonable response to help alleviate his discomfort. On the other hand, stopping at a gas station does not necessarily address Barnet's issue with needing to use the restroom.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet ströp fiskmat i tanken"", it is more likely that option A, ""Fisken hoppade ut ur tanken"" is correct. The wording of the premise suggests that something inside the tank (i.e., Barnet) caused the fish to jump out, rather than the fish moving towards the food."
"Response:  Option A: Hon bytte parti. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman's political views changed. This suggests that she may have switched parties or ideologies, rather than participating in a protest. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Badrummet var täppt"", option B is more likely. The word ""täppt"" means ""clogged or blocked"", so it's likely that the toilet was clogged and needed to be unblocked. Option A does not make sense in this context as there is no reason why opening the kitchen faucet would help unclog a toilet."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Passagerna gick av tåget,"" it is more likely that option A (Tåget kom till stationen) is the correct answer. The passengers got off the train at a station, not because the train whistled."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He foresegled the kuvert) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They lost contact) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A: She got fired. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the bookkeeper managed the company's funds, implying that she had a significant role in managing the company's finances. If she failed to perform her duties properly or mismanaged the company's funds, it is possible that she was fired for poor performance or negligence. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag hörde klockan ticka) is the correct cause. The sentence ""Jag tittade på klockan"" implies that the speaker looked at the clock, but does not necessarily imply that they heard it ticking. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min hand kramper"", option A is more likely. The word ""kramper"" in Swedish means cramp or spasm, so it's likely that the writer experienced a muscle cramp in their hand while writing the essay. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (I changed the screw) caused the bulb to burn out. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the pair moved into the apartment) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hon wanted to see sunset) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why she was sitting outside. The other option (she thought she saw a bolt of lightning) does not provide any explanation for her actions.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Vattnet var grunt) is more likely. The man could not swim because the water was too shallow for him to dive into or stay underwater long enough to reach safety.
"Response: 
Option B: She pressed the backspace key."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She won a competition) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gräsmattan var lera"", option A is more likely. It rained overnight, which could have caused the grass to become wet and muddy. Option B does not provide a clear explanation for why the grass would be muddy."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hon övernattade på ett hotell) is the correct answer. The fact that she ""sov over"" suggests that she spent the night at a hotel, rather than forgetting to set her alarm clock."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Han satte på sig solkräm"", it is more likely that option A (He sat in the shade) is correct."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A, ""Forskarna drog tillbakatheorin,"" occurred. The passage states that the researchers proved a theory, but does not mention anything about them withdrawing or retracting their findings. Therefore, it can be inferred that they did not reverse their conclusion and the theory remains valid."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fansen vid matchen buade"", option A is more likely. The fans cheering during the game could have contributed to the team's energy and motivation, potentially influencing the outcome of the match."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag skrev in min kombination på låset"", it is more likely that option A, ""Jag stängde låset"" is correct. This is because writing one's combination onto a lock implies that one has access to the lock and can open or close it as desired. Therefore, it is unlikely that the lock would suddenly open without any action being taken by the person who wrote their combination on it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Publiken blev allt starkare,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Fadern gav sin son lite pengar,"" will occur. The phrase ""publiken"" (the public) became stronger, indicating an increase in popularity or influence. Giving money to one's son is a common way for a father to show affection and support, so this outcome aligns with the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jag skövlade bort snön) is more likely. The text states that the entrance was blocked by snow, implying that there is a significant amount of snow present. Skovling (clearing away) would be more effective in this scenario than gathering the snow into a ball (option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kajakpaddlarna paddade sina åsar"", option A is more likely. The word ""paddlade"" implies that the kayakers were actively moving their kayaks through the water, which suggests that they reached the shore. Option B does not provide any information about the kayakers' movement or location in relation to the shore. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Option B: She crashed into a fence.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The passage states that ""Jag kände att kall luft passerade över mig,"" indicating that a cool breeze passed over the speaker's body. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Surfarna återvände till stranden"", it is more likely that they were wet (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vatten som rinner ut ur badkaret) is more likely to occur. The fact that the protagonist ""drog ur avloppsproppen"" implies that water is flowing out of the sink, rather than splashing onto the floor. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He acknowledged his infidelity to her) is more likely.  
Explanation: The premise states that he felt guilty for being unfaithful to his wife, indicating that he was aware of his actions and their consequences. Therefore, it is more likely that he would acknowledge his infidelity rather than accuse his wife of it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bläcket på affischen är smutsat,"" option B is the most likely cause. The word ""smutsat"" implies that something has been contaminated or stained, which could be caused by spilling water on the poster. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the blotch appears on the advertisement."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Barnet had a nightmare) than option B (he kissed someone in bed). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Hans far satte sig vid bordet) occurred than option B (Hans far föreläste honom). This is because the premise mentions ""fötterna"" (feet), which suggests a physical action of sitting down, rather than a verbal instruction or lecture from his father."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Jag ropade hans namn) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Min vän vände sitt huvud mot mig,"" which means ""My friend turned its head towards me."" This implies that there was a physical action involved in turning the head, such as someone calling out or making a noise. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Medborgarna gjorde uppror) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He skrek om hjälp) is more likely. The boy's cry for help suggests that he is in distress and needs assistance, whereas setting up a tent implies that he has taken some proactive steps to protect himself from harm.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan reste utomlands,"" it is more likely that she wanted to learn about other cultures (Option B). The phrase ""reste utomlands"" means ""traveled abroad,"" indicating that she left her home country to explore new places and experiences. Learning about other cultures is a common reason for traveling, especially among young women who are eager to broaden their horizons and gain new perspectives. Therefore, Option B is the more plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hans collogae became promoted) is more likely as the reason for his jealousy. The premise states that he was envious of his colleague's success, implying that they had a professional relationship where one person excelled over the other. Therefore, it is more plausible that his colleague's promotion triggered his envy rather than their working late.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han had hallucinations) is the correct answer. The phrase ""bevittnade utomjordingar"" suggests that something unusual or supernatural occurred, which aligns with the idea of hallucinations rather than meditation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannens hår blev blond,"" option A (He put bleach in it) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Hon criticized her previous work) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""the artist created new works,"" implying that she was motivated to create something new or different from what she had done before. It does not suggest that she felt inspired by her earlier work, but rather that she wanted to move beyond it. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the artist created new works."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Sonen flyttade hemifrån) is the correct answer. The reason for this is not specified in the premise, but it is implied that Sonen left his home due to being fired from the military, rather than going to college.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Böcker föll ur bokhyllan"", option A (Hylsorna var täckta av damm) is the more likely cause. The fact that books fell out of the bookshelf suggests that there was a sudden disruption or disturbance in the shelf, which could have been caused by dampness or humidity accumulated on the hylsorna (the wooden boards used to support the books). This is a more plausible explanation than an earthquake causing the books to fall off the shelf."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Jag tände en lampa) is a more plausible explanation for why the current in my house was turned off than option B (Jag har ställt om strömbrytaren). This is because turning on a lamp would be a more direct cause of the current being turned off than simply flipping a switch.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vi åkte berg- och dalbana"", it is more likely that option A is correct, as the sentence implies a negative experience with the roller coaster ride. Therefore, the answer is (A) It looked ugly."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jag hällde smör i påsen) is more likely to be the cause of the popcorn bag starting to break apart. Adding oil or butter to a hot popcorn bag can make it more prone to bursting, as the grease can heat up quickly and expand inside the bag.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The falling tree will cause a power outage in the surrounding area, leading to strong winds.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He offended the audience) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (a blood drop formed on my finger) is more likely to occur than option A (a sweatdrop dropped from my face). This is because jabbing oneself with a needle can cause bleeding or injury, but it is less likely to result in sweating.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fisken flöt på tankens yta,"" it is more likely that option A (the fish was hungry) is correct. The phrase ""flöt på tankens yta"" suggests that the fish was floating on top of the water in the tank, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as being hungry or thirsty. It does not necessarily imply that the fish is dead."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannens röst lät hosta"", option A (He was hoarse) is a more likely cause than option B (He stopped smoking). Hoarseness can be caused by various factors such as overuse, acid reflux, or respiratory infections, but it is less common for hoarseness to occur due to stopping smoking."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The hiss drain was stuck between floors, causing it to get stuck in mid-air. This is a common problem with elevators and can happen due to various reasons such as overloading, improper maintenance, or a sudden power outage. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the hiss drain did not reach its destination.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A: He lied to his parents. The reason being that the phrase ""tonåringen smög ut ur huset"" implies that he snuck out of the house without his parents' knowledge or consent, suggesting that he may have been dishonest with them about his whereabouts. Therefore, option A is the more plausible cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Toalettens vatten flöt över (the water from the toilet overflowed) caused the bathroom to become flooded. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ägaren satte en krage på valpen) is more likely. The sentence ""Valpen stannade Nära sin ägare"" implies that the horse stopped near its owner, suggesting that it was under control of the owner. Setting a halter on the horse would be a common way to keep it close to the owner, making option A the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen fångade hans spegelbild,"" it is more likely that he stood over the calm lake (Option B). The image of him was captured in a mirror, indicating that he was standing still or moving slowly, rather than being caught under a large tree where there would be less reflection."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jag träffade henne på middag) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their dog ran away from home rather than valuable jewelry went missing from their house. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the weather was cold) caused Jag saw my breath when I breathed out. When we exhale, our breath condenses in cold air, resulting in visible vapor or ""breath."" So, if the weather was cold, it's possible that Jag saw his/her own breath when he/she exhaled. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (De ville ha bättre arbetsvillkor) is the correct answer. The formation of a union suggests that employees are seeking better working conditions or improved treatment by their employer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag bakade en äppelpaj,"" it is more likely that a warm smell will fill the kitchen. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan kämpade för att gå,"" option B is more likely. The woman struggled to walk, indicating that she had difficulty walking due to some obstacle or challenge. This suggests that she took off her shoes as a way of making it easier for herself to move forward. Option A does not provide any explanation for why the woman would have high heels, and therefore seems less relevant to the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ånga steg upp ur vattenkrukan"", it is more likely that option A, ""Vattnet kokade"". This is because the word ""ånga"" in Swedish means steam or vapor, which would indicate that the water inside the kettle began to boil."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Alla mina strumpor var i tvättstugan"", it is more likely that option A (Jag had sandals on) is correct. The use of the word ""alla"" suggests that all of the speaker's socks were in the washing machine, which would be unlikely if they had been wearing shoes like stoves."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He lost voters' support) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the couple became pregnant) than option B (the couple ran away).
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Miljonaren wanted the building to be torn down) is correct. The sentence ""Byggnaden var tillägnad miljonären"" implies that the building was dedicated or built for the millionaire, but there is no indication that he contributed financially to its construction or had any other positive interest in it. Therefore, it is more likely that he simply wanted the building to be demolished."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (försäljaren saw flickanlägga varor in her bag) is more likely. The fact that the sales assistant accused the girl of stealing suggests that they had evidence or suspicion of her taking something without permission. It's unlikely that the salesperson would help a thief find their lost item if they didn't have any proof of ownership.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Soldaters skickades ut för att strida) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (an uprising broke out in front of the courthouse) is more likely. The use of language such as ""controversial decision"" and ""uprising"" suggests that there may be significant opposition to the decision, leading to a confrontational response. In contrast, option B (""a pair exchanged promises"") does not convey the same level of conflict or urgency."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan kände lukten av något brinnande"", it is more likely that she left the cakes in the oven. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Det regnade i stort,"" option A is more likely. The sentence implies that the storm became worse, so option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A: ""Hissen slutade fungera"" (The elevator stopped working) is the cause of the building being evacuated. This is because there is no mention of a fire alarm going off or any other reason why the building would need to be evacuated due to a malfunctioning elevator. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Fadern köpte en öl till sin son) will occur. The premise states that the father was angry with his son's alcoholism, but rather than punishing him or kicking him out of the house, he chose to buy him a beer as an attempt to connect with him and help him overcome his addiction. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sekreteraren gick hem för dagen) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why the lawyer did not go upstairs to his office.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hans vän avbröt honom) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The premise states that ""Flickan gav sina pengar till kassören,"" indicating that the girl gave her money to the cashier. However, there is no mention of a receipt or a kvitto being given in return. Therefore, it is more likely that the cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt rather than giving her money without any documentation."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, option A (Hon became paralyzed in an accident) is more likely than option B (She came to the hospital in a coffin). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option B (landet stod inför ekonomiska svårigheter) is the correct answer. The mention of ""nationalflaggan"" being hung outside homes suggests a sense of patriotism or pride in one's country, but does not necessarily imply any particular reason for doing so. However, given the context of economic difficulties, it seems more plausible that people would be motivated to display their flag as a symbol of solidarity or hope during difficult times rather than simply out of habit or tradition."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the team will be disappointing their fans (Option A).
"Response: 
Option B: I felt proud."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken föll på historietext,"" option A (Han var uppmärksam i klassen) is the more likely cause. This is because falling on a historical text does not typically result in being paying attention in class."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (a jordbävning struck the city) is more likely as a cause of the building collapse in the center of town. This is because earthquakes are known to have the potential to cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially those that are not designed or constructed with seismic activity in mind. On the other hand, an increase in criminal activity may not necessarily lead to a building collapse.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hon presented him to her parents) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (bollen rullade iväg) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tvättbjörnen har genomsökt soptunnan"", it is more likely that option A is correct, as there was probably paper in the dumpster for Tvättbjörn to find."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken vaskade pennan,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Det var billigt,"" is the correct answer. The word ""billigt"" means ""cheap"" in Swedish, so it fits with the context of a child washing a pen."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (she lost her money) is the correct answer. The phrase ""nekade kvinnan en återbetalning"" suggests that she did not receive a refund or compensation for the clothing item, implying that she may have accidentally dropped or misplaced her money."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Skrapan i min hud var djup"", option A (Det läktet snabbt) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He talked to himself) is more likely. The passage states that he got strange looks from passengers on the train, indicating that his behavior was noticeable and unusual. Talking to oneself is a common symptom of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, which could explain why he received strange looks. In contrast, staring at the ground does not necessarily indicate any particular mental state. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Myror kröp till smulorna) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kvinnans syster fyllde händer) is more likely. The sentence implies that the woman's sister did something to her hands, rather than simply starting to cry.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Her colleague covered for her) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han stödde deras sak) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had stage fright) is the correct answer. The phrase ""helt galen"" suggests a high level of anxiety or fear related to performing on stage, which aligns with the symptoms of stage fright. While option B (he learned his lines by heart) could also be possible, it does not fit as well with the language used in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag var vilse,"" option B (I have drawn a map) is more likely. The word ""vilse"" means lost or confused, so it's unlikely that the person would be counting their money in this situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den mogna frukten dröjde i solen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""den blev oppatén,"" occurred. The phrase ""dröjde i solen"" suggests that the fruit was left in the sun for a period of time, which could cause it to ripen or become overripe. It is less likely that the fruit would have shrunk (option B) as a result of being left in the sun."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bilen gick sönder"", option A is more likely as it suggests that the speaker started something (i.e., the car) rather than the engine overheating."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han gick till en psykiater) is more likely. The fact that han has had a stiff neck for several days suggests that he may be experiencing some discomfort or pain in his neck, which could potentially be caused by muscle strain or other factors such as poor posture or injury. Going to see a psychiatrist would not directly address this physical symptom.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag startade en eld i spisen,"" option A is more likely. The fact that there was no wood left suggests that the speaker started a fire in the stove intentionally rather than because of a lack of heat."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hon har fått en kramp i sidan) is the correct answer. The phrase ""hon slutade jogga"" suggests that the woman stopped running, which could be due to a cramp in her side."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag knackade på grannens dörr"", it is more likely that option B, ""Min granne lämnade sitt hus"" is correct. This is because if you knocked on your neighbor's door, it is likely that they would answer or respond in some way, rather than simply leaving their house without notice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Her man missed understood her worry) is the correct answer. The phrase ""sucked off by frustration"" suggests a feeling of pent-up anger or agitation, which could be misinterpreted by someone else as a sign of affection rather than distress. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why she was kissed on the cheek."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Studenten svarade rätt på frågan) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan had slut på ägg,"" it is more likely that she went to the farm ( Option A). This is because ""slut"" in Swedish means ""eggless"" or ""without eggs"", so it makes sense that she would go to a place where eggs are produced, such as a farm."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jag avslöjade en hemlighet för honom) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan undvek att gå i sjön,"" it is more likely that she avoided going into the water because she saw something contaminated or dirty in the water rather than catching a fish. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Studenten kom till klassen blötvåt,"" option A (Hans paraply var trasigt) is the more likely cause. The fact that he is wet suggests that there may have been a problem with his umbrella, such as it breaking or leaking, rather than him simply forgetting to bring it."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (An accident occurred on the main road) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the linen is fläcked (Option B). The sentence ""Jag hängde upp det våta linnet på tvättlinan"" implies that the linen was wet when it was hung up to dry. If it had already been tucked ( Option A), the sentence would not make sense in this context. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan satte på sig sina solglasögon,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Solen var ljus,"" is the correct cause. The woman putting on her sunglasses suggests that she may be protecting herself from the sun's bright light, rather than calling a taxi for an unknown reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen stirrade på natthimlen,"" it is more likely that he was admiring the beauty of the night sky (option B). The phrase ""stirrade på"" in this context implies a sense of wonder or appreciation for something, rather than wishing for something else to be different."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I was up all night) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han växte ut håret) is more likely as it directly contradicts the given information that ""Mannen gick till frisören"" meaning he went to the barber. Option B (Hans hår blev långt) does not provide any contradiction or explanation for why he would go to the barber if his hair had grown long."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken lekte med sin nya klasskamrat,"" option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag längtade après un glass mjölk,"" it is more likely that option A (I ate cakes) caused the longing for milk. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Jag bad om att fá tala med en chef) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""bad om"" means ""asked for"" in Swedish, indicating that the speaker requested to speak with a manager or supervisor. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker was asked to give their ID number."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vinden blåste genom det öppna fönstret"", option A (Dörrklockan ringde) is the most likely effect to occur."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag kopplade ur lampan) caused the stream to stop running in the house. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Viktlyftaren grönskande"", option A (Han böjde sina muskler i spegeln) is the more likely cause. The word ""grönskande"" suggests that something green or plant-like is happening, which could refer to the man's body growing or changing shape in a way that would be visible in a mirror. Option B (""Han lyfte stangen over head"") does not fit with this interpretation as it refers to an action involving a stick rather than any physical change in the man's appearance."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He took out a mini calculator) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet somnade"", option A is more likely. The father changed the baby's diaper."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The boy became blöt (wet) as a result of being hit with a water balloon.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (bilderna blev suddiga) is more likely. The idea that all people in the photos refused to smile is unlikely given the context of a photographer forgetting to use the flash.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that option A (Jag var ensam) is the correct answer. The text states that Jag avböjde inbjudan till födelsedagsfesten, indicating that the speaker declined an invitation to a birthday party. This implies that the speaker was alone at the party, as there would be no one else to share the experience with if they had not been invited. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tränade"", option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag klämde i den fuktiga svampen,"" it is more likely that water has entered the mushroom through the puncture wound caused by the claw, option A."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the resort was fully booked) is the correct answer. The fact that the group took a ferry to get to the resort suggests that it was located on an island or peninsula, which would make it difficult for the group to reach if it were not fully booked. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hon wanted to rebel) is more likely. The fact that she was afraid of needles suggests that she may have been hesitant or resistant to getting a tattoo, but her desire to rebel could still motivate her to go through with it despite any fears or reservations.
"Response: 
Option A: I became suspicious. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person will become suspicious rather than calling the police. The fact that a strange car is parked outside their house could raise concerns about potential danger or illegal activity, leading them to feel uneasy and investigate further. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Bevisen pekade på honom) is more likely. The text states that ""bevisen pekade på honom,"" indicating that there were evidence pointing towards him as the perpetrator."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He cut off sweets) is more likely to lead to weight loss than option B (He avoided caffeine). This is because cutting back on sugary foods and drinks can have a significant impact on overall calorie intake, leading to weight loss over time. In contrast, while avoiding caffeine may help some people feel less hungry or increase their physical activity levels, it is unlikely to result in significant weight loss without other dietary changes.
Response:  Option A: Hon gled. (She glided)
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan had rings under her eyes,"" it is more likely that she was up all night (Option A). This is because rings under the eyes are a common symptom of lack of sleep or fatigue, rather than an indication that she laid her son to bed."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan tog på sig skorna,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Hon kände alla på festen,"" is correct. The sentence suggests that the woman put on her shoes, which implies that she was preparing to attend a party or social gathering where she would meet people (kända). Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag gick ut genom fönstret,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Huset brann,"" is the correct cause. The phrase ""gick ut genom fönstret"" suggests that someone left the house through a window, which could be an indication of a fire."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken fingrar blev prunny,"" option A (Han tog en lång dusch) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""fingrar blev prunny"" means ""hands became soft/smooth,"" which suggests that something gentle or soothing was applied to the hands. Taking a long shower would be a common way to relax and soften one's skin, making it the most likely explanation for why the boy's hands were feeling smooth."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag spottade ut mjölken,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mjölken smakade sur,"" is the correct answer. This is because ""spotta"" means to spit out or cough up something, so it implies that the milk tasted unpleasant or sour."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag missade bussen,"" it is more likely that option B (Jag var sen till jobbet) is correct."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the car was crushed (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they won the competition. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sodavåset siffrade"", option A (Jag vände på flaskan) is the more likely cause. The word ""vända"" in Swedish means to turn or rotate something around its axis, which could potentially explain why the bottle's label was upside down. Option B (Jag vridde av locket) does not provide a clear explanation for how the label ended up upside down."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he climbed up onto the roof (Option B). The phrase ""utlåst from his house"" implies that he was outside and not inside the building, so Option A (""he kröp in through an open window"") is less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dörrklockan ringde"", option A (Besökaren knackade på dörren) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen fläckade sin kostym"", it is more likely that he spilled something on his shirt (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Flickan spottade ut tandkräm) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that something was forced out of the girl's mouth against her will, implying that she did not intentionally spit out the toothpaste. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome than option A (Tandkrämmen sprutade ut ur röret), which implies that the toothpaste came out of the drain on its own without any external force.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pacifister protested) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan drog bandet ur håret,"" option A (Hon band bandet) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""drogs bandet ur håret"" means to pull someone's hair, so it is likely that the girl pulled the boy's hair rather than him pulling her hair. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Han aged rather than looking younger. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""En kyckling föddes ur ägget,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ägget kläcktes,"" occurred. This is because the word ""kylking"" implies a process of hatching or birth from an egg, rather than breaking or destroying one. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fångarna svälte"", it is more likely that Option A: Han dog. is correct. The word ""svält"" means ""to starve"" in Swedish, implying that the prisoners were not receiving enough food to sustain themselves. It is unlikely that they would have been able to escape from their captors given these circumstances."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He fell off the ladder) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet brast,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Han tog en slurk läsk"" (He took a gulp of cola) occurred. This is because the word ""brast"" in Swedish typically means to take a deep breath or gulp something down quickly, which aligns with the idea of taking a drink. Option B, ""Han öppnade soda burken"" (He opened the soda can), does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jag slappnade av) is more likely. The word ""slappna"" means to relax or unwind, so it suggests that the person was feeling tense or stressed before the cold wind came in through the window, and therefore they were relieved when they felt the cool breeze. Option B (Jag skakade) means I shook, which could suggest a different reaction to the sudden change in temperature."
"Response:  Option A (Hennes klasskamrater respekterade henne)
Explanation: The premise states that the student received a scholarship to attend college, which suggests that she was academically talented or had other qualities that made her stand out. Therefore, option A is more likely as it aligns with the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan gjorde narr av pojken,"" option B (Hon var kär i honom) is the most likely cause. The word ""narr"" in Swedish means to make a story or tale about someone, often with romantic connotations. Therefore, it is likely that the girl had feelings for the boy and was thinking of him in a romantic way. Option A (She lived beside him) does not provide any information about the nature of their relationship."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den hungrige vaggaren stal mat,"" option B (Han had no money) is more likely. The phrase ""stal mat"" implies that the man was in a desperate situation and did not have any other means of obtaining food, leading to him resorting to stealing. Having no money would be a significant obstacle for someone trying to purchase food legally, making it a more plausible explanation for why he stole."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen räckte ut handen till mig"", option A (I shook his hand) is more likely."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan bet sig i naglarna,"" option A (Hon var orolig) is more likely as it aligns with the emotional state implied by the premise."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag har markerat ett möte på kalendern) is the correct answer.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan tappade gummibollen"", option A (Bolen hoppade) is the most likely outcome."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hans motståndare tacklade han"", option A is more likely. The word ""tacklade"" implies physical contact or violence, so it's more likely that Hans' opponent struck him than vice versa."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag plockade tomaterna från vinstockarna,"" it is more likely that option A, ""De var mogna,"" is the correct answer. The phrase ""plockade"" means to pick or pluck, indicating that the author picked ripe tomatoes from the garden."

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option B (Vädret became warmer) caused the temperature to rise in the thermometer.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the roof of the courthouse was blown off) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Hans's betyg förbättrades (his grades improved) than that he fuskade på provet (he cheated on the test). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag kände migbekväm"", option A is more likely. The word ""kände"" means felt or sensed, so it's unlikely that the person actually knelt down or wrapped themselves in a filt."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag polerade stenen"", it is more likely that Option A: Det blev halvt slickigt will occur. This is because the word ""polerade"" in Swedish means to smooth or shine something using a polishing compound, so it implies that the stone became partially smoothed or shined after being polished. Therefore, Option A is the most appropriate answer choice based on the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag lade socker i kaffet,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Kaffet luktade starkt,"" will occur. This is because adding sugar to coffee will make it taste stronger, not sweeter."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he has cut himself in paper (Option A). The phrase ""blandade genom tidningarna"" suggests that he has carefully and deliberately torn or cut through multiple pages of a newspaper, rather than simply tearing them into smaller pieces ( Option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag slog i spiken med hammaren"", option A is more likely. The word ""slog"" implies a forceful impact, which would cause the nail to sink into the wood rather than being rotated. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fisken bet i snöret,"" it is more likely that option A (Fiskaren dropped the line) occurred. The wording of the premise suggests that something was caught or hooked onto the line, rather than something being pulled back towards the fisherman. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she took off her retainer (Option B). The reason being that a ""finn"" is not a common term used to describe a retainer, but rather a slang term for a Finnish person. Therefore, Option A is less plausible."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mitt ansiktsuttryck lyser upp"", option A (Jag fick goda nyheter) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Mina händer var våta) is the more likely cause. The fact that the speaker has a handkerchief suggests that they are trying to dry their hands, implying that their hands are already wet. Therefore, option B is the better fit for the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen tappade balansen på stolen"", option A is more likely. The word ""tappade"" in Swedish means ""lost balance"". Therefore, it is more likely that the man lost his balance rather than spilling something on the chair."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De förlorade spelet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag bad om förlåtelse,"" option A is more likely. The word ""bad"" in this context implies regret or remorse for something that has happened, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The man talked about himself continuously during the date, indicating that he was self-centered and not interested in getting to know the woman better.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan log,"" Option A (Her children were born) is more likely."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Many became sick) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De skulle gå in i motgående trafik) is more likely. The fact that the guard blew his whistle at the children suggests that they were doing something wrong or out of place, and going into oncoming traffic would be a dangerous action for them to take without proper supervision. Therefore, it is more likely that the guard was warning them about their proximity to the road rather than recognizing them from their neighborhood.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag vände ögonen på min vän,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""vände ögonen"" means to turn one's eyes away or to avoid looking at something, so it suggests that the speaker is not telling the truth about what their friend said. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bilen fick slut på bensin,"" it is more likely that Option A (the driver was stuck on the road) occurred. This is because running out of gasoline would prevent the car from moving forward, causing the driver to be stranded on the road until assistance arrives."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannens hatt blåste bort,"" option A (Han took off his hat) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hon fick en inbjudan) is more likely as it suggests that she received an invitation to the party rather than buying a present for her classmate's birthday celebration.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She saw the finish line) is more likely. The premise states that she was running at a slow pace, indicating that she was conserving her energy for the final stretch of the race. Therefore, it is more likely that she was motivated by the sight of the finish line rather than saving energy.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken sparkade automat,"" option A is more likely. The word ""sparkade"" implies that there was a sudden electrical discharge or spark, which could potentially damage the machine's electrical system and cause it to malfunction. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the machine stopped working."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min väns hund dog"", option A (Jag vände ögonen på honom) is more likely. The phrase ""vände ögonen på"" means to turn one's eyes away or to avoid something unpleasant, so it suggests that the speaker did not want to confront the death of their friend's dog directly. Option B (Jag gav honom en kram) means ""I gave him a hug"", which does not fit with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Option A: He wrote a debt letter.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen förbannede,"" option A (Han klippte naglarna) is the more likely cause. The word ""förbannelse"" in Swedish means to curse or swear, so it's unlikely that he would have accidentally stumbled upon his own toenail while cursing."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hans bror bråkade med deras föräldrar) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: She looked at the stars."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag placerade affischen ovanför dörren) caused the poster to be hung on the wall. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Arkitekten konstruerade byggnaden) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen tappade sin sked,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tappade"" means ""to tap"" or ""to hit,"" so it's more likely that Hans hand accidentally hit his skate than he intentionally sliced it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Styrelsen upplöste företaget) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jag närmade mig podiet) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hans familj betalade borgen) is more likely. The fact that he was released from prison suggests that his family paid the bond or fine to secure his release, rather than resorting to violent actions such as attacking a fellow inmate.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their house burned down (Option B) than they sold their house (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The burden of proof is on the person who made the claim (Jag), so they must provide evidence to support their statement. Since there is no indication that the dog was involved in the situation, it is unlikely that the dog will be ""krossaded"" or harmed in any way. On the other hand, since the burden of proof is on Jag, he/she must provide evidence to support his/her claim that he/she stepped on an aluminum can. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She learned to communicate) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Jag lyssnade på musik) caused Mitt humör förbättrades. This is because listening to music has been shown to have a positive impact on mood and emotional well-being, whereas cleanliness may not necessarily affect one's mood directly.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they gave food to the homeless (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Passangererna skrek) is more likely. The use of the word ""sjunk"" instead of a more gentle verb like ""slid"" or ""glided"" suggests that there was a sudden and dramatic drop down the hill, which would cause passengers to scream in alarm rather than laugh."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I slammed the door when I left the house) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen ville seg soloppgangen,"" option A (Han resta norut) is more likely. The phrase ""ville seg"" means ""to want to see/experience something,"" so it's likely that the man wanted to go north rather than wake up early."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag vikte papperet,"" option A (I folded the paper) is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ledare i andra länder sände nödhjälp) is more likely. The text states that ""ledare i andra länder"" (leaders from other countries) sent aid, indicating a collective effort to provide assistance. This suggests that the leaders of different nations worked together to respond to the natural disaster, rather than forming an alliance to address the issue. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken var blöt,"" it is more likely that he fell into the pool (Option B). The word ""blöt"" in Swedish means wet or soaked, indicating that the boy was already in contact with water before falling into the pool."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (the book would be sent back to the library) is the correct answer. This is because the passage states that ""Studenten skyndade sig att läsa boken färdig,"" indicating that they finished reading the book quickly, suggesting that they did not have much time to read it before returning it to the library."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han blev fängslat) is more likely as it states that the criminal was imprisoned rather than executed or convicted of murder.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Solsken kom in i rummet"", option A is more likely. The sunlight entering the room suggests that the door or window was opened, rather than the door being locked."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag drog i den bedragarens hår,"" it is more likely that option A will occur, as pulling someone's hair can cause them to lose their wig or hairpiece. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han tyckte att manuskriptet var overtygande) is more likely. The use of ""omformulerat"" in the premise suggests that there was a change made to the original text, which implies that the editor found something lacking or unclear in the original version. Therefore, it is more likely that the editor thought the manuscript was convincing rather than confusing."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hon insåg att kortet saknades) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen och kvinnan blev kära"", it is more likely that they got married (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I wrote my own song) is more likely. The author believes that their own music would be stronger than the existing music they are listening to, so they decide to write their own song instead of adjusting the volume.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken had hair that stood up,"" option A is more likely. The reason being that a boy's hair standing up is a common occurrence, while a girl disturbing or pulling someone else's hair is less common. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the boy's hair stands up in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I sprayed myself with insect repellent) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Insects are crushed,"" which suggests that a liquid or gas was used to harm or kill them. Spraying oneself with insect repellent would not directly result in the death of insects, whereas stepping on an insect would likely cause it to die. Therefore, option A is the more plausible choice given the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag öppnade ögonen"", option A (Jag vaknade) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option A: Jag bad honom att sänka ljudet.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Min grannes musik var högljudd"", it is more likely that the speaker asked their grandfather to lower the volume of his music rather than borrowing a CD from him."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He was sparsam with his incomes) is more likely as it suggests that he was careful with his limited resources rather than earning less than minimum wage.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He took up a hobby) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Målen sprutade överallt) is more likely. The premise mentions that the artist mixed yellow with blue, which could result in a green color. However, it does not mention anything about the paint splattering everywhere, which is the scenario described in option B. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jag had nothing to talk about) is more likely as the reason for the awkwardness in the conversation.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (I welcomed him home) is the correct answer. The premise states that his brother has been discharged from the hospital, indicating that he is now free to go home. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the speaker welcomed him back with open arms.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Föreställningens öppningsscen började) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kidnapper threatened to harm the hostage) is more likely. The fact that Gisslan underkastade sig kidnapparsorder suggests that they may have been trying to avoid conflict or danger, rather than being left alone. Therefore, it is more likely that the kidnapper made threats against Gisslan in an attempt to control them.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""En bom hördes över scenen,"" option A is more likely. The word ""bom"" typically refers to an explosive device, so it's unlikely that the musician knocked on the foot with their drumsticks. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Barnet vaknade skrikandes from a nightmare) is more likely. The use of the word ""skrikandes"" in Swedish implies that the child woke up screaming, which suggests that they were having a nightmare or experiencing some kind of distress. This is more plausible than Option B (Barnet was afraid to look under the bed), as it does not provide any context for why the child would be afraid of looking under the bed."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she was born too early) than option B (she was born deaf). The premise states that she communicates through sign language, which suggests that she has normal hearing capabilities. Therefore, it is unlikely that she was born deaf. Option A provides a more plausible explanation for why she might communicate through sign language.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Skörden dog) is more likely. The premise states that there was a drought in the region, which could potentially lead to crop failure due to lack of water. Option A (Vattnet blev förorenat) does not necessarily imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship between water pollution and crop failure.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Katten jagade fågeln"", it is more likely that Option A: Fågeln flydde iväg (Fågeln flew away) will occur."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the school has summer vacation) is the correct cause for why the girl changed schools. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Anställda gick i strejk) is more likely. The owner of the factory refused to increase wages for employees, leading to a strike by the workers.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Extremisterna påverkade honom) is correct. The premise states that the leader ""antagonized"" the extremists in his country, suggesting that they had a negative relationship. It does not imply that the extremists directly caused his death or that he was murdered by them. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Vågorna slog samman längs stranden) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something happened along the beach, rather than in the sand itself. Therefore, option B is a better fit for the given premise.
"Response: 
Option B: I drank a glass of water."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moren tystade sin son,"" it is more likely that option A (her son logged) is the correct answer. The word ""tystade"" in Swedish means to be quiet or silent, so it is unlikely that her son would be gnalling ( Option B). Therefore, the most likely explanation for why Moren is quiet is that she has silenced her son by logging him."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ett hål i mina jeans,"" it is more likely that option A (Jag har dragit upp jeans) is the correct answer. The phrase ""ett hål i"" typically means ""a hole in"" in Swedish, so it suggests that there is a hole in the speaker's jeans, rather than the speaker simply tripping or stumbling."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken had tandställning"", it is more likely that his teeth became straight (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tränade i gymmet igår,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jag vaknade idag med ont i musklerna,"" will occur. This is because training in a gym yesterday would likely cause soreness or fatigue in the muscles today."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The fact that ""andra elever vid lunchbordet kände sig utestängda"" suggests that the two girls were excluding others at the table, which could be a source of discomfort or tension for them."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hon bestämde sig för att försöka göra en flip) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Postkontoret levererade brevet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He satsade alla sina pengar) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the player was overconfident in their abilities, which could lead to them betting all of their money on a risky move. This behavior aligns with the idea of being ""själfsäker"" or overly confident."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (the winds became stronger) is a more plausible explanation for why the fire spread quickly. The text states that ""the winds had changed direction,"" indicating that the weather conditions had shifted, potentially making it easier for the fire to spread. In contrast, option B (the arsonists were caught) does not provide any evidence or context to suggest that this was a factor in the fire's rapid spread. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet flårade sitt knä"", it is more likely that his mother sent him to his room rather than putting a band-aid on the wound. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he wrote his will) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that there is no mention of any medical treatment or intervention that could have saved him from the deadly disease, such as an organ transplant. Therefore, it is more plausible that he simply made arrangements for his estate before passing away.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tog en klunk av det brännande kaffet,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Jag brände tungan,"" will occur. This is because taking a sip of hot coffee can cause burns to the tongue or mouth."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Författaren undvek att vara partisk i sina berättelser) is more likely. The fact that the editor fired the author suggests that there was a problem with the author's work, rather than simply missing a deadline.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag kände mig utmattad"", option A (I slept all day) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Hon identifierade patientens symptom) is the correct answer. The passage states that the doctor ""ställde diagnosen,"" which means she made a diagnosis or identified the patient's symptoms. This suggests that the doctor was able to identify the patient's symptoms and determine their cause, rather than simply writing out prescriptions without fully understanding the patient's condition. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag klådde mig,"" option B is more likely. The word ""klår"" means to hit or strike someone, so it is more likely that the person actually struck themselves rather than sweating excessively."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han tappade humöret) is the correct answer. The premise states that the man underwent an acute operation, which could potentially affect his mental state and lead to a drop in mood. This is a common side effect of surgery and is therefore a more plausible explanation than option B (Han fick en hjärtattack), which refers to a heart attack, which is less commonly associated with surgical procedures.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannens armmuskler bullade"", option A (Han böjde sina armar) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han blev förvunnad) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I understood his intentions were good) is more likely. The speaker seems to be taking a positive view of their colleague's actions, suggesting that they believed their colleague had good intentions behind their mistake.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he started training earlier (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Anfallaren became lifeless) will occur. The phrase ""slog sin angripare i näsan"" suggests a violent or aggressive act, and the use of the word ""livlös"" to describe the outcome implies that the person was seriously injured or killed. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mannen siktade fel) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man discovered a rat infestation in his cellar (Option A). The mention of an ""avrottningsman"" suggests that there may be a problem with waste or filth in the house, which could lead to rodent infestations. Additionally, the fact that the man has a room with a myrgård (a Swedish term for a marshy area) suggests that there may be dampness or moisture issues in the home, which can also contribute to rat infestations."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag var för trött för att förbereda något) is the correct cause for why we did not go out to eat. The speaker mentions being too tired to prepare something, indicating a lack of energy or motivation to plan or prepare a meal. This suggests that they may have been too exhausted to go out and eat as well.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she began hiding her diary (Option A). The fact that she caught her brother reading her diary without permission suggests that she values her privacy and personal space, and may feel uncomfortable or vulnerable if someone else reads her diary without her consent. Therefore, it makes sense that she would take steps to protect her diary by hiding it from her brother and others.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She stopped working) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Han rörde vid den varma spisen) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that Barn's hands quickly moved back, implying that he was trying to avoid something hot. Option B (Han klappade valpens huvud) does not fit with this context as it implies that Barn was petting a dog, which is unlikely given the situation described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (De delade ut en enkät till kunderna) is more likely to increase customer satisfaction. By collecting feedback directly from customers through a survey, the company can gain valuable insights into their needs and preferences, which can help improve their overall experience with the brand. This approach also shows that the company values its customers' opinions and is willing to listen to their feedback, which can enhance their perception of the brand. In contrast, offering a discount to new customers may not necessarily lead to increased customer satisfaction, as it may not address any underlying issues or concerns that existing customers may have.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trädgolvet brutits,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Pojken kastade kuddarna från soffan,"" caused the damage to the floor. This is because the word ""kastade"" implies a sudden and forceful movement, which could potentially break or damage something like a floor. In contrast, option B does not imply any such violent action and therefore seems less likely as the cause of the damage."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag skyddade mitt ansikte,"" it is more likely that option A (Min fiende retade mig) is the correct answer. The phrase ""skyddade sitt ansikte"" means to protect or shield one's face, implying that the speaker was trying to avoid being hit or attacked. Therefore, it is unlikely that option B (Min fiende höjde en knytnäve) is the correct answer, as there is no indication in the premise that the speaker was struck with a fist."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the statue was struck by lightning) caused the fire than Option B (people came to worship the statue). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that a fly (Option B) swarmed on the fruit than for the fruit to produce seeds (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option B.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Hon pekade med tårna) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""Ballerinan rev et ligament,"" which means she twisted or turned her ankle. This suggests that she may have injured her ankle while pointing with her toes, rather than by rotating her foot. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how she might have caused the injury."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet fick slippa sina skosnören,"" it is more likely that he learned to tie them (Option A). The sentence suggests that he was able to learn a new skill or technique in response to the situation, rather than simply running around on the playground (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jag lämnade tillbacka boken) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hans föräldrar påverkade honom) is more likely. The passage states that ""Mannen had similar religious beliefs as his parents,"" indicating that he was influenced by them. It does not suggest that his parents abandoned him or neglected to influence him in any way. Therefore, it is more likely that his parents' beliefs and values were passed down to him through their upbringing and interactions with him."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the car ran out of gas) caused the traffic to slow down gradually. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen åt glass i solen,"" option A (Julen förlorade sin smak) is more likely. The phrase ""mannen åt glass i solen"" means ""the man ate glass in the sun,"" which is an absurd and impossible scenario. Therefore, it is unlikely that anything good or positive would happen as a result of this action. Option B (""Ja, det dropper från konen"") is also nonsensical, but it does not convey the same level of impossibility as option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mattan saw smutsig out) is more likely. The text states that ""Jag hängde upp konstverk i rummet,"" indicating that something was hung up in the room. If the mattress was also seen as smutsig, it suggests that someone had been working or creating something in the room, rather than the walls being blank."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (My chef held a meeting) is more likely as it provides a specific reason for leaving work early that is related to the context of the situation. Option A (I had a headache) is not directly related to the scenario provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Valpen smutsade mattan"", option A (Ägaren skälle på valpen) is more likely. This is because the word ""smutsa"" in Swedish means to soil or stain something, so it's likely that the dog has made a mess somewhere. The phrase ""ägaren skälle på valpen"" also implies scolding or reprimanding the dog for its behavior, rather than rewarding it with a treat."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag bad min vän om ursäkta"", it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Min vän förlät mig"". This is because the wording of the premise implies a request for forgiveness, which suggests that there has been some kind of wrongdoing or offense committed by the speaker against their friend, and therefore it is more likely that their friend will choose to forgive them rather than become angry."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen stod ut i mängden"", option A (Han bar en ryggsäck) is more likely as it provides additional information that helps to identify the man in a crowd. The presence of a backpack can make someone stand out from others in a crowd, especially if they are not carrying anything else that would draw attention. On the other hand, having a neon vest does not necessarily help to distinguish one person from another in a large group. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vittnet ljög under ed"", it is more likely that Option A: Han avslutade sitt vittnesmål (He finished his testimony) is correct. The wording of the premise suggests that the witness lied during their testimony, which would mean they have completed their statement and are no longer testifying."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan färgade håret,"" it is more likely that she wanted a new look or to blend in with her surroundings (Option A)."
"Response: 
Option B: Deporterades. 
Explanation: The premise states that the undocumented immigrants were caught illegally residing in the country. This implies that they are at risk of being deported, rather than finding legal employment. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Publiken skrattade) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tittade in i solen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Solen gjorde mig blind,"" occurred. The phrase ""tittrade in"" means to look into or gaze at something intensely, so it is reasonable to assume that the person looked directly at the sun without proper protection, causing them to become temporarily or permanently blinded by the intense light. Option B, ""Solen brände min hud,"" does not align with the premise as it implies a superficial burn from the sun's rays rather than the direct damage caused by looking directly at the sun."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag kände mig uttråkad,"" option A (Jag snorkade) is more likely. The word ""snorka"" means to yawn or stretch, which are actions that people often do when they feel bored or tired. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise than option B (Jag gäsade), which means to laugh or make fun of someone."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Biffen was raw) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why Biffen would be difficult to cut.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hon fick underhåll) is correct. The woman explained herself bankrupt, indicating that she received financial support or maintenance from someone else.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ljuset i min väns lägenhet var tänt,"" option A (Jag undrade om han var ute) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag satte blomman under näsan"", it is more likely that option A - ""Blomstren föll av"" will occur. This is because when you place a flower under your nose, the scent of the flower will be stronger and more noticeable to you. Therefore, it is more likely that the blossoms will fall off rather than you feeling their fragrance."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan kände nostalgi"", option A (Hon träffade en barndomsvän) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han lämnade in papperet tidigt) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min bil gick sönder,"" option A (Jag gick till köpcentret) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something has gone wrong with the car, and going to a shopping center would not be the most logical response. Option B (Jag ringde en mekaniker) could also be a possible solution, but it's less directly related to the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag kastade lappen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Det var anonymt,"" is the correct cause. This is because the sentence suggests that someone threw a ball (lappen) without specifying who did so, implying that the action was anonymous."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fågeln flaxade med vingarna"", it is more likely that option A (Den la ägg) is correct. The verb ""flaxade"" means to flap or wave, which suggests that the bird was in motion, rather than standing still or rising upwards. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The garage being open suggests that there may be a car inside, while the garage being full implies that there are already cars present in the garage.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the perpetrator aimed the gun at their victim) suggests that the perpetrator was preparing to fire the weapon, making it more likely that they would pull the trigger. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag såg fram emot helgen"", option A (Jag planerade att gå på min farbrors begravning) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag drömde) is the correct answer. The phrase ""jag tappade tidsbegreppet"" suggests that something unexpected happened to the speaker's sense of time, which could be a common experience during dreams. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the writer had a low supply of ink (Option A). The passage states that the document was ""unreadable"" due to the ink running out, indicating that the problem was related to the lack of ink rather than the absence of paper. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Fansen rusade in på planen) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dippen smakade blek,"" it is more likely that option A (Jag serverade den) is correct. The word ""dipping"" implies immersion or dipping something into a liquid, which could cause the food to taste bland or unappetizing. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker served the food rather than adding salt to it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A, ""Handduken absorberade vätskan"", will occur. The wording of the premise suggests that something was placed on top of a surface (spilln), and then an action was taken to cover it (satte pappershandduken på). This implies that whatever was on the surface before has been covered or hidden by the paper handkerchief. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hon bokmärkte sin sida) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mannen spände på sitt säkerhetsbältet) is more likely. The premise suggests that the man was preparing for a bumpy ride or turbulence, which would require him to fasten his seatbelt. Option B (Mannen tittade ut genom fönstret) does not provide any contextual clues about the situation being described, making it less likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken flinched,"" it is more likely that option B: Flickan stötte honom (The girl pushed him). This is because the word ""flinched"" implies a sudden movement or reaction to something unexpected or unpleasant, which could be caused by physical contact or pressure from someone else."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (De amputerade hennes ben) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the doctors gave the patient a ""constructional limb,"" which implies that they performed an amputation. This is a surgical procedure that involves removing a body part, such as a limb, for therapeutic or reconstructive purposes. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she will react with option A - ""Hon ryckte på axlarna mot honom"". This response indicates a nonchalant or dismissive attitude towards his actions, rather than actively pulling away from him."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The speaker seems to be indicating that they already knew they were right before asking their friend for advice, so option B is a better fit.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken trampade i lera,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mudden fastnade i hans skor,"" will occur. This is because the word ""trampa"" (meaning ""mud"") suggests a wet and dirty environment, making it more plausible for mud to get stuck in someone's shoes than for them to be hit in the face."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that skolorna (schools) stängdes (were closed). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the tree fell on the roof) caused the damage to the house. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag staplade veden i spisen) caused the tree to split. This is because stapping wood in a fireplace can generate high temperatures that may be strong enough to split a tree. Option B (Jag svängde yxan ner mot träet) does not provide any information about how the tree was affected, so it cannot be determined if this action would have caused the tree to split.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She liked him) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I was confused) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnans bil var i verkstaden,"" option A (Hennes körkort togs tillback) is the most likely cause.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag sov mitt alarm,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jag har gjort frukost,"" is correct. The sentence suggests that the speaker overslept their alarm, indicating that they were not awake to make breakfast."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (His family was present at the press conference) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Badvattnet blev ljummet) is more likely to occur as a result of the woman lingering in the bathtub. As she stays longer than expected, the water may become cooler due to evaporation or other factors, leading to an unpleasant bathing experience. Option B (Badvattnet dränerades ut ur badkaret) is less likely to happen since it implies that all the water from the bathtub has been drained out, which is unlikely to occur just because the woman took too long in the bath.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han gick med i et brödraskap) is more likely. The premise mentions that the students wanted to meet other students on campus, which suggests that they were looking for social interactions with their peers. Joining a fraternity would provide an opportunity for socializing with like-minded individuals who share similar interests and goals. Therefore, option A is more likely than option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag lyfted upp soffkuddarna"", option A (I looked for small change) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vespen flög mot pojken"", it is more likely that option A (Pojken sprang iväg) is correct. The word ""flög"" in Swedish implies movement towards something or someone, so it suggests that the wasp flew towards the boy. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the boy ran away to avoid the wasp."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was sentenced to community service (option A). The phrase ""skyldig till ett brott"" means ""guilty of a crime,"" and ""samhälltjänst"" is a type of punishment in Sweden where the offender performs work for the benefit of society, such as cleaning up public spaces or volunteering at non-profit organizations. On the other hand, ""dödscell"" means ""death cell,"" which is not a real thing in Swedish law. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag blandade sockret i det varma teet,"" it is more likely that the sockret has dissolved into the tea rather than the tea steaming. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he was drafted into the war) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Veteranen gick med en halt"" suggests that the man went to war, rather than being injured during combat. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Brottslingarna rymde från polisen"", it is more likely that option A, ""Polisen took care of the victim"" is correct. This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the criminals escaped from the police, implying that they were in custody or under investigation by the authorities before escaping. Therefore, it is unlikely that the police would have taken care of the victim at this point in time."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jag tappade den) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the laptop won't turn on. Losing or misplacing the device is a common reason why a laptop may not start up. On the other hand, Option B (Jag laddade den) does not provide any explanation for why the laptop won't turn on, and it is less likely to be the correct answer based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Hon had a comprehensive wardrobe) is the correct answer. The statement ""Kvinnan had slut på rum"" implies that she had a lot of clothes in her closet, which supports Option A. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (His job offer was rescinded) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Spelaren slår bollen mot hålet"", it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Bollen gick in i hålet"". This is because striking a ball against a hole implies that the ball has a high probability of entering the hole rather than bouncing back to the player."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag ochades i dammet på vinden,"" option A, ""Jag hickade"" is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kunden använde falska pengar) is more likely as a cause for why the customer's account was debited without their knowledge or consent. Using fake money to make purchases is a common scam that can result in unauthorized charges being made to a person's account. It is less likely that the customer would forget to turn off their lights at home and leave them on for an extended period of time, resulting in a large electricity bill.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tog ut soporna"", option A is the most likely cause - ""Av skräpet luktade köket illa"". This is because taking out the trash would be a common solution to getting rid of unpleasant odors in the kitchen."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that barnens beundrade djuren (Option A).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Hans's kidneys failed rather than his lungs were overloaded. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jag frågade min vän om vägen till platsen) is more likely. The premise mentions that you had an extra ticket to the concert, implying that you already knew someone who was interested in going with you. Therefore, it's more likely that you would ask your friend for directions rather than asking if they were interested in going with you.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jag öppnade fönstren) is more likely. The premise states that the air conditioning in the house broke down, which suggests a hot environment. Opening windows would be a common solution to cool down such an environment. Option A (Jag tog fram filtar) does not necessarily address the issue of a broken air conditioner or provide any relief from heat.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pojken har ont i ryggen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Hans ryggsäck var öppen,"" caused his back pain. This is because an open backpack can potentially put pressure on the spine and cause discomfort or pain. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag bakade en tårta åt henne) is the correct cause for why Jag köpte en present till min mamma. The fact that Jag bakade a cake for her suggests that Jag wanted to give her a special treat or gift as a present, rather than simply buying her a present because of her birthday.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Narcissus i trädgården förstördes,"" option A (a gardener accidentally stepped on him) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag slog i tändstiften,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Flamman försvann"" (The flame disappeared) will occur. This is because striking a match stick can cause the flame to go out, rather than creating one."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They wanted to avoid discussing in court) is more likely. The text states that they ""came to an agreement,"" implying a resolution without going through the legal process of a trial. This suggests that they were able to find common ground and settle their differences outside of court, rather than continuing to fight it out in front of a judge."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their parents died rather than abandoned them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that a tsunami occurred (Option A).

Hailing would not typically cause such a significant impact."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vandraren stötte på en giftig orm,"" it is more likely that she became dehydrated (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ugnen blev het,"" option A is more likely. The sentence implies that something happened to the oven, making it hotter than usual. Setting a pot on the oven would not make the oven hotter, but rather the opposite - it would be cooler as there would be less heat inside the oven. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the oven became hotter."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Citronen became möglig) is more likely. The word ""kclam"" in Swedish means to squeeze or press something, so it's possible that the speaker accidentally squished the lemon while holding it, causing it to become mushy or soft. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the context of the sentence."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Den krossades over hela golvet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bordet vacklade"", it is more likely that option A: ""Golvet var ojämnt"" (The floor was uneven) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hans son erkände sanningen) is more likely. The premise states that Fadern fångade sin son på att ljuga, implying that the son was caught lying. Therefore, it is more likely that the son will admit to telling a lie rather than the father trusting him without any evidence.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannens huvud slog av smärta"", it is more likely that he took option A - ""Han tog hostmedicin"". This is because headache medication (hostmedicin) is a common treatment for headaches or migraines, while aspirin is typically used to treat pain or inflammation in other parts of the body, such as the stomach or muscles."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tåget saktade ner"", option A is more likely. The train was approaching the station, which means it was slowing down to stop at the station. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han had a psychiatric disorder in the family) is the correct answer. The text states that Han went through therapy, but does not provide any specific details about his mental health history or diagnosis. It only mentions that he had a ""psychiatric disorder"" in his family without providing further context or clarification. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Han's own mental health issues may have been inherited from someone else in his family rather than being caused by a recent traumatic event."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Kvinnangrep om halsen"", it is more likely that she choked on her food (Option B). Choosing Option A would suggest that she swallowed her food, which does not align with the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan had ont i halsen,"" it is more likely that she spoke with a raspy voice (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hunden stirrade på den saftiga biffen på bordet,"" it is more likely that the dog drooled (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hon sparkade sina anställda) is correct. The phrase ""lyckades"" in Swedish implies success or achievement, but also carries a connotation of forcefulness or aggression. Given this context, it seems more plausible that the woman was able to achieve her goals through dismissing her employees rather than simply becoming rich."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eleverna lämnade klassrummet"", option A (Klockan ringde) is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option B: Her friend was related to her."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he died ( Option B) than that he lost his hearing (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ballongen steg upp i luften) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han fick en stroke) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""mannen förlorade förmågan att tala,"" which means he lost the ability to speak, indicating a neurological problem such as a stroke. This is a more plausible explanation than option B (Han tog ett djupt andetag), which suggests that he took a deep breath, which would not result in losing the ability to speak."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (there was a crack in the sidewalk) is more likely to be the cause of the woman's sudden stop while walking down the street. The use of the word ""snubblade"" suggests that she may have tripped or stumbled over something unexpectedly, which could have been caused by a small fissure or crack in the pavement. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mannen blötade livräddaren) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag tog antibiotika"", it is more likely that the infection has been cured (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the driver pressed the brake pedal (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I blotted the container in warm water) is more likely to have caused it to melt than option B (I placed the container on the hot stove). This is because immersing the plastic container in warm water can cause it to soften and become pliable, making it more susceptible to melting when exposed to heat. Placing the container directly on a hot surface, such as a stove, can also cause it to melt, but this process may take longer due to the limited exposure of the plastic to heat.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bilen blev bucklad,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""bilen blev bucklad"" suggests that the car stalled or broke down, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as mechanical issues or running out of fuel. It is less likely that the driver deliberately drove onto a telephone pole (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he studied all night (Option B). The premise states that ""he studied,"" implying that he put in effort to prepare for the exam. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would have skipped the exam altogether (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The reason being that the phrase ""klamrade sig fast"" suggests a sense of fear or hesitation, which aligns with the idea that the boy was afraid to learn how to swim. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the young boy held onto the edge of the pool."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag la handen på bröstet"", option A is more likely. When you touch your chest, it can make you feel like your heart is racing or beating faster, which is why option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Mitt kontor var fullsatt) is true. The sentence ""Byggnaden intill mitt kontor var under uppbyggnad"" implies that there was construction going on near my office, but does not provide any information about whether or not my office itself was busy. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why I might have been unable to focus."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Familjen bjöd in grannarna till middag) is more likely. The family wants to get to know their new neighbors, so they invite them over for a meal, which is a friendly and welcoming gesture. Option B (Familjen vinkade till grannarna from their garden) does not convey the same level of intentionality or hospitality as option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vatten sprutade upp från poolen"", it is more likely that option A: Simmaren dyck ner i poolen (the swimmer dived into the pool). This is because the water spurted up from the pool, indicating that there was a disturbance in the water, which could have been caused by the swimmer diving in."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag bet i en skiva vattenmelon,"" option A (I accidentally ate a frozen watermelon) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Hans' jacket was lost (Option A). The phrase ""Hans jacka var loss"" means ""Hans' jacket was lost,"" indicating that the speaker believes Jack's jacket to be missing or misplaced."
"Response:  Option A (Hon became distracted by noise)
Explanation: The premise states that the woman put earplugs in, indicating that she was trying to block out noise. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause as it suggests that she became distracted by something else rather than having holes in her ears."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Jag drack allt vatten i den) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Jag fyllde på min vattenflaska"" means ""I filled up my water bottle,"" indicating that the speaker added water to the bottle. Therefore, it is unlikely that the speaker would then drink all the water in the bottle, as there wouldn't be any left over. Option B (""Jag har den i kylskåppet"") means ""I have it in the fridge,"" which doesn't make sense in this context."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the show contained vulgar language) is more likely to be the reason for censorship.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Skeppet gick sönder,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Besättningen drunknade,"" occurred. The phrase ""gick sönder"" implies a sudden and catastrophic event, such as a shipwreck or explosion, which could result in the crew drowning rather than encountering pirates."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (He solved the riddle) is correct. The use of the word ""förbryllad"" (forbidden) suggests that the boy was confused or perplexed by the riddle, rather than asking for a hint or solution. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Telefonen ringde"", option A (Mannen lade på luren) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan stirrade på mig"", it is more likely that Option A: ""Jag kramade henne"" is the correct answer. The word ""stirrade"" in Swedish means to stare at someone with a strong gaze, indicating a sense of unease or discomfort. Therefore, option B is less likely as there is no indication of feeling uncomfortable in the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De took pictures of the exhibitions) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen började gräla med mig"", option A (Min vän presenterade mig för mannen) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jag pumpar luft i däcket) is more likely to make a difference in flattening Mitt's cycle tire. Pumping air into the tire will increase the pressure and help to flatten it out again. Option B (Jag bytte växlar på cykeln) may not have as much of an impact on the flat tire.
"Response: 
Option A: Hennes far läste en saga för henne.  
Explanation: The premise ""Flickan såg blek ut"" suggests that something is wrong with the girl's appearance, implying that she may be feeling unwell or unhappy. Option A is more likely because it provides a plausible reason for the girl's behavior, as reading a story can help to distract her from her discomfort or provide comfort. In contrast, option B does not offer any clear explanation for why the girl would look so pale, making option A the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pennan var slut på bläck,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jag använde en penna,"" is correct. The word ""slut"" in Swedish means ""empty,"" so if the pen was empty, it would be unlikely for the speaker to have written their name with it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han var i skuld) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hon had vattkoppors) is the correct answer. The phrase ""stannade hemma"" suggests that she did not go to school, implying that she was at home instead of being in class. Additionally, the mention of ""vattkoppors"" specifically implies that she was feeling unwell or experiencing some kind of discomfort, which could have prevented her from going to school. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the girl stayed home from school."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Jag dumpade den i diskbänken) is more likely. The sentence implies that the protagonist took the bag to the trash can, rather than putting it in a recycling bin or donating it to charity. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag har dammsugit mattan,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Min rumskompis spillde punch,"" caused the mess. This is because the sentence suggests that someone (the speaker) has vacuumed the floor, indicating a deliberate action taken to clean the area. In contrast, option B, ""Min hund tappar hår,"" means ""My dog pulls hair,"" which does not suggest any direct causality for the mess in the room. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he kastade a stool over the room) is more likely. The premise suggests that he lost his temper, which could lead to destructive behavior like throwing objects. Option A (he shut down his computer) does not necessarily indicate any kind of emotional outburst or destruction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flickan kastade en kvist i lägerelden"", option A is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the girl threw a twig into the campfire, which would likely result in the twig burning rather than the fire extinguishing. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen kom ut ur duschen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Det varma vattnet var borta,"" is the correct cause. The man coming out of the shower suggests that he was in a state of being wet, which would make it unlikely for him to not have a towel available. Therefore, the absence of warm water is a more plausible explanation for why he does not have a towel."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They encouraged their children to play outside) is more likely. The parents want their children to go to college, but they do not have a savings fund for that purpose. Therefore, they are unlikely to encourage their children to play outside as an alternative way to spend time. Instead, they would probably focus on saving money for their children's education.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen tog loss sina skor"", option A (Skorna löste sig) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen åt halva rätten"", option A is more likely. The word ""kylde"" in Swedish means to freeze or cool down, so it's unlikely that he saved the recipe. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min fotled var svullen"", it is more likely that option A (Jag satte is på den) occurred, as applying ice to a swollen foot would be a common remedy for reducing inflammation. Option B (Jag gnuggade lotion på den) does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min dörr var öppen"", it is more likely that option A (Jag pratade med min kollega vid mitt skrivbord) is correct. This is because if the door was open, it would be more likely for you to have been in your office rather than in the hallway."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jag fick vänta i kön"", it is more likely that option A (Jag satte mig) is correct. The word ""fick"" in Swedish means ""had to wait"", so it implies that the speaker had to sit somewhere while waiting. Option B (""Jag skummade en tidning"") does not fit with this context as it means ""I read a newspaper""."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen slog på fluga"", option A is more likely. The word ""slog"" implies a strong and sudden movement, which would suggest that the man threw the fly away with force. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He was dying) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He accelerated his step) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B occurred - ""Jag kom på en lösning"" (I came up with a solution). The premise states that the speaker has thought about the problem, implying that they have been considering different solutions or ideas to address it. This suggests that they may have come up with their own solution rather than seeking advice from someone else."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He felt extatic) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He did a bet with his friends) is more likely. The text states that he ""gjorde ett vad"" which means he made a bet in Swedish. This implies that he placed a wager with his friends on the outcome of the game, which makes Option B more likely than Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He set his alarm clock) is more likely. The premise mentions that the boy could not sleep, so it is unlikely that he would have been able to count sheep.
