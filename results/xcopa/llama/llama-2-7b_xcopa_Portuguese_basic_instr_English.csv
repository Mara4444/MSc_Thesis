Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It was fragile) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Recuperei um talão de bilhete) is more likely. The phrase ""Esvaziei os bolsos"" suggests that the speaker's pockets were emptied, which could indicate a loss of personal belongings such as a wallet. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the termites ate through the wood of the house (Option B). The disappearance of the nails suggests that they were consumed by something, and given the nature of termites as wood-eating insects, this option seems most plausible.
"Response:  Option B: O agente da patrulha acusou-os de contrabando.  
Explanation: The premise ""Os viajantes chegaram à fronteira"" suggests that they are at a border crossing, and the agent of the patrol has the authority to check their documents and goods. Therefore, it is more likely that the agent will accuse them of smuggling rather than simply checking their passports."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It was a holiday) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ela saltou da corda) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that a young girl ran out of energy, which could potentially lead to her jumping from a cord or climbing something to get some height and regain her strength. Option A (She played dams) does not make as much sense in this context, as it would require additional information about why she was playing dams in the first place.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mais pessoas entraram na fila) is the more likely cause. The passage states that ""A mulher perdeu o lugar na fila,"" indicating that she lost her place in line, suggesting that there were other people who entered the line after her. Therefore, it is more likely that more people entered the line than she left it."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the baby was crying in its swimsuit) is the more likely cause of the girl's nose being wet. This is because it is unlikely that the baby would have been able to reach and touch the girl's nose with its tiny hands or mouth. Therefore, it is more plausible that the baby was crying and producing tears, which could have accidentally touched the girl's nose.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the audience applauded along with the song) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the girl brought a apple to the teacher) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the orientador told them a story of ghosts) caused their fear. The mention of marshmallows being toasted at the fire suggests that they were engaging in a normal campsite activity, rather than experiencing something supernatural.
"Response: 
Option B: He had a concussion."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the account was empty) caused the check to be returned unpaid rather than option B (an increase). This is because if there were insufficient funds in the account, the bank would have rejected the check when the writer tried to deposit or cash it, rather than after a period of time had passed. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the check was not paid.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he sent an email in bulk (Option B). The fact that his mailbox was full of spam suggests that he has been receiving a large volume of unsolicited emails, which would be consistent with sending out a mass email. Apaging the spam messages would not necessarily reduce the amount of spam he receives, as new messages could continue to flow into his inbox.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O marinheiro foi puesto em quarentena,"" it is more likely that he was exposed to a disease (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ela recitou-o para si mesma) is more likely. The fact that she remembered the code suggests that she may have repeated it to herself in order to retain it in her memory.
Response:  Option A - The water quenched my thirst.
"Response: 
A) He wanted to offer support to his friend."
"Response: 
Option A: Senti-me culpado. "
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (A corrente está envolvido em um pneu) is the most likely cause of the problem. The premise mentions that ""a corrente desfez-se,"" indicating that there was a failure in the electrical system. Since a pneumatic tire can be damaged by an electrical fault, it is more likely that the issue lies with the tire rather than a broken chain link. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They got tired of discussing) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ela testemunhou no tribunal) is more likely. The premise states that she decided to run for office, indicating that she may be involved in legal proceedings related to her candidacy or political activities. Testifying in court is a common occurrence in such cases, making it a more plausible outcome than hiring a campaign manager.
"Response:  Option B - He traveled with a large suitcase.
Explanation: The man anticipated the cold weather by packing warm clothing in his suitcase, making option B (traveling with a large suitcase) the more likely explanation for why he was prepared for the cold weather."
"Response: 
Option B: He made a foolish mistake."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Os olhos do homem encheram-se de lágrimas,"" option B is the most likely cause - he put on glasses over his eyes. This is a common solution to help people see clearly when their eyes are filled with tears. Option A, ""O pó entrou nos olhos dele,"" does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that something entered his eyes."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the opponent felt sorry for her) is more likely. The idea that the opponent accused her of cheating suggests a negative reaction, while the fact that they felt sorry for her implies a more empathetic response.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the student's answers were incorrect) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Fiquei sem fôlego.
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker stopped talking suddenly, which suggests that they lost their breath or had difficulty breathing ( Option B). The possibility of losing one's voice (Option A) does not align with the given information as it would have resulted in a gradual decrease in speech rather than an abrupt stop."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (putting it in the microwave) caused the food to thaw. Microwaves are a common way to quickly heat up frozen foods, and it's possible that the food was placed in the microwave for too long or at too high of a temperature, causing it to thaw unevenly. Option B (wrapping it in plastic) may not have had any effect on the food's thawing process.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he had stomach cramps) is the correct answer. The phrase ""fingiu estar doente"" means ""lied about being sick,"" so it makes sense that the employee would come up with a plausible excuse for not coming to work. Stomach cramps are a common and relatable illness that many people experience, making it a more believable reason than simply wanting a day off."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A rapaziça caiu na piscina,"" option B (Ela saltou do trampolim) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the day of the film's release) is more likely to be the reason for the sold-out tickets.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (As pessoas elogiaram-no) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ela escreveu uma carta) is more likely. The premise states that ""As mãos da menina ficaram com bolhas,"" indicating that something unexpected happened to her hands, such as them becoming inflated or filled with air bubbles. Writing a letter would not typically result in this outcome, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the acrobatic performer balancing on a tightrope) is more likely to occur as it aligns with the context of the situation provided in the premise.
Response:  Option A (My friend made me wait).
"Response: 
Option B: They negotiated a treaty. 
Explanation: The premise states that the countries in war wanted peace, which suggests that they would be willing to engage in diplomatic efforts to achieve it. Developing nuclear weapons or using them would not necessarily lead to peace, but rather continued conflict and destruction. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
A) He became sleepy."
Response:  Option B: She hurt her knee.
"Response:  Option B: The balloon flew.
Explanation: According to the premise ""O menino espremeu o balão,"" we know that a boy squeezed the balloon. This implies that the balloon was inflated with air or gas, making it more likely that it will fly rather than burst. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They unpacked their bags) is more likely. The fact that they registered at the hotel suggests that they have arrived and are now settling in, which means they would be unpacking their bags rather than heading to the airport.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Meti um bocado no pêssego,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O pêssego magoado"" occurred. The word ""magoado"" implies a severe injury or damage to the peach tree, which could result in its being damaged or broken. Option B, ""O suco derramou-se,"" means that the juice spilled, but does not convey the same level of severity as option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""As minhas mãos ficaram pegajosas,"" it is more likely that option A (Comi um donut) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""pegajosas"" suggests a sticky or messy situation, which would be consistent with eating a donut."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu empurrei a porta,"" it is more likely that option A, ""A porta abriu-se,"" will occur. This is because when someone pushes or forces something open, it is expected that it will move out of the way."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the products were manufactured through child labor) is a more plausible cause for the boycott than option A (the products were tested for quality). The use of child labor in product manufacturing is often associated with exploitation and human rights violations, which could lead to consumer outrage and calls for boycotts.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu fiz um buraco na parede,"" it is more likely that a rat will exit the hole than for dust to come out of it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A irmã dela está feliz) is more likely. The reason for the woman's jealousy is not provided in the premise, but it is implied that her sister is happy, which could be a source of envy for the woman. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Eu coloquei um avental) will occur because the speaker mentions ""vinho"" (wine) being spilled on their shirt, indicating that they have already taken some action to address the situation by putting an apron on. Option B (Mudei de camisa) means changing shirts, which would not be necessary if the speaker had already taken steps to protect themselves from the wine spill. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the customer reviewed his wallet) is more likely than option B (the customer gave him money). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (As pessoas davam-lhe troco) is more likely. The passage states that ""a multidão"" was attracted to the musician, implying that he had an audience. It also mentions that people were giving him money, further indicating that he received financial compensation for his performance. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ele sentiu falta dos pais) is more likely. The reason for the boy's crying could be that he missed his parents who were not present to comfort him. This answer choice aligns better with the information provided in the premise compared to Option B (It was time for lunch), which does not provide any logical connection to the boy's emotional state.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The pilot flew through the storm, indicating that they navigated through it rather than avoiding it.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the leaves changed color (Option A). The premise states that the tree lost its leaves, which implies that they were once present but are now absent or gone. This could be due to various reasons such as weather conditions, disease, or old age, all of which can cause the leaves to change color before falling off. On the other hand, if the leaves had simply accumulated on the ground, there would be a significant amount of them piled up in one area, which is not what the premise suggests. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he decided to do something fun with his sister) is more likely. The fact that he was in a bad mood suggests that he might want to distract himself or lift his spirits, which could involve doing something enjoyable together with his sister. Option A (playing cards with his sister) does not necessarily imply a desire to have fun or lift his mood.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the father gave him a drink) occurred. The reason for this is that the child requested to go to the bathroom, which suggests that he may have needed to urinate or defecate. Giving him a drink would not address this issue, but rather provide temporary relief from thirst. On the other hand, stopping the car at a gas station could potentially solve the problem of needing to use the restroom by providing access to a bathroom there.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The child threw food into the tank, and the fish swam towards it, so option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she changed her political views (Option A). The passage states that ""as opinions on politics have changed,"" indicating a shift in perspective rather than a one-time event such as participating in a protest. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option B: Pus limpador de esgotos nela.
Explanation: The premise states that the drain was clogged, so option B, ""pus limpador de esgotos nela,"" is more likely to be effective in unclogging it. Option A, ""Eu liguei a torneira,"" would not have any effect on a clogged drain."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the train arrived at the station) is more likely than option B (the train whistled). Therefore, the answer is (A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man pressed the damp cloth of the envelope rather than putting a stamp on it or closing it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They lost touch with each other) is more likely. The passage states that ""the friends had grown apart"" and ""lost touch,"" indicating a gradual decline in their relationship rather than a sudden move to different cities. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of why they are no longer close."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Ela foi demitida de seu cargo) is the correct answer. The premise states that the countess mismanaged company funds, which could lead to her termination from her position as CEO or manager of the company.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ouvi o relógio a bater) is the more likely cause. The premise states that Olhei para o relógio, indicating that the person looked at the clock, but it does not mention anything about hearing the clock ticking. Therefore, it is more likely that the person simply looked at the clock without paying attention to its sound.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A minha mulher e eu agarrámo-nos pela mão) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation described in the premise. The fact that the speaker's hand has become swollen suggests that they may have injured themselves while holding onto something or someone, such as their partner. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's hand became swollen than option A (Escrevi o ensaio à mão), which does not make sense in this context.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O parafuso apertou,"" option A is the most likely answer. The word ""apertou"" suggests that something opened or loosened, which aligns with option A's explanation of swapping the screwdriver. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of turning a key."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the couple moved into the apartment) is true. The mention of a contract being signed suggests that the couple made arrangements to rent the apartment, which implies that they actually moved in. There is no indication in the premise that the city condemned the apartment, so this option is less likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ela pensou que viu um relâmpago) is more likely. The fact that she thought she saw a lightning suggests that her attention was drawn by something sudden and bright, rather than a gradual event like the setting sun.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the water was calm) is more likely. The man wore a life jacket in the water, indicating that he knew how to swim or at least had some level of proficiency in the water. Therefore, it is unlikely that he did not know how to swim (option A).
"Response: 
Option B: She pressed the backspace key."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Ela teve uma má nota) is the correct answer. The premise states that the girl got a bad grade, indicating that her performance was poor or below expectations. This suggests that she did not win any competition or achieve anything positive, making option A the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O gramado está enlameado,"" it is more likely that Option A (Choveu durante a noite) caused the grass to be wet. The premise does not provide any information about the presence of weeds or other factors that could make the grass wet. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option B (she forgot to adjust her alarm clock) is the correct answer. The premise states that she fell asleep, implying that she was in her own bed or home, rather than being away from home like in option A. Additionally, forgetting to adjust an alarm clock is a common mistake that many people make, making it a more plausible explanation for why she didn't wake up on time.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O homem colocou protetor solar,"" it is more likely that he went to the beach (option B). This is because putting on sunscreen suggests protecting oneself from the sun's harmful rays, which is something one might do at the beach rather than in the shade."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Os pesquisadores retractaram a teoria) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the game went into overtime) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the fechadura abriu-se) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (O pai agarrou a mão do filho) occurred. The premise states that ""a multidão intensificou-se,"" indicating that there were many people present in the scene, making it difficult for Option A (O pai deu ao filho algum dinheiro) to occur without drawing attention."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eu limine a neve do caminho) is more likely to melt the snow blocking the entrance.
"Response:  Option B - The caiaque bateu numa onda.  
Explanation: According to the premise ""Os caiaqueiros remaram seus remos,"" it is more likely that the caiaque hit a wave than reached the shore. Remaining in their oars suggests that they are still rowing or paddling, rather than having arrived at land."
Response:  Option B: She crashed into something.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Senti o ar fresco passar por cima de mim) is more likely to occur. The premise mentions feeling a cool breeze passing over one's skin, which is consistent with the sensation of wind blowing on the body. Option A (Água salpicada na minha pele), on the other hand, does not involve a physical sensation that would be directly related to the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they were enchanted (Option A). The phrase ""os surfistas voltaram para a praia"" suggests that they returned to the beach after their previous visit, implying that they had left and then came back. There is no mention of any encounter with a shark or being enchanted in the premise, so Option B is less likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the water drained from the bathtub) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele confessou a infidelidade dele a ela) is more likely. The husband felt guilty for cheating on his wife, so he would be more likely to admit it to her rather than accusing her of being unfaithful.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (derramar água no cartaz) is more likely to be the cause of the stain.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option B (he woke up) is the correct answer. The child waking up in the middle of the night would be a more plausible reason for them to start crying than having a bad dream or sleepwalking.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (O pai dele deu-lhe uma lição) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Eu acenei os braços. 
Explanation: The premise states that my friend turned his head in my direction, implying that he was facing me when I made the gesture. Aceneo (waving) is an action that involves moving one's arms up and down, so it is more likely that this is what happened in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the citizens made a revolution) will occur as a result of government oppression. This is because a revolution typically involves mass protests, demonstrations, and other forms of collective action by citizens to challenge or overthrow an oppressive government. In contrast, voting is a relatively peaceful and legal means of expressing political opinions and influencing government policy, but it may not necessarily lead to significant changes in government behavior or policies.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he cried for help (Option B). The boy was lost in the forest, which means he would not have a tent to set up. Additionally, crying for help is a natural response when someone is lost or in danger, whereas setting up a tent may be less practical or necessary in this situation.
"Response: 
Option B: She wanted to learn about other cultures."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (O colega dele foi promovido) is more likely as a reason for the man's jealousy than Option B (O colega dele trabalhou até tarde). The premise suggests that the man is feeling insecure because his colleague has been promoted, which implies that he feels threatened by their success. Working late may be a factor in why the man is feeling this way, but it is not the primary cause. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Ele estava a alucinar) is the correct answer. The man's claim of witnessing alien beings suggests that he may have been experiencing some kind of hallucination or delusion rather than actually encountering extraterrestrial life.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O cabelo do homem ficou loiro,"" it is more likely that he used a shampoo (option B) rather than lixívia (option A)."
"Response: 
Option B: She felt a surge of creativity."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O filho se mudou de casa,"" it is more likely that option A (he was dispensed from the army) is the correct answer. The reason being that moving out of one's childhood home is not typically a decision made by someone who is going to college."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the prateleiras were covered in dust) is more likely. The premise mentions that ""os livros caíram da estante,"" indicating that something caused them to fall from their shelves, but it doesn't provide any information about an external event like a earthquake or tremor causing the books to fall. It's more plausible that the books simply became dislodged due to dust accumulation on the shelves."
"Response: 
Option B: Eu reiniciei o disjuntor.
Explanation: The premise states that the power in your house went out, indicating a larger issue such as a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker. Reinicing the disjuncto would not have fixed this issue, but it's possible that it could be related to the problem. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (it seemed scary) is the correct answer. The phrase ""parecia assustador"" suggests that the speaker found the experience to be frightening or unsettling, rather than enjoyable or exciting. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Eu despejei manteiga no saco) caused the bag of popcorn to start bursting. Manteiga (butter) can make the kernels inside the bag of popcorn stick together and expand rapidly, leading to a burst bag. Microwaves do not have enough power to cause this effect. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the previsão prevê ventos fortes) is more likely to occur as a result of the tree falling onto the power line. Strong winds could cause the power line to break or be disrupted, leading to a loss of electricity in the neighborhood.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He offended the audience) is more likely. The speaker's political incorrectness may have caused offense to some members of the audience, rather than inducing boredom or disgust.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (A gouta of blood formed on my finger) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the emotional tone of the sentence. The speaker seems to be experiencing some discomfort or pain, which could lead to a small cut or injury. Option A (A little sweat dripped from my face) does not convey the same level of intensity or cause for concern as option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O peixe flutuava na superfície do tanque,"" it is more likely that the fish was dead (Option B). Fluttering on the surface of a tank suggests that the fish has died and is floating to the top rather than swimming or feeding."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Ele estava constipado) is the correct answer. The voice of the man sounded rough because he was constipated, not because he had stopped smoking.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""As portas do elevador abriram-se,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the elevator has reached its designated floor. Therefore, the answer is (A) The elevator arrived at the designated floor."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ele mentiu aos pais) is more likely. The fact that the teenager ran away suggests that there may be a conflict or issue at home that led to their decision to leave. It's possible that they may have felt unsafe or unhappy with the situation at home, leading them to seek freedom or escape. On the other hand, if the parents had put him/her in castigation, it would not have been enough reason for the teenager to run away from home.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the sewage tank overflowed) is a more likely cause of the flooded bathroom than option B (the water heater broke). The mention of ""inundou"" (flooded) suggests that there was a significant amount of liquid present, which is consistent with an overflowing sewage tank rather than a broken water heater. Therefore, option A is the better answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (the owner put a leash on the dog) occurred. The premise states that the dog was near its owner, indicating that they were together and not separated by distance. Therefore, it is unlikely that the owner would have left the dog unattended with a leash on, as this could potentially harm the dog or cause it to run away. Instead, it is more likely that the owner kept the dog close by their side while they were near each other.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O homem apanhou o seu reflexo,"" it is more likely that he stood under the extensive tree (Option A). The wording of the premise suggests that the man caught his reflection in a body of water or surface, such as a lake or pond, rather than standing directly beneath an extended tree branch. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Conheci-a para jantar.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it's more likely that the speaker will try to get in touch with their ex by inviting them out for dinner rather than calling them back directly. This suggests that the speaker may be trying to handle the situation in a more casual or indirect manner, rather than being direct and confrontational."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that their dog ran away from home (Option A) than that valuable jewelry went missing from their house (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vi a minha respiração cuando exalava,"" option B is the most likely cause. The phrase ""exalava"" means to breathe out, so the speaker was probably experiencing shortness of breath or difficulty breathing when they inhaled. This could be caused by various factors such as anxiety, stress, or respiratory problems like asthma. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Queriam melhores condições de trabalho) is more likely as it suggests that the employees formed a union to demand better working conditions rather than the employer voluntarily increasing their wages.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (a smell of putrefaction filled the kitchen) occurred. The phrase ""um cheiro de podridão"" specifically conveys an unpleasant odor associated with rotting or decaying matter, which would be expected if the tart had gone bad."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ela usava saltos altos) is a more likely cause for her struggle to walk because it suggests that she may have been using high heels, which can make walking difficult and unstable. Option B (Ela tirou os sapatos) does not provide any insight into why she might be struggling to walk.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O vapor subiu do pote de água,"" it is more likely that option A, ""A água ferveu,"" occurred. This is because as water heats up, steam rises from the surface of the water, causing the water to boil. Therefore, option A is the most logical explanation for what happened based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eu usava botas) is more likely because it provides a contrast to the idea of being in the laundry room with sandals. The image of wearing boots in a laundry room is less common than wearing sandals, making option B more unexpected and therefore more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Ele perdeu o apoio dos eleitores) is the correct answer. The premise states that the politician's argument was considered absurd, which could indicate that he or she lost support from voters who no longer found his or her arguments convincing.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the couple became pregnant) is the correct answer. The fact that everyone disapproved of their marriage suggests that they may have faced societal pressure or opposition to their relationship, but this does not necessarily mean that they fled. Pregnancy would be a common solution for couples who wish to start a family despite societal objections.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (O milionário queria que o prédio fosse demolido) is more likely. The fact that the building was dedicated to a millionaire suggests that he had some sort of connection or interest in it, and it's unlikely that he would want to see it destroyed. Option B (O milionário contribuiu com os fundos para construí-lo) does not align with this interpretation as it implies that the millionaire contributed to its construction, rather than wanting to see it torn down.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (O vendedor viu a rapariga a pôr mercadoria na mala) is more likely. The fact that the vendor accused the girl of stealing suggests that he saw her putting something in her bag, which could be interpreted as an attempt to steal.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: The soldiers were sent to fight in the war.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A motim começou em frente ao tribunal) is more likely. The mention of ""um motim"" suggests that there was some kind of disruption or protest in front of the courthouse, which could have caused the decision to be confirmed despite the controversy surrounding it. Option B does not provide any context that would suggest why the decision was confirmed, and does not align with the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ela deixou os biscoitos no forno) is more likely. The fact that she could smell something burning suggests that there was an uncontrolled fire somewhere in her vicinity, such as inside the oven where she left the cookies to bake. Option A (ela tirou os biscoitos do frasco) does not provide any information about why she would be able to smell something burning.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Estava chovendo a pique,"" option A (A tempestade piorou) is the most likely answer. The use of the word ""chovendo"" suggests that it was raining heavily, which would make it less likely for someone to run inside. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B: The alarm system triggered due to a potential fire hazard in the building. This is because an evacuation of the building would typically be carried out as a precautionary measure when there is a possibility of danger or risk present, such as a fire. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the building was evacuated.
"Response: 
Option B: O pai expulsou o filho de casa.
Explanation: The premise states that the father felt resentful towards his son's alcoholism. As a result, he may have taken drastic measures such as expelling him from the house rather than buying him a beer. This option is more likely to occur given the context of the situation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the elevator was out of order) is more likely. The fact that the lawyer had to climb the stairs suggests that there was an issue with the elevator, making it unavailable for use.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Seu amigo o interrompeu) is more likely as it provides a reason for the man's irritation that is consistent with the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The caixa esqueceu-se of giving a receipt to the girl, so it's unlikely that the caixa would give her the change.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ela ficou paralisada num acidente) is more likely. The premise mentions that she was ""colocada"" in a wheelchair, implying that she became unable to walk due to an accident or injury. Option B (Ela entrou no hospital numa maca) does not provide any information about how she ended up in the hospital, and it is unlikely that she would be admitted to the hospital without any explanation for her condition."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (the country faced economic difficulties) is the correct answer. The mention of citizens hanging their national flag outside their homes suggests a sense of patriotism and pride in one's country, but does not necessarily indicate any particular reason for celebration or commemoration. Economic difficulties are a common challenge facing many countries around the world, and could be a plausible explanation for why citizens might be displaying their flags in this manner.
"Response: 
Option B: Eles inspiraram os fãs.  
Explanation: The premise states that the team lost the tournament, but option B suggests that they inspired their fans instead of disappointing them. This implies that despite their loss, the team's performance or attitude may have had a positive impact on those around them."
"Response:  Option B: Senti-me orgulhoso.
Explanation: The premise ""O meu amigo disse-me que havia comida presa nos dentes"" implies that someone else noticed food stuck in their teeth, not the speaker themselves. Therefore, option B, ""Senti-me orgulhoso,"" is a more likely response as it suggests feeling proud or pleased about something rather than embarrassed."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele esqueceu-se de estudar) is more likely. The boy did not pass the history exam because he forgot to study, rather than paying attention in class.
"Response: 
Option A: Um terremoto atingiu a cidade.  
Rationale: The premise states that ""the building in the city center collapsed,"" indicating that there was significant damage to the structure. Terremotos are known for causing widespread destruction and collapse of buildings, making Option A the most likely cause. In contrast, Option B does not provide any specific information about the cause of the collapse, only mentioning an increase in crime rate, which is unlikely to result in the collapse of a building."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She presented him to her parents) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: As cabeças delas colidiram.  
Explanation: The premise states that both children simultaneously reached for the ball, indicating that their heads collided as they tried to grab it at the same time. This is more likely than the ball rolling itself, as there is no context provided in the premise for the ball to roll. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Havia cartão no caixote do lixo) is more likely. The fact that there was a card in the trash can suggests that someone intentionally put it there, rather than just accidentally leaving it out of the container. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O menino afiou o lápis,"" it is more likely that he was bored (Option B) than that he found it cheap (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The vestido não me caía) is more likely to be the cause of her losing the receipt.
"Response: 
A) Curou-se rapidamente."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he was looking strangely at something (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (As formigas rastejaram até às migalhas) occurred because the child left crumbs on the floor. Formigas are attracted to food sources, especially sweet or sticky ones like breadcrumbs, and will move towards them in search of a meal. Therefore, it is more plausible that the formigas moved towards the crumbs rather than the child storing them away.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A irmã da mulher começou a chorar) is more likely. The reason for this is that the premise states that the woman gave her sister a handkerchief, which suggests that something emotional or sad happened to prompt this action. It's unlikely that the sister would cross her arms in response to receiving a gift, especially one with sentimental value like a handkerchief. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Os lábios dele estavam rachados) is a more plausible explanation for why the man was smiling than option B (Ele estava preocupado com o mau hálito). The premise does not provide any information to suggest that the man had bad breath, but it does mention his lips being cracked, which could be causing him discomfort or pain and lead to a smile as a form of coping mechanism. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They have indications for the theatre) is more likely. The sentence ""O casal saiu mais cedo para o show"" suggests that they are going to a performance at the theatre, and therefore it is more likely that they have tickets or reservations for the show rather than anticipating traffic around the theatre."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (O colega de trabalho dela cobriu-a) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he supported their cause (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he had stage fright (Option A). The phrase ""O coração do ator estava a bater antes da sua actuação"" suggests that he was experiencing anxiety or fear related to performing in front of an audience, which is a common symptom of stage fright. Memorizing lines ( Option B) would not necessarily cause this physical response."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eu desdobei um mapa) is more likely. The fact that the speaker was lost suggests that they may have needed to consult a map in order to find their way back.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Os frutos maduros ficaram no sol,"" it is more likely that they were consumed by an animal or a person rather than enrolling themselves. Therefore, option A (Foi comido) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I turned on the ignition) is the more likely cause of the car's sudden acceleration. The premise states that ""the car roared to life,"" indicating that the engine was already running when the driver tried to accelerate. This suggests that the driver may have accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of the brake, causing the car to speed up unexpectedly. In contrast, option B (the motor supercharged) does not fit with the given information as it implies that the engine suddenly gained power without any external input. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given details."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele ficou na cama por vários dias) is more likely. The man was so amazed by his own back that he stayed in bed for several days, indicating a strong psychological impact rather than seeking professional help from a psychiatrist.
"Response: 
Option B: Estava frio na casa.
Explanation: The premise states that ""Eu acendi um incêndio na lareira,"" indicating that a fire was started in the hearth. However, the consequence stated in option B, ""Estava frio na casa,"" suggests that the reason for starting the fire may have been to warm up the house, rather than being out of wood. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (ela tem uma cólica no lado) is more likely. The premise mentions that the woman stopped running, implying that she may have experienced some discomfort or pain while running, which could be caused by a side stitch or cramp. Option B (she had a second wind) does not align with the information provided in the premise and seems less plausible.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu bati na porta do meu vizinho,"" it is more likely that option B, ""A minha vizinha saiu de casa,"" is true. This is because if my neighbor did not answer the door when I knocked, it suggests that they are not at home."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (O marido não compreendiu as preocupações dela) is more likely. The woman sighed in frustration, indicating that her husband did not understand her concerns, rather than him giving her a goodbye kiss.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (O estudante respondeu corretamente à pergunta) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she went to the fifth (Option A).
"Response: 
Option B: Dei-lhe um abraço.
Explanation: The premise ""Encontrei um velho amigo"" suggests a reunion or encounter with an old friend. Option B, ""Dei-lhe um abraço,"" is therefore more likely as it aligns better with the context of meeting an old friend after a long time. Option A, ""Eu revelei-lhe um segredo,"" does not fit as well in this scenario as there is no indication that the speaker revealed a secret to their friend."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (parecia contaminado) is more likely. The woman avoided going to the lake because she thought it was contaminated, not because she wanted to catch a fish.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the umbrella was broken) is more likely. The fact that the student arrived at school soaked suggests that their umbrella may have failed them during the rain, rather than someone stealing their bike.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the user moved the mouse) is a more likely cause for the cursor to move on the screen than option A (the user clicked the mouse). Therefore, the answer is (B).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O condutor fez um desvio,"" it is more likely that Option A (an accident occurred on the main road) happened. The driver made a turn, which suggests they were not paying attention to their surroundings or driving safely, increasing the likelihood of an accident occurring."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the towel dried (Option A).
"Response:  Option B: She called a taxi.
Explanation: The premise states that ""a woman put on her sunglasses,"" indicating that she was outside in bright sunlight. It's unlikely that she would need to call a taxi for transportation while wearing sunglasses outdoors. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O homem olhou para o céu noturno,"" it is more likely that he found it beautiful (option B). The phrase ""olhou para"" suggests a sense of admiration or appreciation, rather than desire for something else. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu me senti exausto"", option B (Figuei acordado a noite toda) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ele estava a deixar o cabelo crescer) is more likely. The man went to the barber, indicating that he wanted his hair cut or trimmed, rather than letting it grow longer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The boy did not give his new classmate a warm welcome, indicating that he may not have liked him.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Eu estava a comer bolachas) is the correct answer because if you wanted a cup of milk, it would be illogical to eat bread.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Começou a chover,"" it is more likely that option B (the driver gave reverse) occurred because if it started raining, the driver would have wanted to back up before continuing driving. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Estacionei perto da entrada) is more likely. The fact that the parking lot was empty suggests that there were no other cars parked nearby, making it less likely for you to have parked your car across the street or near the entrance of the building. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (she had a writer's block) is the correct answer. The author did not deliver the rough draft on time, indicating that she may have encountered difficulties in writing or experiencing a creative blockage. This is supported by the fact that many writers experience writer's block at some point in their careers, making it a common occurrence. In contrast, editing the rough draft would require significant time and effort, which may not be feasible within the given deadline. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the author failed to deliver the rough draft on time.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (“Pedi para falar com um supervisor”) is more likely to be the correct cause. The premise states that the associate disconnected the call, implying that there was a problem or issue with the call that needed to be escalated to a higher level of support. Asking to speak with a supervisor would be the most appropriate course of action in this situation.
"Response:  Option B: As cortinas estremeceram.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""O vento soprou pela janela aberta."" This implies that there was an open window through which the wind could blow. Since the wind is already blowing through the window, it is less likely that it would also toc... (View More) touch the doorbell or cause the curtains to move. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. (Hide)"
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (I flipped a circuit breaker) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""my house's power went out,"" indicating that there was an issue with the electrical system rather than simply turning off a light bulb. Flipping a circuit breaker is a common way for an electrical issue to cause a power outage in a home."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O levantador de pesos grunhiu,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""grunhiu"" suggests that the person is making a loud noise while lifting weights, which is consistent with Option B (he lifted the barbell above his head). Option A (""Ele flexionou os músculos no espelho"") does not make sense in this context as there is no mirror present to reflect the muscles."
"Response: 
Option B: He got confused."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (the father changed the diaper of the baby) than option B (the father rocked the baby gently). The premise mentions that the baby fell asleep, implying that the baby was in a comfortable state beforehand, which suggests that the father may have changed the diaper to make the baby feel clean and comfortable.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The boy got wet from the water balloon being thrown to him.
"Response: 
Option B: Todas as pessoas nas fotos recusaram-se a sorrir."
"Response: 
Option B: Estava fora da cidade.
Explanation: The sentence ""Eu recusei o convite para a festa de aniversário"" implies that the speaker was invited to the party but declined. Since the speaker is not present at the party, it is more likely that they were outside of the city rather than alone. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu fiz exercício,"" it is more likely that option A (Senti-me energizado) is the correct answer. This is because exercising can increase a person's energy levels and improve their mood, leading to feelings of being energized or motivated. On the other hand, feeling anxious or scared after exercise is less common and may be related to other factors such as anxiety disorders or past traumatic experiences. Therefore, option A is the most plausible response based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu espremido a esponja úmida,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Ele absorveu água."" The word ""espremido"" means ""squeezed"" in Portuguese, indicating pressure or compression was applied to the sponge, leading to the absorption of water. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The resort was located in an island) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: She wanted to rebel against her parents' strict rules."
"Response: 
Option B: Eu chamei a polícia.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person will call the police rather than feeling desconfiado (desconfidence). The reason for this is that the presence of an unknown car parked outside one's home can be perceived as suspicious or threatening, leading to a desire to seek help from authorities."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The criminal surrendered) is more likely. The fact that he surrendered suggests that he had knowledge of his involvement in a crime and wanted to take responsibility for it, which aligns with the idea that there were sufficient proofs against him. Option B (There weren't any proofs against him) doesn't fit well with this scenario as there would be no reason for the criminal to surrender if he knew he was innocent.
"Response: 
Option B: He stopped drinking coffee."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A rapirga psoou no gelo,"" option B is more likely. The word ""tremeu"" means to tremble or shake, which is a common reaction when someone steps on ice. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She put the child to bed) is more likely. The fact that she had rings under her eyes suggests that she may have been up late or tired, but it does not necessarily imply that she stayed awake all night. Putting the child to bed would be a more plausible explanation for why she was tired.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the volcano entered into eruption) is a more likely cause for the lava to be flowing from the volcano than option B (the volcano was in a state of inaction). This is because an eruption is a natural event that occurs when magma from beneath the Earth's surface is released through a vent or fissure in the volcano's crater. It is not possible for a volcano to enter into eruption without first being in a state of unrest or activity. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ela queria sair da festa) is more likely as it provides an explanation for why she took off her shoes without knowing everyone at the party.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The speaker paid for the attendant to let them through the toll booth, so it's unlikely that they were held up in the cabin. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ele vendeu as ações da empresa) is more likely to be the cause of his failure.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the doctor was on leave) is more likely than option B (the man felt sick).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the house was on fire) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for why someone would have left their room through the window. Option B (the house was empty) does not provide any logical reason for this action.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he spumed his hands with soap) is a more likely explanation for why the boy's fingers turned white. Soap can strip the skin of its natural oils and cause it to become dry and discolored, leading to a whitening effect. Taking a long bath may also help to soften and relax the muscles in the hand, but it would not have the same effect on the color of the skin. Therefore, option B is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu cuspo o leite,"" it is more likely that option A (the milk had an acidic taste) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Perdi o autocarro,"" it is more likely that option A (Cheguei cedo ao trabalho) is correct. This is because losing a car suggests that something unexpected happened, such as forgetting where you parked it or having someone steal it, rather than simply being early to work."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O caminhão colidiu com o carro,"" it is more likely that the car was esmagado (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They won) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Eu virei a garrafa) caused the assobição. Turning the bottle could potentially dislodge any particles or debris inside the bottle, leading to the hissing sound described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele subiu ao telhado) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the woman peeked through the hole in the door) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O homem manchado o fato,"" option A (Ele levou-a para a lavandaria) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""manchado"" suggests that something stained or dirty happened to the man's clothing, so it makes sense that he would take it to be cleaned rather than hanging it in an armoire where it could potentially get worse."
"Response:  Option B - The girl spit out the toothpaste.
Explanation: According to the premise, ""A menina espremeu o tubo de pasta de dente,"" which means that the girl squeezed the toothpaste tube. Therefore, it is more likely that she spat out the toothpaste rather than it coming out of the tube."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the pacifists held a parade) is more likely to be effective in changing public opinion about the war. The premise states that ""as civilian deaths increased,"" indicating that the situation was becoming increasingly dire for innocent people caught in the conflict. Holding a parade would serve as a visual reminder of the human cost of the war and could potentially generate greater empathy among bystanders than simply holding a protest."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the fita parecia infantil) is more likely. The girl pulled her hair tie, indicating that she was trying to remove it from her hair, but since the tie looked childish, it suggests that she may have been attempting to undo a child's hairstyle rather than an adult one.
"Response: 
Option B: He looked younger."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Um frango saiu do ovo,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O ovo chocou,"" occurred. The reason being that a chicken hatching from an egg is biologically impossible, as chickens develop inside their mother's womb before hatching outside of her body. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why a chicken came out of an egg."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he died of starvation than escaped. Therefore, option A (he died) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he lost his balance while going down the stairs (Option B). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A criança arrotou,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ele tomou um gole de refrigerante,"" is the correct answer. The word ""arrotou"" in Portuguese means to drink or swallow something quickly, so it is unlikely that the child opened a can of soda without first taking a drink from it."
"Response: 
Option B: Eu tremi.
Explanation: The premise states that a cold air flow entered through the window, indicating that the protagonist felt cold. Option B, ""Eu tremi,"" means ""I shivered,"" which is a common response to feeling cold. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Seus colegas de classe a respeitavam) is more likely to be the cause of her receiving a scholarship. Having respect from one's peers can demonstrate good character and social skills, which are often valued in academic settings. It is less likely that having good grades would lead to receiving a scholarship without any other factors being considered, such as financial need or academic achievement. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She lived next to him) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for how she became infected by his virus without any romantic involvement or personal connection with him.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele não tinham dinheiro) is more likely as it suggests that the thief did not have money to buy food, leading them to steal it instead.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Queria privacidade) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Eu apertei-lhe a mão) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the fireworks were launched into the air) is more likely than option B (the frisbee flew towards my head).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A menina mordeu as unhas,"" option B (Ela ficou surpresa) is a more plausible cause than option A (Ela estava preocupada). This is because the phrase ""mordeu as unhas"" suggests that the girl acted impulsively or violently, rather than out of concern or worry. Therefore, it is more likely that she was surprised by her own actions than that she was feeling worried or concerned."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (It was the beginning of a new month) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there would be a change in the calendar page. Marking a query in the calendar is not a common occurrence that would result in a change in the entire calendar page. Therefore, option B is the better answer.
"Response: 
Option B: He asked for a divorce.
Explanation: The husband discovered that his wife was having an affair, which means their marriage has been broken beyond repair. In this situation, it's more likely that he would ask for a divorce rather than dismissing his lawyer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the bola saltou (jumped) than brilhou (shone). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: A bola saltou.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she guessed the answer (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the opponent fell to the ground) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu apanhei os tomates da videira,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Estavam maduras,"" is the correct answer. The phrase ""apanhei"" means ""I picked,"" indicating that the tomatoes were already ripe or mature when they were harvested. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker picked the tomatoes from the vine."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ele encontrou a ex-namorada para almoçar) is more likely. The man wants to be romantic, but he finds his ex-girlfriend instead of someone new. This suggests that he may not have moved on from their relationship yet, which undermines his attempt at being romantic.
"Response:  Option B: O tempo ficou mais quente.
Explanation: The premise states that ""O mercúrio no termómetro subiu."" This means that the mercury in the thermometer has risen, indicating a higher temperature. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it suggests that the temperature has become hotter, which aligns with the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option B: The road became dangerously icy."
"Response: 
Option A: As notas dele melhoraram. "
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I knelt down) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu poli a pedra,"" it is more likely that the person became scurrying (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option B (the coffee was sweet) occurred. The addition of sugar to coffee typically makes it sweeter, rather than stronger in flavor. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome given the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Option B - He tore the papers.
Explanation: The premise states that ""the man turned over the newspapers,"" implying that he physically manipulated them in some way. Tearing suggests a more violent action than simply folding or bending, making option B the more likely choice."
Response:  Option A - The nail sank into the wood.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O peixe mordeu a linha,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O pescador amarrou o peixe,"" occurred. This is because the phrase ""mordeu a linha"" suggests that the fish bit the line, indicating that it was caught by the angler."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ela tem uma espinha) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for the boy's embarrassment. Option B (Ela tirou o aparelho) does not provide any logical explanation for the boy's embarrassment.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A minha expressão facial iluminou-se,"" it is more likely that Option A (recebi boas notícios) is correct. The phrase ""iluminou-se"" suggests a positive emotion, such as happiness or excitement, rather than a negative one like frustration or irritation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu limpei as mãos com uma toalha,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Tinha as mãos molhadas,"" is the correct answer. This is because if you had clean hands when you used the towel, there would be no need to use a towel to clean your hands in the first place. Therefore, it is more plausible that you had dirty or wet hands before using the towel."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (O banco balançava debaixo dele) is the more likely cause of the man losing his balance. The premise suggests that the bank was swaying beneath him, causing him to lose his equilibrium. This is a plausible explanation for why he lost his balance, as the movement of the bank could disrupt his sense of balance. Option B (Ele derramou tinta no banquinho), on the other hand, does not provide a logical explanation for why the man lost his balance.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they blamed each other for losing the game. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pedi perdão,"" it is more likely that option A (Eu me arrependi do meu erro) is the correct answer. The phrase ""pedi perdão"" means ""I apologized for my mistake,"" so it makes sense that the person would regret their error rather than having achieved their goal."
"Response: 
Option B: He spoke incessantly about himself."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (As covinhas dela apareceram) is a more plausible explanation for why the girl smiled. The phrase ""as covinhas dela apareceram"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising happened to cause the girl's smile, rather than her cheeks turning red due to embarrassment. Therefore, option B is the better answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Passou sobre a mina) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O homem furou o pé,"" it is more likely that he stepped on broken glass (Option B). The word ""furou"" in Portuguese means ""he stomped"" or ""he kicked,"" indicating that the man used his foot to strike something. Given the context of a broken glass on the ground, it is more plausible that he accidentally stepped on it with his foot than that he entered a pool (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they found the identity of the killer (Option A). The fact that they were able to find digital impressions at the scene suggests that there may be evidence related to the perpetrator's identity, such as fingerprints or footwear impressions. This could potentially lead to the identification of the killer through forensic analysis. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Pedi uma boleia) is more likely. The premise states that there was a lot of traffic on the road, making it difficult to drive through. Asking for a ride would be a more practical solution in this situation than taking a detour.
Response:  Option B: Many people faced unemployment.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The passage states that the children were about to enter traffic coming from the front, indicating that they were approaching a busy street or intersection. This suggests that they were in a public place, rather than in their own neighborhood. Therefore, Option A is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: He made a sarcastic comment."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O carro ficou sem gasolina,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""O condutor ficou preso na estrada,"" will occur. This is because running out of gasoline can cause a driver to become stranded on the side of the road, making them unable to move their vehicle or continue their journey."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: The baby was born.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O chapéu do homem foi levado pelo vento,"" it is more likely that option A (Ele tirou o chapéu) is correct. The sentence suggests that the man's hat was blown away by the wind, rather than simply being a windy day outside. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for what happened to the man's hat."
"Response: 
Option B: She bought a present.
Explanation: The premise states that she went to a party for a classmate's birthday, indicating that she was invited to attend. It does not mention anything about her receiving a invitation or buying a gift, both of which are possibilities but not explicitly stated in the premise. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (the mother measured his temperature) is correct. The premise states that the boy's forehead was hot, indicating that he might have had a fever. Measuring his temperature would be a logical response to this situation. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the mother took him to the park.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ele queria impressionar o seu encontro) is more likely as it suggests that the man intentionally harmed himself to make a good impression. Option B (Ele pôs gel no cabelo) does not provide any explanation for why the man would harm himself with water from a cologne bottle.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Peguei numa pá) is more likely. The character in this scenario is more likely to grab a nearby object like a broom or mop handle than to search for a lantern.
"Response: 
Option B: A mãe deu à luz gêmeos."
"Response:  Option B: She saw the finish line. 
Explanation: The premise states that the runner maintained a slow pace, indicating that she was conserving energy for the end of the race. Seeing the finish line would be a strong motivator to pick up speed and push through the remaining distance, making option B the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the machine spit out change) is more likely. The premise states that the boy gave a kick to the vending machine, which could potentially cause it to dispense money or products. It does not mention anything about the bag of French fries being stuck, which makes option B less likely. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option B (Dei-lhe um abraço) was the correct response. The death of a friend's dog would typically elicit a gesture of condolence or support, such as an embrace, rather than rolling one's eyes.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he wrote a check (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ele cortou as unhas) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the man was cursed, which could potentially result in supernatural consequences such as cutting off his own nails. Option B (Ele esmagou o dedo do pé) does not fit with this supernatural context and seems less plausible given the information provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the brother of the man had a discussion with their parents) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the man would feel proud of his brother. In contrast, option B (the brother was accepted into law school) does not directly relate to the man's pride in his brother. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response: 
Option B: She looked at the stars.
Explanation: The premise states that she wanted to learn about the solar system, but looking at the stars would not provide her with information about the solar system. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option B occurred - ""Eu coloquei fita adesiva na parte de trás do pôster."" The fact that the poster got stuck to the wall suggests that there was some kind of adhesive used to attach it, rather than simply being placed above a doorway."
"Response: 
Option B: The architect adjusted the plans."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A mão dele tremia) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides an explanation for why the man dropped his spoon that is consistent with the information provided in the premise. Option B (Ele lambia a colher) does not provide any logical explanation for why the man dropped his spoon.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the council of administration dissolved the company) is more likely to occur. The reason for this is that the CEO's resignation does not necessarily imply that there will be a change in leadership or management structure within the organization. It could simply mean that the CEO has decided to leave their position for personal reasons or other opportunities without affecting the overall operations of the business. In contrast, if the council of administration dissolves the company, it would suggest that they have taken a more drastic measure to address issues with the company's performance or governance structure.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Aproximei-me do pódio) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the family paid the bail) than option B (he attacked a fellow prisoner). Therefore, the answer is Option A.

Response:  Option A - The lata was recycled.
"Response: 
Option B: Aprendeu a comunicar. 
Explanation: The premise states that the girl joined the debating team, indicating that she learned to communicate effectively through public speaking and argumentation. This skill is more relevant to the task of debating than learning how to use a computer, which would not have a direct impact on her ability to participate in the team. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option B: Eu lavei os pratos.
Explanation: According to the premise ""Meu humor melhorou,"" it's more likely that the speaker did something that made them happy or relaxed, such as washing dishes, rather than listening to music. Washing dishes can be a calming and meditative task, and it's possible that doing so improved the speaker's mood."
"Response: 
Option B: Fizeram um leilão. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the institution held a charity auction to raise money rather than feeding the homeless directly."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the passengers will scream (Option B).
"Response: 
Option B: Eu fechei a porta ao sair de casa.
Explanation: The premise ""Eu estava furioso"" suggests that something unexpected or unpleasant happened to the speaker. Checking the mailbox (Option A) would not be an unusual response to feeling angry, but closing the door behind oneself when leaving the house (Option B) might be a more common reaction in this situation. Therefore, Option B is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele acordou cedo) is more likely. The man woke up early to see the sunrise, indicating that he was in his bed at home or somewhere else close by, rather than traveling to the north.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu dobrei o papel,"" it is more likely that Option A (I recycled the paper) is correct."
"Response: 
Option B: Líderes de otros países enviaram ajuda de emergência. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that leaders of other countries will send aid to help their affected nation rather than forming an alliance with them. This is because sending aid is a tangible way for other nations to demonstrate support and solidarity in times of crisis, without necessarily committing to a long-term political partnership."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""As roupas do rapaz ficaram molhadas,"" it is more likely that he got wet in the pool (Option B). The phrase ""ficaram molhadas"" implies that his clothes are now wet, indicating that he was submerged in water. Option A does not provide a clear explanation for why his clothes would become wet."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""O criminoso foi executado,"" it is more likely that he was executed rather than being imprisoned or convicted of murder. Therefore, option A (Ele foi preso) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A luz do sol entrou na sala,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Abri as cortinas,"" caused the light to enter the room. This is because opening the curtains would allow natural light from outside to enter the room, whereas opening the door might not necessarily result in light entering the room. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the wig came off) will occur. The phrase ""Arranquei o cabelo do impostor"" implies that someone pulled or yanked the hair of the imposter, which could potentially cause the wig to come loose or fall off. It is less likely that the person would become careless (option B), as this outcome does not align with the given context."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he considered the sentence unclear) is more likely. The editor's decision to revise the sentence suggests that they found it difficult to understand or confusing, rather than convinced by its clarity.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ela percebeu que o cartão estava desaparecido) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman's credit card was canceled without her knowledge or consent.
"Response: 
Option B: They got married."
"Response: 
Option B: Eu compus a minha própria canção."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the girl pulled his hair) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pulverizei-me with repellent of insects) is a more plausible explanation for why the insect was crushed. The use of repellents to deter or kill insects is a common practice in many settings, including agriculture, gardening, and home pest control. Therefore, it is more likely that the insect was accidentally pulverized by someone using an insecticide or other repellent than that it was intentionally stepped on by a person.
"Response:  Option A - Acordei (I woke up).
Explanation: The premise ""Eu abri os olhos"" means ""I opened my eyes,"" indicating that the speaker was awake or alert. Therefore, option A, ""Acordei"" (I woke up), is the most likely cause for why the speaker opened their eyes."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Pedi-lhe que me emprestasse o CD) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He gained less than the minimum wage) is more likely. The family lived in poverty because they didn't have enough money coming in to support themselves.
"Response: 
Option B: He adopted a new hobby. 
Explanation: The premise states that the student graduated from university, indicating that they have reached a milestone in their academic journey. Given this information, it is less likely that they would immediately seek employment after graduating (Option A) and more likely that they would explore other interests or pursue personal passions (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the tinta salpicou por todo o lugar) is more likely to occur because when yellow and blue paint are mixed together, they create a shade of green, not a messy or discolored appearance.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the conversation turned sour) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Eu dei-lhe as boas-vindas de volta a casa) is the correct answer. The premise mentions that the speaker's brother was released from the hospital, indicating that he returned home. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would greet him warmly upon his return.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A cortina do palco foi levantada,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Começou a cena de abertura da peça,"" is correct. The lifting of the curtain suggests that the play has begun, and therefore Option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (O sequestrador ameaçou ferir o refém) is more likely. The fact that the hostages submitted to the demands of their captors suggests that they were trying to avoid harm or danger, rather than simply being left alone. Therefore, it is more plausible that the sequestrator made threats against them in order to gain compliance.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Um estrondo reverberou pelo palco,"" option B (O músico bateu no tambor) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the child had a fear of looking under the bed) is more likely. The premise states that the parents ran to the child's room after hearing her crying, suggesting that something unexpected and potentially frightening occurred. While it's possible that the child was having a nightmare or bad dream, the fact that the parents were startled by her cries suggests that there may have been an external stimulus that triggered their reaction. Given that the child had a fear of looking under the bed, it's more likely that she saw or heard something that scared her, rather than simply having a bad dream.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option B (Ela nasceu surda) is the correct answer. The premise states that the woman communicated with sign language, indicating that she was born deaf or became deaf at some point in her life. This is a common occurrence among individuals who are born with hearing impairments or lose their hearing later in life. In contrast, being born prematurely does not typically result in deafness. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for why the woman communicated with sign language.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the water became contaminated (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O gato perseguiu o pássaro,"" it is more likely that Option A (the bird flew) will occur than Option B (the bird caught a worm). This is because the premise suggests that the cat is chasing the bird, indicating that the bird is trying to escape or avoid the cat, rather than engaging in an activity that would allow it to catch something else like a worm."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She moved to a new city) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the girl changed schools. The other option (The school is free during summer) does not provide any explanation for why she would change schools.
"Response: 
Option B:Os empregados entraram em greve. 
Explanation: Based on the premise that the owner refused to increase workers' wages, it is more likely that the employees will resort to striking as a form of protest rather than naming a new manager. Striking is a common tactic used by workers to pressure employers to address their demands, including better pay and working conditions."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A - ""Os extremistas influenciaram-no"" - occurred. The leader's actions suggest that they were influenced by the extremists, rather than being directly responsible for their death."
"Response: 
Option B: As ondas bateram na costa.
Explanation: The premise ""Eu erei descalço na praia"" suggests that the speaker went barefoot to the beach. Option B, ""As ondas bateram na costa,"" is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's feet got wet, as it implies that the waves were hitting the coastline. Option A, ""A areia ficou presa aos meus pés,"" does not make sense in this context, as there would be no reason for sand to get stuck to the speaker's feet while they are at the beach."
"Response: 
Option B: Bebi um copo de água. 
Explanation: The premise ""Acordei no meio da noite com frio"" suggests that it was cold in the middle of the night. Drinking a cup of water would be a common action to alleviate thirst caused by the cold weather, making option B more likely than option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option B (the son was crying) is the correct answer. The mother's silence suggests that she may have been trying to comfort or calm her son after he became upset, rather than smiling at him.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Um buraco rasgado nos meus jeans,"" it is more likely that Option B (Tropecei no passeio) caused the hole in the pants. The phrase ""tropecei"" means ""to trip"" or ""to fall,"" suggesting that the speaker may have accidentally fallen and ripped their pants while walking. Therefore, Option B is the more likely cause of the hole in the pants."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O rapaz usava aparelho,"" it is more likely that he has a retainer (Option B). A retainer is an orthodontic appliance used to hold teeth in their new position after braces are removed. It is designed to prevent teeth from shifting back to their original position, which would be necessary if the boy had cavities (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Acordei hoje com dores musculares) is correct. The premise states that the speaker worked out at the gym yesterday, which could potentially cause muscle soreness today. Option B (Acordei hoje com dor de garganta) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a sore throat before or after the workout. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the information given.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The girl whispered to herself forwards and backwards, indicating that she was talking to someone or something else at the table, rather than other students sitting there. This suggests that she may have been feeling excluded or isolated from the group, leading to her internal monologue. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (the correspondence was delivered) than option B (the correspondence was expedited). Therefore, the answer is (A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He went home without any money) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the winds became stronger) is a more plausible explanation for why the forest fire spread quickly. The passage does not provide any information to suggest that the perpetrators were caught or apprehended, so this option can be ruled out. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A mãe dele pôs uma ligadura na ferida) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ele assinou o testamento) is the correct answer. The fact that he survived a deadly disease suggests that he may have been terminally ill and prepared for his death by signing his will before passing away.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (magoei a língua) is more likely to happen because it means ""I swallowed hot coffee."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the writer avoided prejudices in her stories) is more likely. The premise states that the editor fired the writer, implying a negative outcome for the writer. It does not suggest any external factors such as missing deadlines or pressure from editors, which are common reasons why writers might lose their jobs. Therefore, it is more likely that the writer's avoidance of prejudices in her stories led to the unfavorable outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu me senti exausto"", it is more likely that option A (Dormi o dia todo) is the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the speaker feels exhausted, which could be alleviated by sleeping for a long time during the day. Option B (Estudei o dia todo), on the other hand, does not align with this sentiment as studying can actually increase mental fatigue rather than relieve it."
"Response: 
Option A: She identified the symptoms of the patient."
"Response: 
Option B: Sentia comichão.
Explanation: The premise ""Eu coçava a minha pele"" suggests that the speaker was scratching or rubbing their skin, which could lead to irritation or discomfort. Option B, ""Sentia comichão,"" better fits this context as it means ""felt itchy."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he suffered an attack) is more likely. The man's sudden loss of patience suggests that he may have experienced some kind of medical event, such as a heart attack or stroke, rather than simply losing his temper.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ele flexionou os braços) is more likely as it suggests that the man's muscles are inflated due to exercise or physical activity, whereas option B (Ele esfregou os braços) does not provide any explanation for why the man's muscles would be inflated.
"Response: 
Option B: He felt disheartened."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Acreditava que as intenções dele eram boas) is more likely.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker's colleague made an error, but the speaker believed their intentions were good. This suggests that the speaker may have given their colleague the benefit of the doubt and assumed they had good intentions, rather than simply assuming they knew better."
"Response: 
Option B: Começou a acordar mais cedo."
"Response: 
A) The body of the aggressor stayed lifeless."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O dardo falhou o alvo,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the man did not aim correctly rather than option B, where the man was losing the game."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ele descobriu ratos na cave) is more likely. The owner of the house requested an exterminator to come to their home, indicating that there was a problem with pests in the house. The mention of ""rats"" specifically suggests that the issue may be rodent-related, rather than related to insects or other small creatures. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Estava demasiado cansado para preparar qualquer coisa) is the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker was too tired to prepare anything, indicating a lack of energy or motivation, rather than any issue with the guest's duration of stay.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ela começou a esconder o diário) is the correct answer. The fact that the girl took her brother's diary suggests that she may be trying to hide something from him or protect herself in some way, which could involve hiding her own diary as well. This option better fits with the given information than Option B (Ela tem um diário novo), which does not provide any explanation for why the girl would take her brother's diary in the first place.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ela deixou o emprego) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ele tocou no fogão quente) is more likely as it provides an explanation for why the child's hand retracted rapidly. Touching a hot stove would be a common reason for a child's hand to recoil quickly. Option B (Ele acariciou a cabeça do cachorro) does not provide a clear explanation for the child's reaction.
"Response: 
Option B: Distributed a survey to customers.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the company distributed a survey to its customers rather than offering a discount to new clients. This is because the goal of the exercise was to assess customer satisfaction, which can be better achieved through surveys or other feedback mechanisms rather than simply offering discounts to new clients."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O chão de madeira ficou arranhado,"" option B is the most likely cause: The meninoarrastada uma cadeira pelo chão. This is because the word ""arranhado"" suggests that something was dragged or pulled across the floor, which aligns with the idea of a child pulling a chair. Option A does not fit as well since it implies that someone threw the pillows from the sofa, which would not result in the floor being scratched."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu protegi a minha cara,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""zombou"" (meaning to attack or harm) suggests that someone or something is trying to hurt the speaker's face, making option A the best choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Foi atingido por um raio) is more likely as it provides a more plausible explanation for why an iconic statue would be destroyed by fire than option B (As pessoas vinham para venerá-lo). While people may visit a famous statue to pay their respects or admire its beauty, it is unlikely that they would intentionally set it on fire. However, a freak accident involving a lightning strike could potentially result in the destruction of the statue through fire.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Deixei a fruta na mesa,"" it is more likely that the fruit will spill seeds (Option A). When you leave a piece of fruit on a table, it is likely to get crushed or spilled due to gravity, causing the seeds inside to fall out. Mosquitoes are not known to gather around fruit on tables, so Option B is less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (she twisted her ankle) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the ballerina ""rasgou um ligamento,"" which means she tore a ligament, specifically in her ankle. This injury is commonly caused by rolling or twisting the ankle, rather than pointing the toes. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice based on the information given in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ele aprendeu a amarrá-las) is more likely. The attackers of the child were released, indicating that someone or something freed them, rather than the child learning to restrain them.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I lost track of time) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""O cachorrinho sujou o tapete,"" it is more likely that Option A (the owner reprimanded the dog) is correct. The use of the verb ""sujou"" suggests that the dog did something undesirable or messy, such as dirtying the carpet, which would warrant a reprimand from the owner."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (My friend forgave me) is correct. The premise states ""pedi desculpas"" which means ""apologized,"" indicating that there was a conflict or mistake that needed to be addressed, and the fact that the speaker's friend forgave them suggests that they have made amends and moved past the issue."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O homem se destacou na multidão,"" option B is more likely. The man stood out in the crowd because he was wearing a neon-colored jacket, not because he carried a backpack."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele foi acusado de perjúrio) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ela queria misturar-se) is more likely. The phrase ""tingiu o cabelo"" suggests that she colored her hair, which would require dyeing it a different color than its natural state. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why she wanted to change her hairstyle."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they were deported (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the audience laughed) is more likely.
Response:  Option A - The sun blinded me.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eu sentia-me entediado,"" option B (Eu bocejei) is more likely. The word ""bocejei"" means to feel bored or uninterested, which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the premise. Option A (""Eu snifei"") does not convey a sense of boredom or disinterest."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (As pétalas caíram da flor) will occur. The premise states that the flower was placed under the speaker's nose, indicating that the speaker is in close proximity to the flower. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the petals of the flower will fall off due to gravity or other natural causes. Option B (Senti o cheiro da flor), on the other hand, does not necessarily follow from the premise and could be true even if the speaker is not near the flower.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she cried with her children) is more likely. The premise mentions that she felt nostalgic, which could be a trigger for emotional memories of her past, including happy moments with her family. It's unlikely that she would find an old friend from childhood, as this information is not provided in the premise. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response: 
Option B: He sent the document incomplete."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O meu carro avariou-se,"" option B (Chamei um mecânico) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the reason for not being able to read the ticket was that it was anonymous (Option A).

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Planejei ir ao casamento de um amigo) is more likely as it suggests a positive event or activity that the speaker has planned for the weekend, whereas option A (Planejei assistir ao funeral do meu tio) implies a negative event such as attending a funeral.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Estava a sonhar acordado) is the correct answer. The fact that she lost track of time suggests that she was dreaming or in a state of altered consciousness, rather than being intoxicated.

In this context, it is more likely that fans would rush towards the field rather than turning towards the flag.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that you added salt to the soup rather than serving it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ela relou o livro) is more likely.

Therefore, it is more likely that she would put down the book and come back to it later rather than marking her place.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the man looked out the window) is more likely because it does not require any additional information or context to understand what happened after the turbulence occurred. Option A (the man tightened his seatbelt) would only be relevant if there was some indication that the turbulence was severe enough to warrant taking evasive action.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the girl ignored him (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Amputated her leg) is correct. The premise states that ""the doctors gave the patient an artificial limb,"" which implies that they removed one of her natural limbs."

"Response: 
Option B: Eu sabia que estava certo.
Explanation: The premise states that you value your friend's opinion, indicating that you are open to hearing their thoughts and considering them.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""O menino pisou na lama,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""A lama ficou presa aos sapatos dele,"" occurred. The phrase ""pisou na lama"" implies that the boy stepped on something soft and squishy (lama), which could potentially get stuck to his shoes.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""A madeira partiu-se ao meio,"" it is more likely that option B occurred - ""Eu bati com o machado na madeira."" The word ""partiu-se"" suggests that something was split or broken in half, which aligns with the action of hitting something with an axe (machado)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the couple announced they were separating) than Option B (the couple announced they were expecting a baby).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She liked him) is more likely. The fact that she sent him a love card suggests that she has romantic feelings for him, rather than simply kissing him without any prior indication of interest.
"Response: 
Option A: Estava confuso.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker heard their friend say something, but then they started to nod in agreement without actually understanding what was being said. This suggests that the speaker was confused or lost track of the conversation, rather than actively agreeing with their friend's statement. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Queriam tomar uma decisão justa) is more likely. The friends launched a coin to find a fair solution to their problem, indicating that they were concerned with making a decision that was fair and just for everyone involved.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O temporizador da cozinha disparou,"" it is more likely that Option B, ""O homem tirou a pizza do forno,"" occurred. The phrase ""disparou"" suggests sudden movement or action, which aligns with the idea of someone taking something out of the oven quickly. In contrast, Option A's suggestion of unloading groceries into a freezer implies a slower and more deliberate process."
"Response:  Option B: She worked hard. 
Explanation: The premise states that the woman established an ambitious goal, indicating that she put in a lot of effort to achieve it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (O filho dele herdou a fortuna dele) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A mulher pisou nas chamas,"" option A (the flames extinguished) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (Ela teve um acidente de carro) is the correct answer. The mention of her ""carro"" being in the office suggests that she may have been involved in a car accident, rather than having her driver's license revoked."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Fiz o pequeno-almoço) occurred. The premise states ""Dormi até o meu despertador,"" indicating that the speaker woke up at their alarm clock. This implies that they had time to eat breakfast before getting ready for the day. Option B (Não tomei o pequeno-almoço) does not make sense in this context as there would be no reason for the speaker to skip breakfast if they were already awake and preparing for the day. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the family of him participated in the conference) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the water in the bathtub drained away (Option B). The phrase ""ficou na banheira"" means ""stayed in the bathtub,"" indicating that the woman did not leave the bathtub after her bath. Therefore, there would be no reason for the water to become calm or drain away."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ele juntou-se a uma fraternidade) is more likely. The student wants to meet other students on campus, but joining a fraternity may not be the most effective way of doing so, as it could limit his social interactions to only members of that organization.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Estava à procura de trocos) is the correct answer. The phrase ""almofadas do sofá"" suggests that something soft or cushy is being referred to, which aligns with the idea of searching for pillows. Additionally, the mention of ""trocos"" implies that the person is looking for specific items, rather than simply reorganizing the room. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the boy picked a flower) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: She was condemned to death.
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman was considered guilty of a minor crime, but in this scenario, she has been sentenced to death. This outcome is unlikely for a minor crime, as it would be excessive punishment. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A - The tea was steaming - occurred. When you mix sugar in hot tea, it will dissolve quickly because of the heat from the tea. Therefore, option B (the sugar dissolved) is not the most likely outcome based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O veterano andava com coxeio,"" it is more likely that he was injured in battle (Option B). The use of the word ""coxeio"" suggests that the man has a prosthetic leg, which would be more likely to result from an injury sustained during combat rather than being recruited for war."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option B: The police pursued the criminal. 
Reasoning: The premise states that the criminal fled from the police, indicating that the police were actively searching for and chasing after the criminal. This suggests that they were not simply attending to the victim but rather trying to apprehend the perpetrator of the crime."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Deixei cair) is the correct answer because if you dropped your phone, it would not be able to connect to Wi-Fi or make calls.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she dobrada a roupa suja) is more likely. The premise states that she has ""sem espaço no armário,"" indicating that her wardrobe is already full and there is no room for additional clothes. Therefore, it makes sense that she would resort to folding her dirty laundry instead of purchasing a new extensive closet organizer system."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O homem ficou de coração partido,"" it is more likely that Option B (the woman left him) caused his heartbreak than Option A (she gave birth). This is because the phrase ""ficou de coração partidos"" typically implies a sense of loss or rejection, rather than joy or celebration associated with giving birth."
"Response: 
A) He became qualified for the job he wanted."
"Response: 
Option B: He spoke into the microphone."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the coin sank to the bottom of the water source (Option A). The phrase ""afundou no fundo"" suggests that the coin was submerged in the water and then fell to the bottom, rather than breaking in half while still floating on the surface (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the ball entered the hole) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A - Eu tive soluço.
Explanation: The correct answer is option A because ""Eu respirei"" means ""I breathed,"" which implies that you took in something into your lungs, not out of them. Therefore, it's unlikely that you would have coughed up the dust from the attic."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A - The customer used fake money - is the correct answer. This is because the premise specifically states ""O caixa da loja ligou para a segurança,"" indicating that something suspicious occurred at the store, rather than simply mentioning that the customer left their lights on. Using fake money would be a more significant security concern for the store than leaving the lights on."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (O lixo fazia a cozinha cheirar mal) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the kitchen might smell bad. It also aligns with our expectations of what could be causing an unpleasant odor in a kitchen. Option B (Eu acidentalmente joguei fora a minha lista de compras) does not provide a clear or plausible reason for why the kitchen would smell bad.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the children admiring the animals) occurred. The premise states that the family went to the zoo, which implies that they were there to observe and learn about the animals, rather than causing chaos or disturbing them.
"Response:  Option B: The lungs were congested.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""O homem respirava alto,"" we know that he was breathing heavily. This suggests that his respiratory system was not functioning properly, leading us to choose option B, ""The lungs were congested."""
"Response: 
Option B: Perguntei ao meu amigo se ele estava interessado em ir."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eu abri as janelas) is more likely to be the correct answer because opening windows would allow fresh air into the house, which could help cool it down if the air conditioner broke.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the boy's backpack was open) is a more likely cause of his pain in the back than option B (his backpack was heavy).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Her birthday) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (uma abelha picou o jardineiro) is more likely to be the cause of the destruction of the narcissus in the garden. The mention of an abelha (bee) suggests a small, precise action that could potentially damage or destroy individual flowers, whereas the idea of esquilos (squirrels) desenterrando (digging up) lâmpadas (lamps) implies a larger-scale action that would be unlikely to target specific plants like the narcissus.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the fósforo produced a chama) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They didn't want to debate in court) is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Os pais deles morreram) is more likely to be the reason why the children were sent to an orphanage. The fact that their parents died suggests a tragic event that could lead to the children being left without caregivers. In contrast, option B (Os pais mimaram-nos) implies that the parents intentionally abandoned their children, which may not be as plausible given the context of the story.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that there will be a tsunami (Option A). When a meteorite falls into the ocean, it can create massive waves known as tsunamis. Granizo (Option B) is less likely to occur in this scenario because meteors do not typically produce rain or thunderstorms.
"Response: 
Option B: She entered into a state of panic.
Explanation: The premise states that the traveler found a venomous snake, which would likely cause fear or panic in most people. Option B best captures this emotional response as it suggests that the traveler became anxious or frightened upon encountering the snake."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O forno ficou quente,"" it is more likely that Option A (Liguei o forno) caused the problem, rather than Option B (Eu coloquei o prato no forno). This is because latching onto the oven would be a more direct cause of an overheated oven than simply placing something inside it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Espremho a cunha de limão,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O limão ficou mofado"" (The lemon became sour) will occur. This is because the word ""mofado"" in Portuguese means ""sour."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the lemon has become sour after being rubbed with salt."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O país descobriu novas terras,"" it is more likely that option B (the country colonized the land) is correct. The discovery of new lands suggests that the country expanded its territory through colonization rather than abandoning or leaving the existing land."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O copo caiu da mesa,"" option A (Espalhou-se por todo o chão) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A mesa balançou,"" option A is more likely. The unevenness of the floor (irregularity) could have caused the table to rock or balance. Option B does not provide a plausible explanation for why the table would balance."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (O filho dele confessou a verdade) is more likely. The fact that the father caught his son lying suggests that the son may have been dishonest, and therefore it is more likely that he told the truth to his father.
"Response: 
Option B: He took aspirin.
Explanation: The premise states that the man's head was pulsing with pain, indicating a possible headache or migraine. Aspirin is commonly used to relieve these types of symptoms, while xarope (a made-up word) is not typically associated with treating tosse (cough). Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O trem abrandou,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the train slowed down or stopped, indicating that it was approaching the station. Option B does not provide any context to support the idea of the train being late."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man was diagnosed with depression rather than his mental illness being hereditary. The phrase ""passed through therapy"" suggests that he has been receiving treatment for his condition, which is a common approach to managing depression. Hereditary mental illnesses are typically not treated with therapy alone but may require medication or other forms of intervention. Therefore, option B (depression) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A mulher agarrou-se à garganta,"" it is more likely that she suffocated with food (Option B)."
"Response:  Option B -Ela falou com sotaque.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman had a sore throat, which can cause her voice to sound different, including speaking with a sotaque (accent). Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O cão olhou para o suculento bife na mesa,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ele babava,"" is correct. The word ""babava"" means ""drooled"" in Portuguese, which fits with the idea of a dog looking at food and drooling in anticipation. Option B, ""Ele desceu,"" means ""He descended,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response: 
Option B: She became rich."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Os alunos saíram da sala de aula,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O sino tocou,"" caused them to leave the classroom. Therefore, the answer is (A) O sino tocou."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Os conocedores dela eram parentes dela) is more likely. The fact that she claimed to have seen a ghost suggests that her experience was personal and meaningful to her, rather than something that could be easily dismissed or doubted by others. It's also possible that her family members may have been more inclined to believe her account, especially if they were close to her.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he nearly died in an explosion) is more likely than option A (he nearly drowned in the ocean). The premise suggests that the man's near-death experience was caused by an explosion, rather than drowning in the ocean. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A criança soltou a corda do balão,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O balão esvaziou-se,"" will occur. When the child let go of the string attached to the balloon, the balloon was released into the air and deflated because there was nothing holding it back. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (he had an accident) caused the man to lose his ability to speak. The premise states that the man lost his capacity for speech after an incident, suggesting that there may have been some sort of physical trauma or injury involved in the loss of his ability to communicate. Option B (he took a deep breath) does not provide any explanation as to why the man would suddenly become unable to speak.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (there was a crack in the sidewalk) is more likely to be the cause of the woman tripping. The mention of her hearing her name being called suggests that she may have been distracted or startled at that moment, but it does not provide enough information to determine the actual cause of the trip.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the man splashed the life jacket) is more likely. The premise states that the man threw a ball into the pool, but it does not mention anything about a life jacket being involved in the action. Therefore, it is more likely that the man simply splashed water when he threw the ball into the pool rather than accidentally hitting or splashing someone with a life jacket.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: My infection disappeared. 
Explanation: The premise states that Tom took antibiotics, which suggests that he may have been able to clear up his infection. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O semáforo ficou amarelo,"" it is more likely that Option A (the motorist pushed the brake) occurred. This is because pushing the brake pedal would cause the vehicle to slow down or stop, leading to the traffic light turning yellow. Tapping the horn would not have any direct impact on the traffic light's color."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Coloquei o recipiente no fogão quente) is more likely to cause the plastic container to melt because it provides a higher temperature than option A (Embebi o recipiente em água morna).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O carro ficou embocado,"" it is more likely that Option A (the driver hit a phone pole) is the correct answer. The word ""embocado"" in Portuguese means ""stuck"" or ""embedded,"" so it suggests that the car became stuck or embedded in something, such as a phone pole. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the car remained stationary after passing through the intersection."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O menino estudou a noite toda,"" it is more likely that he passed the exam. The premise suggests that he studied all night, indicating dedication and hard work, which are typically associated with success in an examination. Therefore, option B (he passed the exam) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the lifeguard was on duty) is more likely. The boy's fear of learning to swim does not seem to be related to his grip on the pool edge.
Response:  Option B - The speed of my heartbeat increased.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (My office was noisy) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the family invited their neighbors for dinner) is more likely. The premise mentions that the family wanted to get to know their new neighbors better, which suggests a friendly and welcoming approach. Inviting them over for dinner is a common way to build relationships with new neighbors, making option A more likely than option B (waving from the backyard).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A água saltou da piscina,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O nadador mergulhou na piscina,"" occurred. This is because the water jumping out of the pool suggests that someone or something entered the pool from outside, rather than floating on the surface of the water inside the pool."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I accidentally parted my tooth) is more likely. The premise mentions that Mordecai bit into a carrot, but it doesn't mention anything about him swallowing a seed or hurting his tooth. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O rapaz tropeçou,"" option A is more likely. The fact that he tripped suggests that his pants were unbuttoned or undone, rather than him being attacked by someone who was already loose."
"Response: 
Option B: She made holes in her ears."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Bebi toda a água) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Eu enchi minha garrafa de água"" implies that the speaker has drunk all of their water, which would not be possible if they had stored it in the refrigerator. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (had language vulgar) is the correct answer. The passage states that the program was ""censored,"" which suggests that there were content restrictions or objections to its broadcast. This could be due to language or other mature themes that are not suitable for all audiences. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the program was censored."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O navio naufragou,"" it is more likely that option A (the crew drowned) occurred. The wording of the premise suggests that the ship sank, which would result in the deaths of all on board by drowning rather than encountering pirates. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ele resolveu o enigma) is correct. The premise states that the boy was ""perplexed"" by the riddle, indicating that he found it challenging to solve. Therefore, it makes sense that he would eventually come up with a solution rather than asking for a hint."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O telefone tocou,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O homem desligou o telefone,"" occurred. Therefore, the answer is (A) O homem desligou o telefone."
"Response: 
Option B: Senti-me desconfortável.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman was looking at me, which could be interpreted as an invitation for romantic or sexual attention. However, option B better captures the discomfort and unease that someone might feel in such a situation, especially if they are not interested in the other person."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They took photos of the exhibitions) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: My friend defended me.
Explanation: The premise states that the man started talking to you, indicating that he approached or initiated conversation with you. This means that your friend did not present him to you but rather stood up for you in response to something the man said. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B - Trocei de marcha na bicicleta.
Explanation: The premise states that the tire was flat, so option A (blowing air into the tire) would not be effective in fixing the problem. Option B (changing gears on the bike) is a more likely solution as it addresses the issue of the flat tire directly."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (O pai dela tocou-lhe na testa) is more likely. The phrase ""parecia pálida"" suggests that the girl looked pale or ill, which could be caused by a touch on her head rather than a story being told to her."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A caneta ficou sem tinta,"" it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Usei um lápis."""
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he was denied a loan because he was in debt (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ela had chickenpox) is more likely. The reason being that chickenpox is a common childhood illness that can keep a child home from school for several days or even weeks, while enjoying math may be an interest of some children but it's not a valid reason to miss school.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Levei-o para o contentor) will occur because the premise states that the trash can was full, indicating that there is a need to dispose of the trash in another location, such as a container.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (O meu colega de quarto derramou ponche) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the floor might be dirty. Derramar ponche means ""to spill"" in Portuguese, so it makes sense that someone's co-worker might have accidentally spilled something on the floor. On the other hand, option B (O meu cão perde cabelo) does not provide any logical explanation for why the floor might be dirty, as losing hair is not typically associated with making a mess. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele atirou uma cadeira para o outro lado da sala) is more likely. The man lost his patience, indicating that he may have acted impulsively or violently, leading to him throwing something across the room. Option A (He desligou o computador) does not convey the same level of aggression or frustration as option B.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the galho will burn (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the water was hot) is a more plausible explanation for why the man left the shower than option B (he couldn't find a towel). The premise suggests that something unexpected happened while the man was in the shower, leading him to leave abruptly. It is unlikely that he would have left without a towel if he had one available. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (encouraging their children to play outside) is more likely. The parents want their children to go to college, but they do not have enough money to pay for it, so they encourage them to enjoy their childhood instead of focusing solely on education.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the shoes came undone) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he refrigerated the leftovers (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (pus gel) will help reduce swelling than option B (esfreguei loção). This is because pus gel has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce swelling caused by a twisted ankle. On the other hand, esfreguei loção may not have any direct impact on reducing swelling. Therefore, option A is the better choice to address the problem stated in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ouvi a conversa no corredor) is more likely. The fact that the office door was open suggests that there may be an audience beyond just your colleague in the next room, making it more plausible that you could hear their conversation from further away.
"Response: 
Option B: Eu li uma revista.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Tive de esperar na fila,"" it is more likely that the speaker was waiting in line rather than reading a magazine. The action of waiting in line is more consistent with the context provided by the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""O homem olhou para a mosca,"" it is more likely that option B, ""A mosca ficou quieta,"" will occur. When someone looks at something, especially an insect like a mosquito, they are likely to cause it to freeze or become still in order to avoid being noticed. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ele estava a morrer) is more likely. The man wrote his will because he knew that he was going to die soon. This implies that he had limited time left to make arrangements for his estate and legacy. Option B (Ele era viúvo) does not provide any information about the man's impending death or motivation for writing his will.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he accelerated his step (Option B).
"Response: 
Option B: Eu encontrei uma solução."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ele sentiu-se extasiado) is more likely. The use of the word ""extasiado"" suggests that the traveler experienced a sense of wonder or excitement at the sight of the bridge, rather than feeling terrified."
"Response: 
Option B: He made a bet with his friends."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he defined the alarm clock (Option A). The premise states that the boy couldn't fall asleep, indicating that he was awake and alert. Defining an alarm clock would require him to be conscious and able to think about setting a time for waking up, which aligns with his state of being awake. On the other hand, counting sheep may not necessarily keep someone awake, but rather help them relax before falling asleep. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise.
