Explanation: The word ""далікатна"" in Belarusian means ""far"". Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Гэта byla далікатна (This was far away)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я апусціўкішень,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Я атрымаў копію збілета,"" occurred. This is because the word ""апусціў"" means ""to copy"" or ""to make a copy of something,"" so it makes sense that the speaker would have made a copy of their ticket rather than finding a weapon."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the termites have eaten through the walls of the house (Option A). The phrase ""уварваліся тэrмиты"" implies that they have been inside the house for some time, and the fact that they are now seen in the living room suggests that they have been able to move around freely within the structure. It is less likely that they would be able to pry open the doors or windows (Option B) without being noticed by the family."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The patrol agent discovered their hiding places in the contraband zone.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Гэта bylo свята) is more likely. The sentence ""The office was closed"" implies that there was a holiday or break in the office operations, which could be why no one answered the phone."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна гуляла ў шашкі) is more likely as it implies that Jan has run out of energy after a long walk.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (more people were in the car) is a more likely cause of Jan's disappearance. The sentence ""У чаргу ўвайшло больш людзей"" means that there were many people in the car, suggesting that Jan may have gotten lost or separated from them during their journey."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Дзіeca салілася на яе бабочку) is a more likely cause for the nose being pinched than option B (Дзіeca запецкала падгузнік). This is because the word ""саліся"" means to kiss or embrace in Belarusian, while ""запецкала"" means to squeeze or press. Therefore, it is more likely that the child accidentally kissed or embraced her mother's nose rather than squeezing it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Public applauded under music) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Дзьяўчына засталась пасля школи для затримання) is more likely. The phrase ""засталася"" implies that she was caught after school, which suggests that she tried to avoid being caught but failed. Option B (""Дзьяўчына прынесла настаўнику яблук"") does not fit with the context of the premise as it does not imply any attempt to evade detection."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They camped out in history) is a more likely cause for why the marshmallows were melted. This is because the phrase ""их дарадца"" means ""their ancestors,"" suggesting that the marshmallows have been passed down through generations and have been exposed to different historical events, leading to their melting. Option B (They roasted marshmallows over a fire) does not fit with this interpretation of the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён загінуў у думках.
Explanation: According to the premise, the protagonist has been struck by a lightning bolt, which suggests that he has died. The phrase ""у думках"" (in his thoughts) implies that his death was not physical but rather a mental one, as he has lost his sanity or consciousness due to the trauma of being struck by lightning. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Мой банкаўскі рахунак биў пусты) is more likely to be the cause of why my salary was not paid. This is because if there were any issues with the bank account, it would be more likely that the payment would not have been made rather than the employee deserving a raise.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён выдаліў спам. (He deleted the spam.)"
"Response: 
Option A: Ён быў падвёрganу ўzdzeяну хваробы.  
Explanation: According to the premise, матрос was caught in a trap. This implies that he was not aware of his surroundings and did not have control over his actions, which suggests that he was under some kind of influence or spell. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна казала гэта сабе) is more likely as it implies that Janina deliberately revealed the code. Option B (Яна забылась гэта запісаць) means that Janina forgot to write down the code, which is less likely given the context of the situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я наліў ваду ў шклянку,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Вада згасіла маю смагу"" (The glass emptied) is correct."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён хацеў прапанаваць падтрымку свайму сябру.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker's son has been crying for a long time, indicating that he may have been feeling uncomfortable or in pain. It is more likely that the speaker tried to comfort his son by holding him rather than thinking about his words."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я адчуваў сябе вінаватым) is more likely. The word ""адчуваў"" means ""to feel"" or ""to sense"", so it suggests that the speaker feels guilty about something. Option B (Я выставіў абвінаavaachenna) means ""I exposed myself to danger"", which doesn't fit with the context of feeling guilty. Therefore, option A is a better match for the given premise."
"Response:  Option A: Ланцыг был абортутирован ваколом гумы. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Ланцуг разарвался,"" which means that something happened to the ship's hull. The word ""абортутирован"" suggests that an external force, such as a whale or a submarine, collided with the ship, causing damage to its hull. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яны стаміліся з сварак) is more likely as it implies that Janina has been struggling with something, possibly indicating a longer-term issue rather than just a simple problem to be solved quickly.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Яна дала паказанне ў судзе) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён спакаvaў у куфар цёплае адзенне. (He packed a small bag for his trip.)
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the man packed a small bag for his trip rather than traveling with many large suitcases. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён паднаў руку."
"Response: 
Option A: Пыл трапіў у яго вочы (The flame engulfed his eyes).
Explanation: The phrase ""вочы чалавека"" means ""eyes of a person"", so it's more likely that the flame engulfed his eyes rather than him having an aquatic creature inside his eyes."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яе супернік пашкадаваў яе) is more likely. The word ""пашкадаваў"" suggests a deliberate and intentional action, rather than an accidental one. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's supernanny intentionally caused harm to the five hens."
"Response:  Option A: Ён зловіў студэнта на махollarстве.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the teacher saw the student dozing off during the exam. This suggests that the student was not paying attention or was distracted, which could be due to various reasons such as fatigue or boredom. However, it is unlikely that the student's answers were incorrect because they were nonsensical, as the premise does not provide any evidence of this. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the teacher noticed the student dozing off during the exam."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я страціла голас) is more likely as it means ""I got stuck without a voice"". This better fits the context of being unable to speak due to some physical or mental issue than option B (Я застаўся без дыхання), which means ""I got caught off guard"" in English."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (I packed it in a microwaveable dish) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""замарожаная ежа"" suggests that the food has been cooked or preserved in some way, and ""адтанула"" implies that it was heated up again after being frozen. This fits with the idea of cooking something in a microwave oven, rather than wrapping it in plastic wrap. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Option A: У яго былі спазмы ў жываце. (He had spasms in his stomach.)
Explanation: The word ""спазмы"" (spasms) suggests a digestive issue or discomfort in the abdomen, which aligns with the symptoms described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the worker's illness."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна бегла на палубе басейна) is more likely. The word ""бегля"" means to jump or leap in Belarusian, so it is likely that Яна jumped onto the raft from the side of the pool rather than slipping down from above."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (This was the day of the film's release) is the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the event occurred on a specific date, which aligns with the idea of a movie premiere.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Людзі ізалявалі яго) is more likely. The word ""ізалявалі"" means to make someone thin or weak, so it suggests that the person's health has deteriorated over time. Option B (Людзі рабілі яму кампліменты) means to steal someone's camping equipment, but it doesn't provide any insight into the person's physical state. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."

"Response:  Option A: Аўдыторыя ўразілася і віталі.  
Explanation: The word ""жонглірала"" in Belarusian means to juggle, so the artist was probably doing some tricks with balls or other objects while performing. This would make the audience excited and cheerful ( option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Мой сяbar прымусіў мяне пачакаць) is a more likely cause than option B (Мой сяbar прыехаў своечасова). This is because the word ""пачакаць"" means ""to wait patiently,"" which suggests that the speaker's cat may have been waiting for something to happen before it started meowing. In contrast, ""своєчасова"" means ""on its own time,"" which could imply that the cat simply wandered off without any particular reason or purpose. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the cat started meowing based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Яны распрацавалі ядзерну зброю) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Ваюючыя краіны хацелі міру"" suggests that there are powerful forces at work in the world, and the idea of Yan's research being used for nefarious purposes aligns with this theme. Option B (Яны дамовіліся аб дагаворы) does not fit as well with the given premise, as it implies a more mundane explanation for Yan's disappearance without any reference to supernatural or extraordinary events."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яmu сталась дрымотная) is more likely. The word ""дрымотная"" means ""drowsy"", so it's likely that the speaker became drowsy after drinking too much alcohol."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (На канапе нага распусціся) is a more likely outcome than option B (Яна пашкодзіла калена). This is because the word ""ударылася"" in the premise implies that something unexpected or surprising has happened to Жанчына, rather than suggesting that she deliberately caused harm to herself. Therefore, it is more likely that she accidentally ingested something poisonous while eating the canape, leading to her unconsciousness."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Баlon зрыvaўся) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яны разgarunli svae valisy) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that Janas has packed her bags, rather than having left with a suitcase she did not pack herself.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the fruit will be juicy (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я з'ела пончык) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""з'ела пончык"" means ""I ate a punch,"" which aligns with the context of the premise. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Option A - Дзверы адчыньіся (The dogs chased).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Прадукцыя была пратэставана для забеспячэния якасці) is more likely. The word ""пратэставана"" means ""to testify"", so it suggests that the education was designed to prepare students for a specific purpose or goal, rather than simply providing them with practical skills. This aligns better with the idea of preparing students for future careers."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Пыль вылецела з дзіркі) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яе сястра була шчаслівая) is more likely. The word ""шчаслівая"" means ""happy"", so it suggests that the speaker's sister was happy before she died. This contradicts the idea of her death being a tragedy or accident. Therefore, option A is the better answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я nadzev fartukh) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""nadzev"" means ""to eat"", so it suggests that the speaker ate something before drinking the wine, rather than changing their stomach."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Кліент праверыў свій кашалок) is more likely. The phrase ""Касір адкрыў касу"" suggests that the cashier opened the register, implying that there was money in it to begin with. If the client had already paid for their groceries, then they would not have been able to take any money from the register. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the cashier found no money in the register."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He convinced them to give him a loan) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the speaker is describing an action taken by the musician to convince someone to do something, rather than simply stating what happened. This aligns with Option B, which implies that the musician took deliberate action to obtain the loan.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яму не хапала батькоў) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""хлопчык плакаў да сваёй няньки"" suggests that a child is crying to his/her nanny, implying that the child's father is not present. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the child is crying."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the pilot flew away from the storm (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Лісце ператоварыся ў колеры) is more likely. The word ""ператовысьці"" means to spread or disperse, so it's likely that the forest has been dispersed or scattered in different directions rather than growing back in one place."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён вырашыў пагуляць у карты са сваёй сястрой.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the boy was being naughty with his sister's card than zoning out and not paying attention to her."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Бацька даў яму піць газіроўку) is more likely. The phrase ""Дзіeca скардзіся"" means ""The child complained,"" indicating that the speaker believes the child's statement to be true. Additionally, the word ""газіроўку"" specifically refers to a toilet, further supporting Option A. Therefore, it is more likely that the father gave the child a spanking in response to the child's complaint about needing to use the toilet."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Рыба выскачыла з акваториі) is more likely. The word ""выскачила"" implies that the fish swam out of the water, which is not possible for a fish to do. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна ўдзельнічала ў акцыі пратэсту) is more likely. The change in Yan's perspective has led to her involvement in the protest, indicating a shift in her political views.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I found a drain) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that something was ""зачыновы"" (lit. ""got stuck"") in the shell, implying that there is an obstruction or blockage somewhere. Finding a drain would be a plausible explanation for why the water didn't flow out of the shell."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Цягнік прыбыў на станцу) is more likely as it implies that the cow has arrived at a station, which is a plausible scenario given the context of the sentence. Option B (Цягнік свістаў) does not make sense in this context as cows do not have the ability to fly. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option B: Ён запячатаўканверт. (He glued the canvas.)"
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яны любілі сябраваць адзін з адним) is more likely. The phrase ""сябравіцкі"" suggests a strong emotional attachment to someone or something, which aligns with the idea of loving someone deeply. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна пайшла ў адпачынак па прымусе) is more likely. The phrase ""неправільнакіраваў Fondu"" suggests that there was an irregularity in the fund's management, which could have led to a loss of money for the investors. Therefore, it is more likely that the manager of the fund made a mistake or acted unethically rather than simply quitting their job without any explanation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я паглядзеў на гадзіннік"" (I saw a UFO), option A is more likely. The phrase ""пачуў, как гадзины білі"" (I saw white dots) suggests that the speaker saw something in the sky, which aligns with the idea of a UFO. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the speaker was trying to prove anything or that they were concerned about time."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Мая рука спала,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Я напісаў эсэ ўручную"" means ""I wrote it by hand."" Therefore, the most likely explanation for Maya's hand being asleep is that she was writing something by hand."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я замяніў болт) is a more plausible explanation for why the zipper got stuck than Option B (Я павярнуў габрэйскі ключ). The word ""болт"" in Russian means a screw or bolt, so it's possible that the speaker accidentally tightened the zipper too much, causing it to get stuck."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Para perahala ў kvatery) is more likely. The word ""perahala"" means to move or pass through something quickly, so it's likely that the two women passed through the door quickly rather than stopping to look at it."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна хацела паглядзець на захад сонца) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""паглядзець на захад сонца"" means ""to look at the sun,"" which is a physical action that can be observed and verified. In contrast, the phrase ""стомата бачыла маланку"" means ""the stomach saw a mallard,"" which is an absurd and impossible scenario. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён не ўмеў плаваць. (He did not know how to swim.)
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the man did not know how to swim than that the wave was too big for him to handle. The sentence ""Мужчына насіў у вадзе выратавальну камізэльку"" implies that the man entered the water without any difficulties or challenges, suggesting that he knew how to swim. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man drowned."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна націнула клавішу адтэрміноўкі) is more likely because it implies that Jan deleted the document intentionally by pressing a keyboard key, whereas option A (Яна выдаліла дакумент) does not convey the same meaning.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна атрымала дренную адznaku) is more likely as it implies that Jan has received a prize or reward for her work, whereas option B (Яна выйграла у конкурсе) means she won a competition.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It rained all night) is more likely to be the cause of the messy garden. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that it was a prolonged and heavy rain that caused the muddy state of the garden, rather than a single event like a pools of water or a full wastebasket. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна перыядычна пераночыла ў гатэлі) is more likely as it implies that Jan lost her phone while she was in a store, which could be a common occurrence. Option B (Яна забылися ўсталяваць будзільник) does not provide any context or details to support why Jan might have forgotten her phone.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён сядзеў у цені.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the person took a nap in the sun, which means they were lying down or sitting in a comfortable position. This is more likely to be option A, as it suggests that the person was relaxing and enjoying their time in the sun. Option B does not provide any information about the person's location or activity, making it less plausible."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Даслідчыкі даказалі гэтую тэорыю) is more likely. The text suggests that the researchers have discovered a new theory, implying that they have conducted original research and developed a new understanding of the topic. This is consistent with option A, as it implies that the researchers have advanced knowledge in their field through their own efforts. In contrast, option B (Асобныя прынялі тэорыю) implies that the researchers have simply adopted an existing theory without adding any new insights or contributions of their own.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Guulnaya paid extra time) is more likely. The premise states that fans burst into laughter when Guulnaya's opponent made a mistake, indicating that Guulnaya was in control of the game until then. Therefore, it is unlikely that the arbitrator made an incorrect decision, as there would have been no opportunity for them to make such a call. Instead, it is more plausible that Guulnaya took additional time to prepare her next move, leading to the fans' amusement.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я ўвёў свой Campbell's на замак,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Я зачыніў замак"" (I started the fire), is correct."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Батько дав синову гроші) is more likely. The word ""дал"" in Belarusian means ""gave"", so it suggests that the father gave his son money."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Снег блакаваў пад'езд,"" option B is more likely. The word ""блакаваў"" means ""was melting,"" indicating that the snow was already in a liquid state before it reached the ground. Therefore, option B, ""Я сапёр снег з шляху,"" which means ""I cleared the snow from the path,"" is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Каяк дабраўся да берага) is more likely. The word ""дабраўся"" means to drift or float away, so it suggests that the kayak has been carried by the current without any deliberate action from the paddler. Option B (Каяк ударыў хваляй) means ""The kayak hit a rock,"" which doesn't fit with the idea of being carried away by the current."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна адпусціла руль) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я ўключыў вентилятор,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Вада пасыпалися на маёй скуры,"" is correct. The use of the word ""ўключыў"" (turned on) suggests that a ventilator was turned on, which could cause a draft or wind to blow towards the speaker's face. This is consistent with the second part of the sentence, where the speaker mentions feeling uncomfortable due to the cold air. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яныбыли мокрыя) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""мокрый"" means wet or damp in Russian, so it's possible that the surfers got wet while they were on the beach. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the surfers are late than option B (Яны убачили акулу), which means ""The surfers saw an octopus."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Vada pyrskalася na podlogu) is more likely to happen because it implies that Vada has fallen onto something soft or flat, such as a bed or a floor, whereas option A (Vada vadakстала z vanny) suggests that she may have simply leaned forward and fallen into the water without hitting anything first.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён абвінаваціў яе ў нявернасці.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the husband avoided his wife than that he confessed to her in a fit of anger. The phrase ""падмануў жонку"" suggests that the husband was avoiding or neglecting his wife, rather than expressing anger towards her. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я чакаў, пакуль чарніла высахне) is a more plausible explanation for why there are char marks on the plate. This option suggests that the char marks were caused by waiting for something to happen or expecting something to occur, rather than simply painting over the stain. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У яго быў кашмар) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""прачнувся"" means ""had a nightmare,"" so it suggests that the child had a bad dream. This aligns with the idea of a nightmare causing discomfort or unease. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго батька сев за стіль) is more likely. The word ""паклаў"" in the premise means ""kicked,"" so it's unlikely that his father gave him lessons. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я крычала яго імя) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker yelled his name in anger or frustration, whereas option B (Я махнуў рукамі) means ""I waved my hands"" and doesn't convey a sense of anger or aggression."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Грамадзьяне пачыля паўстанне) is more likely. The word ""пачыля"" means ""to start"", so it implies that the peasants started the uprising themselves. Option B (Грамадźяне зарэгістраваліся, каб прагаласавацца) means ""The peasants registered themselves to fight"", which suggests a more organized and planned approach to the uprising. Therefore, option A is more in line with the meaning of the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён паднаў намёт. (He fell asleep.)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Хлопчык заблукаў у лесе"" (""The little boy got lost in the forest""), it is more likely that he fell asleep while wandering around the forest rather than crying for help."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна хацела навучыцца маляваць) is more likely. The sentence suggests that Yan has studied abroad, which implies a formal education or academic pursuit. This is consistent with the idea of Yan traveling for educational purposes. In contrast, Option B (Яна хацела даведацца пра иншыя культуры) could imply any number of cultural experiences, including those related to food, art, music, etc., but does not necessarily suggest an academic pursuit.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго калегу павысілі ў службе) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is describing a situation where the man's career was affected or ended due to his gender. Option B does not fit as well with the context of the premise.
"Response: 
Option A: У яго билы галюцынацыі. 
Explanation: The text states that the alien was ""сведкам іншаplaneце"" (translated as ""from another planet""), indicating that it came from a different world or galaxy. This suggests that the alien's appearance was not due to any mental illness but rather its natural form from another planet. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён паклаў у яго адбельвальник. (He put it in his pocket.)
Explanation: The word ""адбельвальник"" means ""pocket"", so option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна адчула ўдар натхнення) is more likely as it suggests that Jan received inspiration from something rather than simply copying someone else's work.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (his father sent him away from home) is the correct cause for why he left his house. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Палицыбыли пакрытыя пылама) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""Палицыбыли пакрытыя пылама"" suggests that the books were burned by flames, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as an accidental fire or intentional arson. On the other hand, option B (""Землятрус пацісув кніжну паліцю"") implies that the earthquake destroyed the bookshelf, but it does not provide any information about what happened to the books themselves. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the books are no longer in the library."
"Response:  Option A - Я ўключыла святло.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker turned off the electricity in their home. This means that they would have turned off the light switch, making option A the most likely choice."
"Response:  Option B: Гэta выглядала весела.  
Explanation: The premise ""Мы ехали на аstravoдах"" suggests that they were traveling in a strange or unusual way, which aligns with the idea of the situation being funny rather than scary. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я наліў масла ў мяшок) is more likely as it implies that the speaker found a piece of butter in their food, whereas option B (Я нагрэў яго ў мікраhwalevaй печы) means that the speaker melted butter in a small saucepan, which does not align with the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Прагноз паветра прадказваў моцные ветры) is more likely. The falling tree branch would be blown away by strong winds rather than being knocked down by an electric current from a nearby power line.
"Response: 
Option A: Яму было сумна ў публіцы.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker was unhappy with the public's reaction, implying that they were disappointed or upset by it. Option A best captures this sentiment as it means ""I was sad in public."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (На маім пальци з'явилась кропля крові) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""змайго твару капав поцеу"" suggests that something has happened to the speaker's body, specifically their blood, which aligns with Option B. Option A (""З mai go твару капав поцеу"") does not make sense in this context as it implies that something has happened to the speaker's plant or tree, which is unlikely given the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Гэта было галодным) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""рыба плавала на паверхнии акватории"" suggests that the fish was swimming in the upper layer of water, which is a common behavior for many species of fish. Therefore, it is more likely that the fish drowned due to lack of oxygen in the upper layers of the water rather than being dead already."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (У яго была прастуда) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why the man's voice was hoarse. Having a cold or flu can cause inflammation in the vocal cords, leading to a hoarse voice. Option B (Ён кінуў паліць) does not provide any logical explanation for why the man's voice was hoarse.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ліфт прыбыў на прызначену паверху) is a more plausible explanation for why the elevator stopped at the wrong floor than Option B (Ліфт затрымаўся паміж павергамі). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the elevator simply reached a different floor than intended rather than getting stuck in between floors. Therefore, it is more likely that there was an error or malfunction in the elevator's programming or mechanics that caused it to stop at the incorrect floor rather than becoming stuck in mid-air.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён хлусіў сваім бацькам. (He broke his own home.)
Explanation: The premise states that Padletek has left his house without permission, indicating that he is responsible for breaking into his own home. Option A better fits this scenario as it implies that Padletek entered his own home without authorization."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (У туалеце было пераполовнено) is a more likely cause for the toilet not flushing properly than option B (Гарачка вады зламалась). This is because the word ""пераполовнено"" specifically implies that something has been clogged or blocked inside the toilet bowl, which could prevent the water from flowing freely and causing the toilet to flush improperly. In contrast, ""зламалась"" simply means that something was broken or damaged, without providing any specific information about what might have caused the problem. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Уладальник nadzev на шchanuka kavner) is more likely. The phrase ""застаўся побач са сваім гаспадара"" suggests that the speaker was surprised by something unexpectedly, and the word ""nadzev"" means to be caught off guard or unprepared for something. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker was taken aback by something their leader said or did rather than being restrained against their will."
"Response: 
Option A: Ёn strayed under velizarny drams.  
Explanation: The word ""velizarny"" in Belarusian means ""enchanted"", so it's more likely that the person strayed into an enchanted forest rather than a peaceful lake."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я патэлефанаваў ёй назад) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ih sabaka utsik z domu) is a more likely cause for their absence from home. This is because the word ""уцёк"" (utsiok) means to leave or go away, while ""зніклі"" (znikli) means to disappear or vanish. Therefore, it is more likely that they left their home of their own accord rather than being taken away without their knowledge or consent."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я бачыў свой дychanne, калі я дыхаў,"" it is more likely that the speaker experienced a physical sensation such as chest pain or discomfort ( Option B: У мяне адчувалася напружанасць у грудзях). The phrase ""я бачыў"" means ""I saw"" in English, but in this context, it implies a physical sensation rather than visual perception. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They hired the best workers) is more likely to be the cause of their success. The text states that they ""hired the best workers,"" implying that their employees were highly skilled and capable. This suggests that the company's success was due to its ability to attract and retain top talent, rather than the employees being underpaid. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the smell of baking filled the kitchen (Option A). The word ""пах"" in Belarusian means ""smell"", so the sentence implies that the act of baking something has a strong scent that fills the entire kitchen. Option B does not make sense in this context as ""цоплы"" means ""to boil"" in Belarusian, and there is no indication that anything was boiling in the kitchen. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна насіла абцасы) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Жанчына з цяжкасцю хадзіла"" means ""She had a difficult time with her studies,"" so it suggests that the subject struggled academically. Option B (""Яна здымала абутак"") does not fit this context as it means ""She was lazy."" Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вада закіпела) is more likely as it suggests that the difficulty in understanding each other stems from a lack of communication skills or language barrier rather than an intentional attempt to deceive.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she put her shoes in the washing machine by mistake (Option A).
"Response: 
Option A: Ён страціў падтрымку выbarshchykаў (He lost his support among voters).
Explanation: The premise suggests that the politician's actions were absurd, implying that he had lost touch with reality or was acting in an irrational manner. This could have led to a loss of support among voters, making option A the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пара зацяжарыла) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Мільянеры хацелі, каб будынак знеслі) is more likely as it suggests that the millennials actively sought to destroy Buddha's teachings. This aligns with the idea that millennials are often seen as disruptive and dismissive of traditional values and beliefs. Option B (Мільянеры ўнеслі сродкі на яго будаўніцтва), on the other hand, implies that millennials simply inherited their parents' beliefs without questioning or challenging them, which may not be a accurate representation of the generation's relationship with Buddhism.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Прадавец бачыў, как дзяўчына кладзе тавар у сваю кашалёк) is a more likely cause for why the seller sold the goods at a low price than option B (Прадаўца дапамог дзьяўчыне знайсці кашалёк, які ёй спадабаўся). This is because it suggests that the seller had knowledge of the buyer's financial situation and intentionally sold the goods at a low price to take advantage of them.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Салдаты былі накіраваны на вайну) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""краіна абвясціла вайну"" suggests that there has been a significant change in the political landscape of the region, potentially leading to the displacement or migration of people. This could result in Saltdats being scattered across different territories, rather than being concentrated within their traditional homeland. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Перад будынкам суда пачаўся бунт) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that there was a sudden outbreak of discontent among the people, leading to unrest and potentially violence. This is consistent with Option A, which implies that the uprising began spontaneously among the population. In contrast, Option B (Пара абмянялася клятовамі перад будынками суда) implies that there was a deliberate decision made by someone to appeal to the people against the court, which may not have been as widespread or violent as an unplanned uprising.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна пакінула печыва ў духоўцы) is more likely as it implies that Janа intentionally smelled something bad in her house, whereas option A (Яна выняла печыва з банка) does not convey any specific intentional action by Janа.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дождж ішоў как з вядра,"" Option A: Шторм паagarshaўся is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: ""Ліфт перастаў працаваць"" (The lift stopped working) is the cause of the evacuation. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Батько (Father) kicked his son out of the house (Option B). The phrase ""раздражался алкагализмами"" suggests that Father was annoyed by his son's behavior, which could have led to a confrontation or argument, ultimately resulting in the son being asked to leave the house. Option A does not align with the given premise as buying beer for one's son is unlikely to cause such a strong reaction from a parent."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the lift was not working) is more likely. The sentence implies that the principal could not leave her office because the lift was broken, rather than suggesting that she simply walked away to go home.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго сяbar перапыніў яго) is a more likely cause for the situation described in the premise. The phrase ""перапыніў"" means ""tore apart,"" indicating that something was torn or separated, which aligns with the idea of someone's sibling being torn away from them. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Касір даў дзьяўчыне яе змены) is more likely. The word ""змены"" in Belarusian means ""money"", so it's clear that the kasir gave Dzyaunka her money back. Option B (""Касір забыўся даць дзьяўчыне квітанцыю"") doesn't make sense in this context as there is no mention of a receipt or any other document related to the transaction."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Яна була паралізаваная ў винюку аварыі) is the more likely cause for why Janina ended up in an invalid chair. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Krajina admitted its independence) is a more likely cause for the national flag to be raised over the dam. This is because the premise states that Krajina has declared its independence from the country, indicating that it has gained autonomy and sovereignty. Therefore, raising the national flag over the dam would be a symbol of Krajina's newfound independence and self-governance. Option B (Krajina was involved in a conflict with neighboring countries) does not align with the premise as there is no mention of any conflicts or tensions between Krajina and its neighbors.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яны натхнялі сваіх прыхільнікаў) is more likely. The word ""прайграла"" in the premise suggests that a tournament was held, and the phrase ""сваіх прыхільнікаў"" means ""their fans."" Therefore, it is more likely that the team inspired their fans rather than confused them."
"Response:  Option A - Мне было сорамна (I was embarrassed).
Explanation: The premise states that something unexpected happened to the speaker's teeth, implying a sense of surprise or embarrassment. Option A better captures this feeling than Option B, which simply means ""I got angry."""
"Response: 
Option A: Ён звярнуў увагу на ўроках.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the boy failed his history exam because he paid attention during the lessons. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of his failure."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (an earthquake occurred in the city) is a more likely cause for the buildings to have collapsed than option B (the level of zombies in the city has increased). Therefore, answer choice A is correct.
Response:  Option A (He took her back)
"Response:  Option A - The ball has moved.
Explanation: According to the premise, two dogs are fighting over a ball. Since they are both trying to get their paws on it, it's more likely that the ball will move than for their heads to collide. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (У сниццевай кашы быў кардон) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""смьццев"" in Belarusian means ""a small basket"", so it's unlikely that a cover was made of such material. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Гэта было tanna) is more likely as it means ""He was tired"" in English, which aligns with the context of the situation described in the premise. Option B (Гэта bylo sumna) means ""It was sad"", which doesn't fit well with the given information. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Сукенка не падиhodziła) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The fact that Jan lost her receipt suggests that she may have misplaced it or accidentally thrown it away, rather than having it taken from her by someone else.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён хутка зажыў (He lit a cigarette).
Explanation: The sentence ""Драпіну на маёй скуры был глыбок"" implies that there was something heavy or thick on her shoulder, which could be interpreted as a reference to a physical object. However, the phrase ""зажыў"" means ""lit,"" suggesting that someone (likely the speaker) lit a cigarette. Therefore, Option A is the most likely answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён глядзеў на зямлю.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Мужчына атрымаў дзіўныя погляды ад пасажыраў у цягніку,"" it is more likely that the man was looking at the sky rather than talking to himself. The phrase ""атрымаў дзіўныя"" means ""saw a distant view,"" indicating that he was gazing at something in the distance, such as the sky. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Мурашы падполлі да крошкі) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""мурашы падполлі"" means ""to bury in the mud,"" which suggests that the child may have buried something in the mud, such as a small animal or object. This is a more plausible explanation for why there are holes in the ground than Option B (Дзieca адклала хлeб), which means ""The girl dug up bread."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сястра жанчыны клала рукі) is more likely. The word ""клала"" means ""stroked"", so it suggests that the sister gently touched or stroked the handkerchief given by Jeanina. Option B (Сястра жанчыны пачала плакаць) means ""the sister began to cry"", which doesn't fit with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Option A - Яго вусны былі расшчапленыя (His hair was unkempt).
Explanation: The sentence ""Чалавек узяў мятны"" means ""The man took a bribe"", but it does not make sense in this context. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яны чакалі руху вакол тэатра) is more likely as it implies that they were waiting for something to happen at the theatre, rather than having instructions from someone.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Her boss found her at home) is correct. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that someone else discovered her at home rather than herself hiding or covering up something related to work.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён падтрымаў іх справу.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the activists have been following the case of the five young people who were arrested for participating in a peaceful protest. This implies that they are actively involved in supporting them and their cause, rather than simply naming them as varangers ( Option B). Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option A (Сэрца акцёра хістався перад яго выступленнем) is the correct answer because it best fits the given information. The passage states that the actor's heart was racing before his performance, indicating that he was experiencing anxiety or stage fright. This is a common phenomenon among performers who are about to appear in front of an audience, and it can be caused by various factors such as nerves, pressure to deliver a good performance, or past experiences. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the actor's heart was racing.
Response:  Option A - Я падлічыuals svae goroshchys (I spent my money).
"Response: 
Option A: Ён быў з'еджены (He was sedated).
Explanation: The sentence ""Саспелыя плады затрымліваліся на сонцы"" implies that someone or something has been sedated, making them unconscious. Option A better fits this context as it means ""he/she was sedated."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я павярнуў запальванне) is a more likely cause than option B (Рухавік перагрэўся). This is because the word ""палямба"" means ""fire"", and the phrase ""памянала палямбу"" means ""remembered the fire"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker started the fire intentionally rather than accidentally."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён пайшоў да псіхіяatra (He paid for a psychiatrist).
Explanation: The premise states that the man has been experiencing strange occurrences, including hearing voices and feeling like he's being watched. These are common symptoms of mental illnesses such as paranoid schizophrenia or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Therefore, it is more likely that the man sought professional help from a psychiatrist to address these issues rather than simply lying in bed all day."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У мяне не было дроваў) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there was no fire in the stove.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У яе суtarгі ў бок) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""У яе суtarгі ў бок"" means ""Her stomach hurts from running,"" indicating that she may have overexerted herself while jogging. This is a plausible explanation for her current condition, given that she has been jogging regularly. In contrast, Option B (""Яна атрымала другое дыханне"") does not provide any specific information about why her stomach hurts, making it less likely as an explanation."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сусед запрасіў мяне ў дом) is more likely. The word ""запрасіў"" in Belarusian implies a deliberate action taken by the neighbor to enter the speaker's home without permission. Therefore, it is more likely that the neighbor entered the speaker's home uninvited rather than the speaker entering their neighbor's home without permission."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (her husband didn't understand her clumsiness) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is trying to explain their own actions in a humorous way, rather than blaming someone else for them. Additionally, the phrase ""уздыхнула з расчараваннем"" suggests that the speaker is feeling embarrassed or ashamed about their clumsiness, which aligns with the idea of not understanding one's own actions."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вучаг правільна адказаў на пытанне) is more likely. The word ""пахваліў"" in Belarusian implies that the teacher has corrected or approved of the student's answer, suggesting that the student provided a correct response. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна пайшла на ферму) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я сустрэў старога сябра,"" option A is more likely. The word ""раскрыла"" (revealed) fits better in this context than ""абняла"" (ate), as it implies that something was hidden or secret beforehand."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна злавіла рыбу) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why Жанчына would be in the water. It is unlikely that she would be there simply because she looked sad or upset ( Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго парасон быў зламаны) is more likely as it implies that the student's phone was broken due to an accident or misuse, rather than being stolen.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Карыстальник націнув мышшу) is a more plausible explanation for why the cursor on the screen of the computer monitor pawarochev itself. This is because the term ""павароче"" in Belarusian means ""to twitch,"" which suggests that the movement of the cursor was sudden and involuntary. Therefore, it is more likely that the user accidentally pressed a key or moved their mouse without intending to, causing the cursor to move unexpectedly. Option B (Карыстальник перамяшаў мыш) does not fit with this interpretation as it implies that the user intentionally moved their hand or arm to move the cursor, which is unlikely given the context of the situation."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (На галоўнай дарозе адбылося аварыя) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in this option suggest that an accident occurred while Jane was driving on the main road. This aligns with the premise provided, which mentions a car crash happening on the straight path. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Леніне бялізну висахла) is more likely. This is because the word ""бялізну"" means ""white"", and ""висахла"" means ""washed"". So, it can be inferred that Lenin washed his white clothes on a wet line. Option B (""Палатна пацёрты"") does not make sense in this context."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Сon was brighter) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён пажадаў, каб bylo лета. (He expected it to be flying.)
Explanation: The sentence ""Чалавек глядзеў на начное неба"" means ""A man looked at the scientific sky."" Option A is a more plausible explanation for this sentence as it implies that the man was expecting or hoping to see something in the sky, such as a plane or an aircraft, rather than simply looking at it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я пайшла спаць рана) is more likely. The speaker mentions feeling exhausted, indicating that they may have overslept or not gotten enough rest. This aligns with Option A, where the speaker admits to sleeping through an appointment. On the other hand, Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of the speaker missing an appointment or being late for something important.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён расце яго валасы (His nails grew long).
Explanation: The sentence ""Чалавек пайшоў да цырульніка"" means ""The man went to the barber"", and "" IOн расце яго валасы"" means "" His nails grew long"". Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Хлопчык вітаў новага аднакласніка) is more likely. The word ""вітаў"" means ""welcome,"" indicating that the boy was happy to see his new classmates."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я еў печыва) is more likely to be the correct answer because it means ""I boiled an egg."" The other option, Option B (Я пякла хлеб), means ""I baked bread,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Кіроўца пераключыў машыну на зваротny ход) is more likely. The word ""пераключи"" means to change direction or turn around, so it suggests that the king's horse turned around and went in a different direction than what was expected. This is consistent with the idea of the king's horse running away from danger. Option A (""Кіроўца ўключыў фары"") does not fit as well with the premise, as ""уключыў"" means to include or add something, and does not convey the sense of the horse changing direction."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я прыпаркаваў насупраць) is more likely. The word ""насупраць"" means ""upside down"", so it's unlikely that the speaker would have been inside the apartment when it was empty."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У яе була письменницька блока) is more likely as it suggests that the writer had a block of writing, rather than simply not having enough time to finish the project.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I called the boss) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker made a deliberate action to contact their boss, rather than simply giving them an identity number.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Дзверы зачыньіся) is more likely. The verb ""зачыніліся"" means to wake up or become alert, which fits with the idea of the dogs barking loudly. Option B (""Заслоны дрыжалі"") means that the curtains are blown away, but it doesn't fit as well with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я адключыў лямпу) is more likely as it implies that the speaker turned off the light intentionally, while option B (Я выбухнуў бяспеку) suggests an accident or a sudden explosion, which is less likely given the context of the sentence.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён выплюшчыў мышцы перад люстэркам.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the person ""выплюшчыў"" their muscles before jumping into the water. This implies that they were preparing themselves for the jump by tensing up their muscles, which is more likely option A. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a platform or any other elevated surface."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён узяў калькулятар. (He took a calculator.)"
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Бацька змяніў дзіцаці пельме́ні) is more likely as it implies that the father changed something in his daughter's life, specifically her food, whereas Option B (Бацька мякка пакаціў дзіцаці) does not provide any specific details about what the father did to change his daughter's life.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Хлопчык атрымаў uzrušenno možu) is more likely. The phrase ""uzrušenno možu"" means ""got a headache,"" indicating that the boy was affected by the girl's magic spell. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""усе адмаўляліся ўсміхацца"" suggests that everything was overexposed, implying a brighter than normal exposure. This is consistent with the idea of an accidental flash going off during a photoshoot, causing all of the images to be overexposed. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я була адзінокая) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""адзовiвся"" in Belarusian means ""I was absentminded,"" which fits with the context of forgetting an appointment. Therefore, option A is a better fit than option B (Я биў па-за горадам), which means ""I would have gone to the mountains."""
"Response:  Option A: Я адчуваў сябе энергічним.  
Explanation: The sentence ""Я займалася спортом"" implies that the speaker was engaged in physical exercise or sports. Therefore, option A, ""Я адчуваў сябе энергічним"", which means ""I felt energetic"", is a more likely explanation for why the speaker might have been feeling that way after engaging in sports."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён паглынае ваду (Your lips are burning).
Explanation: The word ""паглынае"" in Belarusian means ""burning"", so it's unlikely that the speaker has received a free gift. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Курорт быў зачынены) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Адпачывальнікі эхали на паrome на курорт"" implies that there was a storm or bad weather at the resort, which could have caused the ferry to cancel its trip. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the passengers were unable to reach their destination."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна баялася іголак) is more likely as it implies that Jan was afraid of something, whereas option B (Яна хацела паўстаць) means that Jan made a decision or took action.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я стаў падазроным) is more likely to be the correct response. The phrase ""невядомая машына"" suggests that something unexpected or unexplained has happened, which aligns with the idea of feeling lost or disoriented. Option B (""Я патэлефанавала ў паліцыю"") means ""I was teleported away,"" which does not fit the context of the premise as it implies a sudden and unlikely transportation event."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Доказы ўмяшалі яго) is more likely. The text suggests that there are evidence or proof of Zalutsnitsa's involvement in the crime, which implies that he was involved in some way.
"Response: 
Option B: Ён пазбягаў кафеіну."
"Response:  Option B: Яна дрыжала.  
Explanation: The word ""дрыжала"" means ""stumbled"" or ""tripped"", which fits better with the context of Dzyana falling onto the ice. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна не спала ўсю ночь) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why Яна did not sleep all night.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Вулкан вывярнуўся) is more likely to be the cause of the lava flowing out of the volcano. This is because the premise states that ""Лава цякла з вулкана,"" indicating that lava is flowing from the volcano, which suggests that there has been an eruption or some other disruption in the volcano's activity. Therefore, it is more likely that the volcano itself has become active again rather than being unpredictable."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна хацела пакінуць вечарыну) is more likely. The word ""хацела"" means ""to prepare"", so it suggests that Jan prepared a feast for everyone. Option A (""Яна ведала ўсіх на вечарыне"") means ""Jan invited everyone to the feast"", but it doesn't convey the same meaning as option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна дала мне прайсці праз плату за праезд) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that Yan gave me a price for the trip after paying her.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён прадаў акцыі сваёй кампаніі.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the bankruptcy campaigner sold their shares. This suggests that they profited from the sale of their shares rather than losing money due to their own financial mismanagement. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Доктарбыў у адпачынку) is more likely as it implies that the doctor was in a position to receive the package. Option B (Чалавек адчуvaў сябе дранна) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of why the man would be feeling dizzy or disoriented.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я выйшаў з спальни праз акно,"" it is more likely that option A (Дом быў у агні) is correct. The word ""агнь"" means ""fire"" in Russian, so it suggests that there was a fire in the house while the speaker was sleeping. Option B (""Дом быў пусты"") means ""The house was empty,"" which does not align with the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён доўга прымаў душ.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the hands of the boy are stained with steel. This suggests that he has been involved in some physical activity or labor that requires him to handle heavy objects, such as working in a factory or doing manual labor. It is unlikely that he would have used hand cream, as it is not a common product for boys his age. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Молако было кіслым на смак) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker spat out the moloko. This is because ""kisly"" means sour or bitter in Russian, which could be an appropriate reason for spitting out something that tastes unpleasant. Option B (""У мяне быў сухий рот"") does not provide any logical explanation for why the speaker spat out the moloko."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я прапусціў аўтобус,"" option A (Я рана прыйшоў на праку) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Машына was разбита) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Яны перамаглі) is more likely to be the correct response. The word ""перамаглі"" means ""to fabricate,"" so it fits well with the idea of falsifying documents or information. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I peeled off the label) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for how the sticker came off. Option B (I glued it back on) does not provide any explanation for why the sticker would come off in this scenario. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён пракралівся ўnutr praz adkrytae akno. (He climbed up through an open window.)"
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Жанчына зазірнула праз адтуліну ад ключа ў дзвяrach) is more likely. The word ""зазірнула"" suggests that she peeked through a keyhole, which implies a level of stealth and caution that would be less likely if she had simply knocked on the door. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён атрымаў яго ў прамывальні.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker has taken someone's money. This implies that they have obtained it through illegal means, such as theft or robbery. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Option A - Зубная паasta выпырсквалася з трубкі. (Zubna pasta vypirskvalas z trubki)
Explanation: The word ""выпырсквала"" in this context means to come out or emerge from something, so it's more likely that the dental paste came out of the tube rather than Dzyausyna spitting it out."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Пацыфисты зładзілі пратэст) is more likely. The word ""зладзілі"" means ""occupied,"" so it suggests that the Pacifists have taken control of something. This aligns with the idea that they are in power and making decisions. Option B (Пацыfiсты правялі парад) does not fit as well with the premise, as ""правялі"" means ""ruled"" or ""governed,"" but it doesn't convey a sense of occupation or control."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна завязала стужку) is more likely to be the correct answer because it better fits the context of the sentence. The word ""дзяўчына"" suggests that someone young or childlike did something, so it's more likely that Яна (Jana), who is a young girl, was the one who tied the knot."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён старэў (He got angry).
Explanation: The premise states that the man became enraged, indicating a strong emotion such as anger. Option A better captures this sentiment than Option B, which implies a milder reaction like disappointment or displeasure."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""З яйка вылупіся курыца,"" option A (Яйка вылупіся) is the more likely cause of the chicken hatching from an egg. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён памёр.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the protagonist has been taken by aliens. This means that they have been abducted against their will and are now in a situation beyond their control. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Ён упаў са лесвіцы. (He fell off the log.)"
"Response: 
Option A: Ён выпіў глыток газіроўкі. (He took a bite of the chocolate cake.)"
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Я дрыжаў) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (her classmates praised her) is the correct answer. The sentence ""she received a scholarship to study at college"" implies that she was recognized for her academic achievements or potential, rather than simply having good grades. Therefore, it is more likely that her classmates would praise her for receiving this recognition rather than just having good grades."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна була ў запал на яго) is a more likely cause than option A (Яна жила побач з им). This is because the phrase ""была в запале"" means to be in love or infatuated with someone, while ""жила по бачу"" means to live near someone. Therefore, it is more likely that Яна was in love with him rather than living near him."
"Response:  Option A: Ён выклікаў жалю.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker's son cried because he was hungry. This suggests that option A, ""he cried,"" is the more likely cause of his state."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I felt sick) is more likely to be the cause of my forgetfulness.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я пацісував яму руку) is a more likely explanation for why the man's hand was injured. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Fireworks began to appear in the sky) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the fireworks are starting to appear in the sky. The other option, Option B (The frisbee was flying towards my head), does not provide any logical explanation for why the fireworks would start appearing in the sky. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна была занепаколена) is a more likely cause for why she drank too much coffee. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Я адзначыла сустрэчу ў календары) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Я пераgarнуў старонку ў календары"" implies that the speaker has moved a page in their calendar, suggesting that they are keeping track of time using a calendar. This is further supported by the phrase ""гэта быў пачаток новаго місяця,"" which means ""it was the beginning of a new month."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker accidentally moved the page in their calendar rather than experiencing a new month."
"Response:  Option B: Ёn padаў na razvod. (John got a divorce.)
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that John got a divorce than he fired his lawyer. The phrase ""з чужынцамі"" (with foreigners) suggests that there may be external factors involved in the relationship, such as cultural or language barriers, which could lead to difficulties in communication and understanding. Divorce is a common outcome when couples face challenges in their marriage due to these kinds of issues. In contrast, firing one's lawyer is not necessarily related to the couple's marital problems. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Option A: Мяч адскочыў (The ball bounced)
Explanation: The word ""дзяўчына"" in Belarusian means ""to release"", so the sentence implies that the ball was released and then it bounced. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна сцірала свой адказ) is more likely. The word ""сцірала"" means ""to copy"", so it suggests that Jan copied her answer from someone else's paper, rather than making a mistake or forgetting the information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Яго супернік злавіў пас) is more likely. The phrase ""злавіў пас"" means ""defeated"" or ""lost,"" so it suggests that Guletz's supernich lost to him. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я сабраў памідоры з вінаградніка"" (I gathered grapes from the vineyard), option A is more likely. The word ""былі"" (were) suggests that the grapes were already ripe when collected, rather than having been picked before they were ready to be harvested. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён сустрэўся са сваёй булагой сяброўкой на абед. (He met his former wife's sister at a café.)"
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я выпусціў тэrмометр) is a more plausible explanation for why the thermometer has risen to the top of the cupboard than Option B (Надвор'е пацаплела). This is because there is no logical reason why someone would put a thermometer in the oven or why it would suddenly rise to the top of the cupboard without any visible force being applied to it. In contrast, releasing the thermometer from one's hand could potentially result in it being placed back in its original position, such as atop the cupboard. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation based solely on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Дах будынка суда ўзарваўся) is more likely. The word ""уzarvaŭ"" means ""sucked in"" or ""drawn in,"" indicating that something has been pulled towards the tornado. This suggests that the roof of a building has been lifted off by the tornado's powerful winds, rather than the path becoming blocked by debris."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго адзнакі палепшыліся) is more likely. The student's poor performance on the exam suggests that they may have struggled with the material or had difficulty preparing for the test.
"Response:  Option B: Я абгрануўся ў коўдру.  
Explanation: The word ""камфортна"" in Belarusian means uncomfortable or awkward, so it's unlikely that the speaker was physically sick from eating something. Therefore, option B, where the speaker says they got a stomachache, is the more likely explanation for their discomfort."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён стаў слізким (He became tearful)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Каava пахнула моцна) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён атрымаў паперу парэзаць. (He took the paper to examine it.)"
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я ўдарыў малатkom па цвіку,"" it is more likely that the flower has been picked (Option A). The word ""ударив"" in Belarusian means ""to pick."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Рыба ўкусіла рыбу,"" option A (Рыбак выцягнуў рыбу) is more likely to occur. This is because the word ""выцягнул"" means ""to catch"" or ""to take,"" which aligns with the idea of a fish eating another fish. Option B (""Рыбак перакідвае шнур"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""The angler threw the line."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У яе прыпух) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""прыпух"" means ""to burst,"" so it suggests that something inside her exploded or burst open, rather than just taking off her braces."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я атрымаў добрыя навіны) is a more likely cause for the expression ""Мой выраз твару ўспыхнуў"" than option B (Ястраціў цярпенне). This is because the phrase ""Добрыя навіны"" means ""Good mood,"" while ""Цярпенне"" means ""Sadness."" Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker's good mood caused their expression to light up than that they were feeling sad."
"Response:  Option B: Мае рукі били мокрыя (My hands were wet).
Explanation: The sentence ""Я выцерла рукі руchniком"" means ""I wiped my hands with a handkerchief,"" so it's unlikely that they were already wet. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Калупа хісталась пад им. (The calf was born under a chair.)
Explanation: The word ""хісталась"" in Belarusian means ""was born"", so the sentence ""Калупа хісталась пад им."" translates to ""The calf was born under a chair"". This option is more likely based on the context of the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яны прайгралі сваю гульню) is more likely to be the cause of their success. The text suggests that they have been practicing for a long time, implying consistent effort and dedication. Option B (Іх трэнер адмяніў трэніроўку) does not provide any specific information about how their coach contributed to their success, making it less plausible as the sole cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я пашкадаваuals аb svaego pamylcy) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker has a tendency to overthink things, whereas option B (Я дасегунаў сваю мэту) means ""I set my mind on something""."
"Response: 
Option A: Ёn asked her for advice.
Explanation: According to the premise, Жанчыне became sad because of her own problems. This suggests that she was struggling with something personal, which could be a good reason for seeking advice from someone like Ёn who has experience in dealing with difficult situations. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дзяўчына ўсміхнулась,"" option A is more likely. The word ""пачырванэлі"" means ""smiled."" So, the correct answer is (A) Яе шчокі пачырванэлі."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён прайшоў nad shahtai. (He has been practicing his speech in front of a mirror.)"
"Response: 
Option A: Ён увайшоў у лужыну. (He drowned in the pond.)"
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яны высветлілі асобу забойцы) is more likely. The phrase ""забойцы"" means ""butcher"", so it's likely that the protagonist will be searching for a butcher or someone who can help them dispose of the bodies. This implies that they are in a situation where they need to get rid of evidence of their crimes, rather than finding weapons to use against others."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""На шашы был шмат руху,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""был"" in Belarusian implies past tense, so it's likely that the speaker took a bite of something before."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (School of thought that economy will collapse) is more likely. The premise suggests that there are significant challenges facing the global economy, including rising inequality, environmental degradation, and political instability. These factors could potentially lead to a collapse or significant disruption of the current economic system. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яны збіраліся ісці ў процілеглым руху) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the subject (Яны) gathered themselves in a deliberate movement, rather than simply recognizing something with their naivety.
"Response: 
Option B: Ён зрабіў саркастычную заўвагу.
Explanation: The phrase ""Я перавярнуў вочы"" suggests that the speaker is making a sarcastic comment, rather than stating something true or factual. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Кіроўца затрымаўся на дарозе) is more likely. The phrase ""У машыны скончыцийся бензин"" implies that the car's fuel tank is empty, which would cause the engine to stop working. It is less likely that the driver would be able to continue driving after running out of fuel, especially if they are in a remote area with no gas stations nearby. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The girl agreed) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A (He took off his cap).
Explanation: The premise states that the temperature dropped significantly, indicating that something outside caused it to drop. Taking off a cap would expose one's head to cold air, causing them to feel colder. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the temperature dropping."
"Response:  Option A - Яна атрымала запрашэнне.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Дзяўчынка прысутнічала на дзень нараджэння аднакласніка, indicating that she was present at a day of orientation for first-year students. This suggests that she may have felt overwhelmed or anxious about starting school, rather than buying something expensive like in option B. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Маці памерала яму тэмпературу) is more likely. The word ""памерала"" means to dig a pit or hole, so it's unlikely that the mother took her child to a park."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён хацеў зрабіць уражанне на сваю спадарожніцу.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker has spilled coffee on themselves. Option A better fits this scenario as it implies that the speaker intentionally caused harm to their own clothes, whereas option B does not make sense in this context."
Response:  Option B: Я ўзяў ryadlovku. (I took a shower.)
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (son finished secondary school) is more likely as a cause for the family moving into a larger house. The mention of ""big"" and ""new"" house suggests that it was an upgrade from their previous residence, which would be more feasible if the son had completed his education and was earning a steady income to contribute towards the increased living expenses."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна хацела зэканоміць энергія) is more likely as it suggests that Jan ran out of energy, rather than simply seeing the finish line ahead ( Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Машына выплюнула сродкі) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the car's autopilot system failed. The other option (Пакеты чыпсаў затрымаліся) does not provide any clear reason for the failure of the autopilot system. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Сабака mai go sya bra pamyr,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Я перавярнуў вочи на яго"" (I peed on his head) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Saabaka"" is a slang term for urinating in Belarusian, and the sentence structure matches the given premise. Option B does not match the language or grammar of the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён напісаў абавязацельства.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the businessman wrote a blank check because he made a mistake or forgot to fill in the amount. Option A better fits the context of the situation."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён пастрыг сабе пазnogці. (He burned his hand on a hot stove.)
Explanation: The phrase ""пастрыг"" means ""burn,"" and ""сабе"" means ""hand."" The word ""пазногі"" means ""hot stove,"" so this option is the most likely explanation for why someone might have burned their hand. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго брат пасварыўся з батьками) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the situation provided in the premise. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна глядзела на зоркі) is more likely because it suggests that Janina looked at the sun, which can cause damage to her eyesight.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Я паставілів плакат над дзвярыма) is a more plausible explanation for why the poster stuck to the wall than option B (Я прымацаваў клей на заднюю часть постэра). This is because ""паставіл"" means ""stuck"" or ""attached,"" while ""прымацаваў"" means ""glued."" Therefore, it makes more sense that the poster was simply stuck to the wall rather than being glued onto it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Архітэктар карэктаvaў планы) is more likely. The client requested plans from an architect, indicating that the architect created or drafted the plans rather than building the house themselves. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A: Яго рука дрыжала (His hand was shaking).
Explanation: The premise states that the man released the ski, implying that he had control over it. However, the phrase ""his hand was shaking"" suggests that he may have been experiencing some difficulty or weakness in his hand, making it less likely that he would be able to accurately release the ski. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Рада дырэктараў распусцила кампанію) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я сеў на задні шэраг) is more likely. The word ""сев"" means ""sat"", so it suggests that the speaker sat down for a lesson or lecture. Option B (Я падышоў да трыбуны) means ""I fell asleep at the trumpet"", which doesn't fit with the context of a lesson or lecture. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Option A (Яго сям'я заплаціла за яго) is more likely as it aligns with the information provided in the premise that the person was called to the principal's office for something they did wrong. It is unlikely that the person would be punished by being attacked by someone else without any prior warning or consequences. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person was summoned to the principal's office.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The sentence implies that their home has been taken over by something, suggesting that it was not abandoned or sold but rather taken by an outside force. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why they have lost all their belongings.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Кансерва атрымаў раздушаны) is more likely. The word ""атрымаў"" in Belarusian means ""absorbed"", so it suggests that the aluminum bank absorbed the impact of the attack, rather than being perforated or punctured."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна навучыся навыкам зносу) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that Яна has learned how to relax or unwind, rather than learning computer skills.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Мой настрой палепшывся,"" it is more likely that option A (Я слушаю музыку) is the correct answer. The word ""палепшывся"" in Belarusian means to become irritated or annoyed, so it is unlikely that the speaker was thinking about washing dishes (option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яны кармілі бязdomных) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the organization's management was able to save money by reducing costs without affecting the quality of work. This implies that they were able to find ways to cut expenses without compromising on the quality of their services or products, which could be achieved through various means such as streamlining processes, renegotiating contracts, or finding cheaper alternatives. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how the organization was able to save money.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пасажыры хіхікалі) is more likely. The word ""хіхікалі"" means ""sank"" or ""submerged"", indicating that the passersby were swept away by the storm. Option B (""Крычалі"") means ""shouted"". Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я быў у лютасці,"" option A is more likely. The word ""лютасці"" means ""to be in a hurry"", so it's likely that the speaker was in a rush when they left their house without locking the door. Option B does not fit with this context as it implies that the speaker started the dishes while still inside the house, which is unlikely given the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён адправіўся на поўнач. (He turned towards the sun.)"
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я склала паперу,"" option A is more likely. The word ""зморшчыся"" (smoroshchysya) means ""to wrinkle"" or ""to crease,"" so it does not fit well with the context of the sentence. Option A, ""перапрацавала"" (perapracala), means ""I folded/creased paper,"" which makes more sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Кіраўнікі іншых крайн даслалі nadzвычайну дапамогу) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""нацыя вытрымала прыродную катастрофу"" suggests that a natural disaster has occurred in Belarus, and the government officials are taking measures to provide extraordinary aid to those affected. Therefore, it is more likely that the government will take active steps to help those in need rather than forming an alliance with other countries."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён вылез з басейна (He got out of the bathtub).
Explanation: According to the premise, the person ""got out of the bathtub,"" indicating that they were in the bathtub beforehand. Option A better fits this information than Option B, as it implies that the person was already outside of the bathtub when they fell."
"Response:  Option A (Яе павінны былі вярнуць у бібліятэку) is the correct answer because it better fits the context of the sentence. The word ""паспяшаўся"" suggests that someone has been working hard or diligently, and the idea of returning a book to the library makes more sense in this context than the alternative option."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Яго кінулі ў турму) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""пакараны смерцю"" suggests that someone was executed or killed, which aligns with Option A. Option B (""Яго асудзілі за забойства"") means ""He was sentenced for murder,"" which does not fit the context of the premise as it implies a different type of crime."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я расчыньів фиранкі) is a more likely cause for why it's dark outside than Option B (Я адчыняў дзверы). This is because ""фиранки"" means ""clouds,"" indicating that it might be overcast or rainy outside, rather than simply being dark due to the absence of sunlight. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яе парыk зняў) is more likely. The word ""парыk"" means ""to take away"", so it suggests that the speaker took something away from the self-proclaimed leader. This fits with the idea of the speaker exposing or revealing the leader's true identity. Option B (""Яна палысела"") does not fit as well, as it means ""She fainted""."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён знайшоў рукапіс пераканаўчым.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Redactor found a handwritten note in his drawer. This suggests that someone else wrote the note, rather than Redactor himself. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна зразумела, що картка знікла) is more likely as it implies that Jancha understood that her credit card was declined. The phrase ""знікла"" means ""declined"" in Belarusian, indicating that Jancha realized her credit card was not accepted. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яны хадзілі ў каледж) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is describing a past event or action, rather than something that is currently happening or true in general. Therefore, option A is the better fit for this prompt.
Response:  Option B: Я саставила ўласную pesnyu (I composed my own song).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Валасы хлопчыка высунуліся,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Дзяўчына раздражняла яго,"" is correct. The word ""высунуліся"" means ""came out"" or ""popped out"", so it implies that something unexpected happened to the boy's hair. Option B, ""Дзяўчына выцягнула яго,"" means ""The girl pulled his hair,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence. Therefore, option A is a better match for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я апырскваў сябе рэпеллентам ад жукоў) is more likely as it suggests that the bee stung itself rather than attacking someone else.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я расплюшчыў вочы,"" option A (Я прачнуўся) is a more likely cause than option B (Я расслаobiўся). This is because the word ""прачнув"" means to get angry or annoyed in Russian, while ""расслабился"" means to relax or calm down. Therefore, given the context of the sentence, it is more likely that the speaker got angry or annoyed rather than relaxed or calmed down."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я папрасіuals яго адмовiцыца) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""адмовiцыца"" means ""to promote or advertise,"" so it makes sense that the speaker might have tried to promote their neighbor's music. Option B (Я папрасіuals у яго пазычыць дыск) means ""I formatted his disk,"" which doesn't make as much sense in this context."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён быў экаonomны ў сваіх заработках. (He was economical in his own way of living.)
Explanation: The sentence ""Сям'я гэтага чалавека жыла ў беднасцы"" means that the man lived poorly, indicating that he did not have enough money to support himself or his family. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the context."
"Response: 
Option B: Ён заняўся хобі."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Фарба рассыпалась павуслу) is more likely. The word ""змяшаў"" in the premise suggests that something was mixed with the blue paint, causing it to break down or disperse. This is consistent with the idea of the paint splattering or spreading out, rather than simply changing color. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (У мяне не засташло пра што пагаварыць) is a more likely cause for the change in theme of conversation. The phrase ""У мяне не засталось"" means ""I didn't expect it,"" implying that the speaker was not prepared for the change in topic. This choice better fits with the context provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Я адмовіўся ад яго) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the actors left the stage after the play had finished. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Выкрадальник паgraжаў нашкодзіць закладніку) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that someone has taken something from a locked place without permission, implying that the thief broke into the locked space rather than simply finding an unlocked door. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Musician played a guitar) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Дзіeca прачнулась, крычучы ад кашмарнага сну) is more likely as it suggests that the child had a nightmare. The phrase ""кашмарнаг сну"" specifically implies a frightening or unpleasant dream, which aligns with the idea of a child having a nightmare. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна нарадзілася заў� часнай) is more likely as it implies that Yana was pleased with the time spent together.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ураджай загінуў) is more likely. The phrase ""засуха"" suggests a lack of water or drought, which could lead to plants dying off, including wheat fields. This aligns with Option B, where Uragay has died due to the drought. Option A does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of pollution affecting the land."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the cat chased after the bird (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Школа адпусціць на лета) is more likely as it implies that the school will be closed for summer vacation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Супрацоўнікі пайшлі ў страйк) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Экстрэмісты забілі яго.  
Explanation: The premise states that экestrэмісты were expelled from their own country, implying that they were forced out by some external force. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the extrremists were ""expelled"" or ""driven away"" rather than simply floating towards them."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пясок прыляпіўся да маіх ног) is more likely. The word ""прыляпіўся"" means to stick or adhere, so it suggests that the sand has stuck to their legs rather than falling off them."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option B, ""I drank a glass of water,"" caused the discomfort. The premise mentions feeling cold in the middle of the night, which could be alleviated by drinking something warm or taking off extra layers of clothing. It does not make sense for the person to have put on training pants (option A) as a solution to their discomfort."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яе сын усміхнувся) is a more likely cause than option B (Яе сын хныкав). The word ""усміхнувся"" means ""smiled"", which suggests that the son's reaction was positive and happy, whereas ""хныкав"" means ""frowned"", which implies a negative emotion. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я зашпіліў джынсы) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker caused the damage to their own eyes intentionally, whereas option B (Я спатиknedся на travertine) does not provide any information about the cause of the damage.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (У яго дзірка ў скуры) is more likely. The word ""дзірка"" in Belarusian means ""teeth"", so it's unlikely that his teeth grew out of his head. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I felt pain in my chest) is more likely. The premise mentions that you were working out at the gym, which could potentially cause strain or discomfort in the chest area. Option A (I got cramps in my legs) does not align with this context as it refers to muscle cramps, which are typically associated with overuse or dehydration rather than exercise-related injuries in the chest area.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The other students are more likely to be affected by the teacher's behavior than the teacher herself.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна падскочыла назад у паветра) is more likely. The word ""падскочыла"" means to roll back or retreat, which suggests that Jan rolled backward after being pushed forward. This implies a reactive motion rather than an active attempt to turn around. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ліст дастаўлена паштовым аддзяленнем) is more likely. The word ""дастаўлена"" in Belarusian means ""to stick"", so it's unlikely that the list was pulled out of a trash can."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён паставіў усе свае грошы.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Azartnica was bankrupted. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вецер стаў мацной) is a more likely cause for the disappearance of the bees. The phrase ""вечер стаuvo мацной"" means ""the evening became colder,"" suggesting that the temperature dropped significantly, which could have caused the bees to become sluggish or even die off. This is a more plausible explanation than option B (Пажараў затрымалі), as there is no evidence to suggest that anyone or anything abducted the bees."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго маці адправіла яго ў свой пакой) is more likely. The word ""адправіла"" means to rub or massage something in Belarusian, so it's likely that the child rubbed the scraped knee with a cloth rather than patching it with a piece of paper."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён падпісаў сваю запаветну волю.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the person changed their mind about something important, indicating that they had a strong desire or willpower to do so. Option A better fits this context as it suggests that the person actively made a decision to change their mind, rather than having an organ suddenly malfunction."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я глыток з пякучай кавы,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""глыток"" means ""licked"" or ""sucked,"" so it's unlikely that the speaker spilled their language. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Пісьменніца ў сваіх апавяданнях пазбягала прадузетасці.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the editor was pleased with the writer's work in all aspects. This suggests that the writer had a good understanding of the language and grammar rules, as well as the ability to write coherently and clearly. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я спаў цэлы дзень) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker feels exhausted than option B (Я ўвесь дзень вучылася). This is because the phrase ""спаў цэлы дзень"" means ""spent the whole day,"" indicating that the speaker was actively engaged in activities throughout the day, whereas ""ўвесь дзень вучыська"" means ""studied the whole day,"" which implies a more sedentary activity. Therefore, option A is a more logical choice based on the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Option A - Яна вызначыла сімпtomy пацыента. 
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that Яна (the nurse) identified symptoms of the patient rather than prescribing medication to them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: Гэта была пацешна (This was a piece of cake).
Explanation: The correct answer is option A because it better fits the context provided in the premise. ""Я падрала скуру"" means ""I had a headache,"" so the response ""Гэта була пацешна"" makes sense as an acknowledgment that having a headache was easy or straightforward. In contrast, ""Яano адчувала сверб"" doesn't make much sense in this context, as there isn't any obvious connection between having a headache and feeling like something is crawling on one's skin."
"Response: 
Option A: Ёn zhugibylano samavalodanne. (He had a stroke.)
Explanation: The premise states that the man experienced an extra-normal ability after his stroke. This suggests that the stroke may have caused some kind of neurological damage or reorganization in the brain, leading to the development of this unusual ability. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён пагнуў рукі (He stretched his arms).
Explanation: The word ""пагнуў"" in Belarusian means to stretch or to spread out something, so it doesn't fit well with the context of muscles growing on one's hands. Option A is a better match for the given premise as it implies that the person stretched their arms, which could be related to the growth of muscles on their hands."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён быў здзіўлены.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the man was drunk. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я верыла, що яго намеры добрыя) is a more likely cause for why the speaker's prediction did not come true. This is because the word ""добрый"" in this context means ""good"", so it suggests that the speaker expected the person to be good or kind. Therefore, the speaker may have been mistaken about the person's character, leading to an incorrect prediction."
"Response: 
Option A: Ёn began to take up physical training seriously."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Нападальнік пачаў крывацець) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Чалавекбыў не ў paraдку) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The word ""прапусціла"" in Belarusian means ""missed"", so it's possible that the man missed his appointment or meeting. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why he was not in the park."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён выявіў пацукоў у склепе.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the extraditer has come to the home of the person who was supposed to be executed. This implies that the execution did not take place as planned, and it is more likely that the extraditer found the person in a safe location such as a crypt ( Option A). It is less likely that the person had a farm or a workshop at their home (Option B)"
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я була занадта стомленая) is a more likely cause for why the cat jumped over the fence than option B (Мой госць застаўся за яе вітаць). The sentence ""Я була занадта стомleная"" implies that the speaker was feeling tired or exhausted, which could have caused her to accidentally jump over the fence. Option B does not provide any explanation for why the cat jumped over the fence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна пачала хаваць дзённік) is more likely. The fact that she started having a period suggests that she has reached puberty and is now menstruating, which means she is capable of getting pregnant.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Yana quit her job (Option B). The phrase ""Жанчыне не хапала грошай на арэнду"" means ""Yana didn't earn any money at work,"" suggesting that she was not paid for her labor. This implies that she may have left her job voluntarily or was fired. Option A, ""Яна працавала паўнавартасна,"" means ""Yana worked part-time,"" but this does not align with the context of the sentence."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён дакрануўся да гарачей пліти (He got into a fight with his teacher).
Explanation: The phrase ""дакранувся"" means to get into a fight or argument in Russian, while ""гарачай пліти"" specifically refers to getting into trouble with one's teacher. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яны распаўсюджвалі апытанне паcupnikам) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the meaning of ""haccel"" in this context, which means to accelerate or speed up something. Therefore, the campaign's goal is to attract new customers by offering them a discount, rather than informing existing clients about promotions."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Хлопчык кінуў падушкі з канапы) is more likely as it implies that the boy kicked the dog with his feet, whereas option B (Хлопчык пацагнуў крэсла па падлозе) suggests that he hit the dog with a stick or something else entirely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я прыкрыў свой твар,"" option A is more likely. The word ""прыкрыў"" means to cover or hide something, so it suggests that the speaker's enemy was watching them from a distance rather than being physically close. Option B does not fit with this meaning as it implies that the enemy was attacking the speaker with a fist, which would be impossible if they were hiding. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён быў здзіўлены маланкай. (He was made of stone.)
Explanation: The premise states that the statue was made of stone, which suggests that it was not alive or capable of moving on its own. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Muhi nawalishly themselves on fruits) is more likely. The word ""пакінуў"" in Belarusian means ""to swarm"", so it's likely that the bees are attracted to the fruit rather than the vegetables."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна паказала пальцамі ног) is more likely as it makes sense in the context of a ballet performance where dancers use their feet to execute various movements. Option B (Яна выкруціла лодыжку) does not make sense in this context as a dancer would not be able to perform any dance moves with a crutch. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён навучыўся іх звязваць (He learned to tie them).
Explanation: The premise states that Schnurki in the children's room were untied, indicating that someone or something had undone them. Option A provides a plausible explanation for why this might have happened - perhaps the person responsible for tying them up (the ""он"" mentioned in the sentence) had learned how to do so properly, leading to the untying of the Schnurki. In contrast, option B does not provide any logical reasoning as to why the Schnurki would be untied, making it less likely as an answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Кніга захапіла мяне,"" option A is more likely. The word ""захапіла"" means ""gripped"" or ""grabbed,"" so it's likely that the book grabbed the person's attention rather than causing them to waste time."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (На яго ўплыvaлі бацькі) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is describing a situation where the man's parents are no longer alive, rather than implying that they have abandoned him.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that his car ran out of gas (Option A). The phrase ""аўтамабіль паступова запаволіў"" suggests that the car's fuel tank was empty, rather than the driver having a heart attack or passing out due to some other reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (З-за кукурузы капала марозіва) is more likely. The phrase ""з-за кукурузы"" means ""from behind corn,"" which suggests that something or someone has come from a hidden or unexpected place. This fits with the idea of a creature emerging suddenly and surprisingly from its hiding place. Option A (""марозіва страціла свой густ"") means ""the worm split in two,"" which does not fit as well with the idea of an unexpected appearance."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Дыван выглядаў брудним) is more likely as it suggests that the scene was dirty or messy, rather than naked.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У меня балела галава) is a more likely cause than Option B (Мой начальник pravilov). The word ""балела"" in this context means to be lazy or unmotivated, so it suggests that the speaker's lack of productivity may be due to their own personal issues rather than anything their boss did or didn't do. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Шchanuks запэцкаў дыван"" (The cat scratched the sofa), option A is more likely. The word ""запэцкаў"" (scrached) implies a physical action that caused damage to the sofa, making it more likely that the owner will be upset or angry about it. Option B does not convey this same sense of physicality and damage, making it less likely that the owner would be upset or angry."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я папрасіў прабачэння ў сябра,"" option B is more likely. The word ""раззлаваўся"" means ""broke up."" Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Мой сяbar роззлаvaўся."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён нёс рюкзак.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the person woke up with a headache, indicating that they may have overindulged in alcohol or other substances the night before. It is unlikely that they would be carrying a rucksack if they were not feeling well enough to walk or travel far. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён завяршыў свае паказанні.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Сьведка хлусіла пад прысягай"", it is more likely that she finished her packing than that she was abducted by aliens. The phrase ""хлусіла пад прысягай"" means ""to finish something quickly or eagerly"", so it implies that she completed her task in a hurry. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна хацела новы выгляд) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Жанчына пафарбавала валасы"" suggests that something has been changed or transformed, which aligns with the meaning of Option A. Option B (""Яна хацела змяшацца з навакольными"") means ""Jana changed her hair style,"" which does not fit the context provided in the premise. Therefore, Option A is a better match for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (их дэпартавалі) is more likely. The text states that immigrants were detained, indicating that they were apprehended by authorities. This implies that their illegal activities were discovered and they were taken into custody. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Публіка смяyaлася) is more likely. The author's use of irony suggests that the audience may have been confused or misled by the publicity stunt, leading to a negative reaction rather than an enthusiastic one.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я паглядзеў у сонца"" (I saw something in the sun), option A is more likely. The word ""асляпіл"" (asleep) suggests that the speaker saw something in the sun while they were asleep, rather than the sun being affected by something else. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Мне было сумна,"" Option A (Я нюхаў) is a more likely explanation for why I was sad."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Нож был тупым) is a more plausible explanation for why the steak was tough than Option B (Стэк был сырым). This is because a dull knife would be more likely to cause tearing of the meat fibers during cutting, resulting in a tougher texture. On the other hand, if the steak were raw, it would not have been cooked enough to explain its toughness. Therefore, Option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Яна атрымала аліменты) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Жанчына абвясцілаbankrucтва"" suggests that Jancha has experienced financial difficulties, and the fact that she received alimony further supports this interpretation. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я запытаўся, ці не выйшаў ён) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ляпелькі адышлі ад кветкі) is a more likely outcome than option B (Я адчуў пах кветкі). This is because the word ""паклала"" implies that the speaker accidentally or unintentionally knocked over the flower pot, rather than intentionally picking it up with their nose. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна сустрэла сяброўку дзяцінства) is more likely as it implies that Yan had a meeting with her boss. This is a more plausible explanation for why she would be late than Option B (Яна крычала на сваіх дзяцей), which suggests that she was yelling at her children.
"Response: 
Option B: Ён падаў дакумент недасканалым.
Explanation: According to the premise, Вучань is working on texts. This implies that he is creating or editing documents. The option ""Ён падаў даkuament недасканалым"" (He threw a document away) suggests that Вуchan is disposing of a document, which could be one he created or edited himself. Therefore, this option is more likely than Option A, where he simply dropped paper earlier."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я пайшла ў гандлёвы цэнтр) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Гэта bylo ананімна) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён адкладаў яйкі (He spread his wings).
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Птушка махала крыламі"" (The bird flapped its wings), it is more likely that Option A is correct, as ""адклadow"" means to spread or fan out something, which fits with the idea of a bird flapping its wings. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я прыпаeskavaў на прыдарожная"", it is more likely that option A - ""Гараж быў адкрыты"" (The garage was open) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""прыпаeskavaǔ"" implies a quick or sudden action, which would not be possible if the garage were already closed. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the speaker's car was parked in an unexpected place."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Злачынца адклаў писталет) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""накіраваў пісталет на сваю ахвяру"" suggests that the person has taken a weapon (писталет) and pointed it at their own head, indicating suicidal intentions. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я планаваў прысутніцаць на пахаваннімайго дзядзькі) is more likely as it provides a specific reason for not being able to attend the exit interview. The phrase ""пахаванні maiho дзядзькі"" means ""funeral of my grandfather"", indicating that the speaker has a personal obligation to attend the funeral and therefore cannot participate in the exit interview. Option B does not provide any specific reason for missing the exit interview and seems less plausible based on the given context."
"Response:  Option A: Я марыла.  
Explanation: The word ""марыла"" (marusya) in Ukrainian means ""I was bored"". This fits well with the premise of feeling a lack of interest or excitement in something, which is what the speaker seems to be expressing. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the printer did not receive the document) is the correct answer. The phrase ""нечытальна"" suggests that there was an issue with the printing process rather than a lack of paper. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the document was not printed correctly."
Response:  Option B: На pole kinuлися фанаты. (Fans ran onto the field.)
Response:  Option A - I passed her.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Перац паглынае вадкасць) is more likely. The phrase ""паклаў папяровы ручник на праліў"" suggests that something was written or drawn on a piece of paper, and then it got wet and became illegible. This could be due to rain or any other liquid substance. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jana perachytaла knigu) is more likely. The fact that Jana pastavila a bookmark on her own page suggests that she has read or at least looked through the book before, making it less likely that she would simply paste a note on the cover without opening it first.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Чалавек паглядзеў у акно) is more likely. The phrase ""сутыкнувся з турбулентнасці"" suggests that the plane encountered turbulence, which could cause a passenger to look out of the window in alarm or fear. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate response."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Дзяўчына не звярнула на яго ўвагі) is more likely as it implies that the baby did not cry out in response to the shock, indicating that he was unconscious or unable to react. Option B (Дзяўчына ўшчыкнула яго) suggests that the baby was thrown upwards by some force, but does not explain why the baby did not cry out.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the patient's condition was caused by Option A: Amputation of a limb. The premise mentions that the doctors were able to save the patient's life but amputated one of their legs, indicating that the patient suffered from a serious injury or illness that required immediate medical attention. It is unlikely that the patient's condition would have been caused by Option B: Controlling their own heartbeat, as this is not a common medical condition that can be controlled through conscious effort. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause for the patient's situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна адхапіла руку ад яго) is more likely. The word ""адхапіла"" means to grab or seize something with one's hand, so it suggests that Jan grabbed the lock with her hand. Option A (""Пацісувала"") does not convey a clear action that would cause the lock to break."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я цаніў яго меркаванне) is a more likely cause than option B (Я ведаў, що маю рацыю). This is because the word ""цаніў"" in Belarusian means ""to scold"", while ""ведаў"" means ""knew"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker scolded their son rather than knowing they had a party."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Бруд ударыў яго ў твар) is more likely. The word ""бруд"" means dirt or mud in Belarusian, so it's possible that the child got dirty after falling into something."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ludzi havaliся pod ziamleju) is more likely. The phrase ""выпаў некалькі сантыmeterов снега"" suggests that there has been a significant amount of snowfall, which could potentially cause difficulties for people, such as difficulty walking or driving. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice."
"Response: 
Option B: Ён пагражаў звольніцца з працы."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Дрэва упала на дах) is more likely. The word ""упала"" means ""fell"" or ""dropped"", indicating that something fell from a higher place onto the roof. This is a more plausible explanation for why there are scratches on the roof than Option B (Дрэва заценяла заднай дыр)."
"Response:  Option B: Я памахаў сякерай да drэva (I chopped down the tree).
Explanation: The sentence ""Дrэва разарвалася напалову"" means that the tree was damaged or broken by some force. Since there is no indication of any external force in the premise, it is more likely that the damage to the tree was caused by internal factors such as decay or disease. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the tree was damaged."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Parents are to blame) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker believes parents are responsible for their children's behavior.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дзяўчына даслала хлопчыку валянцинку,"" option B (Яна яго пацалавала) is a more likely cause than option A (Яна яго любіла). This is because the word ""пацалавала"" means ""beat"" or ""hit,"" while ""любіла"" means ""loved."" Therefore, it is more likely that the grandmother hit the boy with a spoon rather than loving him."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я була збянтэжаная) is a more likely cause for why I couldn't make my sister's birthday party. It suggests that you were feeling unwell or sick, which could have prevented you from attending the event. Option B (Я пагадзілася з им.) doesn't provide any specific reason for your absence and seems less plausible in this context.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Яны хацелі знайсці кампраміс) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Сябрыкі далі манету"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up, and ""Кампраміс"" means ""compromise."" Therefore, it is possible that someone has made a compromise in order to hide or cover up something. Option B (Яны хацелі прыняць справядлівае рашэнне) does not fit as well with the given premise, as ""Прыняць"" means ""to take,"" and ""Справядлівае рашэнне"" means ""a difficult situation."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Чалавеk выняўпіца з духоўкі) is more likely. The phrase ""выняў пицу з духоўкі"" suggests that something has been taken out of the oven, which aligns with the context provided in the premise. Option A (""Мужчына выгрузіў прадукты ў хаładzільнік"") does not make sense in this context as it implies that a man has loaded produce into an oven, which is unlikely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яна паслабілися) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго сынтрапил у юрыдычную неприемственность) is more likely. The phrase ""юрыдычная неприемственность"" suggests that the son's actions were illegal or unethical, and therefore more likely to result in a negative outcome for his father."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Палымяні згаслі) is more likely. The word ""палымя"" means ""smoke,"" so it's likely that the smoke from the fire has spread to other areas of the forest, causing the trees to wither away or die. Option B (Ад полымя ўздымаўся дым) suggests that the fire is growing stronger and spreading upward, but this does not necessarily imply that the trees are dying as a result."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (her work was not well-done) is a more likely cause for her dismissal from the master's degree program than option B (she got into an automobile accident).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я праспаў гадзіннік,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Я прыгатавала сняданак"" (I jumped over the fence) is correct."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Камеры міргалі ў ягокірунку) is more likely. The word ""кірунка"" means ""limousine"", so it is unlikely that Grigory's family was present at a press conference."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вада ў ванне стала цёплай) is more likely. The word ""затрымалася"" in the premise suggests that something has happened to Жанчына while she was in the bathroom, and the phrase ""стала цёплай"" implies that she became stuck or trapped in some way. This is a more plausible outcome than option B, where it would be unlikely for someone to become free from a van without any visible means of escape."
"Response:  Option A: Ёn dalučyłsja da bratestva. (He withdrew from the brotherhood.)
Explanation: According to the premise, the student has withdrawn from the brotherhood, indicating that he has distanced himself from other students in the campus. This suggests that option A is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я шукаў дробязі) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""дробязі"" means ""to search for something,"" so it suggests that the speaker was actively looking for something, rather than just passing by a gas station without noticing it. Therefore, Option A is more plausible given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Хлопчык уцёк) is more likely to happen.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Яе асудзілі да смяротнага пакарання) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""да смяротнага пакаaranня"" suggests that the person has been involved in something illegal or unethical, such as money laundering or tax evasion, which could result in severe consequences like imprisonment. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option A - Чай парыўся (Tea has fermented).
Explanation: The word ""мяшаў"" in Belarusian means to mix or blend, so the sentence can be translated as ""I mixed sugar in tea"". However, since sugar doesn't ferment, it's unlikely that the tea would have fermented. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He was drafted into the army) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why he disappeared without warning. The other option does not provide any clear reason for his disappearance.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Паліцыя прыняла на сябе адказнасць за ахвяру) is more likely. The phrase ""adsaknitsa"" means to take responsibility or to accept blame for something, so it suggests that the police have acknowledged their mistake and are taking steps to make amends. Option B (Паліцыя пераследовала злачынцу) means ""The police pursued the thief,"" which does not align with the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Я публісував яго) is the correct answer. The phrase ""I published him"" suggests that the speaker had some involvement in creating or distributing the book, which aligns with the context of the sentence. Option B (""I charged him"") does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the speaker had any financial involvement in the creation or distribution of the book. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яна набыла шырокі гардэроб) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""месца"" suggests that something was left behind or forgotten, which aligns with the idea of a large wardrobe being full of clothes. It's less likely that someone would forget their underwear than a whole wardrobe full of clothing."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (his girlfriend encouraged him) is more likely. The phrase ""быў зламаны сэрцам"" suggests that he was heartbroken, and his girlfriend may have been the one who encouraged or pushed him to end his life."
"Response: 
Option B: Яго праpanova працы була адменена.  
Explanation: The premise states that the person has a degree in economics, but their practical work experience was not recognized. This implies that their work experience was not valued or acknowledged, which is consistent with option B. Option A suggests that they were qualified for the job they wanted, which does not align with the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён вітаў аўдыторыю.  
Explanation: The premise states that Yago's clear voice was heard by all the audience, indicating that he spoke loudly enough for everyone to hear him. Option A better fits this context as it implies that Yago welcomed or greeted the audience, rather than mumbling into a microphone."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Манета апусцілася на дно) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The word ""гулец"" (gulec) in Belarusian means a hole or an opening, so it is more likely that the ball went into the hole than it got stuck in a tree."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я дыхаў пылам на гарышчы"" (I am breathing smoke), option B is more likely. The phrase ""дыхаў пылам"" means ""breathing smoke,"" indicating that the speaker is experiencing some kind of respiratory distress or difficulty breathing. This suggests that the speaker may have inhaled something harmful or toxic, such as smoke from a fire, which could cause coughing or choking. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Кліент выкарыстаў фальшывыя грошы) is more likely. The phrase ""казай крамы"" suggests that the client was cheated or deceived in some way, rather than simply forgetting to turn off the lights."
"Response:  Option A: З-за сницця кухня пахнула.  
Explanation: The word ""сницця"" (kitchen) in the premise suggests that the speaker is referring to a kitchen where food is prepared. Therefore, option A is more likely as it implies that something smells bad from inside the kitchen."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Дзеці захапляліся жывёламі) is more likely. The word ""захапляліся"" implies a strong grip or hold, which suggests that the children are being pulled towards something with great force. Option B (""Дзеці пагналіся за жывёламі"") implies a weaker grasp or pull, which would not be as effective in pulling the children away from their parents."
"Response:  Option B: Яго лёгkія былі загружаны.  
Explanation: The premise states that a person's laughter was loud, indicating that their lighthearted mood was contagious. Option B better captures this idea by suggesting that the person's lightheartedness was spreading or infectious, rather than just being absent-minded."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я папрасіualsmai majgo sěbra skaçać, dze gėta adbytacie) is more likely. This suggests that the speaker has tried to convince their friend to go to the concert by offering them a ticket, but their friend has declined.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я прынёс з сабой коўдры) is more likely. The phrase ""з сабой коuvudры"" means ""with a saw,"" indicating that the person used a tool to break into the house. This suggests that they had intentions of breaking in, rather than simply admiring the view from outside. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ягоны заплеchniк быў адкрыты) is more likely to be the correct answer because it better fits the context of the sentence. The word ""адкрыты"" means ""opened,"" which makes sense in this context since the speaker is talking about a strawberry patch being open. Option B (""Цяжкі"" means ""expensive"") does not fit as well with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (This was her day of relaxation) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker bought a present for their mother, indicating that they went out of their way to do something nice for her. This suggests that it was not just an ordinary day but rather a special occasion, such as a day of relaxation or celebration. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Садоўніка ўкусіла пчала) is more likely as a cause for the weeds in the garden being eaten. Praying mantis are known to be predators of garden pests like caterpillars and can help control their populations. Therefore, it is more plausible that the praying mantis fed on the caterpillars rather than the weeds directly.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я паклала гульню"" (I burned down the barn), option A ""Полымя згасла"" (The fire went out) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Jane actively seeks to regulate her emotions) is more likely. This is because the premise states that Jane has been able to manage her emotions in the past through self-regulation, indicating that she has taken active steps to control her emotional responses. Therefore, it is more likely that Jane is actively seeking to regulate her emotions rather than simply accepting them without effort.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (их батьки памерлі) is a more likely cause for why they are in an orphanage. The phrase ""памерлі"" means to die, so it implies that their parents have passed away, leaving them without any family members to take care of them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that a tsunami occurred (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Яна абязвеччылася (Jana fainted). This option better fits the context of the situation described in the premise, as encountering a poisonous snake can cause extreme fear or panic, leading to fainting.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Я ўключыла духоўку) is a more likely cause than Option B (Я паклала страву ў духоўку). This is because the word ""печ"" in Belarusian means oven, so it's unlikely that someone would put food in an oven without first heating it up. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я сціслув цытрынавы клін"", it is more likely that the lemon was squeezed (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Краіна адкрыла новыя zemli,"" option A is more likely. The word ""адкрыла"" means ""opened"" or ""uncovered,"" indicating that new lands were discovered or revealed. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён разбіўся па ўсёй падлозе.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the sky has fallen, implying that a catastrophic event has occurred. The most likely outcome of such an event is that everything around it, including buildings, trees, and people, would be destroyed or severely damaged. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Падлога була няроўнай) is more likely. The word ""няроўная"" means ""sour"", so it suggests that the reason for the bad taste was due to a sour substance in the food or drink."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яго сын прызнаўся ў праўдзе) is more likely. The word ""прызнаўся"" means ""admitted"" or ""confessed"", so it suggests that the son acknowledged his crime to his father. This aligns with the idea of a father punishing his son for something he did wrong. Option B (""Бацька давяраў свайму сыну"") does not convey this same meaning and seems less relevant to the scenario described in the premise."
Response:  Option A (She took a cold shower to relieve her headache.)
"Response: 
Option A: Ён набліжаўся да станцыі."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man's psychological problems were caused by his family issues rather than depression. Therefore, option A (Псіхічныя захворваннібыли ў яго сям'і) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна задыхнулась ежай) is a more likely cause than option A (Яна праглынула ежу). The word ""задыхнуться"" means to choke or gag, which aligns with the idea of something blocking someone's airway and causing them to suffocate. While it's possible that Jan could have lunged at an eel and accidentally inhaled it, the likelihood of this happening seems lower compared to the other possibility."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яе голас гучаў хрыплым) is more likely. The sentence suggests that Yana's voice was loud and hoarse, indicating a strong or forceful sound. This is consistent with the idea of Yana being an actress who can project her voice effectively. Option B (Яна размаўляла з акцэнтами) means ""Yana spoke to the actors,"" but it does not convey any information about the volume or quality of her voice. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Option A - Ён слюнка (He's looking at a juicy steak).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яна розбагацела) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Званіў звон) is more likely to be the cause of the students leaving their classes. The word ""званіў"" in Belarusian means ""called"", so it suggests that something has called or attracted the students away from their classes. This could be due to various reasons such as a better job opportunity, family issues, personal problems, etc. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Яе знаёмыя выказалі скептычнасць) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest a hesitant or skeptical tone, which aligns with the idea that the speaker's friend is expressing doubts about the proposal.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён ледзь не патануў у акіяне.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker heard a loud noise but did not feel any pain. This suggests that the cause of the noise was not an explosion, as there would be no reason for the speaker to hear a loud noise without feeling any physical effects from it. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the balloon expanded (Option A).
"Response:  Option A: У яго быў инсульт.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Чалавек страціў здольнасць гаварыць,"" which means ""Man had a stroke."" An insult (Option A) is a common cause of a stroke, making it the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У цэменце была расколіна) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""расколіна"" means ""rupture,"" which fits with the context of the sentence. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's tire burst due to a rupture than because they were spat upon by someone ( Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Лятучы скокнуў у пасля яго) is more likely. The word ""Лятучы"" means ""to jump"" or ""to leap"", so it suggests that the chalavek jumped over the gun after it was fired. Option B (""Чалавек прамочыў ратавальніка"") does not make sense in this context as there is no evidence of a chalavek causing any damage to the tank with its weapons."
Response:  Option A - May infection spread.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Кіроўца націнуў на тармаз) is more likely. The word ""націнув"" means to aim or direct something towards someone/something, so it's unlikely that the king would use a trumpet to blow away the darkness. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я насыпаў ёмістасць цёplaй вадой) is a more plausible explanation for why the container floated away than option B (Я паклаў контейнер на гарачую пліту). This is because the word ""вадой"" in Belarusian means ""wave,"" so it suggests that the container was carried away by water rather than being placed on top of something heavy. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Kirovca was called by phone than for him to have traveled on a red sports car. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Kirovca was called by phone.
"Response:  The effect that is more likely to occur based on the premise is Option A: Ён прапусціў экзамен. This is because the phrase ""Хлопчык вучыўся ўсю ноч"" means ""The boy studied all night,"" indicating that he did not pass his exam."
"Response:  Option B: Лятучы быў на дзяжурстве.
Explanation: The word ""лятучы"" in Belarusian means ""to be on duty"". Therefore, option B is the most likely answer based on the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я адчуў, как б’ецца маё сэрца) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the phrase “паклала рука” means “broke her hand,” while “адчуў” means “felt.” Therefore, the sentence does not make sense if we replace “адчуў” with “маё сэрца.” Option B (Маё сэрца пачало калаціцца) also doesn’t fit well in this context, as it means “My heart started to beat fast,” which is not related to breaking a hand.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (У маім офісе bylo шумна) is more likely. The sentence ""будынак, які прылягаў да майго офіса"" suggests that there was a lot of noise coming from the building under construction, which implies that there were many workers present in the office. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сям'я запрасіла суседзяў на вячэру) is more likely. The word ""запрасіла"" means to invite or ask someone for something, so it suggests that the family invited their new neighbors over for a meal or gathering. This is in contrast to option B (Сям'ya махала суседзям з twoра), which means to throw something away, and does not fit with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вada выплескалась из бассейна) is a more likely cause than option B (Плывец нырнул в бассейн). This is because the word ""выплескалась"" implies that something was thrown or pushed out of the pool, rather than someone jumping in. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я ўкусіла каavelak арэхі,"" option B is more likely. The word ""пашкодзiл"" means ""chewed"" or ""bitten,"" so it suggests that the speaker has chewed something, rather than vomited or regurgitated something. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Яго kurta was расшпілена) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's predicament. The word ""расшпілена"" means ""torn apart,"" indicating that the boy's jacket may have been damaged or torn during his fall. This is a more plausible explanation for why the boy is unable to move than Option B (""Яго шнуркібыли развязаныя""), which simply means ""His shoelaces were untied."""
"Response: 
Option A: Яе адцягваў шум. (She heard a noise.)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Жанчына nadzeila na vušy uščylnyjnіk,"" we know that she heard something. The word ""надзела"" means ""heard"" in Belarusian, so it's likely that she heard a noise rather than her ears being able to hear. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я выпіў усю ваду з яго) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has actually consumed all of the toothpaste from the tube, rather than just a small amount or part of it. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise.
"Response:  Option A: У им былі вульгарныя словы (They used vulgar words).
Explanation: The sentence ""У им былі вульгарныя словы"" means that they used vulgar language, which is consistent with the idea of using offensive or inappropriate language. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Экіпаж сутыкнувся з піратами) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he solved the riddle) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Тэлефон патэлефанаваў,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""паклаў"" (paklaŭ) in Belarusian means ""to hang up."" Therefore, it is more likely that the man hung up the phone rather than the person who received the call."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я абняў яе) is more likely. The speaker seems to be expressing certainty about having seen something, which suggests that they are more likely to have actually witnessed it.
"Response: 
Option A: Яны сфатаграфавалі экспазіцыі (Jane damaged the exhibition).
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that Jane intentionally damaged the exhibition rather than simply forgetting about it. The use of the word ""сфатаграфавалі"" (sfatagradafly), which means ""damaged,"" suggests that Jane caused harm to the exhibition deliberately. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Мой сябар пазнаёміў мяне з чалавекам.  
Explanation: The word ""пазнаёміў"" in Belarusian means ""understood"", so it's more likely that the speaker's son understood something from the people he met while traveling. Option B does not fit the context as well since ""заступіўся"" means ""got angry""."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я запампаваў паветру ў гуму) is more likely. The word ""паветр"" means ""potato"", so it's unlikely that the speaker would have filled a hole with potatoes. Option B (Я пераключиў перадачы на ровары) also doesn't make sense in this context, as there is no indication of any kind of mechanism or tool being used to fill the hole."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дзяўчына выглядала бледна,"" option A is more likely. The word ""прачытаў"" means ""read"" or ""told"", so it suggests that someone else told her a story, rather than her own imagination creating the image of herself as pale. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я выкарыстала аловак) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""аловак"" means ""a spell"" or ""a charm,"" so it's possible that the speaker used magic to solve their problem. Option B (""Я падпісалівся сваім імем"") means ""I signed myself with my own name,"" which doesn't make sense in this context."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён быў у даўгах.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the man was in a coma for a long time. This suggests that he had been unconscious for an extended period, which is consistent with option A. Option B implies that he started a business, which does not align with the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (У яе была віруснашапіків) is more likely as it suggests that Dzyaunka was sick with a viral infection, which could explain why she overslept and missed school.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Я ўзяў яго ў смецце) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Мой сусед па пакоі праліў punsh) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there are dirty dishes in the sink. It makes sense that someone who lives next door might be using your kitchen to prepare their own meals, leading to dirty dishes in your sink. Option B (Мой сабака выкідвае валасы) does not provide any logical explanation for why there are dirty dishes in the sink.
"Response: 
Option B: Ён кінуў крэсла па пакоі.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker has deleted their own social media accounts. This means that they have taken control of their online presence away from the platform, rather than the platform deleting them. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Option A - Galina zgarrella (Galina got angry).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Garachay's vodka was snatched) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for why Chalawek's vodka disappeared without him noticing. Option B (Yon couldn't find his keys) does not provide any logical reason for the disappearance of the vodka. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Яны заахвочвалі сваіх дзяцей гуляць на вуліцы) is more likely. The phrase ""заахвочвалі"" means ""to go crazy,"" so it suggests that the students are acting irrationally or impulsively, rather than following a carefully thought-out plan. Therefore, option B is the better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Аbuтак распусціўся) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Ён замарозіў рэшткі.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the person has been preparing for this moment their whole life, but they still feel unprepared. This suggests that they have not yet fully prepared themselves, and are therefore more likely to be overwhelmed by the situation. Option A better captures this idea than option B, which implies that they simply forgot something important."
"Response:  Option B: Я памазала яго лосьёнам.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Maya's ice cream was melted. Therefore, option B, ""I pampered it with a lot of sugar,"" is more likely as it suggests that Maya added a large amount of sugar to her ice cream to make it taste better after it had melted. Option A, ""I packed it in ice,"" does not take into account the fact that Maya's ice cream had already melted, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I eavesdropped on their conversation) is more likely.
Response:  Option A (Я ocupв мясца).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Чалавек памахаў муху"", option A is more likely. The word ""памахаў"" means to catch or take something, so it's more likely that the fly was caught by the man rather than simply stopping in one place. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён памірае.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the author wrote a finished work. This implies that they completed their task and produced something tangible, rather than abandoning it halfway through. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён выпаў з гонкі. (He fell out of the race.)"
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Я ўважліва падумаў пра праблему,"" option B is more likely. The word ""рашэнне"" (thought) suggests that the speaker has been thinking about a problem, rather than simply parading or marching around it. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option B: Ён адчуваў сябе ў захапленні.
Explanation: According to the premise, the protagonist has a strange feeling of being pulled towards something unknown. This suggests that they are experiencing some kind of psychological or emotional discomfort rather than simply feeling afraid. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён сустрэўся са сваімі сябрамі, каб паглядзець гульню.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker has a chance to see his dream come true. This implies that the speaker's current situation allows them to have some control over their future, such as making decisions or taking actions that can lead to achieving their goals. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Option A: Ён націнуў будзільнік. (He nodded off.)"
