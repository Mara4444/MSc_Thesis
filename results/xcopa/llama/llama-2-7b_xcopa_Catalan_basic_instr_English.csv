Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Va aixecar la mà) will occur. The student knew the answer to the question, so he raised his hand to indicate this. Therefore, Option B (Ha fet una estupidesa) is less likely to happen.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Els ulls de l'home van llorar"", option A is more likely. The phrase ""van llorar"" suggests that something emotional or intense happened to the eyes, rather than a physical injury like Option B. Therefore, it is more likely that the eyes became irritated or inflamed due to an emotional reason rather than a physical one."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (El seu oponent la va acusar d'enganyar) is correct. The reason for this is that the text states ""va guanyar cinc partits seguits,"" indicating a streak of victories, which could be seen as suspicious or impressive enough to warrant an accusation of cheating from the opponent."

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (He perdut la veu) is the correct answer. The premise states ""Vaig fer una pausa per deixar de parlar,"" indicating that the speaker intentionally stopped speaking, rather than losing their voice or experiencing some other unintentional event. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker did not speak after taking a break."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Es va fer mal al genoll) is more likely. The premise states that the woman hit the sofa, which could potentially cause injury to her leg or knee if she were to strike it with sufficient force.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""El noi va apertar el globus,"" it is more likely that option A, ""El globus va esclatar,"" will occur. This is because opening a hot air balloon can cause it to inflate and potentially lead to an explosion if not handled properly. Option B, ""El globus va volar,"" does not align with the premise as a hot air balloon cannot fly without proper lift sources such as wind or engines."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they went to the airport (Option B).

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Em vaig vessar vi a la camisa,"" it is more likely that option B, ""M'he canviat de camisa,"" is correct.

"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: The crowd gave him money.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the street musician attracted a large crowd, which suggests that people were interested in his performance and wanted to show their appreciation by giving him money. It does not suggest that he made the crowd leave or move away."

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (El tren va arribar a l'estació) is more likely because it directly follows from the information provided in the premise that ""Els passatgers van baixar del tren."" If the train had arrived at the station, then the passengers would have gotten off the train."

"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she was acomiadated from her job.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the accountant ""va mal administrar els fons de l'empresa,"" which implies that she made mistakes or poor decisions in her work as an accountant.

In contrast, going on maternity leave is typically a temporary absence for personal reasons unrelated to professional performance. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vaig mirar el rellotge"", option B is more likely. The correct answer is (B) Want to check the time."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La meva mà s'ha encrencat,"" option B is the most likely cause. The sentence suggests that both the speaker and their partner are holding hands, so it is unlikely that the speaker wrote the essay by themselves (option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El perno es va apretar,"" option A is the most likely cause: He has changed the nut."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the couple moved into the apartment) is true. The fact that they signed a rental agreement suggests that they intended to occupy the apartment, and there is no indication in the premise that the city would condemn the building.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Volia veure la posta de sol) is more likely. The woman wanted to see the sunset, not think she had seen a lightning bolt.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Va tenir una mala nota) is the correct answer.

This contrast between expectation and reality aligns better with Option A than Option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El césped estaba fangós,"" Option B (Estaba ple de males herbes) is the more likely cause. The word ""fangós"" suggests that there is a thick layer of dirt or mud on the lawn, which could be caused by the presence of weeds. Therefore, option B is the better answer."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Es va seure a l'ombra) is the more likely cause because it suggests that the man sought shade to avoid the sun's rays, rather than going to the beach where he would be exposed to direct sunlight.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Els investigadors van retractar la teoria) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the team entered extra time) is more likely as it suggests that the game went into overtime, which means that there was still a chance for the team to score and win the match. The other option does not make sense in this context since an árbitre taking a bad decision would have resulted in a different outcome of the game.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""He introduced the combination to the door,"" option A (He tancat la porta) is the most likely outcome. The premise suggests that someone has introduced a code or combination to unlock the door, which means that the door was previously locked and now it is open. Therefore, option B (The door has opened) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (El pare va agafar la mà del seu fill) is more likely because it aligns with the meaning of ""intensificar"" in the context of a crowd becoming more intense or violent."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Vaig espatllar la neu del camí) is more likely. The premise states that the snow was blocking the path, indicating that there was a physical obstruction preventing progress. Therefore, it is more likely that the character would try to remove the snow rather than gathering it into a ball of snow.
"Response:  Option B - El caiac va caure en una onada.  
Explanation: The premise states that the kayakers are paddling their kayaks, indicating that they are in control of their vessels. Therefore, it is less likely that the kayak would fall into an onwave, as the paddlers would be able to avoid such an occurrence. On the other hand, option A does not provide any information that would suggest the kayak arrived at the coast, making it equally unlikely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she lost control of her bike due to Option A - She let go of the handlebars. This option aligns with the given information as letting go of the handlebars can cause a rider to lose balance and control over their vehicle. In contrast, Option B - She crashed into a fence does not align with the premise as there is no indication in the statement that she collided with any obstacle or structure.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""He turned on the fan,"" option B is more likely. The sentence suggests that something cool or refreshing was blowing on the speaker, which is consistent with turning on a fan to create a breeze.

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they saw a shark (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (L'aigua va sortir de la banyera) is more likely. The premise states that he turned on the drainage tap in the bathtub, which would cause water to flow out of the bathtub rather than spreading onto the floor. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Vaig cridar el seu nom) caused my friend to turn his head in my direction.  
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the citizens rebelled) is more likely. The premise states that ""El govern oprimeix als seus ciutadans,"" which implies that there is a high level of oppression or control by the government over its citizens. This could lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and even violence among the population, resulting in a rebellion or uprising against the government. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he cried for help than he set up a tent. The reason being that crying for help is a more immediate response to getting lost in the woods compared to setting up a tent, which would require some time and effort to prepare.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Volia aprendre a dibuixar) is more likely. The premise mentions that the woman went abroad to learn something new, but does not provide any information about cultural exchange or learning about other cultures. Therefore, it is more likely that she went to improve her drawing skills rather than to learn about other cultures.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (El seu company de feina va ser ascendit) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker's jealousy was caused by their colleague's success or promotion rather than their work hours.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man was hallucinating rather than meditating. The fact that he saw alien beings suggests that his experience was not based in reality, but rather a product of his imagination or a psychological phenomenon. Therefore, option A (he was hallucinating) is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Li va posar blanquejador) is more likely as it suggests that the man used a hair whitener to lighten his beard, rather than using shampoo or any other product.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Va sentir un cop d'inspiració) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El fill es va allunyar de casa,"" option B (Anava a la universitat) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the books were covered in dust) is more likely. The premise states that ""els llibres van caure,"" indicating a sudden and unexpected fall or collapse of the books. This could be caused by the accumulation of dust or dirt on their covers, making them slippery and prone to falling. On the other hand, an earthquake (option B) would not typically cause books to simply fall off shelves without any visible damage or disturbance to the surrounding area. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the books fell from the library shelf."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La llum de la meva casa s'ha apagat."", option B is more likely. The sentence implies that there has been a power outage or a problem with the electrical circuit, rather than someone turning on a light. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vam anar en la muntanya russa"", it is more likely that option A (semblava espantós) is correct. The phrase ""anar en la muntanya russa"" means to go down a steep mountain slope, and the word ""espantós"" means frightening or scary. Therefore, the sentence suggests that the experience of going down the mountain was frightening or scary."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La bossa de palometes va començar a saltar,"" option A is more likely. The premise suggests that something unexpected and unusual happened to the bag of marbles, causing them to start jumping.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Va offend the public) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Em vaig picar amb l'espina,"" option B is the correct answer because a gota de sang (blood) is more likely to occur than una gota de sudor (sweat)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El peix va flotejar a la superfície del tanc,"" it is more likely that the fish was dead (Option B). The phrase ""flotjar"" means to float, but in this context, it implies that the fish has risen from the water to the surface of the tank, indicating death rather than hunger or movement."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La veu de l'home sonava rau,"" option A (Tenia un refredat) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The premise states that ""les portes de l'ascensor s'han obert,"" indicating that the elevator doors have opened. However, if the elevator had reached the designated floor, it would not be able to open its doors again until it has completed its descent back down to the lobby. Therefore, it is more likely that the elevator became stuck between floors rather than reaching the desired floor."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'home va veure el seu reflex,"" option A (Es va quedar sota l'arbre) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (La vaig trucar) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (their dog escaped from home) is the correct answer. The family is searching for something in their neighborhood, indicating that they are looking for an external location rather than a missing item within their own home. Additionally, the mention of ""cercant"" (searching) suggests that the family is actively trying to locate something or someone outside of their residence, further supporting Option A as the most likely explanation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (The time was cold) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions ""when I exhaled,"" which implies that the event occurred while the speaker was breathing out, suggesting a physical sensation related to temperature. In contrast, Option B (My chest felt tight) does not provide any information about the timing or context of the sensation, making it less likely as an explanation for the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the employees formed a union to demand better working conditions) is more likely.

Therefore, the most likely cause is that the water in the pot boiled or heated up, resulting in the formation of steam."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vaig portar sandàlies) is more likely. The sentence ""Tots els meus mitjons estaven a la bugaderia"" implies that the speaker has left their socks at the dry cleaner's, which would be easier to do with sandals than with boots."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Va perdre el suport dels votants) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B: The couple fled is the correct answer. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""tothom desaprovaba el compromís de la parella,"" indicating that there was opposition to their relationship from others. This could lead to a situation where the couple feels unsafe or unsupported in their relationship, potentially leading them to flee for safety reasons. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (L'assistant de vendes va veure la noia posar mercaderia a la bossa) is more likely to be the correct cause. The assistant of sales saw the girl putting merchandise in her bag, which suggests that they may have witnessed her stealing.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Els soldats van ser enviats a lluitar. The country declaring war means that there will be military action involved, and soldiers are likely to be sent to fight in another territory. This option aligns better with the context provided than Option B, where soldiers would be reunited with their families, which does not necessarily involve military action.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Es va desencadenar un motí davant del tribunal) is more likely. The sentence implies that there was a reaction to the court's decision, and a mob forming outside the courthouse is a common occurrence in situations where people are unhappy with a verdict. Option B (Una parella va intercanviar els seus vots davant del tribunal) does not fit the context as well, as it suggests a couple switching votes within the courtroom, which is unlikely given the seriousness of the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La noia va olorar quelcom cremant,"" it is more likely that she took out the cookies from the jar (Option A). The phrase ""olorar quelcom cremant"" suggests a strong smell of something burning or toasting, which could be due to the cookies being taken out of the oven. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: La tempesta va empitjorar.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""La pluja estava caient"", it is more likely that the storm worsened rather than improved. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the elevator has stopped working) is the cause of the building being evacuated. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the father bought a beer for his son) will happen. The premise states that the father is frustrated with his son's alcoholism, but rather than punishing or expelling him, he decides to buy him a beer as an attempt to connect with him and help him address his problem. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La secretària es va anar a casa) is more likely. The reason being that there is no logical connection between the fact that the advocate went upstairs to her office and the ascensor being out of order. It is more plausible that the secretary left work early than that the elevator was not working.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (El seu amic el va interrompre) is more likely to be the cause of his anger.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (El caixer s'ha oblidat de donar-li a la noia un rebut) is more likely. The fact that the girl gave money to the cashier suggests that she expected something in return, but if the cashier has forgotten to give her a receipt, it means that they didn't actually exchange anything.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Va quedar paralítzica en un accident) is the most likely cause for why the woman was placed in a wheelchair. Therefore, this answer choice should be selected.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (the country was facing economic difficulties) is the correct answer. The mention of citizens hanging their national flag outside their homes suggests a sense of distress or hardship, rather than celebration or commemoration.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (terrorist attack) is more likely as the reason for the collapse of the building in the city center. The mention of a ""collapse"" suggests that the event was sudden and catastrophic, which aligns better with the nature of a terrorist attack than an increase in crime rate over time."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She presented him to her parents) is more likely. The fact that she broke up with him suggests that there may have been some conflict or issue in their relationship, and presenting him to her parents could be seen as a way of seeking support or validation from them. It is less likely that she would suplicate him to take her back, as this would imply a level of subservience or lack of agency on her part.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Els seus caps van col·lidir) is more likely. The two children stretching their hands simultaneously to retrieve a ball would likely result in them bumping into each other or colliding rather than the ball rolling away.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (There was cardboard in the cistern) is more likely as it provides an alternative explanation for why there were no papers left in the paper box.

The passage states that he received ""strange looks"" from other passengers, indicating that his behavior was noticeable and unusual. It does not suggest that he was simply talking to himself (Option B), as there is no mention of any verbal communication or self-talk. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why the man received strange looks from the other passengers."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Les formigues van arribar a les migelles) is more likely. The premise states that ""El nen va deixar migalles al terra,"" indicating that there are food crumbs left behind by a child. It's unlikely that the child would have taken their own food back, so it makes more sense for other creatures like ants to come and collect the leftovers."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Els seus llavis estaven trencats) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the man took out his mint-flavored breath freshener.

It does not suggest that the fruit has been eaten by an animal or person."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El cotxe es va avergonyir,"" it is more likely that option A, ""He girat el motor,"" is the correct answer. The word ""avergonyir"" in Catalan means to embarrass or shame someone/something, so it suggests that something unexpected happened with the car, such as the engine overheating. Option B does not provide a clear explanation for why the car would be embarrassed."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Va estar al llit durante diversos dies) is more likely. The fact that he was in bed for several days suggests that his back injury may have been severe enough to immobilize him and prevent him from carrying out daily activities.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (El seu marit va mal entendre les seves preocupacions) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (L'estudiant va respondre correctement la pregunta) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La dona es va quedar sense ous"", it is more likely that she went to the supermarket (Option B). This is because the phrase ""es va quedar sense ous"" implies that she has run out of eggs, which are typically purchased at a grocery store like the supermarket rather than a farm."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Li vaig revelar un secret) is the correct answer. The premise mentions finding an old friend, which suggests a reconnection or catching up after a long time. Revealing a secret would be a significant moment in such a reunion, as it could bring back memories or create new connections between the two friends. In contrast, giving someone an embrace may not necessarily reveal a secret but rather express affection or happiness at seeing each other again.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Va agafar un peix) is more likely. The woman avoided going to the lake because she wanted to catch a fish, not because it was contaminated.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""La dona es va posar les seves ulleres,"" it is more likely that she put on her sunglasses (Option A).

"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'home va mirar el cel nocturn,"" it is more likely that Option A (Ell desitjava que fosse estiu) is correct. The phrase ""va mirar el cel nocturn"" suggests that the man looked up at the night sky, implying a desire for something better or different, such as warm weather. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""va jugar trucs malvats"" implies that the boy did something negative or harmful to his new classmate, rather than giving them a warm welcome. Therefore, it is more likely that he did not like the new student and played mean pranks on him."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tenia ganes d'un got de llet,"" it is more likely that Option A (She was eating cakes) is the correct answer.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Va començar a ploure"", it is more likely that option A (the driver turned on the headlights) than option B (the driver went backward).

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He demanat parlar amb un supervisor) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El vent va bufar a través de la finestra oberta."", option B is the correct answer as it suggests that the curtains were blown by the wind through the open window. Option A does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a bell sounding."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La llum de la meva casa s'ha apagat."", option B (Em va esclatar una fiuza) is the more likely cause.

This suggests that they were unable to perform the calculations mentally, indicating that they needed a tool to help them. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (El pare va canviar el plou del nadó) is more likely. The fact that the baby has fallen asleep suggests that it was comfortable enough to do so, which implies that its needs were met, including being changed and cleaned. It is unlikely that the father would have shaken the baby softly without causing any discomfort or disturbance, especially since the baby had just fallen asleep. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the baby fell asleep.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Les proves el van implicar) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will choose option A, ""Va deixar de menjar dolços."" The reason for this is because the premise states that the man decided to lose weight, and giving up sweets is a common way to reduce calorie intake and promote weight loss. Option B, ""Va evitar la cafèina,"" while related to dietary changes, is not as directly linked to weight loss as giving up sweets."
"Response:  Option A: S'ha desliurat.  
Explanation: According to the premise ""La noia va pisar el gel,"" it is more likely that she has broken through the ice than that she started shaking. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Va estar despert tota la nit) is more likely as it suggests that she was awake all night, which could be caused by various reasons such as insomnia or being worried about something. The fact that she had rings under her eyes also supports this possibility. Option B (Va posar el seu fill a dormir) does not provide any information that would suggest why she might have been awake all night.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Es va espumar les mans amb sabó) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why the boy's fingers became twisted. Espumar means to foam or lather something with soap, so this option suggests that the boy may have accidentally gotten his hands covered in soap while washing them, leading to the twisting of his fingers. This is a more logical explanation than Option A (Va prendre una llarga dutxa), which does not provide any clear reason for why the boy's fingers would become twisted.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vaig tornar la ampolla) is the most likely cause. The premise states that the ampolla de refresc va xiular, indicating that it has been shaken or agitated.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""La noia es va mossegar les ungles"", option B is more likely. The fact that she got bitten by something suggests that there was an unexpected or surprising event, so option B is a better fit than option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He marked a date in his calendar) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the husband will ask for a divorce rather than acomiad his lawyer.

The sentence suggests that the storm caused a dangerous ice buildup on the highway, which could lead to accidents or other hazards.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (Se li ha tret l'aparell dentari) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the adolescent being embarrassed about going to school suggests that there may be an issue with their appearance or self-consciousness, which could potentially be related to teeth alignment or other dental issues.

Turning one's head away in disinterest or avoidance may not be as likely given this context.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he paid with cash (Option B). The phrase ""the man of business"" suggests that he has a lot of money and is able to pay in cash. Additionally, the fact that his credit card was rejected implies that he did not have enough money in his account to cover the payment, so he would need to use cash instead."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (La junta directiva ha trobat el seu reemplaçament) is more likely. The director general has resigned, indicating that there may be a need for a new leader to take over the position.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Em vaig aproximar al podi) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that his family paid the bail (Option A). The reason for this is that in many jurisdictions, a defendant's family or friends may be able to pay the bail amount to secure their release from prison while they await trial.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'home volia veure l'alba,"" option A (Va viatjar cap al nord) is more likely. The premise suggests that the man wanted to see the sunrise in the north, so he packed his bags and traveled there.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Es va quedar calva) is more likely to happen as it directly relates to the action described in the premise (se li va treure la perruca). Option A (Se li va treure el cabell de l'impostor) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the impostor had a wig or hairpiece. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The editor found that the sentence was not clear and needed to be rephrased.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Va adonar-se que la targeta havia expirat) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Va buscar feina) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the paint spread everywhere) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (L'he donat la benvinguda a casa) is the correct answer.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the crops died due to the drought (Option B).

On the other hand, drinking water may not have any direct impact on the feeling of coldness.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (El seu fill es va fer una broma) is more likely. The reason being that a mother's silence towards her child is not something that can be explained by the child making a joke or complaining.

Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the premise provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He tancat la cremallera dels pantalons) is more likely than Option B (Em vaig tropeçar en el paviment). This is because the premise mentions that there is a hole in the speaker's pants, which suggests that they may have accidentally closed their belt loop or button instead of tripping over something.
"Response:  Option B: Les seves dents es van tornar rectes.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Va signar el seu testament) is the correct answer.

Therefore, it is more plausible that he signed his will as a precautionary measure before passing away from the disease.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Em vaig cremar la llengua) is more likely. Taking a hot shower can cause burns or injuries to the tongue or mouth, so it's more plausible that taking a hot shower could harm one's language than causing oneself to bite their own tongue.

The premise states that the editor was disappointed with the writer’s work, suggesting that there were issues with the content or style of the stories rather than simply missing a deadline.

The fact that she was surprised by her brother reading her diary suggests that she values her privacy and personal space, and may take steps to protect herself from future invasions of her privacy.

This is because measuring customer satisfaction through surveys is a common practice in businesses, especially when trying to understand how well they are meeting their customers' needs and expectations. Offering a discount to new customers may also be a way to measure satisfaction, but it would not directly address the goal of understanding overall customer satisfaction.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the parents' influence) caused the son to have similar beliefs as them. The passage states that ""he had always been close to his parents,"" indicating a strong bond between them. This suggests that the son was heavily influenced by their beliefs and values, leading him to adopt similar views himself. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Se li va acabar la gasolina) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the premise that the driver has fallen asleep or become otherwise incapacitated, which would be necessary for option B to occur. Additionally, running out of fuel is a more plausible explanation for why the car slowed down and eventually stopped than the driver falling asleep.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'home va menjar el gelat al sol,"" it is more likely that option A, ""El gelat ha perdut el seu sabor"" (The ice cream has lost its flavor) is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (They were deported) is more likely to occur.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Em preguntava si era fora) is more likely. The fact that the lights in your friend's apartment are on suggests that someone might be inside, so it's reasonable to assume that you would ask if they were home before deciding to visit.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""M'he posat la flor sota el nas,"" option A is more likely. The word ""posat"" means ""placed"" or ""set,"" so it is unlikely that the person captured the scent of the flower by placing it under their nose. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she found an old friend from childhood (Option A). The sentence ""La dona es va sentir nostàlgica"" suggests a feeling of longing or wistfulness, which could be triggered by encountering someone from the past who brings back memories. Option B does not provide any context to suggest why she would call her children, so this option seems less plausible given the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Va presentar el paper abans) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El meu cotxe es va trencar"", option B is more likely. The speaker has already taken action by calling a mechanic, indicating that they are taking steps to fix their car rather than going to the mall."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the víctima va aixecar les mans) is more likely because it contradicts the fact that the criminal pointed the gun at the victim.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Tenia ganes de passar el cap de setmana) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Tenia ganes de passar el cap de setmana"" suggests that she has something she wants to do or attend during the weekend, which could potentially conflict with either option B (assisting a friend's wedding) or option C (attending a funeral). Therefore, it is more likely that she would choose to attend her uncle's funeral over her friend's wedding."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he was dreaming (Option A). The phrase ""he lost the notion of time"" suggests that his experience was disconnected from reality, which is a common feature of dreams. Additionally, the fact that he had nausea after waking up does not necessarily imply that he was dreaming; many people experience nausea for various reasons unrelated to dreaming. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (l'impresora no tenir tinta) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Els aficionats van entrar al camp) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the fans entered the field, implying a physical action rather than simply turning towards the flag.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""El noi es va estremeix,"" option B is the most likely cause. The word ""estremeix"" means to shiver or tremble, so it is likely that the boy was feeling uncomfortable or scared due to something the girl did or said. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Li van amputar la cama) is more likely. The passage states that ""els metges van donar al pacient una extremitat artificial,"" indicating that they gave him an artificial limb. Amputation of a limb would be a drastic measure to take in order to give someone an artificial limb, so it seems more likely that this happened rather than simply monitoring the patient."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El noi va pinçar el còl a la noia,"" it is more likely that she will hit him in the shoulder (Option A)."
"Response: 
Option A: Valorava la seva opinió.
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the speaker sought their friend's opinion because they valued their friend's viewpoint. This aligns with Option A, as it suggests that the speaker actively sought out their friend's advice or opinion. In contrast, Option B implies that the speaker already knew they were right, which does not align with the idea of seeking someone else's input."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El noi va pisar el fang,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""va Enganxar-se"" means ""got stuck to,"" indicating that the mud got stuck to his shoes rather than hitting him in the face. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The gent es va amagar sota terra) is more likely. The sentence suggests that people are hiding underground due to the snowfall, indicating a more extreme reaction than simply closing schools.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Va amenaçar amb deixar el treball) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'arbre va danyar la casa,"" option A is the most likely cause. The sentence suggests that the tree fell or damaged the roof of the house, which is consistent with Option A. Therefore, the answer is (A) L'arbre va caure sobre el sostre."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fusta es va trencar per la meitat,"" it is more likely that Option B (Vaig fer que la destral caigués sobre la fusta) caused the breakage, as the wording of the premise suggests that the fusta was broken in half by an external force, such as a blow from a destral."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La parella va anunciar que es separaven) is more likely than Option B (La parella va anunciar que estarien esperant un nadó).

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the man downloaded the refrigerator) is correct. The premise states that the kitchen timer has disappeared, which suggests that something inside the kitchen has happened. Since the refrigerator is a large appliance located in the kitchen, it is more likely that the timer was accidentally downloaded onto it rather than taken out of the kitchen altogether.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""La dona va pisar les flames,"" option A is the most likely answer because it implies that the woman stepped on the flames and extinguished them. Option B suggests that smoke was coming from the flames, which does not align with the given premise."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (La seva família va assistir a la conferència de premsa) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the public figure's family was present at a press conference, indicating that they are in the public eye and their image is being managed or protected. This is consistent with the idea of a public figure trying to maintain a positive image. In contrast, Option A (Les càmeres van mirar en la seva direcció) could simply mean that photographers were taking pictures of the person without necessarily implying that they are trying to manage their public image.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La dona es va quedar en la banyera,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""L'aigua del bany es va tornar tibia,"" occurred. The reason is that if a person gets stuck in a bathtub, they are unlikely to be able to escape or move around, so the water temperature would not affect their situation directly. On the other hand, if the water level in the bathtub decreases, it could make it easier for them to get out, but this scenario is also less likely given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Es va especialitzar en enginyeria) is more likely to lead to meeting other students at the university. Specializing in engineering will likely involve taking classes with other students who are also interested in that field, creating opportunities for interaction and collaboration. On the other hand, joining a fraternity may not necessarily provide as many opportunities to meet other students outside of that specific organization.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""La vessa va volar cap al nen"", it is more likely that Option A (the boy fled) is correct. The use of the word ""volar"" (to fly) suggests a sudden and rapid movement towards the child, indicating that the bird may have been startled or threatened by something near the child. Therefore, it is more likely that the boy would try to escape rather than picking up a flower."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she was sentenced to perform community service rather than being executed. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vaig mesclar el sucre al te calent"", it is more likely that option A, ""El te s'ha fet a l'aigua"" (The sugar has dissolved in the tea). This is because when you mix sugar with hot water, the sugar will dissolve into the liquid, rather than staying suspended as a solid particle. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Va ser reclutat per a la guerra) is the correct answer. The phrase ""va ser reclutat per a la guerra"" implies that the man was drafted into the military for war service, rather than being injured in battle. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause of his condition."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (La policia va perseguir el criminal) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (M'ho vaig deixar caure) is the correct answer. The fact that the laptop does not turn on suggests that there may have been physical damage to the device, such as a drop or impact, which could prevent it from functioning properly.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Va dobrar la roba) is more likely because it implies that she did not have enough space in her closet for all of her clothes, so she had to fold them up instead of buying a larger one.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""La moneda va caure fins al fons"". This is because when you throw a coin into water, it will most likely sink to the bottom of the pool or pond due to its weight and buoyancy. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the ball entered the hole) is more likely to occur than option B (the ball was returned to the player). Therefore, the answer is A.
"Response:  Option B: Vaig aixecar. 
Explanation: The premise ""Vaig respirar la pols al sostre"" implies that the speaker was able to reach a high point, such as the ceiling. This suggests that the speaker has enough strength or ability to lift themselves upwards, which is consistent with option B. In contrast, option A does not make sense in this context because having a singuish (a type of cough) would not allow the speaker to reach the ceiling. Therefore, the most likely answer based on the premise is option B: Vaig aixecar."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the customer left the lights on) is more likely. The premise states that the security guard received a call from the store owner, indicating that someone had been in the store after hours. This suggests that the person who made the call was not the customer who forgot to turn off the lights but rather the store owner or another individual who noticed something unusual.

Rationale: According to the premise, ""La respiració de l'home era sorollosa,"" it suggests that there was a problem with his respiratory system, specifically with his lungs. The word ""sorollosa"" implies that the sound of his breathing was abnormal or labored, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including lung disease or failure of the kidneys (rinyons in Catalan). Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Vaig preguntar al meu amic si estava interessat en anar) is more likely because it aligns with the context of asking someone to accompany you to an event.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he opened the windows (Option B) than he carried blankets (Option A). This is because opening the windows would be a more practical solution to cool down the house after the air conditioner broke down, rather than carrying blankets.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (La seva motxilla era pesada) is more likely to be the cause of his back pain. The weight of a heavy backpack can put strain on the muscles in the upper back, leading to discomfort or pain.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (He bought a gift for my mother) is correct. The sentence ""Li he fet un pastís"" means ""He bought a cake,"" which suggests that the speaker's mother received a gift of food rather than something else entirely. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vaig encendre el foc,"" it is more likely that Option A: La flama es va apagar will occur. This is because when you light a fire, the flame produced by the ignition of fuel will eventually subside or be extinguished. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (No volien debatre en el tribunal) is more likely to be the correct answer. The text states that ""les parts en disputa"" have reached an agreement, indicating that they did not want to continue arguing in court.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Els seus pares van morir) is the correct answer. The statement ""els nens van ser enviats a un orfanat"" implies that the children were sent to an orphanage after their parents died.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (tsunami) is more likely to occur than Option B (grilling).
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the hiker will enter into panic (option B). The sentence ""El senderista se va trobar con una serp venenosa"" implies a sudden and unexpected encounter with a dangerous animal, which would likely cause fear and panic in the hiker rather than dehydration."
"Response:  Option A: He encès el forn. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""El forn es va escalfar,"" it is more likely that someone turned on the oven rather than placing a dish inside it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: El llimó s'ha mollit.  
Explanation: According to the premise ""He apagat la cuina de llimona,"" the kitchen has been turned off. This means that there is no heat or energy being applied to cook the lemons, so they are unlikely to have softened. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (El país va colonitzar la terra) is more likely. The country discovered new lands, indicating that it expanded its territory through colonization rather than leaving or abandoning the original land.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Es va espatllar per tot el terra) is more likely. The phrase ""va caure"" implies that the glass fell to the ground, so it is unlikely that it would have landed on top of a pile of clothing."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La taula va trontollar,"" Option A (El terra era irregular) is the more likely cause. The word ""trontollar"" suggests a sudden and unexpected movement or collapse, which is more consistent with an uneven or unstable surface than a slippery one."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (El seu fill va confessar la veritat) is more likely. The father took his son to the woods with a promise of going fishing but instead lied about it. This implies that the son was not aware of the true purpose of their trip and may have been confused or scared by the situation. Therefore, it is more likely that he would tell the truth when questioned about what happened in the woods rather than making up a story.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El cap de l'home palpitava de dolor,"" it is more likely that he took aspirina (Option B) than xarop per a la tos (Option A).

The phrase ""L'home va fer teràpia"" suggests that the man sought therapy for his mental health issues, implying that he had a history of mental illness within his family. This is supported by the statement ""Malaltia mental era familiar,"" which means ""Mental illness is inherited."" Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."

"Response:  Option B: Es va posar.
Explanation: The sentence ""El gos va mirar el sucós bistec sobre la taula"" implies that the dog looked at the juicy steak on the table. Therefore, it is more likely that the dog wanted to eat the steak rather than bave (bath) in it. So, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Es va fer rica."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Els estudiants van sortir de l'aula,"" option A (La campana va sonar) is a more likely cause than option B (El professor li va assignar una tasca). This is because the premise mentions that the students left the classroom, which suggests that there was some external stimulus or event that prompted them to do so, such as the bell ringing. It is less likely that the students would leave the classroom simply because their teacher assigned them a task."
"Response: 
Option B: Els seus coneguts eren familiars d'ella. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman claimed to have seen a ghost. This implies that she was in a situation where people around her might be skeptical or dismissive of her claim. Therefore, option A (her friends expressed escepticism) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Gairebé es va ofegar a l'oceà) is more likely as it provides a clear and specific detail about what almost happened to the man. The other option does not provide such a vivid image or danger. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Va tener un atac) is the correct answer. The premise states that the man lost his ability to speak, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as a stroke or other neurological disorder.

The premise states that you took antibiotics, which can help to eliminate or reduce the severity of an infection. Therefore, it is more likely that the infection has disappeared rather than spreading.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""El semàfor es va tornar groc,"" it is more likely that the driver turned on the brake light (Option B). This is because turning on the brake light is a common action taken by drivers when they are preparing to stop at an intersection where the traffic light has turned yellow or red."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""El noi va tropeçar,"" option A is the most likely cause - his jacket was unfastened."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Va ser distret pel soroll) is more likely. The woman put earplugs to protect her ears from the noise, indicating that she was distracted by it.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He utilitzat un llapis) is more likely. The premise states that the pen ran out of ink, indicating that it was being used to write something. Using a pencil would not have solved this problem, as it does not provide ink. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Estava en deute) is more likely. The phrase ""li van negar un préstec"" implies that someone denied him a loan, suggesting that he was already in debt. Starting a business would not necessarily be the reason why he was unable to obtain a loan."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""La noia va llançar una branca a la foguera,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""La rameta s'ha cremat,"" will occur.

Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'home va sortir de la dutxa,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""L'aigua calenta no hi era,"" is the correct answer.

"Response: 
Option B: He sentit la conversa al vestíbul.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""La porta de la meva oficina estava oberta,"" it is more likely that the sound of the conversation was heard in the hallway outside the office rather than at the table where the speaker was sitting."

The text states that he ""va fer una aposta,"" indicating a specific action taken by the speaker to place a bet with his friends. This suggests that the speaker was actively involved in making a wager rather than simply watching the game with them."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Va comptar ovelles) is more likely. The phrase ""El noi no podia dormir"" suggests that the boy could not sleep, so he might resort to counting sheep as a way to pass the time until he falls asleep. Option A (Va posar el despertador) does not make sense in this context, as setting an alarm clock would not help him fall asleep."
