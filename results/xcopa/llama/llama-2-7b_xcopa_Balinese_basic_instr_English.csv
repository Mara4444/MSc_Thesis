"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (punika rapuh) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""barang punika kaemas"" suggests that something has been wrapped or packed tightly, which could indicate that it has become compact and dense. This is further supported by the word ""ring,"" which implies a circular shape, suggesting that whatever was wrapped may have compressed into a smaller space. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngamolihang selah tiket) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang ngamolihang"" means ""to be confused or disoriented,"" and ""selah tiket"" means ""to lose one's way."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person will become lost due to confusion rather than intentionally hiding their location."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ulam punika ical saking umah) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika"" means ""to eat"", so it suggests that Ulam will eat something. Option B (Ulam punika ngamah taru ring umah) does not make sense in this context as ""ngamah"" means ""to throw"". Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Agen patroli punika nganikayang ipun ngamencorang) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the given context better than option A (Agen patroli sampun nureksain paspor ipuné). The phrase ""ring tepi siring Kotane"" suggests a location near or around a river, which could be a potential source of danger for people living nearby. Therefore, it is more plausible that an agent would be assigned to monitor and secure the area rather than just patrolling randomly."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kantornyané katutup,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""katutup"" means ""to fall down."" Therefore, option A's translation of ""Rahina punika rahina libur"" makes sense as it implies that something fell down or collapsed. On the other hand, option B's translation of ""Duk punika masan panes"" does not make much sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané maplalian dam) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""luh ento kebus"" suggests that there is a buildup of something, possibly dirt or debris, in the engine, which could cause it to malfunction. Maplalian dam refers to the act of cleaning or clearing out an engine's combustion chamber, which may be necessary if there is a buildup of fuel residue or other debris inside the engine. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Akeh malih anake rauh) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""anake istri punika"" suggests that there are two people involved in a conflict or argument, while ""nenten malih maderbe genah"" implies that one of them is trying to make peace. Therefore, it is more likely that the second person is attempting to calm down the first person rather than starting a fight themselves."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anake alit punika raris nglelet ring jubahnyane) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""luh ento nguntul irungne"" suggests that something has been taken or stolen, and ""ring jubahnyane"" implies that it was taken by someone who is skilled in stealth and cunning. Option B (""Anak alit punika ngletehin popokné"") does not fit with this context as it means ""the child ate the egg,"" which has no relation to the previous sentence. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para pamiarsa sareng-sang) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pamiarsa"" means ""to be scattered or dispersed,"" and ""sareng-sang"" means ""everywhere."" Therefore, it is more likely that the para will be scattered everywhere rather than being concentrated in one place."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anake luh ento nongos ditu sasubane masekolah ulian ia ngelah tetegenan) is more likely to occur. The premise suggests that the speaker's child has difficulty in school due to lack of interest in mathematics, which may lead to poor performance in the subject. Therefore, it is more likely for the speaker's child to struggle academically than to have a natural talent for mathematics.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pangabih kampuh ipuné nyritayang indik hantu) is the more likely cause for the phenomenon described in the premise. This is because the idea of ghosts or spirits being attracted to people who are sad or depressed is a common trope in many cultures and belief systems around the world. It is also supported by some psychological research that suggests that people who are experiencing negative emotions may be more prone to hallucinations or other unusual experiences. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person's sadness or depression is causing them to experience the strange occurrences rather than the other way around.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I da makeneh-keneh) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the person will become confused or disoriented due to their head being spun around rapidly. This is a common effect of dizziness or vertigo, which can be caused by various factors such as inner ear problems, medication side effects, or even just spinning around too quickly. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the premise provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (rekening bank tiange kosong) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""cek sane tiang tulis nenten polih"" suggests that there may be a discrepancy in the account balance, which could be due to various reasons such as incorrect record-keeping or unauthorized transactions. However, it is unlikely that the issue is caused by a sudden increase in salary without any prior notice. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ida ngusap suratan sané nénten kaaptiang) is more likely to happen. This is because the phrase ""suratan sané"" refers to unwanted or spam emails that are sent in large quantities, which can cause inconvenience and distraction for the recipient. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will feel annoyed or frustrated by receiving such emails rather than sending them."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané keni pinungkan punika) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""pelaut punika karantina,"" indicating that a sailor has been quarantined. This suggests that the person in question may have contracted an illness or disease while at sea, which could potentially be caused by exposure to contaminated food or water. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the person was sent to the hospital."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané ngucapang ring manahnyané) is a more plausible cause for why people are not interested in learning to code. This means that people may be less motivated or enthusiastic about learning to code because they feel it's too difficult or time-consuming. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngisep yeh ka gelas"", option A is more likely. The word ""ngisep"" means to be heavy or burdensome, so it's likely that the speaker will choose option A, which suggests that they are feeling tired or weighed down by their workload."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané makayunan ngicénin timpalnyané dukungan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""timpalnyané"" in this context suggests that something has been done or taken away from someone, which aligns with the idea of a cause being removed or taken away. Therefore, option A better fits the meaning of the premise than option B (Ida minehin indik baos sawitran idane), which implies a different type of relationship between the two phrases."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Titiang rumasa iwang) is more likely to occur because it implies that the cause of the accident was due to a sudden change in the angle of the car's tire, which can be caused by various factors such as a puncture or uneven road surface. This is a more plausible explanation than option B (Tiang nalih ipun), which suggests that the accident was caused by a mysterious force that pushed the car off the road without any apparent reason.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ranté punika kaambil saking ban sané mabungkus) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""kaambil saking"" suggests that there may be a blockage or obstruction in the pipe, causing water to back up and overflow. This is supported by the image of water spilling out from underneath the sink, indicating that there is indeed an issue with the plumbing system. Option B (Wenten pahan sane rusak ring rantai punika), on the other hand, does not provide any specific information about the cause of the problem and seems less plausible based on the given context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun sampun las ring maiegan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ipun sampun"" means ""to make a mess,"" and ""las ring"" means ""a lot of."" So, the whole sentence can be translated as ""making a lot of mess."" This makes sense in the context of the scenario described, where two people are fighting and causing chaos. Option B (""Ipun nénten maosang pikobet punika"") does not fit the context as well, as it means ""I will eat your face off,"" which doesn't seem related to the situation at hand."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dané nyaksiang ring pangadilan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""makayunan dados prajuru"" suggests that there are many obstacles or challenges in the way of achieving the goal, which could lead to a sense of frustration or helplessness among those involved. This could result in a lack of motivation or engagement in the campaign, making it less effective overall. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate response based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané ngempak baju sané anget ring kopernyané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""anake punika sampun marasa ring pamargin danene punika"" suggests that there will be a conflict or disagreement between two parties, and the use of ""ngempak"" (to clash or collide) and ""mamargi"" (a conflict or argument) further reinforces this interpretation. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngungkulang tangan Idane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sang sisia sampun uning ring pasaur pitakén"" suggests that there will be a strong reaction or impact from something, and ""ida ngungkulang tangan Idane"" means to stretch out one's hand in anger or frustration. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will react angrily or frustratedly rather than simply disappearing without a trace."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bungané nyusup ka paningalané) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""nyusup ka paningalané"" means ""to make someone angry or upset,"" so it suggests that the person's anger or upsetness is caused by something else rather than their own actions. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person is feeling this way."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lawannyané nganikayang ipun malsuin) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pamain punika ngamolihang lima jayanti"" suggests that there are five important events or celebrations in a year, and the speaker is feeling overwhelmed by them all. This implies that they may be experiencing stress or fatigue due to the constant demands of these events, rather than simply being sad about one particular event. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané ngejuk sisia sané ngapus) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Sang guru ngusak-asik ujian sisyane"" suggests that there are many obstacles or challenges in the way of achieving success, and ""Dané ngejuk sisia sané ngapus"" means ""The teacher who has been through difficulties himself can help his students overcome their problems."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker believes that a teacher who has experienced difficulties themselves will be better able to help their students overcome their own challenges."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang sampun nénten malih mabaos) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""sampun nénten"" means ""too much,"" while ""malih mabaos"" means ""too many."" Therefore, it can be inferred that there are too many problems or issues causing the current situation. Option B (Tiang nénten mrasidayang ngampet) does not provide a clear explanation for the problem."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngenahang ring microwave) is more likely to cause the phenomenon described in the question. The premise states that the object was placed in a microwave oven for 30 seconds, which could potentially heat up the object enough to cause it to melt or deform. In contrast, option B (Tiang nutupin antuk bungkus plastik) does not involve heating the object with microwaves, but rather placing it inside a plastic bag. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the observed phenomenon.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia sakit bayu dugas ento) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""sungkan"" in the premise suggests that something has been stuck or blocked, which could be caused by a physical obstruction such as a piece of debris or a blockage in the pipe. This is more consistent with the idea of a pipe being clogged than the alternative explanation of a maid being lazy. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun malaib ringkolam renang) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""luh punika"" suggests that something has been done or taken care of, while ""macebur ka tengah toyan"" implies a sense of urgency or importance. Given these phrases, it's more likely that the speaker is referring to the act of jumping into the water to save someone who is drowning, rather than simply playing with a rubber ball in the middle of a lake. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rahina punika wantah rahina pangawit pilem) is more likely to be the correct cause of the effect. The phrase ""pangawit pilem"" suggests that something has been added or mixed with the original substance, which could explain why it has changed color. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the observed effect."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Jadmane sami nulak Ida) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Anaké punika nénten malih jangkep"" suggests that Anaké has a strong desire or craving for something sweet, which could be interpreted as a physical hunger or thirst. In this context, it makes sense that Anaké would choose to eat or drink something sweet, such as ice cream, rather than simply daydreaming about it. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nyurat surat) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Tangan anake alit punika raris pucet"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their knowledge or consent, and ""nyurat surat"" means to steal or take something secretly. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's property was stolen without their permission rather than being tied up with a rope."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Akrobat punika maguling saking trapéz) is more likely to be the desired effect. The use of the word ""maguling"" in the premise suggests that the akrobat's movements are fluid and graceful, while the phrase ""saking trapéz"" implies a sense of balance and poise. Therefore, it is more likely that the akrobat will perform a trapeze act with ease and precision rather than struggling or stumbling."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Timpal tiange ngaenang tiang ngantosang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang nénten sabar malih"" suggests that something has been done repeatedly or consistently over time, while ""timpal tiange rauh ring galah sane sampun kapastiang"" implies a sudden change or shift in perspective. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun nglimbakang sanjata nuklir) is more likely to occur. The sentence ""Negara-negara sané maperang punika meled pisan mangda wenten dame"" suggests that several countries are experiencing internal conflicts or wars, which could lead to a nuclear war. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida rumasa sirep) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""anaké punika nginum ubad anggén"" suggests that something will be taken away from someone, and ""rumasa sirep"" means that something will be lost or gone forever. Therefore, it is more likely that Ida will lose her ability to see than gain the ability to see."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak istri punika nabrak sofa,"" option A (Cokor sofaé ulung) is more likely to occur because it implies that the husband's wife will be angry with him for breaking the sofa."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Balóné punika puún) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb that means ""to inflate"" or ""to swell,"" which could refer to the balloon expanding as air enters it. Option B (Balóné punika makeber) does not use a verb that directly implies expansion or growth, but rather one that means ""to tie up"" or ""to bind."" Therefore, option A is the better answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun ngempak kopernyane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngempak kopernyane"" means ""to be blown away by a storm,"" indicating that the city will experience severe weather conditions that could potentially cause damage or destruction. This outcome aligns with the premise of the scenario, where the city is facing the risk of being destroyed due to the volcanic eruption. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngigel ring buah persiké punika,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Peach punika mabul"" will occur. This is because ""mabul"" means to swell or become plump, which is a common effect of eating something sweet like peaches. Therefore, it makes sense that if someone were to eat too many peaches, they might experience this effect. Option B, ""Jamu punika raris kaketisang,"" does not make as much sense in this context, as ""raris"" means to be sour or acidic, and ""kaketisang"" means to be bitter or unpleasant. It is unlikely that eating too many peaches would cause these effects."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngajeng donut) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang"" in this context most likely refers to a hanging or suspended object, such as a donut, rather than a person's name. Therefore, option A is the best fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngedorong jelanané"", option A (pintu mabukak) is more likely to occur. The word ""tiang"" in Malay means ""sky"" or ""heaven"", and ""ngedorong"" means ""to lean"". Therefore, the phrase can be interpreted as ""the sky leans towards something"". This suggests that the thing being leaned upon is heavy enough to cause the sky itself to bend or tilt. Option B (pintué sampun kakunci) does not make sense in this context, as it refers to a door that has been locked from the inside."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Produk punika kauji antuk jaminan kualitas) is more likely to be the cause of the activist's success in promoting the product. This is because the activist is focusing on ensuring the quality of the product rather than exploiting workers. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wenteng bikul sane medal saking bungunge punika) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""tiang ngetrokan tembok"" implies that something heavy has fallen onto the wall, causing damage or a hole. The use of the word ""sane"" also suggests that the impact was significant enough to cause injury or harm. Therefore, it is more likely that the wall will crack or break as a result of the impact rather than simply having a dent or indentation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Adin ipuné liang pisan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake istri punika iri ati ring semetonnyane"" suggests that there are two possible causes for a woman's husband not wanting to have sexual intercourse with her, either he has been made angry by something she did or he has found someone else to be intimate with. Option A provides a logical explanation for this situation as it implies that the man may be avoiding his wife due to some personal issue or problem, while option B does not provide any clear reasoning for why the man would not want to have sex with his wife. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngucur anggur ring kaos tiangé,"" option A (Tiang nganggén payuk) is the most likely effect. The word ""ngucur"" in Indonesian means to become angry or upset, so it's likely that the person will get angry with their partner for not wearing a matching outfit."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the customer got angry with the machine) is the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngampakang mesin kas"" suggests that the customer was frustrated or annoyed by something related to the machine, rather than being angry at their wife's infidelity. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Anake akeh pada ngedumang jinah ring dane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ring margi punika"" suggests that there will be some kind of conflict or problem, and ""ngawinang akeh"" implies that this problem will arise from something internal or personal. Therefore, it is more likely that the main character's own thoughts or feelings will cause them to become anxious or worried, rather than external factors such as someone else's actions."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia kangen teken reramanne) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""anake alit punika"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone, and ""ngumbah rare punika"" implies that it was taken without permission or consent. This fits with the idea of stealing or taking something without permission, which is what option A describes. Option B does not fit as well with the given premise, as it only mentions ""punika galah ngajeng,"" which could refer to a variety of things but does not specifically imply theft or unauthorized taking."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Radar piloté nyantenang bada) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""nyantenang"" in Indonesian means ""radar"", so the sentence ""Radar piloté nyantenang bada"" can be translated as ""The radar is piloted by someone"". Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Daun-dauné mawarna) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punyan kayune punika"" suggests that something is being pulled or stretched, which could result in a tearing or breaking of the leaves. This is consistent with the idea of leaves breaking off from a plant due to strong winds or other external forces. Option B (Daun-dauné makumpul ring tanahé) does not fit as well with this premise, as it implies that the leaves are growing deeper into the ground rather than breaking off from the plant."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia makeneh lakar maplalianan kartu ngajak nyama luhne) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngajak nyama luhne"" suggests that someone is trying to deceive or manipulate another person through a clever plan or scheme. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is describing a situation where they are using cunning tactics to achieve their goals rather than simply relying on luck."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ajinnyane ngicen ida nginem soda) is more likely to happen because it is a logical consequence of the given premise. The idea that ""Anak alit punika ngadu ring genah kosan"" implies that the child has been playing with something flammable, such as matches or lighters, near their grandmother's house. This could potentially lead to an accidental fire starting in the house, which would be exacerbated by the lack of proper safety measures. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ikané punika raris malaib saking genah toyané) is more likely. The phrase ""malaib saking genah"" means ""to be affected by something,"" so it suggests that the person's behavior or actions are being influenced by something external. This implies that they are not in control of their own actions, which aligns with the idea of a curse. Option B (Ikan punika raris malayar ngungsi genah ajengannyane) does not convey this same sense of external influence, and instead suggests that the person's behavior is simply a result of their own desires or intentions."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Dané ngentosin pahan partai) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pikayunan politik anake istri"" suggests that the husband's political views are in conflict with his wife's, leading to tension within their relationship. This could lead to a breakdown of their marriage or a separation, rather than resorting to protest actions. Therefore, Option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nguripang kran) is more likely to occur than option B (Tiang ngenahang deterjen ring jeroan). This is because ""sink"" in Indonesian can be translated as ""nguripang"", which means something that has been submerged or immersed underwater. Therefore, the phrase ""tiang nguripang kran"" literally means ""the anchor has been submerged underwater"". As such, it is more likely for an anchor to sink into the ocean rather than being stuck in a tree."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Kereta api rauh ring stasiun) is more likely to be the cause of the delay. The phrase ""rauh ring"" means ""around the station"", indicating that the train may have been delayed due to a problem near or around the station. Option B (Kereta api punika nyerit) does not provide any contextual clues about the location of the delay, making it less likely as an explanation for the delay."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I da ngenahang cap ring amplop punika) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika raris ngenahang"" suggests that something will be taken or removed from a place, while ""ring amplop"" implies that this action will happen suddenly or unexpectedly. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's property will be stolen than for them to simply put it in a package and give it away."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun seneng sareng-sang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Timpal-timpalne tusing buin matemu"" suggests that something is not working properly or efficiently, while ""Ipun seneng sareng-sang"" means ""It's all messed up."" Therefore, option A better fits the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané kapademang ri tatkala ngambil swadharmannyané) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""Juru bacakané"" implies that something has been taken away or lost, while ""Nyidaang ngubadin jinah perusahaan"" suggests that there is a problem with the company's management. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience negative consequences such as losing their job rather than simply taking a break due to illness."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang nyingakin jam,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ningeh"" in this context means to make or do something, so it's more likely that the speaker is saying that they will make or do something related to jam rather than just mentioning it."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang nulis esai punika antuk tangan) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's hand was trembling. It suggests that he may have been writing an essay or holding something delicate in his hand, causing him to feel nervous or anxious about it. Option B (Tiang miwah kurenan tiange saling sautin), on the other hand, does not provide any logical explanation for the man's trembling hand. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngentosin bautne) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""punika sayan"" suggests that there is a blockage or obstruction in the pipe, which could be caused by debris or other materials accumulating inside the pipe. Option B (Tiang ngalinggihin kunci punika) implies that the issue may be related to the key being stuck in the lock, but this does not seem to be the primary concern based on the given information. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pasangan punika raris ngungsi ka apartemen punika) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""punika"" means ""to rent"" or ""to lease,"" indicating that the couple will be renting an apartment. Option B (Kotané ngukum umah punika) does not make sense in this context, as ""ngukum"" means ""to buy"" or ""to purchase."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané meled nyingakin suryané surup) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake istri punika"" suggests that a woman has been married, while ""raris negak ring jabaan"" implies that she has been widowed or separated from her husband. This could lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, as suggested in the second part of the premise. Therefore, option A is more plausible given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nénten uning nglangi) is more likely the correct answer. The phrase ""Anaké punika mabusana jas selam ring toyane"" suggests that something has been taken away from Anaké by someone else, and the phrase ""Dané nénten uning nglangi"" means ""He/She took it without permission"". Therefore, it is more likely that someone took something belonging to Anaké without their permission rather than Anaké giving something to someone else."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané ngusap suratan punika) is more likely to happen because it implies that Anak will be able to control or manipulate the machine's text processing abilities through his wife's prayers. Option B (Ipun ngetok tombol backspace) does not make sense in this context as it refers to pressing a button on the keyboard, which would have no effect on the machine's ability to process texts. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané polih nilai sané nénten becik) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""polih nilai"" means ""many values,"" while ""sané"" refers to a person's worth or value. Therefore, it can be inferred that there are many conflicting values or priorities at play in this situation, leading to confusion and difficulty in making decisions. This answer choice aligns better with the given premise than option B (Dané ngamolihang jayanti), which translates to ""the heaviness of the day."" While this could potentially contribute to feelings of exhaustion or overwhelm, it does not directly address the issue of conflicting values or priorities."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ring wengi punika raris sabeh bales pisan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punikabek"" means ""to ring or call someone"", so it suggests that the speaker is trying to contact someone by phone. Option B (""Irika akeh wenten padang rumpuh"") does not make sense in this context and seems to be an unrelated sentence fragment. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ipun maletan awengi ring hotel) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The use of the word ""luh"" in the premise suggests that there may have been a mistake or error made by someone, which could result in the wrong room being assigned to the guest. Additionally, the phrase ""maletan awengi ring hotel"" implies that there was some kind of confusion or misunderstanding regarding the reservation, which could lead to incorrect information being entered into the system. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the guest received an email with the wrong room number."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I da malinggih ring genah sane teduh) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ring genah sane teduh"" suggests that there may be a blockage or obstruction in the pipe, which could prevent water from flowing through it properly. This is supported by the fact that the water pressure is low and the pipes are old, which can contribute to clogs and other issues. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the water pressure is low in this scenario."
"Response: 
Option A: Para peneliti nulak teori punika. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""muktiang teori punika,"" meaning that the researchers have rejected the theory of evolution. Therefore, it is more likely that they will not accept any evidence that supports the theory of evolution, making option A the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pacentokané raris kalanturang antuk galah tambahan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""pasantokané"" means ""to add something extra,"" so it suggests that there may have been an additional or unnecessary element added to the mixture, causing problems with the fermentation process."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nutup kunci) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang nyatet kombinasi tiang ring kunci"" suggests that there are multiple keys or combinations that can be used to unlock a door, and ""nutup kunci"" means to lock a keyhole. Therefore, it is more likely that someone could use a combination of keys to unlock the door rather than simply picking the lock with a tool."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bapanne ngaenang pianakne pipis) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Anake punika sayan maweweh-weweh akehipun"" suggests that something will happen to the person who has been cursed by the witch's spell, and the word ""ngaenang"" in Option A implies that the curse will cause the person's body to wither away or shrink. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngumpul salju dados bola salju) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""saljune sampun ngebekin margi"" suggests that there will be a lot of snowfall in the area, which could lead to accumulation of snow on the ground and make it difficult for people to walk or drive. This aligns with Option A, where the speaker talks about throwing snowballs made of ice. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Para juru kajak ngerauhin dayungnyane"", option A is more likely. The word ""rauh"" means calm or peaceful in Indonesian, so it's unlikely that there would be a big wave or rough sea condition for kayaking. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ipun ngutang kemudi) is more likely to occur as it implies that the speaker's bike has a flat tire, which can cause difficulty in moving forward. Option B (Ipun nabrak pager) does not make sense in this context as ""pager"" is not a common term used in Indonesian language. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Toyane punika raris ngetisin cokor tiange) is a more plausible explanation for why the wind is blowing hard. The phrase ""toyane"" means ""wind"" in Javanese, while ""punika"" means ""blows"". Therefore, Option A suggests that the wind is blowing strongly due to the presence of a large bird flying overhead. On the other hand, Option B (Tiang marasa kadi udara dingin ngliwatin tiang) does not provide a clear explanation for why the wind is blowing hard and seems less plausible compared to Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun sami sampun leteh) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""sami sampun leteh"" means ""the same old story,"" implying that something has been repeated or done many times before. This suggests that the speaker is familiar with the situation and knows what to expect, rather than being surprised by it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Toyane punika raris medal saking bak) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""ring bak"" refers to a type of Indonesian dish that is typically served during special occasions or celebrations, such as weddings or festivals. Therefore, it is unlikely for someone to bring a medal to be cooked in a rice cake dish. Option B (Toyane punika raris nylempoh ring tanahe) does not make sense in this context and is therefore less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané nganikayang sang istri nénten satia ring sang lanang) is more likely to happen because it implies that the husband will be affected by his wife's beauty. The phrase ""nganikayang"" means ""to be captivated or enchanted,"" indicating that the husband is under her spell. Option B (Dané ngakuang nénten satia ring ipun) does not convey this same sense of being entranced or charmed by someone's appearance. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang ngantosang mangdané tinta punika tuh) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because ""tinta"" means ink, and ""punika"" means to write or draw something. So, it makes sense that someone might use ink to write or draw a message on a ring post. Option B does not make as much sense, as ""tiang"" means a finger and ""yeh"" means a ring, but there is no clear connection between these words and the idea of writing or drawing something on a ring post. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak alit punika bangun raris jerit-jerit,"" it is more likely that option A (Ida sampun ngugut) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""alit punika"" means to vomit or throw up, which suggests that the child may have eaten something that did not agree with them and caused nausea and vomiting. The phrase ""bangun raris jerit-jerit"" also implies a severe stomachache or cramps, which could be caused by food poisoning or another digestive issue. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bapannyane raris negak ring mejane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""bapannyane"" means ""to be scattered or dispersed,"" and ""negak"" means ""ring."" Therefore, it can be inferred that a ring of some kind will be scattered or dispersed. This does not necessarily imply that something will be added to the ring, but rather that the ring itself will change in some way. Option B (Ajinnyane sane ngajahin) does not make sense in this context as there is no clear connection between adding something to a ring and changing its shape."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Timpal tiange ngaksi tiang,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""ngaksi"" in Javanese means ""to bend or curve,"" so it is likely that the speaker is referring to a bent or curved object, such as a tree branch or a piece of metal. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Parajanane sami pada brontak) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pamréntah punika nyangsarain rakyatnyané"" suggests that there are external factors causing discontent among the people, such as economic hardship or political oppression. This could lead to a situation where the people become restless and demand change, which in turn could result in social unrest or even violence. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngwangun kemah) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""alit punika"" suggests that something is being pulled or stretched, which could result in a tear or rip. Additionally, the word ""sampun"" implies a fragile or delicate nature, which further supports the idea of something breaking or tearing apart. Therefore, it is more likely that the fabric will tear rather than become fluffy or puffed up."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané meled malajah ngambar) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngambar"" in Javanese means ""to be angry or upset"", so it suggests that Anak's wife may have been causing problems for him due to her anger or frustration. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Timpal ipuné polih panugrahan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika"" in the premise suggests that something has been taken or removed, which aligns with the meaning of ""polih panugrahan"". Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the problem is related to something being taken away rather than something being added."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia ngigel) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""Anake punika sampun manggihin anak lianan"" suggests that there is a lack or scarcity of food for the children in the village, which could lead to malnutrition and other health problems. Option A implies that this situation has been going on for some time, further emphasizing the likelihood that it is a chronic issue rather than a temporary one."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngenahang pemutih ring tengah) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that rambut anake punika mawarna kuning, which suggests that there is a change in color of the hair due to some reason. Option A implies that this change in color may occur due to exposure to sunlight or other environmental factors, which could potentially cause the hair to turn yellowish. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B, which does not provide any logical explanation for the change in hair color.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané nganikayang pakaryannyané sané sampun lintang) is a more plausible cause for the artist's creativity. The phrase ""ngaryanin karya anyar"" suggests that the artist has been inspired by various things in their environment, leading to the creation of new works. This implies that the artist's creativity is influenced by external factors rather than just internal inspiration alone. Therefore, option A is a more likely explanation for the artist's creative output."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun kalugra medal saking militer) is more likely to be the cause of her success in life. The phrase ""putran danene raris nilar umahnyane"" suggests that Ida has been blessed with good fortune or luck from a young age, which could have contributed to her achievements in military service. In contrast, option B (Ia lakar masekolah di perguruan tinggi) does not provide any specific information about Ida's early life experiences or advantages that might have helped her succeed later in life. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rak-raknyanébek antuk lebu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""rak-raknyané"" suggests that something is being pulled or dragged along, which fits with the idea of a book being carried by someone. Additionally, the word ""antuk"" means ""to carry,"" so this option better matches the meaning of the premise. Option B does not make as much sense in this context, as it implies that the ground itself is moving instead of just the person carrying the book."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngalangin lampu) is more likely to occur as a result of the situation described in the scenario. This is because the term ""ring umah"" typically refers to something that is hot or burning, and the phrase ""tiang ngalangin lampu"" specifically means ""to burn out a light bulb."" Therefore, it is more likely that the light bulb will burn out due to excessive use than for any other reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Punika sané ngawinang jejeh) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang sareng ipun numpak roller coaster"" suggests that something has been rolled up or compressed, which could potentially lead to a puncture or tear in the material. This is further supported by the word ""ngawinang,"" which means ""to burst or tear open."" Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the damage is due to the compression or rolling of the material rather than the material being bitten into."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngenahang mentega ka tasé punika) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika"" suggests that something has been cooked or heated up, and ""mentega"" means butter. Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is suggesting that they heated up some food using butter as a cooking medium. Option B (tiang ngelemang ring microwave) does not fit with this context, as it refers to heating something in a microwave oven rather than using butter as a cooking medium."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Listrik ring genah punika matilar) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""wit sané ulung ring kabel listrik"" suggests that there may be a problem with the electrical circuit or wiring in the house, which could cause the lights to flicker or go out temporarily. This is supported by the second part of the premise, where it mentions ""punika matilar,"" which means ""flickering light."" Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngawinang penontoné marasa jengah) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Sang sané mapidarta ngicénin komentar"" suggests that the speaker's comment has been misunderstood or misinterpreted by others, leading to a negative reaction from them. This implies that the speaker's words have had an adverse impact on their audience, causing them to feel displeasure or annoyance rather than amusement or entertainment. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang nyuduk dewek tiangé aji pin punika) is more likely to occur than option B (Jeriji getih marupa tetebus ring jerijin tiange). This is because the phrase ""tiang é"" suggests that something is being pulled or stretched towards the ground, which could cause it to break or fall. In contrast, option B does not provide any context for why the tree would suddenly start growing in size. Therefore, option A is the better answer based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ikané punika ngambang ring toyane,"" it is more likely that option A (Ipun seduk) is the correct answer. The phrase ""ngambang"" means ""to bite or chew,"" so it suggests that the person's tongue is moving around in their mouth as they speak. This implies that they are articulating words or sounds, rather than just making a noise with their mouth. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané sungkan) is the most likely cause for why Suaran's child is crying. The phrase ""punika sakadi"" suggests that the child is hungry or thirsty, which could cause them to cry. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lift rauh ring lantai sané kaaturang) is more likely to be the cause of the issue. The phrase ""rauh ring lantai"" suggests that there may be a problem with the elevator's movement or vibration, which could potentially cause it to stop at certain floors. Additionally, the use of the word ""kaaturang"" implies that the issue may be related to the elevator's control system or programming. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the issue described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané ngapus reramannyané) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anaké punika malaib saking umah"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their knowledge or consent, which aligns with the meaning of ""ngapus reramannyané"". Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Toilet paper smeared with feces) is a more likely cause of the mess in the bathroom than option B (Panic attack). The premise mentions that the toilet seat and surrounding area are covered in feces, indicating that someone intentionally or unintentionally left behind a mess after using the restroom. While panic attacks can certainly cause disorientation and confusion, it seems less likely that someone would smear feces around the bathroom during such an episode. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang sané nuénang sampun ngrangsuk guling ring anaké alit punika) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""sang sané"" means ""he/she was angry,"" while ""nuénang"" means ""to suck."" Therefore, the sentence ""Anaké punika kantun nampek ring gustinnyané"" can be translated to mean ""He/She sucked the name of the ring with anger."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngadeg ring sor wit tarune sane ageng) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake punika jeg manggihin"" suggests that there are many factors contributing to the problem of poverty in Indonesia, including a lack of access to education and job opportunities for rural communities. Therefore, it is more likely that the root cause of poverty in Indonesia is complex and multifaceted, rather than being solely due to a single factor such as corruption or mismanagement."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang sampun nelpon ipun) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""tiang tusing polih telepon"" means that someone is using a lot of effort or energy to call their partner, but the word ""saking"" implies that they are not getting any response or acknowledgement from them. Therefore, it is more likely that Tiang will become frustrated and give up trying to contact their partner."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Asu ipuné malaib saking jeroné) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""malaib saking jeroné"" suggests that there may have been a sudden or unexpected change in the environment that caused the plants to wither away. This could be due to factors such as drought, extreme temperatures, or other environmental stressors. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the plants are dying off."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (cuacaé dingin pisan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""tiang nyingakin ambegan"" suggests that there is a lack or scarcity of something, which could be caused by cold weather (dingin). Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun meled mangda kahanan pakaryan ipuné becikan) is more likely to occur as the reason for the strike. This is because the phrase ""ipuné becikan"" means ""to demand higher wages,"" indicating that the workers are seeking better pay rather than simply accepting a lower wage offered by their employer. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Gandané sané makenyem nglikub dapuré) is more likely to happen because it uses a verb form that indicates a future tense, whereas option B (Gandané sané anget ngenyudin dapur) does not use any indication of time in the verb form. Therefore, option A suggests that something will happen in the future, while option B does not convey any specific information about when or if anything will occur.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nganggén sepatu hak tinggi) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""nganggén sepatu"" means ""too high heels,"" indicating that the height of the shoes may be causing discomfort or difficulty in walking. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Toyane punika raris mendem) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""panesne makeber saking bokorne"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, while ""toyane punika raris mendem"" means ""the thief took it."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to a situation where something was stolen rather than simply disappeared."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nganggen sandal) is more likely to occur as a result of wearing shoes with worn-out soles. The phrase ""ngumbah"" in Indonesian means ""to wear out,"" so it's likely that the person will experience discomfort or pain from walking barefoot after wearing shoes with worn-out soles for an extended period of time. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ida katiwakin pamidanda korupsi) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the politician's actions are motivated by personal gain rather than public interest. This aligns with the idea of corruption, which involves using one's position for personal benefit without regard for the law or ethical standards. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the couple will have a baby boy (Option A). The phrase ""punika"" in Indonesian means ""boy,"" while ""mobot"" and ""malaib"" are both feminine terms for ""girl."" Therefore, the option that refers to having a boy as the most likely outcome is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Jero jutawan punika meled mangda wangunan punika kausak) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""punika"" in this context suggests that something has been done or caused to happen intentionally or deliberately, rather than by accident or natural causes. Therefore, it is more likely that the damage was caused by someone actively trying to harm the tree, such as cutting it down with a machete, rather than simply neglecting to water it over time."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sang madagang punika nalih anake istri punika mamaling) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""madagang punika"" suggests that there may have been a disagreement or conflict between the husband and wife, which could lead to the husband's decision to leave his belongings behind. Option B (Rakan dagangane nulungin anake luh ento ngalih dompet ane demenina) does not fit with the context provided in the premise, as it implies that someone else took the husband's belongings without permission, rather than the husband leaving them himself. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the husband left his belongings behind."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Prajurite Kapangandikayang Medal Ka Payudan) is more likely to be the effect of the war between neighboring countries. This is because the phrase ""Kapangandikayang"" means ""to conquer or take by force,"" indicating that the country is likely to gain territory through military victory. Option B (Para Prajurit Mawali Sareng Kulawarga) does not convey a sense of territorial gain but rather the idea of soldiers fighting for their own land or homeland. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Pasangan punika raris ngéwa rabi ring ajeng gedung pengadilan) is more likely to occur. The use of ""ring"" instead of ""rings"" in Option B suggests that a single pair of eyes is looking at the controversial building from afar, rather than multiple pairs of eyes gathered around it. Therefore, Option B better fits the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ia ngambil jaje saking toples) is the correct answer. The phrase ""ngambil jaje"" means to boil or cook something in a pot, so it makes sense that the speaker would suggest this as a possible solution for making the food taste better. Option B (Ia ngutang jaje-jaje di oven) does not make as much sense in this context, as it implies baking the food in an oven rather than cooking it in a pot. Therefore, option A is the more likely correct answer based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dugas punika sabehé macul,"" option A is more likely to occur because it suggests that something will happen to Dugas' eyesight. The phrase ""punika"" means ""to see"" or ""eyesight"", and ""sabeh"" means ""badly"". Therefore, Option A implies that Dugas' eyesight may become impaired or damaged in some way. On the other hand, Option B does not provide any clear indication of what might happen to Dugas' eyesight, making it less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lifté nénten malih magingsir) is more likely to be the cause of the fire. The phrase ""malih magingsir"" suggests that the fire was caused by something burning or smoldering for a long time, which could be due to a variety of factors such as an unattended candle or a malfunction in an electrical appliance. Option B (Alarm kebakarané majalan) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the fire and simply mentions the alarm going off, which could be due to many different reasons. Therefore, based on the given premise, it is more likely that the fire was caused by something burning or smoldering for a long time rather than just the alarm going off."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bapanne meliang pianakne bir) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""meliang pianakne"" means ""to draw a child's picture,"" indicating that the speaker will create a drawing of a child. This suggests that the speaker will engage in creative activities such as drawing or painting, rather than causing harm to someone. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sekretarisésampun budal) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""pengacara punika"" suggests that someone has been accused or charged with a crime, and the word ""raris"" means ""to lift"". Therefore, it is possible that the person being referred to in the premise has been accused of lifting something, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Timpalné ngrenggeng) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake punika"" suggests that something has been taken or stolen, while ""raris brangti"" means to break or damage something. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's property was broken or damaged by someone else rather than being lost due to natural causes such as a storm."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Jero kasir nyukserahang jinah bolongné ring anak luh punika) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""nyukserahang jinah bolongné"" suggests that the child's mind is affected or influenced by something, and the word ""punika"" implies a negative impact. Therefore, it is more likely that the child will experience some kind of psychological distress or trauma due to the events described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané lumpuh sangkaning kecelakaan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""kagenahang ring kursi roda"" suggests that something has happened to the wheelchair's seat or frame, which could potentially cause the chair to become unstable or difficult to maneuver. It is less likely that the problem is caused by a mental disorder or illness, as suggested in option B (Ipun ngranjing ka rumah sakit nganggén brankas)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Negara punika ngelingin rahina kamerdékaannyané) is more likely to be the cause of the national flag being hung upside down. This is because the phrase ""ngelingin rahina"" means ""to hang upside down,"" indicating that the act of hanging the flag in this manner is intentional or deliberate. Option B (Panegara punika katiben pikobet ekonomi) does not provide any context or explanation for why the flag might be hung upside down, making it less likely as a cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ipun dados inspirasi majeng ring fansnyané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ipun dados inspirasi"" means ""to be inspired by something,"" while ""majeng ring fansnyané"" means ""the fans' cheers."" Therefore, it is more likely that Tim will be inspired by his fans' cheers rather than feeling disappointed or discouraged by their reaction."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang marasa kimud) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiange nyambatang ring tiang"" suggests that there are obstacles or challenges in the way of achieving one's goals, and ""mungguing tiang ngelah ajengan ane macemplung di giginan tiange"" implies that these challenges can cause frustration or disappointment. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will feel discouraged or disheartened by these obstacles rather than feeling proud or confident about their abilities."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nguratiang paplajahan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika nénten lulus ring ujian sejarah"" suggests that there was a failure in the history examination, and therefore it is possible that the student did not prepare well for the exam or did not understand the material adequately. This could lead to poor performance in the exam, as suggested by the phrase ""nguratiang paplajahan"". Option B (Ia lali malajah) does not provide any specific reason why the student failed the exam and seems less relevant to the given context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kotene punika raris magejeran) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ring tengah kota"" suggests that the issue is centered in the city itself, rather than being caused by external factors such as criminal activity ( Option B). Therefore, it is more plausible that the problem is related to internal issues within the city, such as poor management or lack of resources."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia mapinunas teken Ida apang Ida buin kaajak) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""mapinunas teken"" means ""to be drawn out"", while ""kaajak"" means ""to be stretched"". Therefore, it can be inferred that the person's body will be stretched or elongated in some way. Option B (Ipun ngajakin reramannyane matemu) does not make sense in this context as there is no clear meaning for ""ngajakin"" or ""reramannyane""."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bola punika raris malaib) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika raris"" means ""to throw or hurl something,"" and ""malaib"" means ""into the air."" Therefore, it is likely that the speaker will throw a ball into the air. Option B (Prabunnyane raris masebun) does not make sense in this context as there is no clear connection between throwing a ball and making someone sleepy."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Went to the dumpster) is more likely the correct answer. The sentence ""I rakuné ngrusak tong sampah"" implies that the speaker went to the location where trash or garbage is collected, which in this case is a dumpster. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (punika murah) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""murah"" means cheap or inexpensive, so it makes sense that the speaker would choose this option if they are looking for something affordable. Option B does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no clear connection between the idea of a pen being ""neatten"" (which could mean many things depending on the context) and its price. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun kélangan resi) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in this premise suggest that it is describing a situation where something is being delayed or held back, which aligns with the meaning of ""ipun kélangan resi"". Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Gelisang sampun) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""kakratik kulit tiange"" suggests that something has been rubbed or scratched, which could cause irritation or inflammation. Additionally, the phrase ""daleman pisan"" implies that there may be some discomfort or pain associated with this condition. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience relief from their symptoms after applying a cooling gel or cream (option A). Option B (Punika sané ngawinangbekas) does not necessarily address the issue of irritation or inflammation, and therefore seems less relevant in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida nganengneng tanahe) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Jadmane ring Kreta punika sami pada Pakrimik"" suggests that there was a conflict or problem between two parties, and the speaker is trying to find a solution. Option A aligns with this context by suggesting that the speaker is looking for a way to end the conflict. On the other hand, option B does not fit well in the given context as it implies that the speaker is trying to create a new problem rather than solving an existing one. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Semut-semut punika pada ngrangsukin rotine punika) is more likely to occur. The use of ""punika"" in this context suggests that the action will be done quickly or suddenly, which aligns with the idea of a spider crawling rapidly across the surface of something. Option B (Anake alit punika raris ngambil rotine punika tumuli karanjingang ring genahnyane) does not convey the same sense of rapid movement."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nyoman anake luh punika raris ngleserang limanipune) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that ""Anake"" is the subject performing the action of ""luh"", which means to read or study. Therefore, it is more likely that ""Anke"" is reading a book than ""Adin"" who is just sleeping."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bibihné macepol) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Anake punika ngambil jinah perak"" suggests that there is a conflict or disagreement between two parties, and ""macepol"" means to be angry or upset. Therefore, it is more likely that one party is causing the other party to become angry or upset, rather than the other way around."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun sampun nyumponin kawéntenan lalu lintas ring teater) is more likely to be the cause of the couple's decision not to watch the show together. This is because the phrase ""nyumponin kawéntenan"" means ""to avoid something,"" implying that the couple is intentionally choosing not to watch the show. In contrast, option B (Ipun polih pituduh jalan ka teater) simply means ""to walk slowly,"" which does not convey any negative connotation or intentionality. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bosnyané ngajumang ipun) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngajumang"" means ""to be angry"" or ""to be upset"", so it suggests that Anak will become angry or upset due to his wife's infidelity. Option B (Timpal ipuné makarya ring genah sané pateh) does not convey a clear emotion or outcome, making it less likely to occur based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida nyokong tetujon ipune) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that there are two possible causes for why Anake's grandmother did not give her any money when she asked for it, and Option A provides a plausible explanation by suggesting that Anake's grandmother may have been too busy or preoccupied with other things to give her any money. On the other hand, Option B does not provide as clear of an explanation and seems less likely to be the actual reason why Anake's grandmother did not give her any money.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané madué rasa takut ring panggung) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""manah aktoré"" suggests that the actor is experiencing fear or anxiety related to their performance, which aligns with the first part of the premise. Option B does not fit as well with the given information, as it implies that the actor is feeling bored or disinterested in their role rather than anxious about performing."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang sampun kaleson"", option A is more likely. The word ""ngitungang"" in this context means to spread or sprinkle something, so it's likely that Tiang will use his powers to spread a substance rather than creating an image of a map."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (punika sampun kajengang) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sampun masak punika"" suggests that something has been cooked or prepared, while ""kantun ring tengahing surya"" implies that it is located in the middle of the sky. Therefore, it is more likely that the thing being described will be elevated or floating in mid-air rather than being buried underground."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Tiang nguripang motor) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""nguripang"" in Tagalog means to break or shatter, so it suggests that the engine may have broken or shattered due to some reason. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem compared to Option B (Mesinnyané pane), which simply means ""engine oil leak""."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ia tetep sirep makudang-kudang dina) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ia tetep sirep"" means ""he/she was tired,"" while ""makudang-kudang dina"" means ""the pain in his/her back."" Therefore, the most likely explanation for the person's condition is that they are experiencing back pain due to being tired."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngenyit api ring genah api,"" option A (Tiang kehabisan kayu api) is the more likely cause. This is because the word ""ngenyit"" in Javanese means ""to be empty"" or ""to lack something"", while ""ring"" means ""to burn"". Therefore, it is more likely that there is a lack of fuel or wood to keep the fire burning, rather than the fire being too cold to burn."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun keni kram ring sisin batisnyané) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake istri punika nenten malih malaib-laiban"" suggests that a wife is asking her husband for something, and the word ""kram"" in Option A means ""to ask"". Therefore, it is more likely that the husband is being asked to give something rather than the wife giving something to him."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tetangga tiange ngajakin tiang macelep ka jeroan) is more likely to happen. The word ""ngajakin"" in Javanese means ""to invite"" or ""to call"", so it implies that the neighbor is actively reaching out to the owner of the house with an offer or request. Option B (""Tetanggalan tiange sampun makaon saking jeronnyane"") means ""The neighbor's house was destroyed by a strong wind"", which does not align with the context provided. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Timpalnyane iwang ngresepang pikobetnyane) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""iwang ngresepang pikobetnyane"" suggests that there may have been a sudden and unexpected increase in the number of bets placed on a particular event or outcome, leading to an overwhelming amount of pressure on the bookmaker's system. This could potentially result in technical difficulties or errors, causing delays or cancellations in the betting process. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang sisia nyaurin antuk pasaur sané patut) is a more plausible explanation for why the teacher's voice was heard in the dream of his student. The phrase ""antuk pasaur"" means ""to be heard clearly,"" so it suggests that the teacher's voice was audible and distinct in the student's dream. Option B (Sang sisia nénten purun nyaurin pitaken punika), on the other hand, does not convey the same sense of clarity or distinctness in the teacher's voice. Therefore, option A is a more likely explanation for why the teacher's voice was heard in the student's dream."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun lunga ka una) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the speaker's wife will become pregnant with a child who is not their own biological child. This is a common trope in fantasy stories where characters can have children through magical means or by adopting them from other worlds. Option B (Ipun ka supermarket) does not make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between buying groceries at a supermarket and having a child who is not one's own biological offspring.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nyritayang rahasia ring ipun) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang matemu"" suggests that something is hidden or concealed, and ""sareng timpal"" implies that it will be revealed or uncovered. This implies that the secret will be exposed, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun polih ulam) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""istri punika"" suggests that there may be a conflict or issue within the marriage, which could lead to feelings of jealousy and insecurity. Additionally, the use of the word ""nenten"" implies that the person's emotions are intense and overwhelming, which further supports this interpretation. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's wife has been unfaithful rather than the person themselves being the cause of their own unhappiness."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payungnyané rusak) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the speaker is describing a situation where something has gone wrong or broken, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Sang sané nganggén klik mouse) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Kursor ring layar komputer"" suggests that the user is interacting with a computer screen using a cursor, and ""klik mouse"" means to click the mouse button. Therefore, Option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (went into a major accident) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sang supir raris ngungsi"" suggests that something serious has happened, and the fact that it occurred at the main road implies that it was a significant event. Option B (ipun nututin mobilé ring arepnyané) does not provide enough context to determine the likelihood of the cause. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wastra punika raris tuh) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang ngantungang kain leneng"" suggests that something is hanging loosely or swinging from a string, while ""sane sampun basah ring tali pangangge"" implies that it is wet and heavy. Therefore, the most likely outcome of these two phrases combined would be for the thing to become even heavier due to the water absorption, making option A the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sinar suryane galang pisan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""Anake istri punika"" suggests that there may be a conflict or issue within the family, while ""raris nganggen kacamata"" implies that someone's eyesight has been affected. Therefore, it is possible that the problem is related to a personal conflict or issue rather than just a physical disability like blindness. Option B (Ipun nyambat taksi) does not provide any context or clues that would suggest it as a plausible cause for the problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané mapangapti yéning sampun masan panes) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika tumuli maliat"" suggests that there are many small rocks or pebbles in the area, which could potentially make it difficult for a person to walk through without making noise. This is further supported by the word ""sane,"" which means ""difficult."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is trying to convey that walking through the area will be challenging due to the presence of these small rocks."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang makeneh enggal sirep) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang"" means ""heavenly body,"" while ""makeneh"" means ""to fall."" Therefore, it can be inferred that something from heaven will fall. Option B (Tiang nénten sirep selami punika) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""nénten"" means ""downward"" but does not necessarily imply a falling motion."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I da sampun ngamecikang rambut idane) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""ida sampun ngamecikang rambut idane"" means ""the hair has been tangled and knotted,"" which suggests that the problem is with the hair itself rather than something external to it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anak alit punika nyambut timpalnyane sane anyar) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""alit punika"" means to be angry or upset, while ""timpalnyane"" refers to a person's face. Therefore, the sentence suggests that the child's anger caused their face to become red or flushed. Option B (Anak alit punika nénten seneng ring timpal kelasnyané sané anyar) does not make sense in this context as it implies that the child's anger caused them to smile at something in class, which is unlikely given the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang dot nginem susu"", option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""dot"" in this context suggests that something is being added or mixed into another substance, rather than simply being placed next to it. Therefore, the most likely explanation for ""Tiang dot nginem susu"" is that Tiang is adding a suspension of some kind to the mixture."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Supirné nyunarin lampu) is more likely to occur. The word ""supir"" means ""to suck"", so it's likely that the lamp will be sucked into something rather than being thrown out of a car."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang parkir ring seberang jalan) is more likely to cause a traffic jam than option B (Tiang parkir ring samping pamedal). This is because parking in front of a busy road can block traffic flow and cause congestion, whereas parking next to a building or wall may not have as much of an impact on traffic. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ipun madué blok panulis) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""pangawi punika"" suggests that there is a blockage or obstruction in the pipes, which could prevent water from flowing through them. This is further supported by the mention of ""blok panulis,"" which specifically refers to a blockage in the pipes. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is caused by a physical obstruction in the plumbing system rather than a lack of writing skills."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang nunas mangda prasida mabaos sareng sang sané ngawasin) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. This is because the word ""tiang"" in this context refers to a specific type of tree that is known for its strong roots and ability to withstand heavy winds. Therefore, it is possible that the tree's roots are causing the building to lean or sink into the ground. Option B (Tiang ngicénin nomor identifikasi tiangé) does not provide any information about the root system of the tree and seems unrelated to the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Suaran jelanané nyareng) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the meaning of ""Anginé"" which means ""to be angry or upset"". Therefore, the sentence ""Anginé nyonsot saking jendélané sané mabukak"" can be translated to ""She became angry/upset when she saw her friend's condition."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngilangang lampu) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""ngilangang"" in Indonesian means ""bright"", so it suggests that the light bulb is not functioning properly due to excessive brightness or glare. Option B (Tiang nglempag sekering) does not make sense in this context as ""nglempag"" means ""to shine"" and ""sekering"" means ""hot"". Therefore, option A is the better answer choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngusap-usap awak ring penyingakané) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ring penyingakané"" suggests that there is a blockage or obstruction in the ear canal, which could cause hearing loss or discomfort. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané ngambil kalkulator) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the context of the situation. The speaker is asking for a calculator to solve a math problem, so it makes sense that they would want to use a tool specifically designed for mathematical calculations rather than getting confused or unsure about how to proceed.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bapanne ngentosin popok anake cerik ento) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that a baby's crying can be caused by discomfort or pain from being too hot, which aligns with Option A. Option B (Bapanne ngeling-elingang anake alit punika) does not provide any evidence to support the idea that a baby's crying can be caused by feeling stuffy or congested. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anake alit punika sampun keni Gegésonan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""luh ento ngentungang balon"" suggests that something is being blown or inflated, while ""keni Gegésonan"" means to be filled with air or gas. Therefore, it is more likely that the balloon will expand rather than burst."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Foto-fotone punika dados leleh) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika dados leleh"" suggests that the photo will be able to capture the light from the lamp clearly, indicating a sharp and clear image. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang marasa sepi) is more likely to be the cause of Tiang's absence from the party. The phrase ""marasa sepi"" means ""feeling lonely,"" suggesting that Tiang may have been feeling sad or isolated, leading them to not attend the party. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Titiang marasa degdeg ring manah) is a more plausible explanation for why Tiang's mother is not happy with him than option B (Tiang jejeh pisan). This is because ""marasa"" in Malay means to be unhappy or dissatisfied, while ""jejeh"" means to be angry or upset. Therefore, it makes sense that Tiang's mother would be unhappy with him if he has done something wrong or disappointed her. On the other hand, ""pisan"" means to be confused or disoriented, which does not necessarily imply that Tiang's mother is unhappy with him."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Punika sampun ngisep toya) is more likely. The phrase ""Tiang nglemesin sponsé sané uyah punika"" suggests that something has been done or taken away from someone without their knowledge or consent, which could result in a negative impact or consequence for them. Therefore, option A is the best answer choice because it implies that the person's situation has become worse as a result of something they did not intend or expect."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Resort punika sampun kadagingin) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika raris malayar"" suggests that there are many tourists visiting the island, which could lead to overcrowding and environmental degradation. Additionally, the mention of a ""resort"" implies that there may be infrastructure in place to accommodate these visitors, such as hotels or restaurants, which could contribute to the problem of pollution. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the sea around the island is dirty."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun jejeh teken jarum) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anaké punika sampun madué tato"" suggests that something has been added or mixed into a drink, which could potentially cause harm if it contains poisonous substances like jarum (lead). Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for what might happen next."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang marasa curiga) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""mararian ring arepan umahan tiange"" suggests that something heavy or large is being carried by a person, and the word ""curiga"" implies that it is difficult or challenging for them to do so. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience discomfort or difficulty while carrying the heavy object."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bukti punika nyihnayang dane sareng sami) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""sang sané ngamademang punika"" suggests that there are many factors contributing to the problem, but the main cause is the lack of evidence or proof for the claim being made. Therefore, option A is the best fit for this premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida nenten malih nunas permen) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ida nenten"" means ""to become angry or upset,"" and ""malih"" refers to a feeling of unease or discomfort. Therefore, it suggests that the person may feel annoyed or irritated by something. On the other hand, option B (Dané nyingkahang kafein) does not fit with the context as ""kafein"" is not a word in Indonesian language."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anake luh ento ngenjekin es,"" option A (Ipun ngeles) is more likely to occur. The verb ""ngeles"" means ""to be hidden"" or ""to be concealed,"" so it suggests that something is being kept secret or hidden from view. Option B (Ipun ngeling) means ""to be revealed,"" so it would suggest that something is being made known or exposed. Given the context of the premise, option A is a better fit."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun nénten sirep selami wengi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anak istri punika nganggen"" suggests that there is a problem or conflict involving an husband and wife, and ""nganggen"" can mean ""to go wrong"" or ""to fail"". Therefore, the sentence ""Ipun nénten sirep selami wengi"" means ""The husband and wife have failed each other"", which aligns with the given premise. Option B does not fit as well with the premise, as it implies that someone is trying to persuade or convince another person to do something, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Gunung Punika raris malepuk) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Lava sané medal saking gunung marapi"" suggests that there was an eruption of Mount Marapi, which could potentially lead to lava flowing down its slope. This would result in the formation of a new volcanic cone or peak, as opposed to the existing mountain becoming more active. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun uning ring makasami anake ring pesta punika) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ipun uning"" means ""to make a mess,"" and ""makasami"" means ""to mix."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is suggesting that someone made a mess by mixing things up or causing confusion. This aligns with the context of the conversation, where the speakers are discussing how something got broken in their house. Option B (Dané makeneh matilar saking partai) does not fit as well with the given premise, as ""dané"" means ""to break"" and ""matilar"" means ""to destroy."""
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ipun nglugrain titiang nglintangin genah pamuputan) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""tiang naur"" refers to a parking lot, while ""ring genah"" means ""to be full"". Therefore, it is more likely that the parking lot will be full of cars than for there to be no cars in the parking lot."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané ngadol saham perusahaannyané) is more likely to be the cause of the company's financial difficulties. This is because the phrase ""Sang sané ngenterang punika bangkrut"" suggests that the company has been experiencing a significant decline in sales or revenue, which could lead to financial difficulties if not addressed promptly. In contrast, the second option (""Ia ngura-ura kasugihanne"") does not provide any specific context or evidence to suggest that it is the cause of the company's financial problems. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dokteré sampun cuti) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""anake punika"" suggests that something has happened or is happening to the speaker's body, and the word ""ring"" implies a physical sensation or symptom. The phrase ""dokteré sampun cuti"" means ""the doctor is sleeping,"" which is an unlikely scenario given the context of the conversation. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Umahne ngendih) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""tiang medal saking kamaré"" suggests that there is a blockage or obstruction in the pipe, which could be caused by debris or sediment accumulation. This is further supported by the word ""ngendih,"" which means ""blocked."" Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is caused by a blockage in the pipe rather than a leak in the faucet."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun mandi panjang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Jari-jari punika"" suggests that something has been stretched or elongated, which could refer to a long piece of string. In contrast, ""Dané ngusap tangannyané antuk sabun"" does not make sense in this context and appears to be a nonsensical combination of words. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang nyilurin susu punika,"" option A is more likely. The word ""nyilurin"" means ""to pour or to flow,"" so it's likely that the speaker is referring to the act of pouring milk into a bowl. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang sampun lempas saking bis"", option B is more likely. The phrase ""sampun lempas"" means to miss or fail something, and ""saking bis"" refers to a deadline or appointment. Therefore, it is more likely that Tiang will be late for his meeting or appointment than that he will get a new job at the office."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Truk punika nyansan ngelis) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika"" in Indonesian means ""to hit or collide,"" and ""nyansan"" means ""a loud noise."" Therefore, it is more likely that Truk will make a loud noise when he hits something with his mobile phone than for nothing to happen (option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun sané menang) is more likely to occur. The premise states that Tim has been practicing for a long time and is confident in his abilities, indicating that he will most likely win the competition. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngalinggihin botol punika) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""punika"" in this context refers to a type of bottle used for carbonated drinks, so it is unlikely that the bottles themselves are causing the issue. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nyusup ngeranjing saking jendéla sané mabukak) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""saking jendéla sané mabukak"" suggests that the person's mind is clouded or confused due to excessive alcohol consumption, which can impair their judgment and decision-making abilities. Therefore, it is more likely that they will make poor decisions or act in a way that is not rational or logical."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sang tamiu raris ngampakang lawange) is more likely to happen because it uses a verb that implies action or movement towards something, whereas option B (Anake istri punika ngintip saking bungas korine) uses verbs that imply thought or contemplation without any clear indication of action. Therefore, option A suggests that the speaker will actively try to find out about their husband's infidelity, while option B does not convey such an intention.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun nyuciang) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Anake punika ngletehin panganggennyane"" suggests that something has been taken or stolen from someone's house, and ""ida sampun nyuciang"" means to hide or conceal something. Therefore, it is more likely that the thief will try to hide what they have stolen rather than hang it in a closet."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Upakara punika metu saking tabung) is more likely. The phrase ""punika"" in this context refers to a type of Indonesian traditional medicine that is believed to have healing properties for toothaches. Therefore, it is possible that applying punika to the affected area could help alleviate the pain caused by the toothache. Option B, however, does not make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between rubbing something against the tooth or gum and getting rid of a toothache."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Para pacifist nglaksanayang protes) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""nglaksanayang protes"" suggests a protest or demonstration against something, which aligns with the idea of peaceful resistance in response to war."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun ngiket pita) is the most likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""nguntul talin rambutne"" suggests that there is a blockage or obstruction in the hair follicles, which could be caused by various factors such as dandruff, eczema, or even excessive styling. Option B (Pita punika sakadi anak alit) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the problem and seems to be unrelated to the given premise. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun lingsir) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika sampun"" means ""to be worried or anxious,"" and ""polih operasi plastik"" means ""plastic surgery."" Therefore, it can be inferred that Ida is feeling anxious about undergoing plastic surgery. Option B (Ida nyingakin truna) does not make sense in this context as there is no word for ""truna"" in Indonesian."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Telur punika rarisleb) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""anak ayam sané"" suggests that the subject is a young chicken, while ""alit medal saking jaja"" implies that it has been injured or harmed in some way. The word ""punika"" in Option A means ""to crack or break,"" which fits with the idea of a young chicken being injured. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jadmane punika padem ulihan seduk,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Ida sampun seda."" This is because the phrase ""punika padem"" means to make or do something, and ""seduk"" means to break or destroy. Therefore, the sentence suggests that Jadmane will cause something to be broken or destroyed. Option B, ""Ida malaib,"" does not fit with this meaning as it simply means to go away or leave."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida munggah ring undagan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika nénten malih teggeg"" suggests that something is being pulled or drawn towards a specific location, which aligns with the meaning of ""munggah"" as a pulling or drawing action. Therefore, it is more likely that the object will be pulled towards the location where the force is applied rather than being pushed away from it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak alit punika ngrered,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Dané nginem gelas soda"" (The child spilled milk) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""alit punika"" means ""spilled"" or ""wasted"", which suggests that something was accidentally knocked over or spilled, rather than intentionally poured out. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wenten angin dingin sane nglintik saking jendelane,"" option A (Tiang makenyem) is the most likely effect to occur. This is because the phrase ""wenten angin"" means ""cold wind,"" while ""dingin sane"" means ""cold enough to freeze."" Therefore, it is likely that the cold wind will cause something to freeze or become frozen. Option B (Tiang ngeling) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of anything melting."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Timpal-timpalne ngajiang ipun) is more likely to be the cause of Sisyane's failure in college. The premise suggests that Sisyane has been struggling with her studies due to her lack of focus and motivation, which can be attributed to her impulsive nature. Therefore, it is more plausible that Sisyane's poor academic performance is a result of her own actions rather than external factors such as the value of the scholarship she received.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun meneng ring samping umahne) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake luh ento nganistayang anake muani ento"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone, and ""ipun meneng ring samping umahne"" means to take something without permission or consent. Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is referring to a situation where something was taken away without proper authorization or permission."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngawinang jadmane pada sedih) is more likely to be the cause of Anaké's sadness. The phrase ""seduh"" in the premise suggests that Anaké has been feeling down or depressed, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as personal problems, relationship issues, or even health concerns. In contrast, option B (Ipun nénten madué jinah) does not provide any specific context or reason for Anaké's sadness, making it less plausible as the cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang nelpon timpal tiangé lakar marembug,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""nelpon"" means ""to be angry or upset,"" so it is likely that the speaker is feeling annoyed or frustrated about something related to their work or daily life. Therefore, option A is the best fit for this premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nguntul limané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang"" means ""to hang"" or ""to suspend,"" and ""limané"" means ""in a place."" Therefore, it can be inferred that something will be hung in a specific location. Option B (Tiang ngamplak ipun) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""ngamplak"" means ""to fold"" or ""to bend,"" and ""ipun"" has no clear meaning in this sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang nylempoh"", option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Kembang api punika"" means ""The firefly's light flickers"". Therefore, the complete sentence would be ""Frisbee punika nbergerang nuju sirah tiange"" meaning ""The frisbee's flight flickered in the sky."" Option B does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun rumasa jengah) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""luh ento ngigel kukune"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the engine or motor, possibly causing it to overheat or malfunction. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as worn out parts, poor maintenance, or a faulty design. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang sampun nyatet janji ring kalender) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang sampun"" means ""the moon has set,"" indicating that it is already nighttime or evening time. This implies that the person in question has missed their appointment or meeting, as they were unable to keep track of the calendar due to being busy with other tasks. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why someone might have forgotten an appointment."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané ngicalang pangacara) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""manggihin mungguing rabin"" suggests that something will happen suddenly or unexpectedly, while ""sampun mamitra"" implies a sense of urgency or haste. This combination of words suggests that the event described in the premise may unfold quickly and without warning, which aligns with Option A's description of an unforeseen turn of events. In contrast, Option B's description of a gradual decline does not fit as well with the given premise. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak luh punika ngelidin bola karet punika,"" option A (Bola punika magingsir) is the most likely outcome. The word ""magingsir"" means to be swollen or inflated, so it suggests that the ball will expand or grow in size due to the impact of the kick. Option B (Bola punika menyinar) means the ball will shine brightly, but it does not convey the same sense of expansion or growth as option A. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané sampun uning ring pasaut pitakén punika) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sampun uning ring"" means ""to take or get something by force,"" while ""pita ken punika"" means ""to be taken away."" Therefore, it can be inferred that Dané will use force to take the ring from its owner. Option B (Dané ngusapin pasautnyané) does not convey a clear meaning in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pamain punika ngebug musuhnyané,"" it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Lawannyané ngrebut pas."" This is because the word ""punika"" in Indonesian means to attack or assault someone, while ""musuhnya"" means enemy. Therefore, the sentence suggests that the speaker's enemy has been attacked or harmed."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun sampun pada lingsir) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tiang nyemak tomat"" suggests that something has been poured or mixed into a pot, while ""saking punyan anggur"" implies that the mixture is now boiling or bubbling. This could indicate that the liquid inside the pot is heating up or reaching a boil point, which would be consistent with Option A. On the other hand, Option B (""Tiang sane nyiram"") does not provide any clear indication of what might be happening to the liquid in the pot. Therefore, based solely on the given premise, Option A seems like the more plausible explanation for why the pot is making noise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané matemu sareng mantan pacarnya) is more likely to happen because it implies that she will be thinking about her ex-boyfriend and possibly still having feelings for him, rather than just eating a chocolate ring.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Tiang ng lempagin termometer) is more likely to be the correct answer. The passage states that ""Merkuri ring termometeré nincap"" which means that Mercury's ring temperature is not accurate. This suggests that the thermometer used to measure the temperature of Mercury's ring may not have been functioning properly, rather than the temperature itself being incorrect. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the temperature reading was incorrect."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Atap gedung pengadilan é kabakar) is more likely to happen because it mentions ""gedung pengadilan"" which is a building that is commonly associated with legal proceedings, and ""kabakar"" which means ""to collapse"". Therefore, if there is an earthquake, it is more likely for the court building to collapse than for the city's edge to be eroded away by the sea."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sapunika taler pikolihnyané) is more likely to occur. The word ""pikolihnyané"" means ""to be confused or disoriented,"" so it suggests that Sisyane may have difficulty understanding or remembering things due to her age. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang raris matedoh ring tanahe) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang marasa nyaman"" suggests that something is uncomfortable or bothersome, while ""tiang raris matedoh ring tanahe"" means ""the mattress is too hard."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker finds the mattress too hard rather than feeling comfortable."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngetep batu punika"", it is more likely that option A will occur - Punika dados licin. The word ""licin"" means ""to crack or break"". Therefore, when a rock (batu) gets hit by a falling object (tiang), it is likely to crack or break."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngwewehin gula ka kopiné,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer because it uses a word that means ""sweet"" in Thai language, whereas option B does not use any words related to sweetness. Therefore, option A is more likely to convey the intended meaning of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia polih tatu ring kertas) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika sedekan"" suggests that the letters are written in a cursive style, which would result in a smudged or blurred appearance if they were written with too much pressure on the paper. Therefore, it is more likely that the writer will accidentally smudge or blur the letters while writing them, rather than simply forgetting how to write them."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Taru punika raris menek ring tarune) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""raris menek"" suggests that something will be taken or carried away by a powerful force, such as water or wind. In this context, it is unlikely that kuku (chicken) would be able to escape from the situation. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang pangangon raris nyaring ulam punika) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb that means ""to swallow"" or ""to gobble up,"" which implies a quick and sudden action. The second option (Sang nelayan malih ngenahang tali) uses verbs that mean ""to fish"" and ""to tie,"" which do not convey the same sense of urgency or rapid movement as the first option. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun sampun polih jerawat) is more likely to be the cause of Anaké's headache. The premise suggests that Anaké has been feeling irritable and restless due to her schoolwork, which could be causing stress and tension in her body leading to a headache. Polishing one's nails is not typically associated with causing headaches, so option B (Ipun ngicalang kawat gigi) is less likely to be the cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wajah tiange ngeling,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang polih gatra sane becik"" means ""the face becomes red due to excessive heat."" This suggests that the person's face may become flushed or red due to exposure to high temperatures, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as sunburn, fever, or allergies. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngusap lima tiangé aji towel,"" option A (Towel punika basah) is the most likely cause. The word ""basah"" means wet or damp in Malay, so it's possible that the towel was accidentally left outside during a rainstorm and became wet."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bangku punika magentos dados lawat) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""punika"" in this context suggests that something has been stuck or caught, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as debris, dust, or other obstructions. It's unlikely that the chair would simply collapse without any obvious reason, so it's more plausible that there is an obstruction causing the issue rather than the chair being damaged beyond repair."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun kalah ring partai) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the speaker is discussing a political or social issue rather than a sports competition. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to a loss in an election or political race rather than a defeat in a sports match.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nyesel teken iwang tiange) is the more likely cause of the effect. The phrase ""tiang nyesel"" means ""the sky is cloudy,"" while ""teken"" means ""to cover."" Therefore, option A suggests that the clouds are covering the sun, which is a plausible reason for the darkness during the daytime. Option B (Tiang sampun prasida muputang tatujon tiange), on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as it implies that the moon is shining brightly during the daytime, which is not possible."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida Nakénin Indik Ragane) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake istri punika"" suggests that there is a problem or issue with the wife's family, and ""raris nyesel ring timpalnyane"" implies that someone is trying to hide something from the husband. Therefore, it is possible that the husband has discovered something suspicious about his wife's family and is now investigating further. Option B (Ipun Tan Mari Maosang Indik Deweknyane) does not fit as well with the given premise, as it only mentions the husband being curious about his wife's family without providing any specific details or context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Panakne masem) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""luh ento ngeling masesambatan"" suggests that there will be a lot of rain, which could cause flooding or other weather-related problems. Option B (Cucuk-cucuknyane sampun kanten) does not necessarily imply any specific effects from the rain. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Punika nglin-tangin tam-bang) is a more plausible cause for the explosion than option B (Dane raris malayar ka pasi). This is because ""Kapal musuhé meledak"" suggests that an enemy attacked the ship with a weapon or device, causing it to explode. The phrase ""punika nglintangin tam-bang"" means ""the attack of the enemy's weapon,"" further supporting this interpretation. In contrast, ""dane raris malayar ka pasi"" does not provide any clear indication of how the ship was damaged or destroyed. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the explosion based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I da macelep ka guleme sane mawarna gadang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake punika ngenahang batisnyane"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their knowledge or consent, which aligns with Option A's meaning of ""I da macelep ka guleme sane mawarna gadang,"" which translates to ""I took your thing without your permission."" Therefore, Option A is a more plausible interpretation of the given premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Ipun manggihin identitas sang sané ngamademang ipun.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the detective will try to hide their own identity rather than reveal the criminal's identity. The phrase ""ngamademan ipun"" suggests that the detective wants to keep their true identity hidden from the criminal, while the word ""manggihin"" implies a sense of secrecy or concealment. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngambil jalan keliling) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Akeh weten lalu lintas ring margi"" suggests that there are many obstacles or challenges in the way of achieving one's goals, and ""tiang ngambil jalan keliling"" means to take a detour around those obstacles. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will choose to take a detour rather than facing the challenges head-on."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Akah anak Sané sungkan) is more likely to occur as a result of the economic crisis in Malaysia. The phrase ""sungkan"" means ""to be lazy or unproductive,"" so it suggests that the youth may become less motivated or productive due to the economic situation. Option B (Akah kramané Sané keni PHK) does not make sense in this context, as there is no logical connection between the economic crisis and the youth's ability to speak English fluently."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun jagi mamargi nglintang ring tengah margi) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""nglintang ring tengah margi"" suggests that there is a conflict or disagreement within the family, which could lead to the child's behavior. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ida nuturang kasujatiannyane ring tiang) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""tiang makenyem sareng timpal tiange"" suggests that there is a crack or fissure in the foundation of the building, which could be caused by poor construction or wear and tear over time. Option B (Dané maosang antuk rasa sané nyindir) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the problem and seems unrelated to the context of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang supir macemplung ring margine) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""macemplung ring margine"" suggests that the driver may be experiencing a sudden loss of control or instability while driving, which could lead to a crash or accident. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anake istri punika raris ngembasang putra,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""punika"" means ""sick"" or ""ill,"" so it is likely that Anake's wife is sick rather than pregnant with a son."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngicalang topéngnyané) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""topi anaké punika raris ical"" suggests that there is a problem with the roof of a house, and ""ida ngicalang topéngnyané"" means ""to repair or fix something."" Therefore, it makes sense that the most likely cause of the problem is a leak in the roof. Option B (""Ring jaba tengahé wénten angin"") does not provide any information about the cause of the problem and seems unrelated to the context given."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun polih undangan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the birthday party invitation has been sent out, indicating that preparations have already been made for the party. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be any last-minute changes or additions to the party, such as changing the venue or giving away new gifts.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Biangnyané ngukur suhu ragané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""biangnyané"" means ""to boil or steam"", and ""ngukur"" means ""to cook"". Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker's rice will be cooked thoroughly and become soft and fluffy. Option B (Biangnyané ngajakin ipun ka taman) does not make sense in this context as ""ngajakin"" means ""to plant"" and ""ipun"" means ""a garden"", so it cannot be related to cooking rice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané meled ngaé kesan sané becik ring anak sané sareng ipun mapesta) is the more likely cause. The premise suggests that the reason why Anake's mother does not want her to play with oil is because it can damage her skin and make it look old and wrinkly. This implies that Anake's mother values appearance and wants to protect her daughter's youthful looks. Option B (Ida ngenahang gel ring bok idane) does not provide a clear explanation for why Anake's mother would forbid her from playing with oil.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngrereh lampu suluh) is more likely to occur as a result of the situation described in the scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Putrané sampun tamat SMA) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that Kulawargannyane has not yet graduated from high school, indicating that he is still a student. Therefore, it is unlikely that he has already gotten married and had children. Option B (Biangne ngembasang anak kembar) is therefore less likely to be true.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané meled ngirit energi) is more likely to be the cause of the runner's fatigue during a marathon race. The phrase ""mamargi alon-alon"" suggests that the runner has depleted their energy reserves, which can occur due to intense physical exertion over an extended period like a marathon race. Option B (Ipun nyingakin garis finish) does not provide any context or explanation for the runner's fatigue, making it less plausible as the cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (mesin punika nyiram jinah punika) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The use of an automatic vending machine without proper maintenance can lead to malfunctioning or breakdowns, resulting in the dispensing of incorrect products or quantities. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Asu timpal tiangé padem"", option A (Tiang nglek-elekang paningalan tiange) is more likely to occur. This is because the word ""tiang"" in Malay means ""to hang"" or ""to suspend"", and the phrase ""paningalan tiange"" means ""suspended"". Therefore, it is likely that something has been hung or suspended from a tree branch. Option B (Tiang ngrangkul ipun) does not make sense in this context as ""ngrangkul"" means ""to break"" or ""to shatter"", and ""ipun"" means ""a piece of wood""."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun nyurat surat utang) is more likely to occur. This is because when a business owner's credit card debt becomes overwhelming, they may choose to ignore their debts or avoid paying them off altogether, leading to a build-up of unpaid bills and negative impacts on their financial health.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anake punika keni temah Ida Sang Hyang Widi Wasa,"" option A (Ida ngetep kuku) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the meaning of the phrase ""punika keni temah"" which means to question or doubt something. Therefore, in this context, ""Ida ngetep kuku"" makes sense as a possible response."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Adinnyane masogsag sareng reramannyane) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""masogsag sareng reramannyane"" means ""the teacher's teaching method is not effective,"" indicating that the teacher's approach may not be suitable for the students. Therefore, it is more likely that the teacher's ineffective teaching methods are causing the students to have difficulty understanding the material rather than any other factor such as a lack of interest or motivation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak alit punika meled uning indik tata surya,"" option B (Ipun nlektekang bintang-bintang) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the idea of a child looking up at the stars in wonder. The phrase ""meled uning indik tata surya"" suggests that the child is gazing upwards towards the sky, which is where the stars are located. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate response."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngenahang poster punika ring duur jelanan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ring duur jelanan"" suggests that the poster has been damaged or affected by something, which could potentially cause it to lose its stickiness or adhesive properties. Therefore, it is more likely that the poster would peel off easily rather than the ring being stuck to the poster."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Arsitek sané ngwangun wangunan punika) is more likely to happen because it implies that the architect will design a building with a unique shape that reflects the client's personality. This suggests that the architect has creative freedom to come up with an innovative design that stands out from other buildings. Option B (Arsitek nyaluyukeun rencana), on the other hand, does not convey any specific or unique aspect of the architect's work.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tanganipune nglincak) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""punika"" in the premise suggests that something has been stuck or caught, which could be caused by a tangled or knotted object. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem was caused by something getting stuck inside the pipe rather than the pipe itself being damaged."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dewan direksi ngabubarin perusahaan punika) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngabubarin perusahaan"" implies that the directors are responsible for managing the company's finances, which suggests that they have a significant influence over the company's financial decisions. Therefore, it is more likely that the directors would be involved in making decisions about how to handle the company's debt rather than leaving it entirely up to the CEO."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang raris negak ring samping) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang telat rauh"" implies that something has been delayed or postponed, while ""ring kuliah"" suggests that there is a schedule or timetable involved. Therefore, it is more likely that Tiang will be late for class than he will advance his studies by skipping classes altogether."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kulawargannyane naur kaulegan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake punika raris kabebasang saking pangkenge"" suggests that something has been taken away from someone without their knowledge or consent, which aligns with the meaning of ""kulawargannyane"". Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kulawargan danene makasami sampun padem,"" option A (Ipun ngadol umahnyané) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""ngadol umahnyané"" suggests that something has been added to the mixture, making it thicker or heavier than usual. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as overmixing or adding an excessive amount of ingredients. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the mixture might not be working properly."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kaléng punika sampun ka-recycle) is more likely to occur. The word ""kaléng"" in this context refers to a container or package, and ""sampun"" means recycle. Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is suggesting that the aluminum containers will be recycled rather than disposed of as trash."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun malajah nganggén komputer) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ipun malajah"" means ""to be unable to use"" or ""to have difficulty with,"" while ""nganggén"" means ""computer."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the person will have trouble using a computer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang mirengang musik) is more likely to be the cause of Ras's happiness. The phrase ""rasa bagia sané"" suggests a feeling of joy or contentment, which could be triggered by listening to music. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun ngicen ajengan ring anak sane tan madue umah) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ipun ngicen"" means ""to make a child cry,"" so it suggests that the person's charity will have a negative impact on the child. This contradicts the idea of charity being beneficial for those in need, which is the opposite of what the premise implies. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para panumpangé sami makenyem) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""makenyem"" means ""to hang loosely,"" which suggests that the object will be suspended in mid-air without any support. This is consistent with the idea of a ghostly figure floating through a room. Option B (Para panumpangé sami jerit-jerit) means ""to swing back and forth,"" which does not fit as well with the image of a ghostly figure floating through a room. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang pedih pisan"", option A is more likely. This is because the word ""pedih"" means ""sour"" in Indonesian, which suggests that the person's face may be contorted or distorted due to discomfort or pain. Option B does not convey this same meaning and is therefore less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida lunga ka kaler) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Anake punika"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, while ""mamanah ngantenang"" implies a sense of longing or yearning for what has been lost. Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker will feel sadness or regret upon realizing that their loved one is no longer with them. Option B (Ida bangun semengan) does not fit well with this context as it means ""I woke up early,"" which doesn't convey any emotional state related to losing someone important."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang sampun ngaresik paper punika) is more likely to occur. The word ""sampun"" in Indonesian means ""to fold"", so it's possible that the person will fold the paper into smaller pieces before throwing it away. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (pamimpin saking panegara tiosan raris ngirim bantuan darurat) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngirim bantuan darurat"" means ""to provide immediate aid,"" indicating that the leader's actions are focused on providing immediate support in response to the disaster. This suggests that the leader is prioritizing short-term relief efforts over long-term planning or strategic thinking. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I will take a medal in swimming) is more likely. The sentence ""Busanan anake alit punika beseh pisan"" suggests that Busanan has already achieved something impressive, implying that she has won a medal in swimming. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Punika patuk katurang malih ring perpustakaan) is the more likely cause of the problem. The sentence ""Sang sisia gelis-gelis muputang cakepannyané"" suggests that there is a buildup of dust or dirt inside the bookshelf, which could be causing the books to fall off. Option B (Ida nyilih saking timpal) does not provide any context or explanation for why the books are falling off the shelf. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun kaprentah mangda ngranjing ka pangkenge) is more likely to be the cause of Jadmane's death. The phrase ""mangda ngranjing"" suggests that Jadmane was killed by a sharp object, such as a knife or sword, which aligns with Option A. Option B (Ida katiwakin danda antuk ngamademang anak) does not provide any information about the cause of Jadmane's death and seems unrelated to the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngampakang gorden) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Sinar suryane nyunarin kamar punika"" suggests that something has been hidden or covered up, and ""gorden"" means to cover or conceal. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to hiding or covering something up rather than revealing or exposing it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wignyané sampun ical) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Tiang nguntul rambutné sané mapi-mapi"" suggests that something heavy or burdensome has been placed on top of a person's hair, causing it to become tangled and difficult to manage. This could potentially lead to headaches or discomfort, but it does not necessarily imply that their hair will fall out completely. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida nyingakin manuskrip punika becik pisan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the editor cannot read the handwriting of the manuscript, indicating that it may be illegible or difficult to decipher. This suggests that the editor may have difficulty understanding what the writer intended to convey through their handwriting, leading them to make mistakes in editing the text. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the editor made errors while editing the manuscript.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun uning kartu punika ical) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""Anak istri punika ngicalang kartu kreditnya"" suggests that the child's wife has been unable to pay off her credit card debt, which could indicate a financial struggle for the family. Option B (Ipun uning kartu punika sampun kadaluwarsa) means ""The credit card bill was paid late,"" which does not align with the initial premise given. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ipun raris marabian) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""anak istri punika"" suggests that there is a conflict or problem within the marriage, which could lead to feelings of jealousy and insecurity among the spouses. This could result in one of them seeking comfort from someone else, such as a friend or colleague, leading to an affair. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngeningang munyinne) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Musiké punika nénten becik kapiragi"" suggests that there will be a lot of noise and confusion in the area where the music is being played, which could potentially disrupt or interfere with other sounds nearby. Option B (Tiang makarya lagu padidi) does not provide any specific information about the potential effects of the music on surrounding sounds, so it cannot be determined whether this option is more likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Rambut anake alit punika sampun tegeh"", option A (Anake luh ento ngae usak) is the more likely cause. The word ""alit"" in the premise means ""to sweat"", so it is likely that the person's hair was wet due to excessive sweating rather than being covered in dust or dirt."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nyiram dewek tiangé antuk racun serangga) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that there are many insects in the tree, indicating a high likelihood of pests or diseases being present. Option B (Tiang ngampetang i lutung) does not provide any context related to pests or diseases, making it less likely as an explanation for why the tree is dying.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang nglekang paningalan"", option A (Tiang bangun) is the most likely cause. This is because ""nglekan"" means to shake or tremble, and ""paningalan"" means a small earthquake. Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the small earthquake is the movement of the mountain itself rather than any external factor such as a volcanic eruption."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngidihtekén ia apang ia ngutang) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the person will buy a new phone with their own money, rather than buying a CD for someone else's benefit. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nénten ja ngetangang jinah) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""Kulawargan danene kalintang tiwas"" suggests that there are many factors contributing to the problem of poverty in Indonesia, including lack of access to education and limited job opportunities. Option A reflects this idea by suggesting that one possible solution to addressing poverty is through education and training programs that can help individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability. In contrast, option B focuses solely on the minimum wage issue and does not take into account other potential causes or solutions to poverty. Therefore, option A is a more comprehensive and plausible response to the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané ngrereh pakaryan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Sisyane punika muputang masekolah ring universitas"" suggests that the speaker is experiencing regret or dissatisfaction with their current academic situation at university. This implies that they are unlikely to be enjoying themselves or having fun in this context. Therefore, option A is a more plausible response."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lukisané punika nglilit sahananing genah) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""Sang seniman ngacampur cat"" means ""The artist mixes colors,"" indicating that the painting will have a blended or mixed color scheme. The word ""nglilit"" in this context suggests a gradual transition from one color to another, rather than a sharp contrast between two distinct colors. Therefore, it is more likely that the painting will have a smooth and subtle color progression, as suggested by Option A."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang nénten malih polih napi-napi) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""malih polih napi-napi"" suggests that there are many small problems accumulating over time, rather than a single major issue. Therefore, it is more plausible that the problem is caused by a series of minor mistakes or issues, rather than a single catastrophic event."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang nyambut dane mawali ka umah tiange) is more likely to happen. This is because ""tiang"" in Indonesian means ""to dream"", so it implies that Adin will have a vivid dream about his house being demolished. The phrase ""nyambut dane"" means ""to be swept away by something"", which suggests that Adin's dream will be intense and overwhelming. Finally, the phrase ""ka umah tiange"" means ""your house will be destroyed"", which confirms that Adin's dream will involve the destruction of his home. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (adegan pangawit drama punika kakawitin) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""panggung"" in Indonesian refers to a stage or performance, and ""kakawitin"" means to be jealous or envious. Therefore, it can be inferred that there may be a conflict or rivalry among performers on stage. Option B (para pelakuné sané maplalian medal saking panggung) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""pelakuné"" means to compete or fight, but the word ""medal"" does not fit with the theme of a stage performance."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang sané ngejuk ngacem pacang nyakitin sandera) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sang sané"" refers to a person who has been hurt or injured, while ""ngacem"" means to feel pain or discomfort. Therefore, the sentence suggests that the person's injury may have caused them to experience physical pain. Option B (Sang sané ngejuk nyerah panjaké padidi) does not make sense in this context as it implies that the person's injury was caused by something else entirely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang musisi raris ngempak cokornyane) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""raris punika"" suggests that something has been taken or borrowed from someone else's work, which aligns with the idea of a musician taking credit for another person's composition without permission. This is a common issue in the music industry where artists may take credit for others' works without proper authorization or compensation. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anak alit punika bangun jerit-jerit ulian ngugut) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that anak alit (a child who has just learned to walk) will have difficulty walking due to their lack of experience and coordination, leading them to stumble or fall frequently. This is a common occurrence among young children learning to walk, and it is not uncommon for them to become frustrated or upset if they are unable to do so successfully. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun embas sadurung masane) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""anake istri punika"" suggests that there are two people involved in the situation, with one person (the wife) being punished or blamed for something. This implies that there may have been a conflict or disagreement between the two individuals, leading to the wife's punishment. Option B (Ipun mula belog ngawit saking wau lekad) does not provide any context or information about the relationship between the two individuals involved, making it less likely as an explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Toyane punika raris keni pinakit) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ring wewidangan punika"" suggests that there will be a lot of noise, which could cause discomfort or disturbance for those around it. Therefore, it is more likely that someone would try to find a way to block out the noise rather than trying to hear it better."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Buroné punika malaib) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the cat will eat a mouse. The phrase ""malaib"" in Indonesian means mouse, so this option is more plausible than option B (Buroné punika ngejuk cacing), which translates to ""the cat will swallow a worm."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sekolahne sampun tutup ring musim panas) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The sentence ""Anake luh punika magentos sekolah"" suggests that there is a lack of interest in school among students, which could lead to poor academic performance or low attendance rates during hot weather. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sang sané nuénang genah punika raris nyelik manajer anyar) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb form that indicates an action happening in the present tense, which suggests that the effect is currently occurring or will soon occur. In contrast, option B (Para pagawé punika mogbog) uses a verb form that indicates an action happened in the past tense, which would suggest that the effect has already occurred or is no longer happening. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (para ekstremis punika ngawinang dane keni pengaruh) is more likely to occur. The premise suggests that extreme ideologies can have a significant impact on people's beliefs and behaviors, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (pasir macet ring cokor tiange) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""macet ring cokor tiange"" means that the sea is rough and choppy, indicating a stormy weather condition. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang ngrangsuk baju renang) is more likely to occur because it is a logical consequence of the situation described in the premise. The phrase ""tingin dingin"" suggests that something cold has been placed near or on top of the ring, causing it to feel uncomfortable or painful. Given this context, it makes sense that the person might try to remove the cold object by wriggling their finger out of its grasp. Option B (Tiang nginem yeh sakecap) does not fit as well with the given premise and seems less likely to occur."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Putran danene raris mesem-mesem ring anake istri punika) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that a man's wife has left him for another man, which implies that there was already a problematic relationship between them. Therefore, it is more likely that the husband felt insecure or threatened by his wife's attention towards another man rather than feeling happy about it.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang ngunciin celana jeans) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang"" in Indonesian means ""to break or crack,"" so it suggests that the jeans are broken or cracked. Option B (Tiang nylempoh ring trotoar) does not make sense in this context as ""nylempoh"" means ""ring"" in Indonesian, and ""trotoar"" means ""sidewalk."" Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun polih karesikan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika nganggén kawat gigi"" suggests that Anaké's teeth are loose and could potentially fall out, which aligns with Option A. Option B (Gigi-gigi ipune dados tegak) does not make sense in this context as it implies that Anaké's teeth will be stuck together instead of falling out."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ring rahinane mangkin tiang bangun sareng otot sané sakit) is more likely to occur. The premise suggests that wearing a ring can cause pain in the ears, which is consistent with the known effects of ringing in the ears or tinnitus. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para sisia sané lianan raris negak ring mejane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ring mejane"" suggests that there will be a conflict or disagreement between two parties, and ""raris negak"" means ""to make angry"". Therefore, it can be inferred that one party may become angry or upset due to the conflict. Option B (Para sisia sané lianan ring mejane marasa kawedarang) does not provide any additional information about the likelihood of anger or conflict occurring."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun raris makeber) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""anak alit punika"" suggests that something small and lightweight has been thrown or launched into the air, while ""raris ulung ring trampolin"" implies that it will bounce or spring back upwards. This combination of phrases suggests that the object may not have enough momentum to travel a long distance after being thrown, but rather will rebound quickly back towards its original position. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that kantor pos punika ngater surate punika (Option A). This is because ""punika"" means ""to be delayed or postponed"", so it is likely that the letter will not arrive at its destination in a timely manner if it is sent through the post office."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia ngéncolang sakancan pipisné) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sang pangjudi punika"" suggests that the person has been gambling excessively, which can lead to financial problems and bankruptcy. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience financial difficulties rather than becoming rich overnight."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Angin punika sayan mangetang) is a more plausible cause for the fire than option B (Para pamedek sané ngembak geni punika raris kapanggihin). The phrase ""mangetang"" suggests that the fire started suddenly and unexpectedly, without any apparent cause. This is consistent with the idea of an uncontrolled fire starting due to strong winds or other external factors. In contrast, option B implies that the fire was caused by something inside the house, such as a spark from a lit candle or a malfunctioning electrical appliance. While this could be a possible cause, it seems less likely based on the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Biangnyané ngandikayang ipun ka kamarnyané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngandikayang"" means ""to peel off"" or ""to remove,"" while ""ipun"" means ""skin."" Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker wants to remove someone's skin. This is a violent and harmful act, making option A the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ida sampun ngardi surat wasiat) is more likely to be the cause of her illness. The phrase ""punika sampun"" suggests that she has been experiencing severe abdominal pain, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as inflammation or infection. However, the mention of ""saging pinakitnyane"" specifically refers to the swelling of the abdomen, which is often associated with obstruction or blockage in the intestines. Therefore, it is more likely that Ida's illness is related to an obstruction or blockage in her digestive system rather than a transplant failure."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngigel bibih tiangé) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang ngigel"" means ""to make something bigger or more intense,"" while ""bibih"" means ""to increase."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the coffee will become stronger as a result of adding sugar. Option B (Tiang ngubadin basang tiange) does not convey this meaning and seems less plausible based on the given context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pangawi punika nénten pisan minayang ring carita-caritannyané) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. This is because the phrase ""pangawi punika"" refers to a type of witchcraft or magic that involves manipulating objects or people through supernatural means, while ""minayang ring carita-caritannyané"" suggests that something has been done to disrupt the natural order of things. Therefore, it is possible that someone has used pangawi punika to manipulate events in such a way as to create the current situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Titiang marasa lemet pisan"", option A (Tiang sirep sedina muput) is the more likely cause. The word ""sirep"" in this context means to be tired or exhausted, so it is likely that Tiang is feeling tired due to his busy schedule."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nentuang gejala pasien) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Dokter sané"" suggests that a doctor is involved in the situation, and ""nentuang gejala"" means ""to feel symptoms"". Therefore, it can be inferred that the patient is experiencing symptoms or signs of an illness, which is consistent with the role of a doctor in diagnosing and treating patients. Option B (Dané nyuratang pil ring pasien) does not fit as well with the given premise, as ""nyuratang"" means ""to take medicine"", but there is no indication in the premise that the patient has taken any medication."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngigel kulit tiange,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""ngigel"" means to scratch or rub, so it is more likely that the cause of the redness around the eyes is due to excessive rubbing or scratching, rather than a reaction to something in the environment."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Dané nénten purun malih) is the correct answer. The phrase ""punika kagentosin"" suggests that Anaké has a fever, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including an infection or inflammation. However, the phrase ""purun malih"" specifically refers to a high fever, which is consistent with the symptoms of a severe illness such as pneumonia. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for Anaké's condition."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tangannyane sane lem et"", option A (Ida ngalinggihin tangan Idane) is the most likely cause. This is because the word ""tangannyane"" means to stretch or expand, while ""lemet"" means to break or shatter. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's hand will stretch or expand to avoid breaking something than for their hand to speak or make sounds."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I will dig a pit) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Anake punika tumuli ngeling,"" which means ""Anak said he would dig a hole."" Therefore, it is more likely that Anak will actually dig a hole rather than run away with the money (option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang practically impossible to find a job) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in this premise suggest that finding a job is extremely difficult or nearly impossible, which aligns with the theme of struggle and hardship in the story. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané ngawitin olahraga sané akéh) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""Anake punika"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual has happened, and ""raris suud nginem"" implies that there are many people involved in the event. Therefore, it makes sense that they would be engaging in some form of physical activity, such as playing sports, rather than simply waking up early for work. Option B (Dané ngawitin bangun sadurungé semengan) does not fit this context as well since it refers to waking up early for work, which may not be relevant in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sawatek anake sane nyedayang ipun sami pada padem) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""sawatek anake"" means ""to be angry with someone,"" and ""nyedayang"" means ""to hit or beat."" Therefore, it is likely that the person will become angry and hit or beat their spouse. Option B (""Sang sané ngamademang dané ngawitin ngwedar rah"") does not convey this same meaning and is therefore less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anake punika nenten ja dados) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""punika nenten"" means to be angry or upset, while ""dados"" refers to a person's stomach. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is experiencing stomach discomfort due to anger or upset rather than a snake bite."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané manggihin bikul ring baskom) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""sang sane madue unahe punika"" suggests that there is a buildup of something in the pipes, which could be caused by debris or sediment accumulating over time. This is supported by the word ""bikul,"" which means ""debris"" or ""sediment."" Therefore, it is more likely that the blockage is due to debris or sediment accumulation rather than an insect infestation."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang sampun leteh pisan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngajakin tamiun tiange"" suggests that something has been stuck or caught in the pipe, which could be caused by a buildup of debris or other obstructions. This is consistent with the idea of ""tiang sampun leteh pisan,"" where the pipe becomes clogged due to excessive grease or food particles accumulating inside it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané ngawitin nyelehin buku harian punika) is more likely to happen. This is because the phrase ""luh ento nepukin adinnyane"" suggests that something has been written in a book, and ""ngawacen buku harianne"" means to erase or remove something from a diary. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will try to erase what was written in the diary rather than create a new entry."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané makarya lembur) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""anake istri punika"" suggests that the speaker's wife has been unfaithful, which could lead to feelings of jealousy and insecurity. This emotion can manifest as a desire for revenge or retribution, which aligns with the meaning of ""makarya lembur"". Option B (Dané ngutang pakaryannyané) does not fit this context as it means ""I will kill you"", which is a much more extreme and violent response than what is implied by the original premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngusud panci sané ngendih) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Jaripune raris engsek"" suggests that something has been taken away or lost, and ""panci sané ngendih"" means ""to take something away"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to a situation where something was taken away from them rather than being given to someone else. Option B (Ida ngusap-usapin muncuk asu punika) does not fit with this context and seems unlikely based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (ipun ngedum survei ring para pelanggan) is more likely to be effective in increasing customer satisfaction. Here's why:

1. Surveys provide valuable insights: Conducting surveys can help businesses gather valuable insights into their customers' needs, preferences, and expectations. By understanding these factors, businesses can tailor their products or services to better meet their customers' requirements, leading to increased satisfaction.
2. Personalized approach: Surveys allow businesses to collect data from a large number of customers, providing them with a comprehensive view of their customers' opinions. This information can then be used to create personalized marketing campaigns that cater specifically to each individual customer's needs, resulting in higher satisfaction levels.
3. Cost-effective: Compared to other methods such as advertising or promotions, conducting surveys is relatively cost-effective. Businesses can reach a larger audience without incurring significant expenses, making it an attractive option for improving customer satisfaction.
4. Improved decision-making: The insights gathered through surveys can inform decision-making processes, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions that are more likely to lead to improved customer satisfaction. By analyzing survey responses, businesses can identify areas where they need to improve and take corrective action accordingly.

In conclusion, based on the given premise, option B (conducting surveys) is more likely to be effective in increasing customer satisfaction compared to option A (offering discounts)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Anaké punika ngentungang bantal-bantal saking sofa) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""saking sofa"" suggests that Anaké is trying to get comfortable while sitting on the couch, which implies that she is relaxing or taking a break. This is consistent with the idea of feeling tired after working hard all day. Option B (Anake alit punika nglempag kursi ring tanahe) does not fit as well with the context provided in the premise, as it refers to Anaké leaning back on her chair, which would not necessarily indicate that she is feeling tired."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Meseh titiange nganistayang titiang) is a more plausible explanation for why the dog's tail is curly than option B (Meseh tiange ngambel tungked). This is because the phrase ""tiang ngindarin"" suggests that the dog's tail has been twisted or bent in some way, which could potentially result in it being curled up at the end. In contrast, option B does not provide any clear reason as to how the dog's tail became curly. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Punika katempuh antuk kilap) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""patung sané kasub punika"" suggests that something has been damaged or harmed, and ""katempuh antuk kilap"" means to be covered in dust or dirt. Therefore, it is possible that the statue was damaged by being covered in dust or dirt."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Woh punika ngasilang wiji) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang ngutang buah-buahan"" suggests that something is being pulled or stretched, which could result in a tearing or breaking of the fruit. This is further reinforced by the word ""ngasilang,"" which means ""to break apart."" Therefore, it is more likely that the fruit will break apart when subjected to this force rather than simply floating away."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida nguntul antuk jrijin cokor idane) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Sang penari balé punika ngusak ligamen"" suggests that there was a collision or impact between two things, and the word ""antuk"" in Option A means ""to hit or collide."" Therefore, it is more likely that the cause of the damage is due to an external force hitting the car's body rather than any internal failure within the car itself."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané malajah ngiket) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngiket"" means ""to be lazy,"" so it suggests that the person may be avoiding their responsibilities or tasks due to laziness. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngwaliang bukune punika) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang rumasa angob"" suggests that something has been poured into a container or vessel, while ""pisan ring cakepan"" implies that the substance inside the container is not solid but rather liquid or soft. Therefore, it is more likely that the substance will spill out of the container than for it to be compressed inward."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Meme bapannyane ngicen panglalah) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ngicen panglalah"" suggests that the issue is related to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of religious teachings, which could lead to conflicts within the community. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Gasnyané sampun telas) is the more likely cause of the problem. The word ""sampun"" in this context suggests that something has been filled or inflated beyond its capacity, which could be caused by a gas leak. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ajengan es punika sampun nénten malih ngerasayang rasané) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""punika"" means ""to boil or simmer,"" while ""sampun"" means ""cooked through."" Therefore, it is more likely that the food will be cooked thoroughly rather than just heated up quickly in a microwave oven."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Karpeté punika sakadi Kotor) is the most likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""Tiang ngantungang sesolahan ring kamar"" suggests that there is a heavy object hanging from the ceiling in the room, which could be causing the floor to sag or sink. This is supported by the word ""kotor"" which means ""sagging"" or ""sunken"". Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang sakit sirah) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""tiang enggal matilan"" suggests that something is stuck or blocked, which could be causing the pain in Tiang's stomach. Option B (Bos tiange ngawentenang patemon) does not provide a clear explanation for why Tiang would experience stomach pain. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang sane madue asu punika nglicatehin tapel) is more likely to occur than option B (Sang sané ngamijilang asu punika ngicénin asu punika ajengan). This is because the phrase ""nglicatehin"" means ""to make something bigger or longer,"" while ""ngamijilang"" means ""to make something smaller or shorter."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will use the former phrase to describe the effect of the action on the object being acted upon, rather than the latter phrase to describe the opposite effect."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nunas pangampura ring timpal tiange) is more likely to occur than option B (Timpal tiange ngampurayang tiang). This is because the phrase ""pangampura"" means ""to spread out or expand,"" while ""ngampurayang"" means ""to shrink or contract."" Therefore, it is more likely that the water will spread out and cover a larger area rather than shrinking back into its original form."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida makta tas) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika sampun nenten"" suggests that something has been taken or stolen, and ""makta tas"" means to take or steal something. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's item was taken by someone else rather than being lost in the first place."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ida sampun muputang pidartan idane) is more likely to happen because it implies that Ida will successfully complete her task of investigating the strange noise by finding out what caused it. The phrase ""muputang pidartan"" means ""to find out or investigate something,"" while ""idane"" means ""it."" Therefore, Option A suggests that Ida will be able to determine the cause of the noise she heard. On the other hand, Option B (Ida katiwakin danda antuk masumpah palsu) implies that Ida will not be successful in her investigation and will instead discover a false explanation for the noise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané meled pisan mangda prasida nyingakin malih) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anak istri punika ngewarnaang bokipune"" suggests that the speaker's child has been born with a deformity or disability, and the use of the word ""mangda"" in the second sentence implies that this condition is causing problems for the child. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will choose to perform a ritual to appease the gods and ask for their blessings for the child's well-being."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ipun polih pakaryan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""para imigran punika"" suggests that the speaker is addressing a group of immigrants who are already in the country illegally. Therefore, it is more likely that they will be detained or deported rather than being allowed to stay in the country legally."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Parajanane sami pada ngedekin ipun) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sang sané mapidarta"" suggests that something has been added or mixed into the drink, which could cause an unexpected reaction. Option B (Para pamiarsa raris matangi) does not provide any context for what might happen after adding something to the drink. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Matan ai punika ngawinang tiang buta) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika ngawinang"" means ""to make something blind,"" so it suggests that the person's eyes will become blind as a result of the effect. Option B (Matan ai ngawinang kulit tiangé pucat) does not convey the same meaning, as ""kulit"" refers to the skin or outer layer of something, rather than the eyes themselves. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang marasa bos"" (The sky is cloudy), option A is more likely. The word ""ngorok"" means ""cloudy"". So, the correct answer is Option A: Tiang ngorok."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pisau punika nénten nglangenin) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika"" in this context suggests that something has been cooked or heated, and ""nglangenin"" means to fry or sauté. Therefore, it is likely that the speaker is referring to a dish where steak is cooked by frying or sautéing it in oil. Option B (Steak punika kari mentah) does not make sense in this context as ""kari"" refers to a spicy sauce, and ""mentah"" means raw."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané polih tunjangan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake istri punika raris naur utang"" suggests that someone's wife has been unfaithful, and the speaker is considering taking revenge against her lover. Option A aligns with this interpretation by suggesting that the speaker may harm or punish the lover as a form of retribution. In contrast, option B (""Ipun akeh nelasang jinah"") does not fit well with the given premise and seems out of place in the context of the sentence. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang makesiab yéning ida sampun medal) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""sawitran tiange kantun"" suggests that there are many people who want to get close to Tiang, but he is not interested in any of them. Therefore, it is unlikely for him to be attracted to a new person like Ida, especially since she is just a simple villager from the countryside. Option B (Tiang raris mamanah ngrauhin dane) does not fit with this context as it implies that Tiang is already aware of Ida's existence and has been keeping an eye on her, which goes against the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lontarnyné sampun runtuh) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang ngenahang bunga punika"" suggests that something heavy or dense has fallen onto a delicate flower, causing it to break or shatter. This implies that the impact of the falling object would be sufficient to cause damage to the flower, leading to its destruction. Option B (""Tiang ngrasayang ambu bunga punika"") does not provide any specific details about the nature of the falling object or its impact on the flower, making it less plausible in this context."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ipun matemu sareng timpal ipuné saking alit) is a more plausible cause for the effect of anake istri punika marasa kangen ring leluhurnyane than option B (Ipun ngeling-elingin pianak-pianaknyane). This is because the first option suggests that the wife's anger towards her husband is caused by his failure to fulfill his obligations as a husband, while the second option does not provide any specific reason or explanation for why the wife is angry. Therefore, option A is a more logical choice based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nyukserahang makalah punika sadurungnyané) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""sang sisia punika"" means ""the sky is cloudy,"" which suggests that it may rain soon. The word ""ngaremba"" in this context implies a strong wind or storm, which could cause trees to bend or break. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mobil tiangé rusak"", option A (Tiang ka mal) is more likely to occur because it implies that the car's engine has broken down due to a mechanical failure, which can happen suddenly without warning. Option B (Tiang ngubungin mekanik) suggests that the car's engine may have been damaged by an external force or mechanism, which could be less likely in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngutang catetan punika,"" option A is the correct answer. The word ""catetan"" means ""to hang down"" or ""to dangle,"" so it is more likely that the cause of the noise is something hanging down or dangling near the wall rather than a person knocking on the wall."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun ngenteg jaja) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ipun ngenteg jaja"" means ""the egg breaks open,"" indicating that something inside has burst or cracked open. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for the character's emotions or thoughts overflowing and becoming uncontainable, leading to a breakdown of some kind. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Garasi punika kantun mabukak) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang parkir ring jalan"" refers to a parking lot located near a road, while ""garasi punika kantun mabukak"" means ""the garage is full of rubbish."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to the former rather than the latter situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kriminalis punika ngutang sanjata) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika ngenjolang senjata"" suggests that the criminal has taken something valuable from the victim, which aligns with the idea of stealing or robbery. Therefore, it is more likely that the criminal will be caught with evidence of their crime, such as a stolen item, rather than being injured by the weapon they used."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngrencanayang jagi nyarengin upacara pemakaman paman tiange) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tiang meled pisan ring wiken niki"" suggests that there was a funeral procession for Tiange's father, which implies that he has passed away. Additionally, the mention of ""upacara pemakaman"" further supports this conclusion, as it is a common term used in Indonesia to refer to a funeral or burial ceremony. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang neten uning malih kali napi,"" option A (Tiang ngimpi) is the more likely cause. The word ""ngimpi"" means ""to be sick"" or ""to have a fever."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person's illness is caused by something they ate rather than something they drank."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Printeré sampun nénten madué tinta) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sampun"" means ""ink"" in Indonesian, so it's possible that the speaker is referring to a printer running out of ink."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para supporters raris matolihan ring pralambang) is more likely to occur. The word ""pralambang"" in Indonesian refers to a sports stadium or arena, so it suggests that the supporters are more interested in cheering for their team at the stadium rather than winning medals on the field of play. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang sampun ngaturang) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""rasané nénten becik"" suggests that something has been done or taken away from someone without their knowledge or consent, which could result in a negative impact on them. Option B (Tiang ngenahang uyah ring jeroné) does not fit with this context as it implies a positive action being taken towards someone. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Towel punika nyerep cairan punika) is more likely to occur. The word ""nyerep"" in Javanese means ""to dry"", so it can be inferred that the towel will absorb water and dry something. Option B (Lontar punika ngamedalang cihna sané masem) does not make sense in this context as ""ngamedalang"" means ""to spread out"" and ""cihna"" means ""water"", but there is no logical connection between these words and the idea of a towel absorbing water. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané nyatet kaca punika) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Anake istri punika"" suggests that a woman has been married multiple times, while ""kagetep rikala ipun ngwacen cakepannyane"" implies that she has had many children with different men. This means that her current husband may not be the only one who could potentially have an heir through her. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anake punika negul sabuknyane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pesawaté keni turbulensi"" suggests that there are strong winds or turbulence in the air, which could cause a plane to shake or oscillate. This could potentially lead to a loss of control or instability in the aircraft, making it difficult for the pilot to maintain a steady course. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anake luh ento tusing ngidepang munyinne) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""anake alit punika"" suggests that something has been taken away or removed, while ""nylempoh"" implies a sense of loss or absence. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is expressing regret or disappointment over something being taken away rather than simply disappearing."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (ipun ngamputasiang batisne) is more likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. The passage states that the patient has a history of ""ngicénin pasien,"" which suggests that they have had previous surgeries or medical procedures. This could potentially lead to complications such as infection or abscesses, which would require further treatment. Option B (ipun sampun nitenin indik vital ipuné) does not provide any specific information about the patient's condition and seems unrelated to the given premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anake luh ento matimpuh tekek-tekek) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the idea of a husband being jealous over his wife's attention towards another man. The phrase ""luh ento"" means ""to be jealous,"" and ""matimpuh"" means ""attention."" Therefore, Option A better captures the meaning of the premise than Option B."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang ngajiang pendapatne) is a more plausible explanation for why the sky is blue than option B (Tiang uning tiang patut). This is because ""tiang"" in Indonesian means ""sky,"" and ""ngajiang"" means ""to be colored."" Therefore, the phrase ""tiang ngajiang pendapatne"" can be translated to ""the sky is colored with opinion."" This suggests that people's perception of the color of the sky is influenced by their opinions or beliefs, rather than any objective factual basis."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lidah punika menempel ring sepatunyane) is more likely to occur. The word ""menempel"" means ""to stick"" or ""to adhere"", which suggests that the lid of the box will attach itself to the ring securely. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what might happen when the lid of a box is opened while wearing a ring."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Jadmane sami pada nyilib ring tanahe) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""nyilib ring tanahe"" suggests that the snow has accumulated enough to cover the entire mountain, indicating a significant amount of snowfall. This is in contrast to option A (Sekolah-sekolahé sami katutup), which implies that the snow has melted away completely, leaving no trace behind. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun lunga ka jeroné) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sampun"" means ""to be angry or upset,"" and ""lunga"" means ""to be long."" Therefore, the full sentence translates to ""Ida will be angry for a long time."" This suggests that Ida's anger may persist over an extended period, rather than being a temporary reaction."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wit punika runtuh ring duur umahé) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase ""runtuh ring duur umahé"" suggests that the problem is related to a buildup or accumulation of something, which could be causing the issue with the witness's ability to speak. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngenahang kayu ring apine) is more likely to be the cause of the damage to the tree. This is because the word ""ngenahang"" specifically refers to a sharp or pointed object that can pierce or cut something, which could potentially harm the tree. In contrast, option B (Tiang nguntul Kapak ring taru) does not necessarily imply any direct harm to the tree."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pasangan punika raris nguningayang indiké punika) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""raris ngutingayang indiké punika"" suggests that the couple's relationship is facing challenges due to their different personalities or interests. This is a common reason why couples may experience conflicts in their relationships. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun demen ring ragannyane) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake luh punika ngirimang kartu Valentine"" suggests that someone has received a Valentine's Day card from their crush or love interest, and the response ""ipun demen ring ragannyane"" means ""I will give you my heart."" This implies that the person receiving the card is excited and eager to express their feelings to their crush. Option B (""Ipun ngambung ipun"") does not fit with this context and seems out of place in the conversation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang bingung) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tiang makenyem"" suggests that something is unclear or confusing, which aligns with the idea of Tiang being perplexed or uncertain about the situation. Option B (Tiang setuju ring baos danene) implies that Tiang has a clear understanding of the situation and agrees with it, which does not fit with the given premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun meled ngrereh pasawitran) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's wife left him. The phrase ""ngrereh pasawitran"" means to be tired of something or someone, indicating that the woman may have become fed up with her husband's behavior or lifestyle. This could include various factors such as lack of emotional support, financial problems, or personal differences. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Anake punika raris ngenahang barang-barange punika ring jeron kulkas) is more likely to happen because it suggests that the person will take out something from the fridge and put it in a jar with a lid. This action implies that they are preparing food or drinks, which can be stored in the fridge, rather than cooking pizza in an oven. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dané makarya keras) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""makarya keras"" means ""hard shell,"" indicating that the egg will be difficult to crack open. This supports Option B as the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Pianakne ngwarisin kasugihanne) is more likely to happen because it implies that the speaker's words will have a negative impact on the listener, causing them to feel uncomfortable or uneasy. This contrasts with option A (Putrané keni sengkala ring pengadilan), which suggests that the speaker's words may be misunderstood or misinterpreted by the listener.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kobane punika padem) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""Anake istri punika raris nylempoh genine punika,"" indicating that Anake's wife has a rare disease called nylempoh. This suggests that Anake may be experiencing emotional distress due to his wife's illness, which could lead him to neglect his work or become less productive. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lisénsi nyetirné katungkasin) is the more likely cause of the accident. The phrase ""mobil anake luh punika"" suggests that the car was involved in a collision or accident, and ""wenten ring genah makarya"" implies that there may have been some sort of failure or malfunction with the vehicle's brakes or steering system. Option A aligns better with this language than option B, as it suggests that the driver may have simply failed to notice something important while driving rather than experiencing a sudden mechanical failure."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang sirep ngantos jam alarm tiangé,"" option A is more likely to occur because it implies that Tiang will take a nap after eating breakfast. The phrase ""ngantos jam"" means ""to eat breakfast,"" and ""tiang é"" means ""nap."" Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Kamera-kamera punika ngetonang ipun) is more likely to happen. The public figure's reputation will be affected by the viral video of them riding in a luxury car, which could lead to negative consequences such as loss of credibility or public scrutiny.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Toyane punika raris tuh) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the given information that ""Anake istri punika meneng-meneng ring jamban"". This implies that Anake's wife is pregnant and will give birth to a baby boy, which is consistent with the first part of the premise. Option B does not fit this context as it refers to cooking rice in a pot, which has no relevance to the situation described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané nyarengin pasemetonan) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""punika meled pisan mangda"" suggests that the student's academic performance has been poor, while ""prasida matemu sareng mahasiswa tiosan ring kampus"" implies that the student's grades are not satisfactory. Therefore, it is more likely that the student will be advised to take a break from their studies rather than being awarded a degree in engineering."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Tiang ngrereh jinah akidik) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tiang ngunggahang"" suggests that something is hanging or dangling from a hook or a branch, which could be interpreted as a person's body swinging from a tree branch. This implies that the person has died by falling from a height, which is consistent with the idea of being thrown off a cliff. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anaké punika malaib) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika"" in this context means ""to be jealous,"" so it suggests that Anaké is feeling envious or resentful towards someone else's success or happiness. This aligns with the idea of being bitter or resentful towards someone who has something that you desire but cannot have. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané kapidartayang mangda nglaksanayang pakaryan sané mabuat pisan ring masyarakat) is more likely to occur. This is because the premise highlights the potential consequences of not addressing the issue of a husband's infidelity in a marriage, specifically the impact it could have on the couple's relationship and society as a whole. It suggests that if the issue is not addressed, it could lead to further problems and conflicts within the marriage and in the broader community. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response based on the given premise.
"Response: 
Option A: Téhé punika maambu. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Tiang nyampur gula ka yeh anget,"" which means ""The sugar cane is sweet because of the sun,"" option A is the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the sun's heat is responsible for making the sugar cane sweet, so it is more likely that the effect will be Option A: Téhé punika maambu (the sun makes it sweet)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida sampun kaundang ka payudan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""sampun"" means ""to pour"" or ""to flow"", while ""kaundang"" means ""to spill"". Therefore, it can be inferred that the problem may have been caused by something spilling or leaking onto the floor. Option B (Ida sampun keni pinakit ring payudan) does not provide a clear explanation for the cause of the problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Polisi sampun nyampatang korban) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""saking polisi"" suggests that the police are involved in some way, and the word ""nyampatang"" implies a negative outcome for the victim. Therefore, it is more likely that the police will be responsible for causing harm to someone rather than chasing after the criminal."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nglempagang) is the more likely cause of the laptop's slow performance. This is because a virus or malware infection can cause system instability, slow down the computer, and consume system resources, leading to poor performance. Therefore, it is more likely that the laptop's slow performance is due to a virus or malware infection rather than a hardware issue such as overheating.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané ngamolihang baju sané akéh pisan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake istri punika"" suggests that someone's wife has left them for another man, which could lead to feelings of sadness and depression. The following sentence ""nenten malih madue genah ring kamarne"" further reinforces this idea by suggesting that the speaker is feeling unwell due to their emotional pain. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kurenané ngembasang rare) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Anake punika kalintang sedih"" suggests that someone is feeling sad or depressed, while ""Kurenané ngembasang rare"" means ""I will make you feel better."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker wants to help the person feel better rather than simply ignore their feelings."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané prasida ngamolihang pakaryan sané kaaptiang) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""punika raris muponin gelar sarjana"" suggests that the person has already completed their bachelor's degree, and therefore would not be eligible for a scholarship specifically for undergraduate students. Option B (Penawaran pakaryannyané katulak) does not provide any context or evidence to support this conclusion."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngaturang pangayu bagia ring para pamiarsa) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""pangayu bagia"" suggests that something is being poured or dripped into a container, which aligns with the idea of a microphone being used for recording purposes. Option B (Dané mabaos ring mikrofon) does not make sense in this context as it means ""to break the microphone,"" which is unlikely given the scenario described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ulam punika raris ulung ka dasar segarane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ulam punika"" means ""to boil or cook something thoroughly,"" while ""raris ulung"" means ""to make something soft and tender."" Therefore, it is likely that the speaker will boil or cook the food until it becomes soft and tender, rather than simply adding a dash of salt and pepper without any further preparation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (bola punika ngranjing ka bolong) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""pamain punika"" means ""to hit or strike something"", while ""ngempak bola"" means ""ball"". Therefore, it is more likely that the ball will be struck by another object rather than being swallowed by a hole."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngisep abune ring loteng,"" option A (Tiang ngigel) is more likely to occur. This is because ""ngisep"" means ""to increase"" or ""to grow,"" while ""ring loteng"" means ""the size of a finger."" Therefore, it is more likely that the finger will become larger rather than smaller."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (pelanggan é nganggén jinah palsu) is more likely as the reason for the customer's dissatisfaction. This is because the customer has accused the cashier of being dishonest, implying that there was a lack of honesty or integrity in their transaction. Option B (pelanggan punika ngutang lampu mobilnya) does not necessarily imply any wrongdoing by the cashier, but rather a problem with the customer's own vehicle. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the customer's dissatisfaction.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sampahé ngawinang dapuré bau) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sampahé"" means ""trash"" or ""waste,"" and ""ngawinang"" means ""to throw away."" Therefore, the complete sentence translates to ""Trash goes into the kitchen."" This makes sense in a household setting where food waste may end up in the trash can in the kitchen. Option B, however, does not make as much sense in this context, as it implies that there is a list of expenses for the trash, which is unlikely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Alit-alite sami pada seneng ring satone punika) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the animal's behavior is influenced by its surroundings and environment. This implies that the animal may be more active during nighttime when there are fewer distractions and more opportunities for hunting. Option B (Alit-alite punika ngejuk buron-buron punika), on the other hand, does not provide any specific context or explanation for why the animal's behavior might change, making it less plausible.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ginjelnyané nénten prasida malih makarya) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ginjelnyané"" means ""to make something soft or weak,"" while ""prasida"" means ""to break."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the speaker's child has made their food too soft or weak, which could lead to it breaking easily. Option B (Paru-parunnyane sampun makenyem) does not fit with the context of the premise as well, as ""paru"" means ""to eat"" in Indonesian, but there is no clear connection to the idea of making food soft or weak."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nunasang ring timbal tiange indik genah acara punika) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""tiang madué tiket tambahan"" implies that additional tickets have been purchased for a concert or event, which would require the use of a ticketing system. The second option, ""tiang mataken ring timbal tiange,"" does not make sense in this context as it refers to a bell being rung at a funeral, which has no relation to purchasing additional tickets for a concert. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang makta selimut) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""rusak"" in the premise implies that something has been damaged or broken, which could lead to a loss of control over the AC ring. This is consistent with Option A, where the AC ring becomes unstable and causes chaos. On the other hand, Option B (Tiang ngampakang jendelane) does not necessarily imply a loss of control over the AC ring, but rather a change in its behavior due to external factors. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tas ranselnyané kabukak) is more likely to be the cause of Anaké's back pain. This is because ""kabukak"" refers to a type of traditional Indonesian massage that involves deep pressure and manipulation of the body's soft tissues, which could potentially cause discomfort or pain in the back if performed improperly or excessively. Therefore, it is more plausible that Anaké's back pain was caused by this form of massage rather than Option B (Tas ranselnyané abot pisan), which simply means ""to carry something heavy."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngae jaje) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tiang numbasang hadiah"" means ""golden gift,"" so it is unlikely that the person would give a ""ring mémé."" Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bungannyané nyuduk tukang kebuné) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Kembang narcis ring tamané"" suggests that something is growing in a garden or park, and ""tukang kebun"" means gardener. Therefore, it is possible that the speaker saw a gardener watering plants in the garden or park. Option B, however, does not make as much sense in this context, as ""punika raris ngisidang umbi-umbiannyane"" means ""to wash dirty clothes with soap,"" which has nothing to do with what the speaker observed."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lilin apine punika raris puun) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb form that indicates an action happening in the present tense, which suggests that the effect will happen immediately or soon after the cause. In contrast, option B (Lontar punika ngawinang genine ngendih) uses a verb form that indicates an action happening in the future tense, which suggests that the effect may not happen until later or at some point in the future. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ipun nénten kayun mabligbagan ring pangadilan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""mabligbagan"" means ""to become complicated"" or ""to get messy,"" indicating that the issue has been developing over time and has become increasingly difficult to resolve. Option B (Ipun meled pisan mangda ipun prasida mawali sakadi jati mula) suggests that the problem was caused by a single event or action, which does not align with the idea of the issue being complex and ongoing. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Paralelin ipun sampun padem) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""panti asuhan"" suggests that there are external factors influencing the child's behavior, such as parenting or upbringing, rather than internal factors like mood swings or emotions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the child's behavior is caused by their environment and upbringing rather than their own emotional state."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Raris wenten tsunami) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""wenten meteorit sane ulung ring segarane"" suggests that a large meteorite has fallen from the sky and hit the earth with great force, causing massive destruction. This event would likely result in a tsunami wave rather than a small fishing boat being swept away by the sea. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun dehidrasi) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Sang ngambah tegeh"" means ""The water level increases,"" while ""manggihin lelipi sane"" means ""the ground becomes wet."" This suggests that there has been an increase in precipitation or water levels, which could lead to dehydration of the soil. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nguripang oven) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""nguripang"" in Indonesian means ""to bake"" or ""to cook using an oven"", which aligns with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most likely meaning of ""tiang nguripang"" is ""oven for baking""."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngisep daun jeruk nipis punika,"" option A (Lemoné sampun mabungkus) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb that means ""to boil"" or ""to simmer,"" which suggests that the lemon will be heated up and become hotter as a result of being mixed with the other ingredients. Option B (Lemon punika kaceperang), on the other hand, does not use any verbs related to heat or temperature increase, which makes it less likely that the lemon will become hotter as a result of being mixed with the other ingredients. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Negara punika manggihin tanah anyar,"" option A is the most likely outcome. This is because ""manggihin"" means to take or occupy something, indicating that the country will actively seize control of the disputed land. Option B suggests that the country will simply reject the claim, which may not be as effective in resolving the conflict."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Punika sami telas ring natah) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika sami telas"" means ""the earth will shake,"" while ""ring natah"" means ""and tremble."" This suggests that the ground will begin to shake and tremble, indicating seismic activity or an earthquake. Option B does not provide any information about seismic activity or earthquakes, so it is less likely to occur based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lantai punika nénten rata) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika"" in this context suggests that something has been taken or carried away, which aligns with the idea of a thief stealing something. Option B (""Ring tanahe punika jeg benyah"") does not fit as well with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Putrannyane raris ngangken mungguing ipun iwang) is more likely to occur because it uses a verb form that indicates an action in progress, whereas option B (Bapannyane practica ring okannyane punika) uses a verb form that indicates an action completed in the past. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (ida ngambil sirup kantuk) is more likely to be effective in reducing a headache caused by stress. Sirup kantuk contains anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce swelling and pain associated with stress headaches. Aspirin, on the other hand, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can also help relieve pain but may have side effects such as stomach upset or bleeding when taken in high doses. Therefore, option A is the better choice for treating a stress headache.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun sampun nampek ring stasiun) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""api punika"" suggests that there may have been a mistake or error in the system, which could result in incorrect scheduling or allocation of resources. Therefore, it is more plausible that the issue is related to the station's internal systems rather than external factors such as traffic congestion."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Penyakit mental punika sampun wenten ring kulawargannyane) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika sampun"" refers to a mental illness or disorder, while ""kaicen terapi"" means counseling or therapy. Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is suggesting that mental illnesses are caused by something internal rather than external factors such as stress or trauma. Option B (Dané keni pinungkan depresi) translates to ""You have to fight depression,"" which implies that depression is an external factor that can be fought through effort and determination. However, based on the premise provided, option A is more consistent with the idea that mental illnesses are complex and multifaceted conditions that cannot be solely attributed to external causes."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anake istri punika raris ngetep munyin danene,"" option A (Ipun nginem ajengannyane) is more likely to be the correct cause. The word ""ajengannyane"" in this context suggests that something has been taken or stolen, which aligns with the idea of a thief stealing the woman's husband. Option B (""Ipun ngrasayang ajengané"") does not convey the same sense of taking or stealing. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anake istri punika sakit tenggek,"" option A is more likely to occur because it suggests that the wife's illness will be cured by her husband's magic potion. The phrase ""suarannyane sakadi suaran anak masem"" implies that the husband has the power to heal his wife through his magical abilities. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (punika drooling) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that punika is experiencing a physical response to the food, such as salivation or drooling, rather than simply enjoying it mentally or emotionally. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ipun ngicalang pagaennyane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""utsaha paraistri"" suggests a strong desire or motivation, while ""raris mamargi becik"" implies that something is being done with great effort or difficulty. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will experience fatigue or exhaustion as a result of their efforts. Option B (Ipun dados anak sugih pisan) does not fit well with the given premise and seems unlikely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Suaran gongé nyarengang) is more likely to be the cause of getting rare medals in class. This is because suaran gongé refers to a type of traditional Javanese dance that involves intricate footwork and graceful movements, which may not be conducive to academic performance. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student's poor academic performance is due to their focus on dancing rather than studying.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Timpal-timpalne maosang indiké punika) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""anak istri punika"" suggests that a child has been born with a strange appearance, which could be interpreted as an omen or sign of something supernatural happening. This aligns with the idea of a ghostly presence being felt in the house. Therefore, it is more likely that the child's unusual appearance would be attributed to a spiritual cause rather than a physical one."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia nyaris tenggelam ring segarane) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tenggelam ring segarane"" means ""almost sank into the sea,"" indicating that the ship was in danger of capsizing or sinking. This suggests that the storm was severe enough to threaten the safety of the vessel and its passengers. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the ship was unable to reach its destination."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Baloné punika puun) is more likely to occur than option B (Balune punika munggah ka ambarane). The phrase ""punika"" in Indonesian means ""to inflate,"" so it's likely that the balloon will be inflated with air rather than filled with a liquid like water or milk. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia keni serangan jantung) is more likely to be the cause of the symptoms described. The phrase ""punika nenten mrasidayang mbaos"" suggests that there may be a problem with the heart or cardiovascular system, which could lead to chest pain or discomfort. Option B (Ida ngaras bayuné sané dalem) does not provide any specific information about the location or nature of the pain, making it less likely as a possible cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Wentent ketebang ring semen punika) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""ring sisin margine"" suggests that there may be a blockage or obstruction in the ear canal, which could potentially cause hearing loss if left untreated. Therefore, it is more likely that the problem is caused by an accumulation of wax or debris in the ear canal rather than magic or supernatural forces."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang juru boros gelis macebur nyantos ipun rauh) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sang juru boros"" means ""the angry person"" in Indonesian, while ""macebur"" means ""to hit or strike"". Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is describing a situation where an angry person hits something with a stick or weapon, causing damage or destruction. This is consistent with the idea of a storm destroying things with its wind and rain. Option B (Anake punika raris nglempag prajurite sane nyaga ipun) does not convey this same sense of destructive force."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Infeksi titiangé sampun ical) is more likely to occur. The word ""sampun"" in Malay means ""to infect or spread"", so it is likely that the person will become infected with an illness if they are exposed to a contaminated surface. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Supir né grem) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""supir né grem"" means ""the driver was sleepy,"" which aligns with the premise of the lampu lalu lintasé mawarna kuning being a traffic light that makes the driver feel sleepy. Option B (""Sang supir nyorokang klaksonnya"") means ""The driver's eyes were red,"" which does not align with the premise as it does not explain why the driver would see a yellow light. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nylempohang wadah punika ring toya anget) is more likely as it suggests that the plastic packaging will melt due to exposure to high temperatures in a car trunk. This is a plausible scenario given the temperature fluctuations inside a hot car, especially during summer months when the sun's rays can heat up the interior of the vehicle quickly. Option B (Tiang ngenahang wadah punika ring duur kompor sané panes), on the other hand, does not make sense as there is no logical connection between the durability of a plastic container and its ability to withstand high temperatures in a car trunk.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Supirne nabrak tiang telepon) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""supir"" in Indonesian means ""to break"", so it's likely that the speaker is suggesting that they broke their phone by hitting something with it. Option B (Sopirne majalan teken lampu merah) doesn't make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between breaking a red light post and breaking one's phone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak lanang punika sedek malajah awengi mepek,"" option A is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika sedek"" means ""to be lazy"" or ""to be idle,"" while ""malajah"" means ""to study."" Therefore, it is more likely that the child will not pass the exam because they are too lazy to study rather than passing the exam without studying."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dané jejeh malajah nglangi) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""malajah nglangi"" suggests that there may be a conflict or issue with the way the teacher is teaching the class, rather than any personal problems with the students themselves. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang ngrasayang jantung tiange magedep) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang ngenahang"" means ""the sky is darkening,"" indicating that a storm or heavy rain is approaching. This could cause the wind to pick up and create a sense of unease or discomfort. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kantor titiangé sampunbek) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sampunbek"" implies that the office will be closed for a long time, indicating that the employees will not be able to work during this period. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kulawargannyane ngundang pisaga-pisagannyane mangda marayunan irika) is more likely to occur. This is because the phrase ""kulawarganyane"" means ""to be jealous,"" and the word ""mangda"" means ""envy."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that Kulawargannyane is feeling envious of Pisagannyane's success or happiness. Option B, however, does not make sense in this context as it refers to a different meaning of ""kulawargan,"" which means ""to be angry."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sang sané nglangi raris macebur ka tengah kolam renang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sang sané"" means ""toy boat,"" while ""nglangi"" means ""to sink."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that a toy boat might sink in the middle of a swimming pool. Option B (Sang sané nglangi ngambang ring kolam renang) does not make sense in this context as ""ngambang"" means ""to dive into"" or ""to jump into,"" but it would not explain why a toy boat would sink in the middle of a swimming pool."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang tan pastika nginem bibit) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person will be able to successfully complete their task without any obstacles or challenges. The phrase ""pastika"" means ""to finish"" or ""to accomplish,"" and ""nginem"" means ""without any problems."" Therefore, this option suggests that the person will be able to achieve their goal with ease. Option B (Tiang tan sengaja ngletehin gigin tiange), on the other hand, implies that the person may face some difficulties or obstacles in completing their task, as the word ""sengaja"" means ""on purpose"" or ""deliberately,"" and ""ngletehin"" means ""to make something difficult."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Jakétnyané nénten kabukak) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""kabukak"" means ""to eat"", so it suggests that Anaké might have eaten something. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why Anaké is not feeling well."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun bingung krana wénten suara) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ipun bingung"" means ""confused,"" and ""krana wénten"" means ""hearing."" Therefore, it suggests that the person is confused about what they are hearing. Option B (Kupingnyane sampun telas) does not fit with the context of the premise as it means ""The sound of a bell is heard in the distance."""
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang nginem yeh sane wenten irika makasami) is a more plausible explanation for why there are no fish in the sea than option B (Tiang nyimpen ring kulkas). This is because the phrase ""tiang ngisiang botol"" suggests that something has been poured into the ocean, which could be interpreted as an excessive amount of plastic waste or other pollutants entering the waterways and harming marine life. In contrast, option B does not provide any specific reason for the lack of fish in the sea beyond the vague statement about the ocean being cold. Therefore, option A is the better answer based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Cakepan punika madaging basa sane cemer) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""punika madaging"" suggests that something is being made or created, while ""basa sane cemer"" means to mix or combine things together. Therefore, it is possible that a new dish or recipe is being developed using different ingredients. Option B (Punika madué plot sané rumit) does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no clear indication of what kind of plot or story is being referred to."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Para kramanya... sami padem) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sami padem"" means ""will be destroyed,"" indicating that the ship will sink or be damaged beyond repair. Option B (Para kramané manggihin bajak laut) means ""the ship will become a reef in the sea,"" which is less destructive than sinking or being damaged beyond repair. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I da sampun nyawisang pitakén punika) is more likely to occur. The use of ""nyawisang"" in this context suggests that the speaker is experiencing a strong desire or craving for something, which could be interpreted as an indication of impending action. Additionally, the phrase ""pita ken punika"" implies a sense of urgency or importance, further supporting the idea that the speaker is likely to take immediate action. Option B (Ida ngarsayang mangda titiang polih pituduh), on the other hand, does not convey the same sense of urgency or likelihood of action."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anake punika raris ngantungang telpon) is more likely to occur because it refers to a situation where someone hangs up their phone without realizing it. This is a common occurrence when people are in a hurry or distracted while talking on the phone, and they accidentally drop the call. Option B (Anake punika raris ngambil hp) means ""Anak punika raris ngambil handphone"" which translates to ""The child took the mother's cellphone"". This scenario is less related to the premise given."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anake luh ento nganengneng tiang,"" option A (Tiang ngrangkul ipun) is more likely to occur because it means ""The tree will be uprooted."" This implies that something strong enough to move a large object like a tree is happening, which could potentially cause harm or destruction."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun ngambil gambar pameran punika) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ipun ngambil"" means ""to take a picture,"" indicating that the speaker plans to capture an image of the exhibition. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Timpal tiange ngajak tiang matemu sareng anak lanang punika) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang matemu"" suggests that the child's mind is affected by something, and ""ngajak"" implies a strong influence or control over the child's thoughts and actions. Therefore, it is more likely that the child will be negatively influenced by the ring than for there to be no effect at all (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang ngemponang udara ka ban) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""tiang ngemponang udara"" means ""the plane will crash,"" indicating that a disaster of some kind is likely to occur. Option B (Tiang ngentosin roda motor) does not convey the same sense of danger or impending doom as Option A. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ajinnyane ngwacen satua majeng ring okannyane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""anake luh punika"" suggests that something is being pulled or drawn towards a specific location, which could be interpreted as a gravitational force. Additionally, the use of the word ""satua"" implies a sense of heaviness or weight, further supporting the idea of something being pulled towards a particular place. Therefore, it is more likely that the effect would be Option A, where the object is pulled towards the person's hand."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nganggén pensil) is more likely to occur. The word ""pensil"" means ""pencil"", so it's unlikely that a pencil would be used as a tool for painting. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ia ngelah utang) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""punika nenten naen nampi jinah"" suggests that there is a debt or financial obligation that needs to be paid back, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ipun keni cacar air) is more likely to be the cause of Anak's poor performance in school. The phrase ""ipun keni cacar air"" means ""the mind is clouded with dirt,"" indicating that Anak may be experiencing some mental or emotional distress that is affecting his ability to learn. This could be due to various reasons such as stress, anxiety, or other personal issues. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for Anak's poor performance in school compared to option B (Dané seneng malajah matematika), which simply means ""Mathematics is boring."""
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang maktaang punika ka tong sampah) is more likely to occur because it implies that the trash will be sucked up by a machine or device, rather than sinking into the ground. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tiang ngusapin karpet,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tiang"" in Malay means ""to stretch or extend,"" so it is unlikely that a person would use this phrase to describe someone's hair being tangled in a carpet. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané ngicalang komputernyané) is more likely to happen because it suggests that a computer will be used for something related to dancing, which could involve creating music or videos, but not necessarily physically moving around in space. Option B (Ida ngentungang kursi ring selagan kamaré) does not make sense in this context as it implies that someone would sit on a chair while floating in mid-air, which is not possible with current technology. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Punyan kayune punika puun) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punyan kayune"" means ""to be angry,"" while ""puunika"" means ""to hit."" Therefore, it is likely that the person will get angry and hit something. Option B (Kobane sampun padem) does not make sense in this context as there is no logical connection between the two phrases."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Toya panesé sampun ical) is more likely as it implies that the person has already taken a bath before going to bed, whereas option B (Dané nénten prasida manggihin toél) suggests that they have not yet taken a bath. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ipun ngutang jinah anggén matumbasan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngutang jinah"" means ""to be confused or puzzled,"" while ""matumbasan"" refers to a feeling of unease or discomfort. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will feel confused or puzzled when faced with a difficult problem rather than being angry or aggressive towards someone else."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sepatu punika ngletehin) is more likely to occur. The word ""ngletehin"" means ""to be scattered or disperse,"" so it suggests that the group of people will break apart or scatter after being hit by the truck. Option B (Sepatu punika sampun usak) does not convey a similar meaning and seems less relevant in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida nglemesin sisan-sisan ajengané) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Anake punika nunas"" suggests that someone has been preparing a meal for a long time, and the word ""nglemesin"" means to cook or prepare food. Therefore, it is likely that the person will continue to cook the meal in small portions until it is ready. Option B (Dané nyimpen resep punika) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a recipe being prepared."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang ngenahang es ring duurnyane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang"" means ""ring"" in Indonesian, and ""ngenahang"" means ""es"". Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker is referring to a ring made of glass or some other material that can break easily. Option B (Tiang ngusapin ipun antuk lotion) does not make sense in this context, as ""tiang"" does not mean ""lotion"" in Indonesian."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang mabebaosan sareng timpal tiangé ring mejane) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""tiang mabebaosan"" means ""the door is broken,"" indicating that the door has been damaged or destroyed. This suggests that the building's structure may have been compromised, making it unstable and at risk of collapsing. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what might happen next."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tiang raris negak) is more likely to occur because it implies that Tiang will be able to successfully avoid being caught by the authorities. The phrase ""patut antri"" means ""can't be caught,"" implying that Tiang has taken steps to evade detection. In contrast, option B (Tiang ngae majalah) does not imply any specific action or outcome related to Tiang's evasion of the authorities. Therefore, option A is a more plausible interpretation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lawat punika raris malaib) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika"" in this context suggests that something will be taken or used for a specific purpose, and ""raris malaib"" means to use something until it is no longer useful or effective. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will take something and use it until it is exhausted or no longer needed, rather than simply using it once and then discarding it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anake punika sampun nyuratang surat wasiat,"" it is more likely that option A (Ida sedekan seda) is the correct answer. This is because ""punika"" in Malay means ""to make someone angry or upset"", while ""sampun"" means ""to be angry"". Therefore, the phrase ""Anake punika sampun nyuratang surat wasiat"" can be translated to mean ""He/She made him/her angry by writing a will."" Option B (Ida sampun balu) does not fit well with the given premise as there is no direct translation of ""balu"" to English."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dané medal saking pacentokan punika) is more likely to occur. The use of ""sawitrannyane"" in the premise suggests that something will be added or mixed with another substance, which aligns better with Option A's idea of adding a metal to create a new material. In contrast, Option B's suggestion of ""ida nyansan ngelisang pamargin idane"" implies a transformation or change within the existing substance, which may not necessarily result in the creation of a new material. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Tiang nunas patitis) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""sampun minehin pikobet"" suggests that there are many obstacles or challenges in the way of achieving the goal, making it unlikely for Tiang to find a solution quickly. Option A aligns with this idea by stating that Tiang will face even more obstacles, while option B implies that Tiang may find a solution but it will not be easy."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dane rumasa jejeh pisan) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""punika mamargi ring duur jembatan"" suggests that there is a gap or hole in the bridge, which could cause water to flow through it. This would result in the formation of a small lake or pond underneath the bridge, which would be visible from below as a reflection of the sky. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I will be angry with him) is more likely to occur because it implies that the speaker's feelings are hurt or angered by someone else's actions. The use of ""punika"" (hurt) and ""ngajap-ajap"" (anger) also suggests a strong emotional response. Option B (""Dané can handle it"") does not convey the same level of emotion or intensity as option A. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ida ngalinggihin jam panyelehné) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ngalinggihin"" means ""to be covered with something,"" so it suggests that the ground will be covered with something, such as water or mud. This implies that there will be a flood or heavy rain, which could cause damage to buildings and infrastructure. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
