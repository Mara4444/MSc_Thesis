"Response: 60% - Opción A (I turned on a light)

This is an example of a classic ""light bulb"" problem, where you are given two options and have to choose which one is more likely to happen based on the situation described. In this case, option A (turning on a light) is more likely because it is a common action that people take when they notice their electricity has gone out. Option B (resetting the circuit breaker) is also possible but less likely as it may not be immediately apparent what caused the power outage. Therefore, the answer is option A with probability 60%."

"Response: 

This question is testing your ability to recognize and interpret visual information. In this case, you are shown a picture of a person moving their hand in front of a computer screen, with a cursor indicating where they are pointing. Your task is to determine which option best describes what happened based on the visual cues provided.

Option A suggests that the user clicked the mouse, while Option B implies that the user shifted the mouse. Based on the image provided, it appears more likely that the user shifted the mouse rather than clicking it, as there is no indication of any movement or change in position of the cursor. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B."

"Response: 72% - Opinia: This is a very difficult question because both options are plausible given the context of the story. However, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that the narrator stacked the wood in the fireplace (Option A) rather than swinging the axe down to the wood (Option B). This is because the narrator mentions that they ""stacked the wood in the fireplace,"" which suggests that they were actively putting the wood away for use later, whereas ""swinging the axe"" does not necessarily imply any specific action towards the wood. Therefore, Option A is the more probable choice."
