"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (It's soft) is the more likely cause for why the item was wrapped in a plastic bag. The word ""rapuh"" in Indonesian means soft or flabby, which suggests that the item may have been wrapped in a plastic bag to protect it from damage or spoilage due to its softness. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Saya jumpa senjata) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Semut menyerang rumah"", it is more likely that semut has entered the house (Option A). The word ""menyerang"" implies a sudden and unexpected attack or invasion, which suggests that the semut has managed to get inside the house without being noticed. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Agen rondaan menuduh mereka menyeludup) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the theme of being caught in a difficult situation while traveling. The idea of an agent rounding up people based on suspicion of smuggling goods fits into this narrative better than Option A (Agen rondaan memeriksa pasport mereka), which seems less relevant to the scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pejabat itu ditutup"", option A (Hari itu hari cuti) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia bermain dam) is the more likely cause of the girl's energy being drained. The premise suggests that she was playing with a toy, which could be a source of distraction or excitement for her, leading to an increase in physical activity and potentially causing her to feel tired or exhausted. Option B (Dia melompat tali) does not provide any context or explanation as to why the girl might be feeling energetic or drained, making it less likely as a cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (more people entering the line) is the more likely cause for why she lost her place in the queue. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gadis itu mencubit hidungnya,"" option B is the most likely cause. The phrase ""mencubit hidungnya"" suggests that the girl bit her tongue or hurt her mouth in some way, which could be caused by crying too much or being upset. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Penonton bertepuk tangan mengikut muzik) is more likely. The audience is expected to show enthusiasm and excitement by clapping along with the music, rather than simply listening silently.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Gadis itu membuka seorang guru sebuah epall) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the girl wants to give something back to her math teacher, implying that she has benefited from his teaching in some way. It is unlikely that she would stay after school for detention, as this would not be a meaningful or productive way for her to show appreciation for her teacher's efforts. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (their counselor told them a ghost story) is more likely to be the cause of their fear. The premise suggests that the children were already feeling anxious or scared before they heard the ghost story, implying that there was an existing reason for their fear. Therefore, it is more plausible that the counselor's tale simply reinforced or exploited their existing anxiety rather than causing it entirely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Dia mengalami gegaran otak) is more likely to occur as a result of being hit on the head with an object. Gegaran otak refers to brain damage or injury caused by external factors such as trauma or impact, which can lead to cognitive impairment or memory loss. Option A (Dia tersesat dalam pemikiran) means that someone is lost in thought, but does not necessarily imply any physical harm or injury.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Akaun bank saya kosong) is the cause of the problem. The fact that the writer's account is empty suggests that they have not received their salary yet, rather than the possibility of a raise. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dia menghantar e-mel secara beramai-ramai) is more likely. The premise states that the male user's inbox is full of spam, indicating that he may be overwhelmed by a large number of emails. Therefore, option B, where he sends numerous emails, is more plausible.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia terdedah kepada penyakit itu) is more likely. The premise states that the protagonist has been quarantined due to an illness, indicating that they have contracted the disease. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mengulangi itu untuk dirinya sendiri) is the more likely cause. The fact that she ""menghafal"" (remembered) the code suggests that she may have repeated it to herself, rather than forgetting it entirely. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Air itu memuaskan dahaga saya) is more likely to occur because when you pour water into a glass, it will fill up the glass, not make the glass heavier. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dia mahu menawarkan sokongan kepada rakannya) is more likely. The phrase ""dia mahu menawarkan sokongan"" suggests that the speaker wants to offer support or help to their friend, rather than just thinking about what they said. Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kemalangan itu adalah salah saya,"" option A (Saya berasa bersalah) is the most likely choice. This is because the phrase ""salah saya"" implies a sense of guilt or regret, which aligns with the idea that something has gone wrong. Option B (""Saya telah memfailkan dakwaan"") means ""I have failed to fulfill my duty,"" which does not necessarily convey the same level of self-blame as option A."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rantai itu terpecah) is the most likely cause of the problem. The fact that the chain is broken suggests that there may have been a failure in the manufacturing process or an accident during transportation, rather than a single link being damaged due to wear and tear. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the bicycle chain broke.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mereka bosan berdebat) is more likely. The passage states that the couple has been arguing a lot lately, indicating that they are feeling frustrated with each other. This suggests that they are not able to find common ground or compromise effectively, leading to further arguments and tension in their relationship. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the couple's communication has broken down.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dia memberi keterangan di mahkamah) is more likely. The premise states that she decided to run for a public office, which implies that she will need to campaign and give her statement of interest in court. Giving a testimony in court is a common aspect of running for public office, so this option is more likely than hiring a campaign manager.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia mengemas pakaian hangat dalam perjalanannya) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the woman is taking proactive measures to prepare for the cold weather by packing warm clothing in her bag. This implies that she is aware of the forecasted cold weather and is taking steps to protect herself from its effects. Option B (Dia mengembara dengan beg besar) does not provide any information about how the woman is preparing for the cold weather, so it is less likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dia tergelak) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Debu masuk ke matanya) is more likely. The premise states that ""Mata lelaki itu menangis,"" indicating that the man's eyes are crying. This suggests that something has entered or affected his eyes, such as a tear droplet from another person or an object. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B, where the man places a mirror in front of his own eyes to see himself crying."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Lawan dia menuduh dia menipu) is more likely to occur. The fact that the player has won five consecutive matches suggests that they have been performing well and consistently, which could raise suspicions among their opponents. It's more plausible that an opponent would accuse the player of cheating or manipulating the game rather than simply feeling sorry for them.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menangkap pelajar yang menipu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the guru caught a student who was cheating, indicating that the student was attempting to deceive the guru through dishonest means. Option B (Jawapan pelajar itu salah) does not provide any information about the student's intentions or actions, making it less likely as an explanation for why the guru caught the student.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Saya kehilangan suara saya) is more likely. The premise states that Saya has stopped talking, which suggests that she may have lost her voice. This is a common occurrence for people who are tired or overused their vocal cords, making Option A the more plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Saya letakkan di dalam microwave) is the more likely cause of the food becoming mushy. Microwaves can heat up food quickly and evenly, but they can also break down the structure of certain ingredients, such as starches and proteins, leading to a softer or mushier texture. Therefore, placing the food in the microwave would be more likely to result in a mushy consistency than covering it with plastic.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mengalami kekejangan perut) is the more likely cause of the worker's absence from work. The premise suggests that the worker is faking illness to avoid going to work, which is a common excuse for not wanting to go to work. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dia melompat dari papan penyelam) is more likely to be the cause of the girl falling into the pool. The premise states that she fell into the pool, indicating that she was already in the water when the incident occurred. Therefore, option B, which involves jumping from a board, is more plausible than option A, which involves running around the pool deck.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the film has already opened) is the more likely cause of the ticket sales being low. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Orang mengasingkan dia) is more likely to happen because when someone loses weight unexpectedly, they may feel embarrassed or ashamed about their appearance, leading them to isolate themselves from others. This is a common psychological response to body changes that can have negative impacts on mental health.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia mengetik surat) is more likely as a cause for the girl's disappearance. The premise implies that the girl became lost or disappeared without any physical injury, which suggests that she may have simply wandered off or gotten lost in the area rather than being abducted or taken away by someone else. Writing a letter could be one way for her to communicate her situation and location to someone who can help find her.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Penonton bersorak dengan terkejut) is more likely to occur. The use of the word ""bersorak"" in Indonesian implies a strong reaction from the audience, such as surprise or shock. Option B does not convey this same level of intensity. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (kawan saya buat saya menunggu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Saya hilang kesabaran saya"" suggests that Saya has lost her patience, implying that she has been waiting for something to happen or someone to arrive. Option A aligns with this idea as it implies that a friend of Saya's is responsible for making her wait. Option B does not provide any context that would suggest why Saya's friend would be arriving at the right moment. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mereka membangunkan senjata nuklear) is more likely to occur than Option B (Mereka berunding perjanjian). This is because the premise suggests that the countries are in a state of war, which would make it unlikely for them to engage in diplomatic negotiations. Instead, they may resort to using nuclear weapons as a means of gaining an advantage over their enemies.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia menjadi mengantuk) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (kaki sofa terlepas) is more likely to occur than option B (dia memar lutut). This is because the premise mentions that the woman was ""terhempas"" onto the sofa, implying that she was forcibly placed there against her will. It is unlikely that she would be able to move or change position voluntarily while lying on the sofa. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak lelaki itu memerah balon"", option A (balon pecah) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Mereka membuka beg mereka) is more likely to occur. The premise states that they are guests who have registered at a hotel, indicating that they are inside the hotel building. Therefore, it is unlikely for them to go to the airport.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Persik yang lebam) is more likely to occur. The word ""lebam"" in Malay means ""to flow or ooze out"". Therefore, it is more likely that the juice will start to flow or ooze out of the persimmon fruit rather than just spilling over."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tangan saya menjadi lengket,"" it is more likely that option A (Saya makan donat) is the correct answer. The word ""lengket"" in Malay means ""sticky"" or ""gluey"", so it suggests that the speaker's hands are sticking together after eating something sweet like donuts. Option B (""Saya suka gula-gula"") does not make sense in this context as it simply means ""I like sugar""."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya menolak pintu"", it is more likely that option A: Pintu dibuka (The door was opened)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Produk diuji untuk jaminan kualiti) is more likely to be the cause of the activist's boycott. The premise suggests that the product has been tested for quality, implying that there are no issues with its safety or effectiveness. This could potentially reduce the likelihood of a boycott based on concerns about the product's impact on children. Option B (Produk-produk itu dihasilkan melalu buruh kanak-kanak), on the other hand, implies that the product is made through child labor, which would be a valid reason for an activist to call for a boycott.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Tikus merangkak keluar dari lubang) will occur. The reason is that tikus are known to burrow into various materials such as soil, sand, or even walls, and they can easily emerge from a hole in the wall. Debris, on the other hand, may not be able to pass through a small hole in the wall, making Option B less likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (adiknya gembira) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the woman feels jealous towards her brother, indicating that she may have a negative emotional response towards him. It is less likely that the brother would be happy or in a loving relationship with someone else, as this would not align with the given information about the woman's feelings towards him. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya tumpah wain pada baju saya"", it is more likely that Option A (Saya pakai tudung) will occur because the word ""tudung"" means headscarf or hijab in Malay, which suggests that the speaker may have accidentally spilled something on their clothes while wearing a headscarf."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (pelanggan itu mencari dompetnya) is more likely. The premise states that pengurus membuka mesin tunai, which implies that the customer has lost their wallet or money and needs to retrieve it from the ATM machine. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Orang memberi dia perubahan) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the street performer's performance is drawing a crowd, indicating that people are interested in what he is doing. It is unlikely that he would be able to make them leave by ordering them to do so, as they have already gathered around him voluntarily. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak lelaki itu menangis kepada pengasuhnya"", option A (Dia rindu ibu bapanya) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Juruterbang terbang melalui ribut) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pokok itu menumpahkan daunnya"", option A (Daun berubah warna) is the most likely outcome. The word ""menumpahkan"" in Indonesian implies a gentle or gradual flow of something, which suggests that the leaves are changing color gradually rather than suddenly piling up on top of the ground. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia memutuskan untuk bermain kad dengan kakaknya) is more likely. The premise implies that Anak is in a playful mood, and playing cards with his older sister seems like an appropriate activity for someone in such a mood. Option B (Dia memutuskan untuk bermain lelucon praktikal pada adiknya) does not fit as well with the premise, as it suggests something more elaborate and practical than simply playing cards together.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ayahnya memberinya soda untuk diminum) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ikan itu melompat keluar dari tangki) is more likely to occur. The word ""menumpah"" in Indonesian means ""to spill"", so it's reasonable to assume that the food will come out of the container rather than go back into it."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dia terlibat dalam protes) is more likely to occur as a result of the woman's political views changing. The premise suggests that she has become disillusioned with her current party and is now involved in protests, indicating a shift towards more activist politics. Option A (Dia menukar keanggotaan parti) does not necessarily imply a change in political views or actions.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sinki bilik mandi tersumbat"", option A (Saya buka paip) is the most likely outcome as it implies that there is a blockage in the sink drain that needs to be cleared before water can flow through it. Option B (Saya tuangkan pembersih longkang ke dalamnya) does not address the issue of the blocked drain and may even make the situation worse by pushing the debris further down into the pipe. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kereta api tiba di stesen) is more likely to be the cause of the penumpang's fall from the train. This is because the train has arrived at the station, indicating that it has reached its destination and the passengers are expected to disembark. Therefore, it is less likely for the passenger to fall off the train while it is still in motion.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dia meletakkan cap pada sampul surat) is a more likely outcome than option B (Dia menutup sampul surat itu). This is because the word ""meletakkan"" in Indonesian implies placing or setting something down, whereas ""menutup"" means to close or shut something. Therefore, option A better fits the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mereka menikmasi pergaulan masing-masing) is more likely as it suggests that they have moved away from each other due to their individual interests rather than a change in location.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Dia dipecat dari jawatan) is the correct answer. The premise states that the accountant has mismanaged company funds, indicating poor performance or unethical behavior in their duties as an accountant. Therefore, it is likely that the accountant would be fired from their job rather than taking a long leave of absence for personal reasons such as giving birth.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya melihat pada jam"", it is more likely that option A is correct, as ""melihat"" means to see or look at something. Therefore, the sentence should be translated as ""I saw the time on my watch."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tangan saya berkerut"", option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""tangan saya"" refers to one's hand, indicating that the writer is experiencing discomfort or pain in their hand. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Saya gantikan bautnya) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The character in the scenario is trying to fix a stuck door by replacing the hinge, which supports Option A. On the other hand, Option B (Saya memutar kunci) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of turning a key to unlock the door. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the couple moves into the apartment) is more likely. The fact that they have signed a lease suggests that they are committed to living in the apartment for some time, and moving out would require additional effort and resources. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mahu menonton matahari terbenam) is the more likely cause. The woman is sitting outside, indicating that she may be enjoying the sunrise or watching the sky for other reasons related to nature. Option B (Dia fikir dia melihat petir) does not align with this context as storms are typically associated with dark skies and heavy rain, rather than a beautiful sunrise. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dia tak boleh berenang) is more likely to be the cause of why the person is wearing a life jacket in the water. The premise states that the person is ""memakai jaket penyelamat,"" indicating that they are wearing a life jacket, which suggests that they may not be able to swim well or at all. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Dia menekan butang backspace) is more likely to be the correct answer because the premise states that she made a mistake while typing, which could result in pressing the backspace button to delete some of the text. Option A (Dia memadam dokumen itu) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that she would try to erase the entire document.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mendapat markah yang buruk) is more likely to be the cause of her happiness. The premise states that she is happy because of her friends, but does not provide any information about her academic performance. Therefore, it is more plausible that her happiness stems from her social relationships rather than any academic achievement.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Rumput itu berlumpur,"" option A is more likely. The word ""berlumpur"" means ""to be muddy."" Therefore, the most likely explanation for why the grass is wet is that it has been raining. Option B does not make sense in this context because there is no mention of rumpai (weeds) in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia bermalam di sebuah hotel) is a more plausible explanation for why wanita itu tertidur. It suggests that she may have fallen asleep in her hotel room after a long day of traveling or other activities. Option B (Dia lupa untuk menetapkan jam penggera) does not provide any specific reason why she would be sleeping, and seems less likely given the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lelaki itu memakai pelindung matahari,"" we can infer that the person is outside in the sun. Therefore, option A (Dia duduk di tempat teduh) is less likely, as there would be no need for a sun hat if the person were sitting indoors. Option B (Dia pergi ke pantai) is therefore more likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (para penyelidik menarik balik teori itu) is more likely. The premise states that the purpose of a researcher is to disprove a theory, not to accept it. Therefore, it is more likely that the researcher will try to refute or challenge the theory rather than simply accepting it without evidence.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the game has entered an additional phase) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""Peminat di perlawanan itu berteriak,"" indicating that the fans are protesting against something related to the game. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as dissatisfaction with the game's mechanics, disappointment with the storyline, or frustration with the game's performance issues. However, there is no indication in the premise that the game has entered a new phase, which would be a rare occurrence in most games. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Saya menutup kunci) will occur because if Saya enters a wrong code, the key will be locked.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Bapa itu memberikan anaknya sejumlah wang) is more likely to occur as a result of the father's actions. The phrase ""orang ramai semakin kuat"" suggests that the father's wealth has increased, implying that he now has more money to give away or share with his family members. In contrast, holding someone's hand does not necessarily imply financial gain. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Saya mengumpulkan salji menjadi bola salji."" This is because the word ""menyekat"" means to tighten or constrict, which suggests that the path ahead of the speaker has become narrower or blocked by something, making it difficult for them to pass through. Therefore, the speaker may try to gather the sand into a ball to make it easier to move around the obstacle."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (kayak itu terhempas ombak) is more likely to occur. The word ""terhempas"" means ""to be tossed around violently"", indicating that the kayak will be affected by strong waves or winds, leading to a bumpy ride. Option A (""kayak itu sampai ke pantai"") simply states that the kayak will reach the beach, without providing any information about the conditions of the journey."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Dia terhempas ke pagar) is more likely to happen as it provides a logical explanation for why the girl's motorcycle disappeared without her. The idea of her simply releasing the driver doesn't seem as plausible or consistent with the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya hidupkan kipas angin,"" option A is more likely. The word ""hidupkan"" means to fan or blow air, so it's likely that the effect of the wind on Saya's skin is being described."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mereka basah) is more likely. The premise states that they are trying to get back to the beach, which implies that they are already in a wet state from being in the water. Therefore, it is more likely that they are simply getting wetter rather than looking jerky.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Air mengalir keluar dari tab mandi) is the more likely outcome. The premise states that Saya is pulled into a well, indicating that she was submerged in water. As air cannot flow out of a well, it is more likely that her body will float to the surface rather than change direction and move towards the floor.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dia mengaku perselingkuhannya kepadanya) is more likely to be the effect of the husband's actions. The husband has admitted to cheating on his wife, which suggests that he may feel guilty or remorseful about his actions and may want to confess to her in order to make amends. This is consistent with the idea that the husband feels responsible for his mistake and wants to take responsibility for it. Option A (Dia menuduh dia tidak setia) does not align with this interpretation as it implies that the husband is blaming himself for something he did not do.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Saya menunggu dakwat itu kering) is more likely to be the correct answer because if you are waiting for something to dry, it would make sense that you would wait until it is completely dry before handling or touching it. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak itu bangun menjerit,"" we can infer that the child woke up crying. Therefore, option A (the child had a bad dream) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak itu meletakkan kakinya di atas meja,"" option A (Ayahnya duduk di meja) is a more likely outcome than option B (Ayahnya mengajarnya). This is because the premise suggests that the child is placing its feet on the table, indicating that the child is in close proximity to the father who is sitting at the table. Therefore, option A is a more likely outcome than option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kawan saya menoleh ke arah saya"", it is more likely that option A (Saya menjerit namanya) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""menoleh ke arah"" suggests movement towards something or someone, which aligns with the meaning of ""menjerit"" as to lean or incline. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kerajaan menindas rakyatnya"", it is more likely that the effect will be Option A: Rakyat berbaris. This is because when a kingdom oppresses its people, they are more likely to rise up in protest or rebellion rather than simply voting for their leaders."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia mendirikan khemah) is more likely. The word ""tersesat"" implies that the person is lost or disoriented in a place they are not familiar with, making it difficult for them to find their way back. Building a shelter would be a practical solution to protect oneself from the elements and provide a sense of security while trying to find a way out of the forest. Option B (Dia menjerit minta tolong) does not make as much sense in this context, as asking for help may not be feasible or safe in a remote location where there may be no one around to assist."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mahu belajar menggambar) is more likely as the reason for her going abroad. The premise mentions that she wants to learn about painting, which suggests that she may be interested in developing a new skill or hobby while abroad. Option B (Dia mahu belajar tentang budaya lain) could also be a possibility, but without additional context, it seems less likely given the information provided.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Rakan kerjanya mendapat promosi) is more likely to be the cause of the coworker's jealousy. The premise states that the coworker is feeling jealous because their colleague has been promoted, indicating that they are envious of their success. Option B (Rakan kerjanya bekerja lewat) does not provide any information about why the coworker might be feeling jealous, so it is less likely to be the cause in this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia berhalusinasi) is more likely. The passage states that the person was ""menyaksikan makhluk asing,"" indicating that they were seeing something strange or unusual. This suggests that their mind may have been wandering or daydreaming, rather than being focused in meditation. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person was ""berhalusinasi."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia letak peluntur di dalamnya) is more likely as a cause for why the man's hair turned into a battle helmet. The premise suggests that something was placed inside the man's body, which could be interpreted as a pellet or pill, rather than a small object like a shampu. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Dia mengkritik karya terdahulu beliau) is the correct answer. The passage states that Artis mencipta karya baru, indicating that he is creating new works of art. This suggests that he may be critiquing or evaluating his previous work as a way to inspire himself for new creations. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how Artis came up with the idea for his latest creation.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia telah dibebaskan dari tentera) is more likely as an explanation for why the young man has left his home. The phrase ""dibebaskan dari tentera"" implies that he was previously under military service or captivity, and has now been released or freed from this obligation. This could be due to various reasons such as completing his term of service, being granted amnesty, or escaping from captivity. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Buku jatuh dari rak buku"", option A is more likely. The reason being that a book falling from a shelf is more plausible than an earthquake causing the books to fall. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Saya menyalakan lampu) will occur because turning on a light can help to restore power to the house. Resetting the circuit breaker may not necessarily fix the issue if there is a problem with the electrical system beyond the circuit breaker.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ia kelihatan menakutkan) is more likely. The use of the word ""menakutkan"" suggests that the person is feeling anxious or uneasy about something, which aligns with the idea of being scared or frightened by a roller coaster ride."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Saya tuangkan mentega ke dalam beg) will result in a better tasting popcorn. This is because butter adds flavor to the popcorn when it is drizzled over the kernels before they are popped. Microwaving the popcorn without any additional seasonings may not produce the same delicious taste as adding butter directly to the kernels before popping them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Listrik di kejiranan itu terputus) is the more likely outcome. The falling coconut tree is unlikely to cause a power outage in the surrounding area.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Dia membosankan penonton) is the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker makes false comments from a political perspective, indicating that they are intentionally misleading or deceiving their audience. This behavior is consistent with Option A, where the speaker is trying to confuse or fool the listeners.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (one drop of blood forms on my finger) is more likely to occur. The act of stabbing oneself with a pin can cause minor injuries such as small cuts or puncture wounds, leading to bleeding. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome in this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ikan itu terapung di permukaan tangki,"" option A (ia lapar) is the more likely cause. The word ""terapung"" in Malay means ""floating,"" indicating that the fish is still alive and floating on the surface of the tank. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Suara lelaki itu terdengar serak"", option A (Dia demam) is the most likely cause. The sound of a man's voice being hoarse could be caused by a variety of factors, including illness or infection such as pneumonia or bronchitis, but it is less likely to be caused by stopping smoking."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lif tiba di tingkat yang ditetapkan) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""Pintu lif dibuka,"" indicating that the door was opened, and then it mentions ""tingkat yang ditetapkan"" or ""the designated level."" This suggests that the door was opened from a lower level to a higher level, which aligns with option A. Option B does not fit well with the given information as there is no mention of the door being opened from one level to another. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia berbohong kepada ibu bapanya) is more likely to be the cause of Remaja's absence from home. This is because the premise states that Remaja ""menyelinap keluar dari rumah,"" indicating that he left without his parents' knowledge or consent. It is unlikely that Remaja's mother would hukum him for something he did not do, so option B (Ibu bapanya menghukumnya) is not a viable choice in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the cause of the flooded field is Option A: Toilet terbanjiri. This is because a toilet overflowing with water can potentially cause a nearby field to become flooded, especially if the field is low-lying or has poor drainage. In contrast, Option B: Pemanas air rosak may not directly cause a field to become flooded, as the buildup of hot air in a greenhouse would typically result in increased humidity and temperature inside the structure rather than outside.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pemiliknya meletakkan kolar pada anak anjing itu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the dog is living nearby its owner, indicating a close relationship between them. It is unlikely for the owner to leave the dog unattended without any means of identification or protection, especially if they are living nearby each other. Therefore, it is more plausible that the owner would keep the dog near them by attaching a leash.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lelaki itu menangkap pantulan dirinya"", option A (Dia berdiri di bawah pokok yang luas) is the more likely cause. The image of a person standing under a large tree suggests that they are in an outdoor setting, and the reflection in the water could be caused by sunlight filtering through the leaves above. Option B (Dia berdiri di atas tasik yang tenang) does not fit with this interpretation as there would be no trees or other obstructions to create a reflection in the water."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Saya telefon dia balik) is more likely to happen. The fact that the friend's number was saved in Saya's phone suggests that they have been in contact before, and it is more probable that Saya will reach out to her directly rather than planning a meeting for dinner.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Anjing mereka lari dari rumah) is the more likely cause of their search. The family is searching for something near their home, indicating that they are looking for an animal that has escaped or run away from their house. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya nampak nafas saya ketika saya menghembus nafas"", option B (Dada saya terasa ketat) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""nampak nafas"" suggests that the speaker can see their breath, which is a common symptom of feeling cold or uncomfortable. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's chest feels tight due to being cold rather than the weather being hot."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mereka mahukan keadaan kerja yang lebih baik) is more likely as the reason for the increase in productivity. The premise suggests that workers are forming unions to improve their working conditions, which implies that they are seeking better job satisfaction and a more conducive work environment. This is more likely than the second option, where employers are increasing wages simply because it is not explicitly mentioned in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (bau busuk memenuhi dapur) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the idea of a ""stinky"" or unpleasant smell filling the kitchen."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia memakai kasut tumit tinggi) is more likely. The passage states that ""Wanita itu berjuang untuk berjalan,"" indicating that she is struggling to walk. This suggests that her legs are weak or injured, making it difficult for her to move around without assistance. Using a high heel shoe would not provide enough support or stability for someone with mobility issues, so option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Uap naik dari periuk air,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Air mendidih"" (the water level in the tank has risen) is the cause of the uap rising from the spout. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Semua stoking saya berada di tempat dobi,"" it is more likely that option A (Saya memakai sandal) is correct. The word ""stoking"" in Malay implies a sense of familiarity or closeness to something, so it is unlikely that the speaker would be wearing a pair of shoes (kasut bot). Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia kehilangan sokongan pengundi) is the more likely outcome for the politician who makes such a statement. The statement implies that the politician has lost the support of their constituents or voters, which could lead to a decline in their popularity and influence in politics. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the couple is pregnant) is the most likely outcome. The fact that everyone disagrees with their marriage suggests that there may be underlying issues or conflicts that are not immediately apparent, but a pregnancy would add an additional layer of complexity to the situation. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice given the information provided.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Jutawan itu mahu bangunan itu dirobohkan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the building was dedicated to a charity, indicating that it was built for a specific purpose. Therefore, it is more likely that the building was destroyed by the earthquake rather than the charity donating money to build it.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (penjual melihat gadis itu meletakkan barang dagangan di dalam begnya) is the more likely cause. The penjual saw the girl putting something in her bag, indicating that she may have stolen something from the market.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tentera has been deployed with their families) is more likely. The premise states that the country has declared war on a neighboring region, indicating that military action is imminent or already underway. This suggests that soldiers have been mobilized and deployed to the conflict zone, including with their families who may be accompanying them for support and safety reasons. Therefore, Option B is the more likely outcome based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a riot breaks out in front of the court) is more likely to occur as a result of the controversial decision made by the court. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mengambil biskut dari balang) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""Gadis itu mencium bau sesuatu yang terbakar,"" indicating that she smelled something burning. This suggests that there was already a fire present before she took the biscuit from the oven. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hujan lebat"", option A (Ribut semakin teruk) is more likely to occur."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A: Lift stopped functioning as the cause of the building's evacuation. The alarm kebakaran (fire alarm) may have been triggered by a different issue in the building, such as a smoke detector or a fire in a nearby area. However, if the lift stops working, it can create a significant obstacle for people to evacuate the building quickly and safely, making it the most likely cause for an emergency evacuation.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ayahnya menendang anaknya keluar dari rumah) is more likely to happen as a result of the father's anger towards his son's alcohol addiction. The father may feel disappointed or frustrated with his son's behavior and decide to take action by kicking him out of the house. Option A (Bapa itu membeli anaknya bir) does not align with the premise as buying alcohol for one's child is unlikely to solve their addiction problem.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Setiausaha pulang untuk hari ini) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""pulang untuk hari ini"" implies that the lawyer has returned home for today, indicating that he/she is not currently at work. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kawan dia mengganggu dia) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the woman is angry with her friend, indicating that there has been some kind of conflict or disagreement between them. It is less likely that the friend would buy the woman lunch as a gesture of goodwill if they are already in a difficult relationship.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (pengurus kasir memberikan gadis itu kembali) is more likely to occur. The fact that the gadis itu has given her money to a juruwang suggests that she may not have received any return for her investment, which means that the pengurus kasir is unlikely to give her back her money. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia lumpuh dalam kemalangan) is the more likely cause of her condition. The premise states that she was placed in a wheelchair, which suggests that she may have suffered an injury or illness that left her unable to walk or move around freely. This could potentially lead to cognitive impairment or confusion, but it does not necessarily imply that she would be admitted to a hospital. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of her condition based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Negara itu meraikan kemerdekaannya) is the more likely cause of people hanging flags outside their homes. This is because gaining independence often brings a sense of pride and nationalism among citizens, leading them to display symbols of their country's flag as a way to express their identity and loyalty. On the other hand, economic struggles may not necessarily lead to an increase in flag displays, as people may be more focused on meeting basic needs such as food and shelter rather than expressing patriotism. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mereka memberi inspirasi kepada peminat mereka) is more likely. The passage states that the team's loss in the final match gave their fans hope for next year, indicating that the team inspired their fans rather than disappointed them.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Kawan will feel embarrassed (Option A). The premise states that Kawan's friend saw something stuck in their teeth, implying a social faux pas or embarrassment. Therefore, Option A is the most appropriate response.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia memberi perhatian semasa kelas) is more likely as the reason for his poor performance in history class. The premise suggests that he was distracted during class, which could have affected his ability to learn and retain information. Option B (Dia lupa untuk belajar) does not provide a clear explanation for why he performed poorly in history class.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (gempa bumi melanda bandar) is more likely to be the cause of the building collapse in the city center. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings, especially those that are not designed or constructed to withstand seismic activity. Therefore, it is more plausible that a strong earthquake could lead to the collapse of a building in the city center than an increase in crime rate.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia memohon untuk dia kembali) is more likely. The fact that the son has been away from his mother for a long time and has not seen her suggests that he may be feeling guilty or remorseful about leaving her behind, leading him to want to make amends by asking her to come back with him. This is in contrast to option B (Dia memperkenalkannya kepada ibu bapanya), where there is no indication of any guilt or remorse on the part of the son, and instead focuses on introducing the mother to someone new.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (bola itu berputar) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ada kadbod di tong sampah) is more likely. The presence of a body in the trash suggests that there may have been foul play involved in the raccoon's death, rather than it simply being a natural occurrence.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak itu mengasah pensil,"" option A (ia murah) is the more likely cause. The word ""murah"" in Indonesian means cheap or affordable, so it is more likely that the child is doing the task because it is cheaper to do so rather than because it is difficult or boring."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dia hilang resitnya) is more likely. The reason being that if the bank manager refused to accept the money without proper documentation or evidence of ownership, it's possible that the woman may have lost her chance to retrieve her belongings. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the woman was unable to get her things back.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Goresan pada kulit saya sangat dalam,"" it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Ia sembuh dengan cepat."" The word ""sembuh"" means to heal or recover quickly, indicating a fast recovery from the wound."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak itu meninggalkan serpihan di atas lantai"", option B (Anak itu meletakkan roti itu) is a more likely outcome as it aligns with the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Adik perempuan itu menggenggam tangannya) is the most likely cause of the situation. The fact that the woman is giving her brother a handkerchief suggests that he may be crying or upset, and the adjective ""perempuan"" in the sentence implies that the speaker is referring to a female character. Therefore, option A is the best answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bibirnya pecah) is more likely. The premise states that ""Lelaki itu mengambil mint,"" indicating that the person took something, which could be a medication or a food item. If the person took a medication, it's possible that their lips might break or crack as a side effect. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They were delayed due to traffic around the theater) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Bosnya memujinya) is more likely to occur. The premise suggests that the woman is not working outside her home, implying a lack of financial independence and agency. This could lead to a situation where she is reliant on someone else for support, such as her husband or bosnya, who may exert control over her.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia menyokong tujuan mereka) is more likely. The use of the word ""menandatangani"" implies that the person signed a petition in support of their activist group's goals, rather than criticizing them as crazy."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia takut pentas) is more likely to be the cause of the actor's nervousness before a performance. The premise suggests that the actor is anxious about facing the audience, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya tersesat,"" option A (Saya kira wang saya) is more likely to occur because it implies that Saya is lost or disoriented, which could lead to confusion about the direction of the way back home. Option B (Saya membuka peta) does not necessarily imply a sense of confusion or disorientation, but rather a proactive approach to finding one's way back home."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Buah yang matang berlama-lama di bawah sinar matahari,"" it is more likely that the fruit has been eaten (Option A). The passage does not mention anything about the fruit shrinking or changing in any other way, only that it has been left under the sun for a long time. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that someone or something has consumed the fruit."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the cause of the train derailment is Option A: Saya menghidupkan pencucuhan (I caused an accident). This is because the phrase ""kereta rosak"" (train derailed) suggests a sudden and unexpected event, which is consistent with the idea of causing an accident through one's own actions. The second option, ""Enjin terlalu panas"" (The engine was too hot), does not seem to fit as well with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia pergi berjumpa dengan seorang psikiatri) is more likely. The premise suggests that the person is experiencing emotional distress and may benefit from seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome than option B (Dia tinggal di tempat tidur selama beberapa hari), which does not necessarily address the underlying issues causing the emotional distress.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya menyalakan api di perapian,"" it is more likely that Option A (Saya kehabisan kayu bakar) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""menyalakan"" means to light or ignite something, indicating that an fire has been started. The phrase ""kehabisan kayu bakar"" also suggests that there are no more logs left to burn, further supporting this conclusion."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wanita itu berhenti berjoging,"" option A is more likely. The word ""berhenti"" implies a sudden stop or halt, which could be caused by an injury or illness on her side. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya mengetuk pintu jiran saya"", it is more likely that option A will occur - Jiran saya menjemput saya masuk. This is because the word ""mengetuk"" implies a gentle knock or tap on the door, which suggests that someone is trying to enter the house."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (suami salah faham kebimbangannya) is more likely to be the cause of her disappointment. The phrase ""menghela nafas"" suggests that she is feeling down or depressed, which could be due to a misunderstanding or miscommunication with her husband. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the student answered the question correctly) is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia pergi ke ladang) is more likely because a woman who has too many eggs in her womb may go to the fields to sell them instead of going to the market.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Saya mendedahkan rahsia kepadanya) will occur. The premise suggests a meeting with an old friend, and while there may be some excitement or happiness in seeing each other again, it is unlikely that Saya would reveal a secret to someone they haven't seen in a long time without any build-up or context. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menangkap ikan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the woman avoided entering the pond, indicating that she may have been afraid of something in the water. It is unlikely that she would be ""tercemar"" or stained by simply avoiding a body of water. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Payungnya rosak) is the more likely cause of the student's arrival at class wet. As the premise states that the student ""tiba di kelas basah,"" indicating that they arrived at a wet or damp location, which could be due to their umbrella breaking or leaking. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (pengguna mengklik tetikus) is more likely as it implies that the user interacts with the computer screen by clicking a button or icon using their mouse. Option B (pengguna menggerakkan tetikus) does not provide any context for how the user interacts with the computer screen.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kemalangan berlaku di jalan utama) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (linen that has been wet) is more likely to have a stronger scent than option A (dried linen). This is because when linen is exposed to water, it absorbs moisture and can take on the odors of its surroundings, including any fragrances or chemicals present in the air. As a result, wet linen may retain these smells longer than dry linen, which could potentially be less effective at masking unpleasant odors.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wanita itu memakai cermin mata"", option A (cahaya matahari terang) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lelaki itu memandang ke langit malam,"" option B (Dia fikir ia indah) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""memandang ke langit malam"" suggests that the person is gazing up at the sky, which could be a sign of admiration or wonder. Therefore, it is more likely that the person finds the night sky beautiful rather than hoping to become warm weather."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya berasa letih"", it is more likely that option A (Saya tidur awal) is correct. The phrase ""berasa letih"" means feeling tired or exhausted, so it is likely that the speaker went to sleep early due to their fatigue. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Rambutnya semakin panjang. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""Lelaki itu pergi ke tukang cukur,"" indicating that someone went to a barber. This implies that their hair was cut or trimmed. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause as it suggests that the person's hair grew longer after visiting the barber."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya mengidam segelas susu"", it is more likely that option A (Saya makan biskut) is correct. The word ""mengidam"" in Malay means to eat or consume something, and the phrase ""segelas susu"" specifically refers to milk. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would choose to eat a snack like biscuits instead of baking bread."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the driver turns on the headlights) is more likely to happen because it provides better visibility for the driver during heavy rain.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tempat letak kereta bangunan itu kosong"", option A (Saya letak kereta di seberang jalan) is more likely to be true because if the parking lot is empty, it means that there are no cars parked in it, including yours. Therefore, you would most likely park your car across the street from the building rather than near the entrance."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the writer experienced a problem with writing (Option A). The fact that they have missed the deadline suggests that there may be an issue with their ability to write the draft, rather than simply editing it.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Saya minta bercakap dengan penyelia) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker's phone has been shut off, indicating that they are unable to contact the owner directly. Therefore, the most logical course of action would be to ask someone else who may know how to reach the owner, such as a neighbor or a friend. Option B (Saya memberikan nombor pengenalan saya) does not make sense in this context, as providing one's identification number will not help the speaker locate the owner of the phone.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the sound of a door creaking) is more likely to be the cause of the noise. The premise mentions that the noise is coming from outside through an open window, which suggests that the source of the noise is something external rather than internal. Therefore, the sound of a door creaking is a more plausible explanation for the noise described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Saya cabut palam) caused the power outage in your home. This is because a loose connection or a blown fuse can disrupt the flow of electricity to various parts of the house, leading to a power outage. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia melenturkan ototnya di cermin) is the more likely cause of her weight gain. The premise states that she has been exercising regularly but hasn't seen any results, suggesting that exercise alone may not be enough to explain her weight gain. It is possible that she may have gained muscle mass through resistance training, such as lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises, which could potentially increase her weight without a corresponding change in body fat percentage. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for her weight gain based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dia keliru) is more likely. The pelajar is trying to solve a mathematical problem in his head, but he makes a mistake due to lack of concentration or understanding. This is a common occurrence for many students when they are struggling with math problems, so option B is the most plausible outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bapa menukar lampin bayi) is more likely to be the cause of the baby's sleepiness. The premise suggests that the baby was tired because its father changed its diaper, which implies that the baby was not getting enough rest or comfort from its usual source (its mother). Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the baby's sleepiness than option B (Bapa itu perlahan-lahan menggelengkan bayi itu), which does not provide any specific reason for the baby's fatigue.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (budak itu mengalami gegaran otak) is more likely to occur. The premise suggests that the girl's actions are causing harm or discomfort to someone else, which could result in mental distress or confusion rather than simply being wet. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Gambar-gambarnya kabur) is more likely. The use of flashlight in a camera can cause blurriness in images due to the uneven lighting conditions. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pictures taken with the flashlight will be blurry rather than everyone in the picture avoiding smiling.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Saya kesepian) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya bersenam,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as ""bersenam"" means to be in a state of exhaustion or fatigue. Therefore, Saya is likely to feel tired or weakened rather than scared or nervous (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya memerah sponge lembap,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Ia menyerap air"" (She absorbs water) will occur. The word ""memerah"" in Malay means to absorb or soak up, indicating that the subject (Saya) is capable of taking in or absorbing something (water). Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise than Option B, which suggests that water is coming out of her instead of being absorbed by her."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Resort itu sudah dipesan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the traveler has already booked a resort, indicating that the trip is planned and arranged in advance. Therefore, it is less likely that the traveler would need to search for a new resort at this point.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia takut jarum) is more likely as the reason for getting a tattoo. The premise states that the teenager got a tattoo, implying that they were scared of needles, which is a common fear among people who are afraid of injections or medical procedures involving needles. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Saya mula curiga) is more likely. The fact that a mysterious car has been left outside one's house would likely elicit curiosity rather than an immediate call to the police.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bukti menunjukkan dia terlibat) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Penjenayah itu menyerahkan dirinya,"" indicating that the thief surrendered themselves. This suggests that there may be evidence linking them to the crime, such as a confession or physical proof of their involvement. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia dah berhenti makan gula-gula) is more likely to cause weight loss. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gadis itu melangkah di atas ais,"" option A (Dia tergelincir) is more likely. The phrase ""melangkah di atas ais"" suggests that the girl is walking on something high above ground level, such as a bridge or a cliff. This implies that she could potentially lose her balance and fall, which is consistent with Option A. In contrast, Option B (""Dia gemetar"") does not fit with this context and means ""She screamed."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wanita itu mempunyai cincin di bawah matanya,"" option A is more likely. The woman is guarding something (her cincin) throughout the night, indicating that she may be protective of her belongings or valuables. Option B does not align with the given premise as there is no mention of the woman putting her child to sleep."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Gunung berapi meletus) is more likely. The passage states that lava is flowing from a volcano, indicating that the volcano is active and erupting. This suggests that the volcano is releasing magma through a vent or fissure, resulting in an eruption. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wanita itu memakai kasutnya"", option A is more likely. The woman is known to everyone at the party, indicating that she is sociable and friendly. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - Saya bayar pembantu tol. The premise states that Saya has already paid for the toll, so it is unlikely that the toll booth attendant would have stopped them. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menjual saham syarikatnya) is the more likely cause of the executive's financial difficulties. The premise states that the executive has become poorer despite being an executive, suggesting that he may have lost money through investments or other financial ventures. Selling shares in a company would be one possible way for an executive to lose money, making option A the more likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Doktor sedang cuti) is more likely. The premise states that the person went to the doctor, but there is no indication in the premise that the doctor is unavailable or busy. Therefore, it is more likely that the doctor is simply taking a break rather than being sick.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Rumah itu terbakar) is the more likely cause. The fact that Saya keluar dari bilik tidur saya melalui tingkap suggests that there was a fire in the room, as smoke from the fire would have filled the room and made it difficult to breathe or see clearly enough to open the window. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why Saya keluar dari bilik tidur saya melalui tingkap.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jari-jari budak itu menjadi prune,"" option A (Dia mandi lama) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""menjadi prune"" suggests that the child's fingers have become wrinkled or aged, which could be caused by prolonged immersion in water. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya meludah keluar susu"", option A is more likely. The word ""meludah"" means to spit out or cough up, so it suggests that there is something wrong with the milk that is causing Saya to spit it out. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya terlepas bas,"" it is more likely that option B (Saya terlambat ke tempat kerja) is the correct answer. The phrase ""terlepas bas"" implies a delay or lateness, which is consistent with option B."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mereka menang) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Botol soda berisiul"", option A (Saya pusing botol) is the more likely cause. The word ""bersiul"" in Malay means to burst or explode, so it is unlikely that the bottle would be rotating due to internal pressure caused by carbonation (option B).

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Wanita itu mengintip melalui lubang kunci di pintu) is more likely to occur as the word ""mengintip"" implies a stealthy action of peeking through a small hole in the door without making any noise or disturbance. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Dia dah kemas kering. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Lelaki itu mencemarkan pakaian"", we can infer that the person has already put their clothes away in a place where they will not be easily accessible or visible to others.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gadis itu memerah tiub ubat gigi"", option B is more likely. The girl is likely to spit out the toothpaste rather than have it come out of her nose."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Pasifists protesting) will be the result of a sudden increase in civilian deaths due to war. This is because pasifism is often associated with peaceful resistance and nonviolent activism, rather than violent action such as arracking. Therefore, if there were an unexpected surge in civilian casualties during a war, it is possible that pasifists would organize protests and demonstrations to draw attention to their cause and pressure those involved in the conflict to find a peaceful resolution.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gadis itu menarik tali dari rambutnya"", option B is more likely. The phrase ""menarik tali"" implies that the girl is pulling or taking something from her hair, which could be a tangle of hair or even a small object like a ribbon.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sejuk masuk melalu tiang"", it is more likely that option A (Saya berehat) will occur. This is because ""sejuk"" means ""cool"" or ""calm"", which suggests a state of relaxation rather than agitation or excitement. Therefore, it is more likely that the person will feel calm and relaxed upon entering through the window, rather than feeling anxious or scared as suggested by option B (Saya gemetar)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (rakan sekelasnya menghormatinya) is more likely as the reason for the student's success in college. The passage states that the student received a scholarship to go to college, indicating that they have financial support from their peers or others.

Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the student's success in college.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia tinggal bersebelahan dengannya) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""mengejek lelaki itu"" suggests that the girl is teasing or flirting with the guy, which could lead to them living together. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."

The phrase ""lapar mencuri"" implies that the thief is hungry and in need of food, while ""menghasut belas kasihan"" means to deceive or cheat someone. Therefore, it is more likely that the thief is trying to scam or deceive people rather than being genuinely poor."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Saya mahu privaci) is more likely. The use of the word ""mahu"" (want) suggests that Saya wants to have some time alone or privacy, rather than feeling lonely (kesepian). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Saya berjabat tangan dengannya) is the most likely outcome. The use of the phrase ""menghulurkan tangannya"" suggests that the person is extending their hand in a friendly or peaceful manner, rather than attacking or harming someone.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Saya berpeluh) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""berpeluh"" means ""to become dizzy or disoriented,"" which could potentially lead to someone feeling as though they are being attacked by a swarm of bees. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gadis itu menggigit kuku"", option A (Dia risau) is a more likely response as it implies that she was surprised or startled by something.

Therefore, option A is the better fit based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia memecat peguamnya) is the most likely outcome. The husband's reaction of firing his lawyer suggests that he is trying to take control of the situation and protect himself from any potential legal consequences of his wife's infidelity. It is less likely for him to fail to divorce his wife (option B), as this would suggest a lack of effort or motivation to address the issue.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gadis itu menjatuhkan bola getah"", option A (Bola itu melompat) is the most likely outcome."

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mereka sudah masak) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Bumbung mahkamah meletup) is more likely to occur as a result of a tornado touching down in the area. The term ""mahkamah"" refers to a courthouse or court building, which suggests that the impact of the tornado will be concentrated in one specific location rather than spread out over a larger area like a highway becoming dangerous due to debris. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the value of the student increases) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya berasa selesa,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""berasa selesa"" means to feel comfortable or at ease, so it is unlikely that Saya would be curled up in a ball (option B) as this would not align with the meaning of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya dah lapis batu itu,"" option A (Ia menjadi licin) is the more likely outcome.

Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the premise provided.

Therefore, option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mereka kalah dalam permainan) is more likely as the reason for their disagreement.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya meminta maaf,"" option A is more likely.

Option B does not necessarily imply this same level of responsibility or self-awareness."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia bertanya soalan tentang dirinya) is more likely. The fact that she is feeling bored with her friend suggests that she may be seeking information or validation from others to alleviate her feelings of monotony.

Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gadis itu tersenyum"", the most likely effect is Option A - Matanya merah (Her eyes are red)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kapal musuh meletup"", option A (Ia melintasi lombong) is the most likely cause. The word ""meletup"" implies a sudden and violent impact, which suggests that the ship was hit by something large and heavy, such as another ship or an object falling from the sky.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lelaki itu menusuk kakinya"", option B (Dia menginjak kaca pecah) is the most likely cause."

Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mereka akan berjalan ke dalam lalu lintas yang datang) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for why the guard would blow his whistle. The other option does not provide any logical reasoning for why the guard would recognize the children from afar.

Explanation: Based on the premise ""Kereta kehabisan minyak,"" it is more likely that the driver of the car will take a detour through a narrow road to avoid the traffic jam caused by the oil spill. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wanita itu mula bersalin"", option A is the most likely answer as bayi has not been born yet."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Topi lelaki itu tertiup angin"", option B is more likely. The phrase ""tertiup angin"" means that something (in this case, the top) is blown away by the wind. Therefore, it is more likely that the man's hat was blown away by the wind rather than him simply leaving it behind."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menerima jemputan) is more likely. The fact that she was invited to a party by her classmate suggests that there may be some mutual interest or connection between them, rather than simply buying a gift as implied in option B. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dahi budak itu terasa panas,"" option A is more likely. The word ""terasa"" means ""feels hot,"" so it's likely that the child is feeling uncomfortable due to heat.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mahu menarik perhatian teman kencannya) is the more likely cause for why a person might spray themselves with cologne. The premise suggests that the person wants to attract their friend's attention, which is more likely to be achieved through scent than by applying gel to their hair. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Listrik di rumah itu terputus,"" option A (Saya mencari lampu suluh) is the most likely outcome. This is because when the power at home is cut off, one of the first things people usually do is look for a flashlight or other source of light to navigate their way around in the dark. Option B (Saya mengambil sekop) does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no logical connection between finding a shovel and dealing with a power outage."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (ibu melahirkan anak kembar) is more likely as a cause for the family moving to a larger house. The premise mentions that the family has grown bigger, indicating that there are now more members in the household, including at least one newborn baby. This is consistent with the idea of a woman giving birth to twins or other multiples, which would require a larger living space. In contrast, Option A (anak lelaki itu lulus dari sekolah menengah) does not necessarily imply a need for a larger home.
"Response:  Option B: Dia nampak garis penamat. 
Explanation: The premise states that the runner's pace slowed down gradually, indicating that they are feeling tired or exhausted. Option B better fits this scenario as a runner who sees the finish line ahead may feel motivated to push through their fatigue and speed up, resulting in a slower pace towards the end of the race. In contrast, option A does not provide a clear explanation for why the runner would want to conserve energy, especially if they are nearing the finish line."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mesin meludah keluar perubahan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""mesin menendang"" suggests that something is wrong with the machine itself, rather than an external factor like a bug or a person's actions. Additionally, the use of the word ""meludah"" implies a gradual change or malfunction, which is consistent with a mechanical issue. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the problem described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Saya menggelincir mata saya pada dia) is the correct answer. The phrase ""menggelincir mata"" means to blink or wink, which suggests a subtle expression of emotion rather than a full-on hug. Therefore, option A is the more appropriate response given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Option A: Dia menulis IOU. 
Explanation: If a customer's credit application is rejected, they are less likely to write an IOU (Option A) than to pay with cash (Option B). An IOU is a written promise to pay back a debt at a later time, often used when someone doesn't have immediate access to funds. Writing an IOU indicates that the person may not have enough money immediately but will try to repay the amount in the future. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia memotong kuku) is the more likely cause of the situation described.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Adiknya bergaduh dengan ibu bapa mereka) is more likely to be the cause of the pride felt by the speaker. The sentence ""Lelaki itu berasa bangga dengan adiknya"" suggests that the speaker feels proud of their brother's achievements, which could be due to their close relationship or shared experiences. On the other hand, option B does not provide any context or reason for why the speaker would feel proud of their brother's acceptance into a law school, making it less likely as the cause of their pride."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dia memandang bintang-bintang) is more likely. The premise mentions that the girl wants to learn about the solar system, which can be observed in the night sky by looking at the stars. Therefore, Option B is a more plausible response.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poster itu melekat di dinding,"" option A (Saya letak poster di atas pintu) is the most likely cause."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tangan dia gemetar) is more likely as a cause of the effect ""Lelaki itu menjatuhkan sudu"". The phrase ""tangan dia gemetar"" means ""he/she hit his/her head"", which could potentially cause dizziness or loss of balance leading to falling over. Option B (Dia menjilat sudu) does not provide any logical explanation for why the person would fall over after hitting their head."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Lembaga pengarah membubarkan syarikat itu) is the more likely outcome. The CEO of a company has been removed from their position, indicating that they have been dismissed or asked to resign. This suggests that there may be serious issues with the CEO's performance or conduct, leading to their removal by the board of directors. Option B (Lembaga pengarah dah jumpa pengganti dia) implies that a new CEO has already been appointed, which would not be consistent with the premise provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Saya menghampiri podium) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Keluarga mereka membayar jaminan) is more likely as the reason for the person's release from prison. The premise suggests that the person was imprisoned but then released due to their family paying a guarantee, which is a common practice in some legal systems as an alternative to serving time in prison. Option B (Dia menyerang rakan banduan) does not align with this premise and seems less plausible given the information provided.
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Rumah mereka terbakar) is more likely to be the cause of their financial difficulties. The passage does not provide any evidence that they sold their house (option A). In fact, it states that they lost all their belongings, suggesting that their home was destroyed in a fire. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for their financial struggles.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tin itu telah dikitar semula) is more likely. The word ""dikitar"" in Malay means to crush or flatten something, so it's unlikely that the tin would be destroyed (option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gadis itu menyertai pasukan perdebatan,"" option B is more likely. The girl is joining a debate team, indicating that she will be learning communication skills rather than computer skills."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Saya mendengar muzik) is the more likely cause of my mood improving. Listening to music can have a positive impact on one's mood, reducing stress and anxiety while also promoting relaxation and happiness. Therefore, it is more plausible that listening to music led to an improvement in my mood rather than washing my face with soap (option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mereka memberi makan orang yang tiada tempat tinggal) is more likely. The premise suggests that the organization's main goal is to collect money, which could be used to provide food for people who have no place to live. This aligns with Option A, as providing food for those in need is a common way for organizations to help individuals who are homeless or struggling financially. In contrast, Option B (Mereka mengadakan lelongan) does not necessarily align with the premise, as organizing a sale is not directly related to helping people who have no place to live.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the passengers will be screaming (option B). The idea of a rollercoaster plummeting towards a steep drop is likely to elicit fear and excitement from the riders, causing them to let out loud cries or screams.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya marah,"" it is more likely that option A (Saya memeriksa peti mel semasa meninggalkan rumah) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""marah"" implies a negative emotion, and checking something (such as a peti mel) when leaving home is a common action taken out of habit or routine rather than anger. Therefore, option A is the most plausible response given the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia pergi ke utara) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya lipat kertas"", option A (Saya daur ulang kertas) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Pemimpin negara lain menghantar bantuan kecemasan) is more likely to occur.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pakaian budak itu basah"", option A (Dia memanjat dari kolam renang) is the more likely cause. The premise suggests that the child's clothes are wet, implying that they were submerged in water, which is consistent with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (IA sepatutnya dikembalikan ke perpustakaan) is more likely. The premise states that the student has been assigned to solve a book, implying that the book belongs to the library or school. Therefore, it is most likely for the student to return the book to its rightful owner, which in this case is the library or school. Option B does not align with the given information as there is no indication of a friend lending the book to the student.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia dipenjarakan) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the person was punished with death, which is a form of imprisonment. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cahaya matahari memasuki bilik"", it is more likely that option A (Saya buka langsir) is the correct answer. This is because ""memasuki"" means to enter or come into something, which implies a physical action of opening a door or window to let in light. Therefore, option A is a more plausible response compared to option B (Saya buka pintu), which simply means ""I open the door""."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya menarik rambut penipu itu"", option A (Wignya dah lepas) is the most likely outcome. This is because ""menarik"" means to pull or draw something, and ""rambut penipu"" refers to a mischievous person's hair, suggesting that the speaker is trying to remove or get rid of the hair. Therefore, option A is the best fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dia mendapati manuskrip itu menarik) is more likely as the editor finds the manuscript attractive.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia sedar kad itu hilang) is the more likely cause for why the woman's credit card was declined. The fact that she couldn't find her card suggests that it may have been misplaced or lost, rather than having expired.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mereka berkahwin) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Saya menyusun lagu saya sendiri) is more likely to be chosen by the speaker. The speaker mentions that their music is too weak to hear, indicating that they may not have a strong sense of melody or harmony in their songs. Therefore, it makes more sense for them to create their own music rather than adding more instruments to their existing tracks.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Rambut budak itu menonjol"", option A (Gadis itu mengganggunya) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I poisoned myself with insecticide) is more likely. The premise states that the bug has been destroyed, indicating that the action taken was successful in eliminating the pest. Poisoning oneself with insecticide would be a drastic measure to eliminate a single bug, making option A the most plausible choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya membuka mata saya,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Saya terjaga"" (I woke up) is the correct answer. This is because ""membuka mata saya"" can be translated to ""opening my eyes,"" which suggests that the speaker has just woken up or is in a state of alertness."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muzik jiran saya berbunyi kuat,"" option A is more likely. The speaker is asking the other person to reject their music, so option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dia berhemat dengan pendapatan) is more likely. The passage states that the family lives in poverty, indicating that their income is insufficient to meet their basic needs. It is unlikely that they would be earning above the minimum wage, as this would imply a higher standard of living than what is described in the passage. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible cause for the family's situation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia mencari kerja) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (cat that is mixed with blue) is more likely to occur as a result of mixing yellow and blue paint. When you mix two colors together, they will produce a new color that is a combination of both original colors. In this case, mixing yellow and blue will create a shade of green, not a change in the cat's appearance. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Saya menukar topik perbualan) is the correct answer. The premise states that Saya menukar topik perbualan, indicating a change in topic, rather than a tense situation. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Saya menyambutnya pulang ke rumah) is the correct answer. The premise states that my friend has been discharged from the hospital, indicating that they are now free to return home. Therefore, it makes sense that I would welcome them back home rather than giving them a hug in the hospital.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Adegan pembukaan drama bermula) is more likely to occur as the scene opens with a dramatic entrance of the actors onto the stage, indicating that the play has just begun.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (penculik mengancam untuk menyakiti tebusan) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""tawanan itu tunduk kepada mandat penculik"" suggests that the person being kidnapped is under the control of the kidnapper, and therefore would be subject to their threats or actions. It is less likely that the kidnapper would simply leave the person alone without any consequences."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (the pemuzik itu mengetuk kakinya) is the more likely cause of the bomb exploding. The use of ""mengetuk"" in this context implies a physical action that could potentially trigger an explosion, whereas ""memukul"" means to strike or hit something with a soft sound, which may not be enough to cause an explosion. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Anak itu bangun menjerit dari mimpi buruk) is more likely to be the cause of ibu bapa bergegas ke bilik tidur anak mereka. The premise suggests that the mother woke up suddenly due to a bad dream, which could have caused her to become agitated and disoriented, leading her to rush into the child's room. This explanation is more plausible than Option B (Anak itu takut untuk melihat di bawah katilnya), as there is no indication in the premise that the child was afraid of something under their bed.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia dilahirkan lebih awal) is the more likely cause for why wanita itu berkomunikasi dengan bahasa isyarat. The premise suggests that the woman was born earlier than usual, which could potentially result in her being unable to speak or communicate through language. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the air becomes polluted (Option A). The phrase ""kekerening berlaku di rantau ini"" suggests that there is a problem with the air quality in this area, which could be caused by various factors such as industrial activities, vehicle emissions, or natural phenomena like forest fires. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kucing mengejar burung"", option A is more likely. The cat is chasing the bird, indicating that the bird is flying away. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sekolah cuti untuk musim panas) is more likely. The phrase ""Gadis itu menukar sekolah"" suggests that the girl has switched schools, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as moving to a new location or taking a break during summer vacation. However, there is no indication in the premise that she has moved to a new town or city. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Option B: Pekerja mogok.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the workers will go on strike rather than the owner appointing a new manager. The premise suggests that the owner is unwilling to increase wages, which could lead to dissatisfaction among the workers and potentially result in them going on strike to demand better pay or working conditions."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Para ekstremis mempengaruhi dia) is more likely. The leader is being influenced by extremists within their own country, indicating that they are being swayed by external forces rather than facing opposition from outside actors. This suggests that the leader's actions may be motivated by factors other than purely self-interest or rational calculation.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pasir melekat pada kaki saya) is more likely to occur. The sentence ""Saya berjalan kaki telanjang di pantai"" implies that the speaker is walking along the beach barefoot, which could potentially lead to sand sticking to their feet. Option B (Ombak melanda sepanjang pantai) means ""The waves crashed against the shore,"" which does not directly relate to the speaker's experience of walking on the beach. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya bangun di tengah malam berasa sejuk,"" it is more likely that Option A: Saya pakai seluar sweat will occur. This is because being in a hot environment can make one feel uncomfortable and sweaty, especially at night when the body's natural cooling mechanisms may not be as effective. Therefore, wearing lightweight clothing such as a sweatshirt would provide relief from the heat and discomfort."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ibu itu mendiamkan anaknya,"" option B (Anaknya merengek) is the more likely cause. The word ""rengek"" in Indonesian means ""crying."" Therefore, given the context of the premise, it is more likely that the child will cry than smile."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option B (Saya tersandung di atas trotoar) is the correct answer. The premise mentions a hole in the pant leg, which could potentially be caused by stepping on something sharp or uneven while walking above ground level. Option A (Saya zip jeans) does not provide any explanation for how the hole was formed. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer based on the given information.
Response:  Option A (Dia mendapat rongga)
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Saya bangun hari ini dengan otot yang sakit) is more likely. The sentence ""Saya bangun hari ini dengan otot yang sakit"" implies that Saya woke up with muscle pain, which could be caused by various factors such as overexertion or injury. Option B (""Saya bangun hari ini dengan sakittekak"") does not provide any specific information about the nature of the pain, making it less likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""berbisik ke belakang dan ke depan"" suggests that the two students are whispering to each other from behind and in front of their classmates at lunchtime. This implies that they are engaging in secretive or illicit behavior, which could make them feel left out or excluded if others around them are not aware of what they are doing. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia melompat kembali ke udara) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (pejabat pos menghantar surat itu) is more likely. The premise states that Saya meletakkan surat itu di dalam peti mel, indicating that the letter was placed inside an envelope. As a result, it would be more practical for the post office to deliver the letter rather than speeding it up. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia bertaruh semua wangnya) is more likely to occur. The penjudi's confidence in their ability to win suggests that they are willing to bet all of their money on a single outcome, increasing the likelihood of them losing everything.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (ibunda menghantar anak ke biliknya) is the most likely outcome. The premise states that ""Anak itu mengelupas lututnya,"" indicating that the child has rolled around or fallen onto the floor, potentially causing injury to its skin. In this scenario, it would be more practical for ibunda to take the child to a safe place rather than trying to treat the wound herself. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menandatangani wasiatnya) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the person is saved from a deadly disease, which suggests that they are in critical condition and may not have much time left to live. It is unlikely that they would be able to receive an organ transplant at this stage, as there may not be enough time for the donor's family to consent to the transfer or for the medical team to perform the necessary procedures. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for how the person survived.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Saya menggigit lidah saya) will occur. The premise states that Saya takes one cup of coffee that is too hot, implying that the temperature of the coffee is uncomfortable or even painful to handle directly with bare hands. To alleviate this discomfort, Saya might choose to grip their lips instead of burning them, hence Option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the author avoids bias in their stories) is the correct answer. The premise states that the editor ""memecat"" or ""cleans up"" the writer's work, suggesting that there may be some bias present in the original material. However, by editing out this bias, the author is able to create a more balanced and fair representation of events. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the editor would need to clean up the writer's work."

"Response:  Option A (Doktor mengenal pasti gejala pesakit)

The phrase ""menggaruk"" means to scratch or rub something, which could potentially lead to irritation or redness of the skin. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why someone might feel uncomfortable after scratching their skin."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia hilang kawalan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the person is experiencing a ""kecemasan"" or intense sadness, which could lead to feelings of hopelessness and detachment from reality. This aligns better with Option A, as losing one's grip on reality can result in confusion and disorientation. In contrast, Option B (Dia mengalami serangan jantung) refers to a heart attack, which is an unrelated medical condition that does not fit with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otot lengan lelaki itu membengkak,"" option A (Dia melenturkan tangannya) is the more likely cause. The word ""membengkak"" implies swelling or inflammation of the arm, which could be caused by a blow to the arm or by an infection.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lelaki itu mengangkat alisnya,"" option A (Dia terkejut) is the more likely cause."

The premise states that Saya memaafkan kesalahan rakan sekerja saya, indicating that Saya is taking responsibility for their mistake and trying to make amends. This suggests that Saya has a positive intention and is willing to own up to their error, rather than blaming someone else or assuming they know better. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia mula bersenam lebih banyak) is more likely. The passage states that the woman stopped smoking after she started to exercise regularly, indicating that her increased physical activity may have contributed to her decision to quit smoking. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the woman stopped smoking compared to option B (Dia mula bangun lebih awal), as there is no mention of the woman waking up earlier in the passage.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (penyerang itu mula berdarah) is more likely to occur because when someone gets hit in the face, they are likely to bleed.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak panah itu terlepas sasaran,"" option A (Lelaki itu tidak menembak dengan betul) is the most likely cause. The word ""terlepas"" implies that the arrow missed its target, indicating that the man did not shoot accurately. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the owner of the house requested the extermination of cockroaches entering their home. Therefore, Option A (the owner meets a mouse in the basement) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Saya terlalu letih untuk menyediakan apa-apa) is the correct answer. The premise states that Saya has suggested to the guest that they go out for dinner, but then immediately follows up with the statement that Saya is too tired to make anything. This implies that Saya does not have the energy or resources to prepare a meal, which supports Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mula menyembunyikan buku harian itu) is more likely. The fact that the younger brother was able to find his older sister's diary suggests that she may have hidden it in a place where he could easily find it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice given the information provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia bekerja lembur) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menyentuh ketupatan panas) is the more likely cause of the child's sudden crying spell. The premise suggests that the child was suddenly exposed to something hot, which could have caused discomfort or pain, leading to their crying. Option B (Dia mengelus kepala anak anjing itu) does not align with the given information as there is no indication that the child hit their head. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (they disclosed their review to customers) is more likely. The company wants to measure customer satisfaction, so they are likely to disclose reviews to their existing customers in order to gather feedback and improve their services. Offering a discount to new customers may not be as effective in measuring customer satisfaction, as it would only provide information about how satisfied new customers are with the service at that one point in time.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lantai kayu menjadi tercalar,"" option B is the more likely cause. The word ""tercalar"" suggests that the floor is uneven or has a slope, making it difficult for someone to walk normally. Therefore, it is more likely that the boy is holding onto the couch as he walks across the room rather than throwing the pillow from the sofa."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya melindungi muka saya,"" it is more likely that option A (Musuh saya mengejek saya) is the correct answer. The phrase ""melindungi"" means to protect or defend, so it suggests that the speaker is trying to avoid being attacked by their enemy. Option B (Musuh saya mengangkat tinju) does not fit with this meaning as it implies that the enemy is raising a fist to hit the speaker, rather than attacking them in some other way. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Patung terkenal dibakar,"" it is more likely that option A, ""ia telah dilanda petir"" (it has been struck by lightning), is the correct answer. The phrase ""patung terkenal"" refers to a famous statue, and the word ""dibakar"" means ""burned."" Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the statue was struck by lightning, causing it to catch fire."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Buah itu menumpahkan benih) is more likely to occur. The reason being that when fruit is left on a table, it will eventually rot or decay, resulting in seeds spilling out. This process is a natural occurrence and can be observed in many fruits. On the other hand, lizards are not known to berserkan buah (lay eggs inside fruit), so option B is less likely to happen.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menunjukkan jari kakinya) is the more likely cause of the injury to the ballerina's ankle. The premise states that the ballerina was rehearsing a difficult routine when she landed awkwardly and injured her ankle, suggesting that she may have twisted or turned her foot in an unexpected way. This could potentially lead to a sprain or strain of the ligaments around the ankle joint, which would be more likely caused by sudden movement rather than gradual wear and tear. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia belajar bagaimana mengikatnya) is the more likely cause of why the little boy's toy broke. This is because the premise states that the toy was broken by someone who tried to fix it, indicating that the breakage occurred as a result of an attempt to repair the toy rather than through any other means such as running in the park. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Saya telah mengembalikan buku itu) is more likely. The premise states that Saya was ""terpesona"" by the book, indicating a positive reaction, and then goes on to say that Saya has returned the book, further suggesting that Saya took action as a result of their excitement. It is less likely that Saya would simply lose time without any indication in the premise that they were distracted or preoccupied. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (ibu bapanya mempengaruhi dia) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Lelaki itu mempunyai kepercayaan yang sama dengan orang tuanya,"" indicating that the person has the same level of trust as their parents. This suggests that the person's mother may have had a significant influence on their beliefs and values, leading them to hold similar views to those of their parents. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the train stopped due to a lack of fuel (Option A). The phrase ""kereta perlahan-lahan"" suggests that the train has slowed down or come to a stop, and the reason for this is not specified in the premise. While it is possible that the pemandu (driver) may have fallen asleep, there is no indication in the premise to suggest this as the primary cause of the train stopping. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aiskrim hilang rasa) is the more likely outcome. The premise states that the sunlight is causing the ice cream to lose its flavor, indicating that the heat from the sun could be melting or degrading the flavorings in the ice cream. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Permaidani kelihatan Kotor) is more likely to be the cause of the mess in the room. This is because permaidani refers to a type of paint that dries slowly and can leave a sticky residue, which could explain why the painting looks blurry or smudged.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Saya keluar kerja awal) is the most likely cause of Saya's absence from work. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anjing itu mencemarkan permaidani,"" option A (the owner scolds the dog) is more likely to happen. The premise suggests that the dog has done something wrong or undesirable, which could result in the owner becoming angry with it. Option B (the owner gives the dog food) does not necessarily imply a negative consequence for the dog, so it is less likely to occur based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (kawan saya menjadi marah) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia membawa beg belakang) is the more likely cause for why a woman was stared at in public.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia telah menyelesaikan kesaksianya) is the more likely outcome.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya melihat ke dalam matahari,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Matahari membutakan saya"" (The sun blinded me) will occur. This is because the phrase ""melihat ke dalam matahari"" implies a direct gaze into the sun, which can cause eye damage or even blindness if prolonged. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya berasa bosan,"" it is more likely that option A (Saya menghisap) is the correct answer. This is because feeling bored often leads to daydreaming or zoning out, which can involve getting lost in one's thoughts and not paying attention to what is happening around them."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia menerima pembayaran nafkah) is more likely. The premise states that ""Wanita itu mengisytiharkan muflis,"" indicating that she received payment for her work. This suggests that she was paid for her services, rather than incurring a large debt. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur. The speaker is curious about whether their friend has left the lamp on in their apartment, so they are likely to ask them directly rather than deciding to visit them without knowing for sure.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (daun kelopak jatuh dari bunga) is more likely to occur. The premise states that Saya has placed a flower under their chin, indicating that there is a flower present near Saya's face. As daun kelopak typically falls from flowers when they are in bloom, it is more likely for daun kelopak to fall from the flower located near Saya's face than for Saya to be able to smell the flower. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Dia bertemu dengan kawan zaman kanak-kanak) is the more likely cause for her feeling nostalgic. The passage states that she met a childhood friend, indicating that she has been reminiscing about her past with someone from her youth. This suggests that she is experiencing nostalgia due to the encounter with this old friend rather than simply joking around with her children.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Saya menantikan hujung minggu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""menantikan hujung minggu"" implies that the speaker is waiting for something to happen in the future, which aligns with the context of a family member's passing away. Option B does not fit as well with the given premise, as it refers to attending a friend's wedding, which is an event that occurs relatively frequently and may not be as emotionally significant as saying goodbye to a deceased loved one."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya hilang masa,"" it is more likely that option A (Saya sedang bermimpi) is the correct answer. This is because ""hilang masa"" can be translated to ""lost time,"" which suggests that a significant amount of time has passed without any explanation. It is unlikely for someone to feel hungry or have a headache while they are dreaming, so option B (Saya berasa mual) is less likely."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (pencetak itu kekurangan dakwat) is a more plausible explanation for why the document cannot be read.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (peminat bergegas ke lapangan) is more likely to occur because when people hear their national anthem being played, they are often filled with patriotic emotions and may feel compelled to express their love for their country by moving towards the field or stage where the performance is taking place.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dip itu rasa tidak sedap"", option B (Saya letak garam di dalamnya) is the most likely answer because adding salt to a dish can make it taste less appetizing."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tuala menyerap cecair) is more likely to occur because when water flows over a surface, it can absorb or soak into the material, causing it to become wetter or soggy. Therefore, in this scenario, the tissue paper would likely absorb some of the water from the spill, making it wetter.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Dia membaca semula buku itu) is more likely to occur because the woman was disturbed while reading her book, indicating that she may have been in the middle of something important or enjoyable when interrupted. Therefore, she is more likely to want to start over from the beginning rather than simply bookmarking the website.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the man tied his belt) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the plane is experiencing turbulence, which could cause discomfort or even injury to passengers. Tying one's belt would provide additional support and stability during this time, making option A a more plausible response. Option B (the man looked out the window) does not necessarily relate to the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak itu tergelak"", option A (the girl smoothed it) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Mereka memotong kakinya) is more likely to be the correct answer.

This is a common issue in areas where trees grow near buildings, and it can lead to significant damage if not addressed promptly. Option B (pokok itu memberi bayangan di halaman belakang) does not provide any information about how the tree is affecting the house, making it less likely as a cause for the problem.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Masa di dapur telah berbunyi,"" option A (Lelaki itu memuat turun barangan ke dalam peti sejuk) is the most likely outcome. This is because the phrase ""masa di dapur telah berbunyi"" implies that the kitchen has already been cleaned up, suggesting that the man in question has finished his cooking and is now preparing to leave or take a break. Therefore, he would be less likely to bring food from outside into the house at this time."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia bersantai) is more likely to lead to achieving her high aspirations. This is because taking a break or being relaxed can help improve one's mental and emotional well-being, which in turn can increase motivation and productivity. On the other hand, working hard without taking breaks may lead to burnout and decreased motivation over time.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Anaknya mendapat masalah undang-undang) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""meninggal kerana usia tua"" suggests that the person has passed away due to old age, which means they have lived a long life and accumulated wealth over time. It is more likely that their children will inherit their wealth rather than facing legal problems."
"Response:  Option A: Api telah padam. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Wanita itu menginjak api"", we know that a woman has stepped on an fire. This means that the fire is already extinguished or has been put out, as it cannot be stepped on if it is still burning. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dia terlibat dalam kemalangan kereta) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya tidur melalui penggera saya,"" it is more likely that option A (Saya buat sarapan) will occur.

Therefore, it makes sense that the person would be actively preparing food instead of simply having a dream about doing so."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Kamera menyala ke arahnya) is more likely to happen. The fact that the protagonist has just stepped out of a bus suggests that he/she may be in an unfamiliar environment or situation, and therefore, the camera might zoom in on their face for dramatic effect.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Air mandi menjadi suam) is more likely to occur. The word ""berlama-lama"" in Indonesian means ""stagnant"", indicating that the water in the bathtub has not been moving or circulating for a long time. This can cause the water to become stale and warm, leading to an increase in humidity levels inside the bathroom. As a result, the air outside the bathroom may feel stuffy or hotter than usual due to the accumulation of heat from the stagnant water. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menyertai persaudaraan) is more likely to occur. The premise highlights the protagonist's desire to meet new people in college, which suggests that they may be interested in joining a fraternity or sorority.

Given this context, it is more likely that the boy will try to escape rather than picking flowers."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (dielektakan di barisan kematian) is more likely to occur as a punishment for a small mistake made by a woman in an Islamic society. This is because under Shariah law, women are often subjected to harsher penalties than men for similar offenses, and death is a possible punishment for certain crimes committed by women.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (gula itu larut) is more likely to occur. When sugar is added to hot tea, it will dissolve and mix with the liquid, resulting in a sweetened tea. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Therefore, option A is the better choice as it aligns with this implication."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Polis telah melayan mangsa) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""melarikan diri dari polis"" implies that the person being pursued by the police has already evaded capture, suggesting that the police have already caught up with them.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia menjadi berkelayakan untuk pekerjaan yang dia mahu) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia menyapa penonton) is more likely to be the correct answer.

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sampah membuat dapur berbau busuk) is more likely to be the cause of the smell in the kitchen. This is because the word ""sampah"" specifically refers to trash or garbage, which could potentially create an unpleasant odor in a kitchen if not disposed of properly. In contrast, Option B (Saya tidak sengaja membuang senarai belanjaan saya) does not directly imply that the smell is coming from trash or garbage, but rather suggests that the speaker may have accidentally thrown away something that caused the smell. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kanak-kanak kagum dengan haiwan-haiwan itu) is more likely. The premise highlights the children's fascination with the animals at the zoo, indicating that they are in a state of wonder and amazement. This suggests that Option A is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ginjalnya gagal) is more likely to be the cause of the man's weakness. The premise states that the man has a strong physique, but his kidneys have failed, indicating that he may be experiencing renal failure or other related conditions. This is a common cause of weakness in individuals, particularly those who are otherwise healthy. Option B (Paru-parunya tersumbat) does not provide any specific information about the man's condition and could potentially refer to a variety of different causes, including respiratory problems unrelated to the man's overall health. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Saya tanya kawan saya jika dia berminat untuk pergi) is more likely. This is because the speaker is asking their friend if they are interested in going to the concert, rather than simply asking them for directions to the venue.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Penghawa dingin di rumah rosak"", it is more likely that Option A: Saya bawa selimut will occur. This is because bringing a blanket can provide warmth to counteract the coldness in the house. Opening the window may not necessarily address the issue of coldness in the house, especially if there are drafts or air leaks that need to be sealed first. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak itu sakit belakang,"" Option A (Beg dia terbuka) is the most likely cause of the child's illness. The phrase ""sakit belakang"" typically refers to a stomachache or digestive issue in Indonesian, which can be caused by eating something that does not agree with one's stomach or intestines. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the child's illness is that they have eaten something that has upset their stomach, rather than being overweight or having an open wound."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Saya buatkan kek untuknya) is the most likely cause. The sentence ""Saya belikan mak saya hadiah"" implies that someone is giving a present to another person, and Option A provides a plausible reason for why this might happen - because the giver wants to make the recipient happy. In contrast, Option B does not provide a clear explanation for why the person in question would become happy on that particular day."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Lebah menyengat tukang kebun) caused the destruction of the bunga-bunga in the garden. The reason for this is that bees are known to be aggressive when they feel threatened or provoked, and their stings can cause significant damage to plants and other living things. On the other hand, while tupai (rabbits) do dig burrows, they are not typically associated with destroying gardens or causing harm to plants. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for the destruction of the bunga-bunga in the garden.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya berjaya,"" option A (Api itu pudar) is the most likely answer. The word ""pudar"" means to be successful or prosperous in Malay, so the sentence suggests that the speaker has achieved success. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (tsunami) is the more likely outcome. The meteor landing in the ocean would create a massive disturbance in the water, leading to a tsunami wave that could potentially cause widespread destruction along coastal areas. While option B (it will start raining ice) is an interesting possibility, it is not as plausible given our current understanding of physics and astronomy.
Response:  Option A: Dia menjadi dehidrasi.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Oven menjadi panas,"" option A is more likely. The word ""menjadi"" in Indonesian means ""to become,"" so it implies that the oven has already reached a high temperature. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya memerah bahagian lemon"", it is more likely that option A (Lemon tu dah berjamur) is correct. The phrase ""memerah bahagian"" means to squeeze or press something, so it implies that the speaker is applying pressure to the lemon, causing it to release its juice. This is consistent with Option A, where the lemon is already juiced and ready to use. In contrast, Option B does not make sense in this context, as there is no way to siram a lemon without first juicing it. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Negara ini menemui tanah baru"", it is more likely that option A (Negara meninggalkan tanah) is correct. The phrase ""menemui"" means to find or discover something new, indicating that the country is leaving its current territory to explore a new land. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Kaca will land on the floor (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Meja bergoyang,"" option A (Lantai tidak rata) is the more likely cause of the noise. The uneven floor could be causing the table to vibrate or wobble, leading to the noise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ayahnya mempercayai anaknya) is more likely to happen because when a child lies to their parent, they are less likely to be believed or trusted by them.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia mengambil sirap batuk) is more likely to be effective in relieving a headache caused by tension. Sirap batuk is a common remedy for headaches and migraines due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Aspirin, on the other hand, is also commonly used to treat headaches but may have side effects such as stomach upset or bleeding when taken in high doses. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She hampers the station) is more likely. The premise states that the train is delayed due to a technical problem, which suggests that it was not running according to schedule. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, option A (psychiatric disorder runs in the family) is more likely to be the cause of the protagonist's condition. The fact that the protagonist has a history of psychiatric problems in their family suggests that there may be a genetic component to their condition, rather than simply being caused by depression or loneliness.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wanita itu menggenggam tenggorokannya"", option B (Dia tersedak dengan makanan) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Suaranya terdengar kasar) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the woman's voice sounds harsh, which implies that she may have a rough or grating tone of voice. Option B (Dia bercakap dengan loghat) does not provide any information about the quality of the woman's voice. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anjing itu memandang steak yang berju di atas meja,"" we can infer that the dog is looking up at the steak on the table. Therefore, option A (ia menggeletar) is more likely, as the word ""menggeletar"" means to look or gaze. So, the answer is Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia memecat pekerja-pekerjanya) is more likely to occur as a result of the woman's success in business.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the noise of the bell) is more likely to be the cause of the students leaving their classrooms. The premise states that ""pelajar-pelajar keluar dari bilik darjah,"" indicating that the students are exiting their classrooms. Therefore, it is more plausible that the noise of the bell is prompting them to leave rather than the guru providing homework."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kawan-kawan beliau menyatakan keraguan) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia hampir tenggelam di lautan) is the most likely cause of her deafness.

Option B (Dia hampir terbunuh dalam letupan) does not provide a clear explanation for how she became deaf.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Anak itu melepaskan tali belon,"" option A is the most likely outcome. The balloon will pop when the string is released."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Dia mengalami stroke) is the more likely cause for the person's inability to speak clearly. Stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, leading to damage to the brain tissue and affecting communication skills.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wanita itu tersandung di trotoar,"" option A (there is a crack in the sidewalk) is more likely the cause of her fall."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Penjaga menyelam melompat selepas dia) is more likely to occur. The idea of a person jumping into the water after being hit by a bullet is unlikely as it would be dangerous and could result in serious injury or death. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Saya mengambil antibiotik,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jangkitan saya telah pulih,"" will occur. This is because taking antibiotics can help to treat bacterial infections and potentially lead to recovery from an illness caused by a bacterial infection."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the driver pressed the brake) is more likely to cause a yellow light to turn green than Option B (the driver honked the horn). This is because pressing the brake would slow down traffic and give pedestrians more time to cross the street before the light turns green, whereas honking the horn might not have any direct impact on the timing of the light.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kereta itu rosak"", option A (pemandu menabrak tiang telefon) is more likely to be the cause of the accident. The premise suggests that something happened to the car itself, rather than the driver's actions or decisions. Therefore, it is more plausible that a mechanical failure caused by hitting a telephone pole led to the accident, rather than the driver running a red light."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Budak itu belajar sepanjang malam"", option A (Dia terlepas peperiksaan) is the most likely outcome. This is because the phrase ""belajar sepanjang malam"" implies that the budak is studying late into the night, indicating a high level of dedication and effort towards their studies. However, this does not necessarily mean that they will excel in their exams or pass with flying colors. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice based on the given premise."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Saya sengaja menelan benih) is correct. The premise states that Saya menggigit sepotong tembikai, which implies that Saya was intentionally chewing something. Therefore, it is unlikely that Option B (Saya tidak sengaja patah gigi saya) is true, as there is no indication in the premise that Saya's tooth accidentally broke.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Budak itu tersandung"", option A (Jaketnya dibuka) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia terganggu oleh bunyi bising) is more likely as it suggests that the woman was disturbed by a noise, whereas option B (Dia menusuk telinga) does not make sense in this context.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kawan saya memperkenalkan saya kepada lelaki itu) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the premise states that the speaker's friend introduced them to the man, indicating that the introduction was made by someone else rather than the speaker themselves.
"Response:  Option A: Saya memompa udara ke dalam tayar. 
Explanation: The premise ""Tayar motosikal saya pecah"" implies that something has happened to the motorcycle's tyre, causing it to break apart. As a result, it is more likely that air will be sucked into the tyre rather than changing gears on a bicycle. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ayahnya membacakan cerita kepadanya) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""pucat"" in the premise suggests that the girl is not very pretty or attractive, so it's unlikely that her father would touch her hair as a way of showing affection. Instead, he might tell her stories or read to her, which is what option A suggests."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pen ini kehabisan dakwat,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Saya guna pensil"" (I am using a pen) will occur. This is because the word ""kehabisan"" implies that there is a lack or shortage of something, which could refer to the absence of ink in the pen. Therefore, the speaker would need to use another pen to write."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia berhutang) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dia ada cacar air) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the girl stays at home instead of going to school, which suggests that she may not be feeling well or has some other issue preventing her from attending school. Option B (Dia suka belajar matematik) does not align with this inference as there is no mention of her interest in mathematics. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the girl is staying at home instead of going to school.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Beg sampah penuh"", option A (Saya bawa ke tong sampah) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""beg sampah penuh"" implies that there is a lot of trash in front of someone, so it makes sense for them to take it away rather than throwing it into the sink. Option B does not make as much sense in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Rakan sebilik saya tumpah punch) is more likely to occur because it is a logical consequence of Saya's action of drinking carpet. If Saya has drunk a carpet, it is possible that she may have also drunk any objects or substances that were nearby, including her roommate's racket. Therefore, it makes sense that her roommate would become angry and hit her with the racket. In contrast, Option B (Anjing saya menumpang rambut) does not make as much sense in this context because there is no clear connection between Saya's actions and the outcome described in the option.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Dia melemparkan kerusi ke seluruh bilik) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the tone of absurdity in the premise. The idea that a person would throw their chair across the room in response to being bored is an exaggerated and illogical reaction, making option B the most plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cabang itu terbakar) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the girl threw something into the bonfire, implying that there was an object or material present in the fire that could potentially catch fire.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dia menyejukkan makanan yang tinggal) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Saya meletakkan ais di atasnya) will provide relief for the pain in my feet. This is because applying pressure to the affected area with a cold compress or ice pack can help reduce swelling and ease discomfort. On the other hand, Option B (Saya gosokkan lotion di atasnya) may not be as effective in providing immediate relief for foot pain caused by pergelangan kaki saya bengkak.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Saya bercakap dengan rakan sekerja saya di meja saya) is more likely to be the cause of the sound coming from the office. This is because the sentence suggests that the speaker is talking with a colleague at their desk, which could potentially produce a loud noise. Option B (Saya mendengar perbualan di dalam dewan) does not provide any specific information about where the sound is coming from, making it less likely as an explanation for the phenomenon described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Saya mengambil tempat duduk) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the situation described in the premise where Saya is forced to wait in a long line. Taking a seat would be a more practical action for Saya in this scenario than reading a magazine (mengimbas majalah).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lelaki itu menatap lalat itu"", option A is more likely. The word ""menatap"" implies that the person is looking at or watching the fly, so it is unlikely that the fly would be making a sound if the person is observing it. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lelaki itu menulis wasiat,"" option A (Dia sedang sekarat) is the more likely cause. The fact that he is writing a will suggests that he is in good health and has his affairs in order, rather than being near death."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dia mempercepatkan langkahnya) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Saya ada penyelesaian) is more likely. The premise states that Saya has a solution to the problem, indicating that they have already thought of a way to address it. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dia berasa gembira) is more likely. The use of the word ""goyah"" to describe the bridge suggests that it may be old or rickety, leading to a sense of excitement rather than fear."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dia membuat pertaruhan dengan kawan-kawannya) is more likely. The premise suggests that the person is excited about their team's chances of winning, which could lead to them making a bet with friends.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Budak itu tidak boleh tidur"", option B (Dia mengira biri-biri) is more likely. The reason is that the word ""tidak"" in the premise implies that something cannot happen or is impossible, so it's unlikely for the boy to imagine things. Therefore, option B is a better fit for the given premise."
