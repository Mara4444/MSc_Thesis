Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It was fragile) is more likely to be the cause of the object breaking inside the package.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Намерих оръжие) is more likely to occur. The premise implies that the protagonist has been left alone with their thoughts for an extended period of time, leading them to consider drastic actions such as finding a weapon to protect themselves. This suggests that they are feeling vulnerable and threatened, making it more likely that they would turn to violent means for self-defense. In contrast, Option A (Взех един билет) does not convey the same sense of urgency or desperation, and seems less plausible given the context provided.
Response:  Option B: Termites have eaten through the wood in the house.
"Response:  Option B: Патрулният агент ги обвини в контрабанда.  
Explanation: The premise states that the travelers have reached the border, indicating that they are in a foreign country. As such, it is more likely that the patrol agent would accuse them of smuggling contraband rather than checking their passports."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Бебето й е изцапало пелените) is more likely. The premise states that the baby's nose has been stuffy, indicating that it may have a cold or other respiratory issue, which could lead to excessive crying.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the audience dances along to the music) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Момичето донесе на учителя ябълка) is more likely. The premise states that the child wants to thank its teacher for something, so it is likely that the child will bring a gift as a token of appreciation. Option A (Момичето остана след училище за наказание) goes against this idea, as it implies that the child has been punished or disciplined in some way.
"Response:  Option B: Те печеха бонбони на лагерния огън.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the young campers were scared, suggesting that they were in a vulnerable state. Therefore, option B, which involves them making bonbons over a campfire, is more likely as it provides a comforting and familiar activity for them to engage in."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He was exposed to the disease) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Излюб водата в чашата"", option B is more likely to occur - the cup will be filled with water."

This suggests that he is prioritizing his friend's well-being over any potential embarrassment or discomfort he may feel himself.
Response:  Option A: Чuвствах се виновен.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there was a broken link (option B) rather than the chain being wound around a gum (option A). Therefore, the answer is option B.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Нае мениджер на кампанията) is more likely. The woman in the scenario has decided to run for a state office, indicating that she wants to be involved in politics and governance.

The player has won five matches in a row, which suggests that they are performing well and have gained confidence. Their opponent may feel threatened or frustrated by their success and accuse them of cheating as a way to explain their own losses.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Хванал е ученика да маме) is more likely as it implies that the teacher has physically harmed or restrained the student, which could be a serious violation of school policies and ethical standards. Option B (Отговорите на ученика бяха grešni) does not provide any information about the severity of the situation and could simply mean that the student gave incorrect answers to questions during an exam. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Изгубих си гласа) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (“Сложих го в микровълновата”) is the more likely cause for thawing frozen food. This is because microwaves are a common household appliance used to heat up or thaw frozen food quickly and easily. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker would suggest using a microwave to thaw their frozen food rather than wrapping it in plastic wrap.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the servant has been pretending to be sick (Option A). The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it suggests that the servant's illness may have been feigned or exaggerated for some purpose, such as avoiding work or seeking sympathy from their master. This is a common trope in literature and history, where servants might fake illnesses to get out of work or to gain favor with their masters. In contrast, Option B does not provide any specific evidence to suggest that the servant was actually feeling unwell.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Тя тичаше по басейна) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the girl was rolling or sliding down into the pool, rather than jumping from a height.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The tickets for the movie were sold out) is more likely as it suggests that there was high demand for the film, leading to all tickets being sold out in advance of its release date. This could be due to positive word-of-mouth or anticipation surrounding the movie's quality or content. In contrast, option B (The movie received bad reviews) does not provide any insight into why the tickets might have been sold out, and could simply indicate a lack of interest from viewers after the film's release.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Тя написа писмо) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for the girl's hands growing.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Приятелят ми ме накара да чакам) is more likely. The use of the verb ""ме"" instead of ""пристигна"" suggests that the speaker's friend has caused them to wait, rather than arriving at the expected time."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Кrackет на дивана се откъсна) is more likely to occur than option B (Тя си е наранила коляното). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the woman has bumped into something hard, such as a chair leg, rather than injuring her knee.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Balloon deflates) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Разпакавали са си куфарите) is more likely. The pledge states that the travelers have arrived at their hotel room, indicating that they have already unpacked their bags.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Аз хапех прасковата"" (I have a headache), option A - ""Персика е наранен"" (The strawberry is bruised) is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ядох поничка) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Ръцете ми се залепиха"" means ""My hands are stuck together,"" which suggests that something has caused a sticky or gooey substance to accumulate on them. The word ""ядох"" in Option A means ""stuck"" or ""glued,"" which fits with this meaning. In contrast, Option B does not fit as well with the given premise, as ""имах сладък зъб"" means ""I have a sweet tooth."""

Response:  Option B: Produced through child labor.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Пробih дупка в стената"", option A (Мишка изплува от дупката) is more likely."
"Response:  Option A: Сестра й беше щастлива.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman depends on her sister for happiness. Therefore, it is more likely that if the sister is happy, the woman will also be happy. This eliminates option B, as there is no indication in the premise that the sister will get divorced."
"Response:  Option B: Смених си ризата.  
Explanation: The phrase ""разлях вино по ризата си"" means to pour wine into a new bottle, implying that the old one has been emptied. Therefore, option B, ""Смених си ризата,"" which means ""You changed your dress,"" is the correct answer as it implies that something new has happened, rather than simply reusing an old container."

"Response:  Option B: Той изпрати тълпата.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the street musician attracted a crowd, but it does not mention anything about him giving money to the people in the crowd. Therefore, it is more likely that he sent the crowd away rather than gave them money."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Lipsvah mu parents) is the correct answer. The premise mentions that the little boy cried on his babysitter's lap, implying that he was separated from his parents. This suggests that the reason for his crying could be the absence of his parents rather than the time for lunch. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The radar of the pilot has detected a storm, indicating that there is a strong wind system in place. As such, it would be more dangerous for the plane to fly directly through the storm rather than around it. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дървото си хвърля листата"", option B is more likely. The phrase suggests that the tree throws leaves, implying a natural process of shedding old leaves to make way for new growth. Therefore, it is more likely that the leaves will accumulate on the ground rather than change color."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Рибата плува към храната) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the woman's political views have changed rather than her party affiliation.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Аз отворих кранчето) is more likely to cause a mess in the bathroom.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Влакят пристигна на гарата) is more likely. The passengers disembarked from the train at the station, not because the train stopped or sounded its horn. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: Той запечата плика.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man pressed the wet cap of a pencil, indicating that he applied pressure to it. This means that the pencil was in contact with something wet, such as a surface or an object, and the man's action caused the pencil to become wetter. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as it implies that the man pressed the wet pencil, causing it to become even wetter."
"Response:  Option A: Те се наслаждаваха на компанията си.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the friends have lost touch with each other. This suggests that they are no longer in close contact or do not make an effort to stay connected. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it implies that they were previously enjoying each other's company but have since drifted apart."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she will be uvolnena from her position as accountant. This is because the premise states that she has been misusing company funds, which could result in disciplinary action such as termination of employment. Option B suggests that she may go on maternity leave, but this does not align with the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Чух как часовнитти тиктака) is a more likely cause for why you looked at your watch than option B (Исках да проверя часа). This is because the word ""тиктака"" in Bulgarian implies a ticking sound, which suggests that you heard the clock's ticking noise rather than simply wanting to check the time. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: С жена ми се държахме за ръци.  
Explanation: The premise ""Ръката ми се сгъсти"" suggests that something has happened to the speaker's hand, causing it to become stiff or immobile. Option B better fits this context as it implies that the speaker was holding hands with their wife when their hand became stiff, rather than writing an essay on their hand (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Смених болта) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""болт"" in Bulgarian means a screw or bolt, so it's possible that the speaker may have accidentally tightened the wrong screw or bolt instead of stepping on it."
Response:  Option A - Двойката се премести в апартамента.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She wanted to see the sunset) is more likely. The woman's desire to watch the sunset suggests that she was enjoying her time outside and taking in the beauty of nature, rather than simply thinking she saw a lightning bolt.
"Response:  Option B: Водата беше плитко. 
Explanation: The man was able to swim in water with a depth of less than 1 meter, as indicated by the phrase ""водата беше плитко"" (the water was shallow). This means that option B is the more likely cause for why the man was able to wear a life jacket while swimming."
"Response:  Option B: Тя натисна бутона за задната част.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman made a mistake in the text processor. Pressing the back button is a common action when navigating through menus or correcting mistakes, making it the most likely option."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Тя получи лоша оценка) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (През нощта валяше) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence implies that it was raining during the night, which could have caused the tree to bend or break. Option B (Беше пълно с плевели) does not provide any information about the weather conditions that might have contributed to the tree's state.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Забравила е да си постави будилника) is more likely. The woman forgot to set her alarm clock, indicating that she was too tired or preoccupied with something else to remember to do it. This is a common occurrence for people who are overtired or distracted, making Option B the more plausible explanation for why the woman overslept.
"Response:  Option A: Той седеше на сянка.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Мъжът сложи слънцезащитен крем"", it is more likely that he sat in the shade rather than going to the beach because sunscreen is typically used to protect against harmful UV rays from the sun, which are stronger when the sun is directly overhead (i.e., at noon). Sitting in the shade provides protection from these rays while still allowing for some exposure to natural light."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (People accepted the theory) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The game will continue) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ключалката се отвори) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Събрах снега в снежна топка) is more likely because it implies that the speaker took action to deal with the snow blockage by collecting it in a snowball. Option B (Изхвърлих снягът) does not provide any context for how the speaker dealt with the situation and could imply that they simply pushed the snow away without taking any further action.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Каякът достигна брега) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Блъсна се в ограда.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl lost control of her wheelchair. Therefore, it is more likely that she will bump into something, such as a wall or an obstacle, rather than simply pushing her corset."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Usetih as a cool breeze passes over me) is more likely to occur. The passage of air over the skin can cause a sensation of coolness or chilliness, which is consistent with the idea of a refreshing breeze passing over the speaker. Option A (Water sprayed onto my skin) does not align with this interpretation and would not produce the same sensory experience.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They were wet) is more likely. The premise states that the surfers returned to the beach, indicating that they had been away from the beach for some time, and therefore would have gotten wet while out in the ocean. Option B (They saw an akuila) does not align with the given information as there is no mention of seeing an akuila.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Водата изтече от ваната) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Той й признал изневярата си) is more likely. The man feels guilty for cheating on his wife, so he will be more likely to admit his mistake rather than accuse her of it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Чахак мастилото да изсъхне) is more likely. The premise states that the ink has been smudged, indicating that it may be wet or oozing. Option B (Разлях вода по плаца) does not take into account the state of the ink and could potentially make the situation worse by adding more water to an already saturated surface. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how the ink got onto the blanket.
"Response:  Option A: Имаше кошмар.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the detective woke up with a start, indicating that he had a nightmare or bad dream. This is more likely to be the cause of his sudden awakening than him simply getting out of bed and stretching."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Баща му го е изкарвали) is more likely. The fact that the son has placed his feet on the table suggests that he may have been encouraged or allowed to do so by someone else, such as a parent or caregiver. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the son's feet are on the table.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Виках името му) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Приятелят ми обърна глава към мен"" means ""My friend turned his head towards me,"" so the action of saying someone's name (Виках името му) is a more likely response to this situation than waving one's hands (Аз размахвах ръцете си)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Гражана се разбунтуваха) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Той викаше за помощ) is more likely. The child has been lost in the woods, indicating that it may be unable to find its way back alone. Therefore, it would be more likely for the child to call out for help rather than setting up a tent.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Неговият колега получи повишение) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (there were hallucinations) is the correct answer. The fact that the person saw something outside of this world suggests that their perception was altered or distorted, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as drugs, mental illness, or other psychological conditions. Meditation alone is unlikely to produce such vivid and detailed visualizations of extraterrestrial life.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Сложил е белина в него) is correct. The phrase ""косата на мъжа стана руса"" suggests that something has been added to the man's hair, rather than a styling product being applied to his wife's hair. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response: 🔍 Option A: Тя критикува предишната си работа.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the artist created a new work after feeling unfulfilled by her previous one. This suggests that she may have been unhappy with her previous work, leading her to create something new. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Той е освободен от армията) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the son left home. The other option does not provide any logical explanation for his departure.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (The books fell off the shelf) is the correct answer. The phrase ""книгите паднаха от шкафа"" implies a sudden and unexpected movement of the books, which could be caused by them falling off a shelf rather than an earthquake. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""В къщата ми спряха тока,"" it is more likely that the power went out in the house rather than the lamp or the circuit breaker. Therefore, option A - ""Запалих си лампата"" (I turned on the lamp) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Качихме се на влака"" (We got wet in the rain), option B is more likely - it suggests that the situation was enjoyable or amusing rather than frightening or disturbing."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Нагрях го в микровълновата) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation described in the premise. The use of a microwave oven to heat up something is a common practice in many households, and it's unlikely that someone would use a torch or any other method to melt butter in a bag. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for what happened based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Prognozaта е за силни ветрове) is more likely. The phrase ""Дървото падна на електрическата линия"" suggests that there has been a power surge or electrical discharge, which could cause damage to nearby objects such as trees. Therefore, it is more likely that the tree fell due to strong winds rather than lack of electricity in the quarter."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (На пръста ми се образува капка кръв) is more likely to occur as it suggests that blood will form a blister on my finger. This is a more plausible outcome than option A (От лицето ми капеше потта), which implies that sweat will come out of my face.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Беше гладен) is more likely. The premise states that the fish was floating on top of the reservoir, indicating that it had died of hunger rather than drowning.
"Response:  Option A: Той е бил настинка.  
Explanation: The man's voice sounded hoarse because he had a cold. This is a more plausible explanation for why his voice sounds different than him stopping to smoke."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Аsanсьорът пристигна на определения етаж) is correct. The premise states that the elevator arrived at a specific floor, indicating that it reached its destination. Option B (Аsanсьорът се заклещи между етажите) goes against this information as it implies that the elevator got stuck between floors, which is not supported by the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he lied to his parents) is more likely. The premise states that he ""escaped from the house,"" implying that he found a way to leave without his parents' knowledge or consent. It is unlikely that they would have punished him for something he did not do."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Тоалетната препълni) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Собственикът е сложил яка на кученцето) is more likely. The phrase ""кученцето остана близо до собственика си"" implies that the dog has remained close to its owner, suggesting that the owner may have fed or petted it recently. This supports the idea that the owner has placed a treat near the dog's location, rather than holding the dog on a leash."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Той стоеше над спокойното езеро) is more likely as it provides a clearer contrast to the man's height than Option A (Той стоеше под голяmoто дърво).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Срещнах я на вечеря) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the dog ran away from home) is more likely to be the cause of their search for the quarter.  
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Видях дъха си, когато дишах"", option B is more likely as it suggests that the speaker's sadness has increased.

"Response:  Option A: Искаха по-добри условия на труд. 
Explanation: According to the premise, workers created a union to demand better working conditions. This suggests that they were not satisfied with their current working conditions and wanted improvements. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вкусът на гниене изпълни кухнята) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""изпълни кухнята"" means to fill or overwhelm a space with something unpleasant, in this case, the smell of rotting apples. Therefore, it is more likely that the smell of rotting apples will permeate the kitchen rather than a warm and inviting aroma."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Свали си обувките) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation described in the premise. The woman is struggling to walk due to her high heels, so removing them would make it easier for her to move around.
"Response:  Option B: Аз покрих гърнето.  
Explanation: According to the premise, water vapor condenses on a cold surface, forming dew or frost. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it suggests that the water vapor in the air will condense onto the ground, forming frost."
"Response:  Option A - Носех сандали.
Explanation: The premise ""Всичкиchoрапи бяха в пералнята"" implies that all the choir members were in the dressing room. Since they were in the dressing room, it's more likely that they wore sandals than boots. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he will lose support from voters) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Двойка забременя) is more likely to happen. The premise states that ""Всички не одобряят годежа на двойцата"", which implies that the couple's relationship is not supported by their friends and family, leading them to consider having a child despite their unsupportive environment. This creates tension and conflict in the story, making it more likely for the couple to become pregnant as they defy societal expectations."
"Response:  Option B: Милионерът е подал средствата за построяването му. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the building was built with money donated by a millionaire. This suggests that the millionaire contributed financially towards the construction of the building, making option B the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Продавачът е видел момичето да слага стоки в чантата си) is more likely. The phrase ""обвини момичето в кражба"" implies that the vendor has accused the girl of stealing something, which suggests that they have evidence or suspicion of her involvement in a crime. It's unlikely that the vendor would go to such lengths if they had simply helped her find her lost item."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Войниците се събраха със семействата си) is more likely. The fact that a country has declared war on another territory suggests that the military will be mobilized to fight, rather than gathering with their families.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Преди съда се разбунтуваха бундове) is more likely. The premise suggests that there were previous uprisings or protests before the court case, indicating a history of unrest in the society depicted. This supports the idea that the people are not satisfied with the current state of affairs and may continue to resist authority through peaceful means or otherwise. Option B (Една двойка си размени клетви пред съда) does not align with this interpretation as it implies a sudden and unusual occurrence of two individuals switching places without any prior context or motivation.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Тя извади бисквитките от буркана) is more likely because it aligns with the idea of the girl wanting to smell something that's burning. If she had left the biscuits in the frying pan, they would not have been giving off a distinct scent.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дъждът валеше като вълни"" (The rain fell like waves), option B is more likely. The word ""вляза"" (enter) implies a sudden and forceful movement into something, which fits with the idea of heavy rain entering a building through an open door or window. Option A does not convey this same sense of forcefulness."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Пожарната аларма се включи) is more likely to be the cause of the evacuation. The alarm system has triggered due to smoke or fire in the building, leading to an emergency evacuation.
"Response:  Option B: Бащата изрита сина си от къщата.  
Explanation: The premise states that the father was angry with the son's alcoholism, which suggests a strong negative emotion towards his son's behavior.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Секретарката си отиде у дома за деня) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Касиерът забрави да даде на момичето разписка) is more likely to happen. The cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt, indicating that they were distracted or not paying attention to their work. This is a common mistake in busy retail environments where employees may get overwhelmed with tasks and forgetful about small details like giving receipts to customers.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Woman was paralyzed due to an accident (Option A). The phrase ""поставена в инвалидна количка"" suggests that she has been confined to a wheelchair, implying that she has lost mobility or function in her lower body as a result of some traumatic event. This is consistent with Option A, where Woman was para...ized after an incident. In contrast, Option B does not provide any specific details about how Woman ended up in the hospital on a stretcher, making it less plausible that she was admitted for medical reasons unrelated to an injury or illness."
"Response:  Option B: Страната се сблъскваше с икономически трудности.  
Explanation: The premise states that the citizens are raising their national flag in front of their homes, indicating a sense of patriotism and pride. However, the second option suggests that the country is facing economic difficulties, which could potentially lead to a decrease in people's purchasing power and overall well-being, making them less inclined to display their national flag prominently. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They inadvertently inspire their fans) is more likely. The team's unexpected loss could actually have a positive impact on their fans by showing them that even when things don't go as planned, they can still find ways to be successful and achieve their goals through hard work and determination.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (земетресение) is more likely to be the cause of the building collapsing in the center of town. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially if they occur close to populated areas. While an increase in crime rate could also lead to a decrease in public safety, it is unlikely to cause a building collapse. Therefore, option A is the better choice.

"Response:  Option B: Главите им се сблъсаха.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the two children are descending at the same time, which means their heads will collide with each other when they meet in the middle. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option A: Имаше картон в кофата за боклук.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It was cheap) is more likely to be the correct answer. The author's use of the word ""молива"" (a type of wood used for making whistles) suggests that the item being described is something inexpensive or low-quality, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Option B: Роклята не ми пасваше.  
Explanation: The premise states that the cashier refused to give the woman her money back for the dress, implying that the woman had returned the dress without a receipt or proof of purchase. Therefore, option B is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the cashier would refuse to return the money."
"Response:  Option A: Лекува се бързо. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Сърцето ми беше силно надраскано"" (My heart was strongly overwhelmed) suggests that the speaker experienced a strong emotional reaction to something. Option A, ""Лекува се бързо"" (It heals quickly), is the most likely outcome given this context, as it implies that the speaker's emotions will recover rapidly. In contrast, Option B, ""Оставил е белег"" (It left a mark), does not align with the idea of quick recovery and may suggest a longer-lasting impact."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Гледаше към zemya) is more likely. The man was looking at the earth, indicating that he may have been lost in thought or contemplating something. This is a common occurrence for many people during their daily commutes, and it's unlikely that they would be engaging in an extended conversation with themselves out loud. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given premise.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Беше изяден) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I turned on the ignition) is more likely to be the cause of the car's engine overheating. This is because turning on the ignition can increase the load on the engine, causing it to work harder and generate more heat. In contrast, option B (the driver forgot to turn off the air conditioning) may not directly cause the engine to overheat, but rather contribute to a decrease in coolant flow to the radiator, which could lead to an overheating issue if left unchecked.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he stayed in bed for several days) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Беше студено в къщата) is more likely as it provides a reason for why there would be no fire in the stove. If it was cold inside the house, then there may not have been enough heat to sustain a fire in the stove. Option A (Нямах дърва за огън) does not provide any explanation for why there would be no fire in the stove.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (There is a grasp in the corner) is more likely. The phrase ""жената спря да тичи"" means that she stopped running to catch her breath, so it's likely that there was some kind of obstacle or challenge that caused her to stop and take a break. Option B (""She received a second wind"") doesn't make as much sense in this context, as it implies that she suddenly gained new energy or motivation, which isn't supported by the information provided."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Разкрих му една тайна) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Хвана риба) is more likely. The woman's reluctance to enter the lake could be due to fear of being caught by a fish in the water.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Часовникът му беше счуpen) is more likely. The fact that the student arrived in class wet suggests that he had been outside for some time, and it's unlikely that someone would steal his bicycle while he was inside the classroom. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the student arrived late to class.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Потребителят е щrackнъл с мишката) is more likely. The sentence implies that the user has clicked with the mouse button, rather than moving it.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (На главния път се случи инцидент) is more likely. The sentence ""Шофьорът е взел заобиколен път"" implies that the driver took a detour or an alternative route, which could lead to an accident on a main road. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Линото изсъхна) is more likely. The word ""литно"" means ""moss"", so it's unlikely that the moss would dry out in this scenario."

"Response:  Option B: Той мислеше, че екрасиво.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Отидох рано да си легна) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Исках чаша мляко,"" option A (Ядох бисквити) is the most likely cause. The word ""ядох"" means ""to crave"" or ""to yearn for,"" indicating that the speaker desires something sweet like biscuits. Option B (""Печех хляб"") means ""I baked bread,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the driver turned the car around (Option B). The fact that he ""started to vali"" suggests that he was moving in one direction but then changed course, which could only be done by turning the car around.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (писателят пропусна крайния сънтраг за представяне на черновата) is the more likely cause of the writer's failure to meet the deadline. This is because the phrase ""пропусна крайния сънтраг"" suggests that the writer missed the final deadline, implying that they were unable to complete their work in time. In contrast, option B ( тя е редактирала черновата) does not provide any information about why the writer failed to meet the deadline, and could potentially be true regardless of whether or not the writer was experiencing a creative blockage."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Изключих лампата) is more likely to be the cause of the darkness in the house. The premise states that ""в къщата ми спряха тока,"" indicating that there has been a power outage or loss of electricity, which would most likely be caused by a problem with the electrical system rather than a single light bulb burning out."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Той се раздвижи пред огледалото) is more likely. The premise states that ""теглото вдигачът изръмжа"", which means he stretches or expands his body, suggesting that he becomes thinner or slimmer. This is consistent with him moving away from the mirror, as he would need to stretch in order to move further away from it. Option B (Той вдигна прътанадглавата си) does not fit with this interpretation of the premise, as it suggests that he raises his eyebrows, which is not a logical consequence of becoming thinner or slimmer."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Момчето receive shock) is more likely. The word ""receive"" implies a physical reaction to the water balloon being thrown at it, such as feeling a sudden jolt or impact. This suggests that the child will experience some discomfort or surprise from being hit with the water balloon. Option B (""Момчето sew up"") does not convey this same sense of physicality and is therefore less likely."
"Response:  Option A - Снимките се оказаха размазани.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the photographer forgot to use a flashlight, which means that the lighting in the photos will be poor or uneven. This is more likely to result in blurry or disorganized images rather than people refusing to smile."

Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the speaker was alone for their birthday rather than being outside of town. The use of the word ""самотен"" (alone) implies a sense of isolation or loneliness, which suggests that the speaker did not have any companions to celebrate their birthday with. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."

Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Всмука вода) is a more likely explanation for why the gum is wet.

Therefore, option A is the better choice."

Option B (Тя трепереше) suggests that she may tremble or shake, but does not necessarily imply a complete loss of control.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Тя не спи цяла нощ) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman has rings under her eyes. It suggests that she may have been awake or unable to sleep throughout the night, rather than simply putting her son to bed.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вулканът изригна) is more likely. The sentence implies that the lava is flowing from a volcano, which suggests that the volcano has recently erupted or is currently active. This supports Option A, as it implies that the volcano has been in an eruption state. On the other hand, Option B (Вулканът е бил в бездействие) means ""The volcano was inactive"", which contradicts the premise of the sentence. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Option B: Искаше да напусне партито.  
Explanation: The woman in the scenario wants to leave the party, so option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Тя ми позволи да мина през митата) is more likely. The phrase ""митата"" refers to a security checkpoint or a gate, so it's possible that the stewardess may allow the speaker to go through without being searched. Option B (Тя ме задържа на пътната такса) means ""She detained me at the taxi rank"", which doesn't fit with the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Продал е акциите си) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the information provided in the premise.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Взе дълъг душ) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's cut fingernails. This is because taking a long shower can cause water to seep under the doors and windows of a house, leading to flooding that could damage the walls and ceiling. Therefore, it is unlikely that option B (Изпрал си е ръцете със сапун) would be the cause of the boy's cut fingernails.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Млякото беше кисело) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the speaker's mouth feels dry after drinking milk.

Therefore, turning the bottle (option A) would increase the likelihood of this happening, whereas removing the cap (option B) might not necessarily produce the same result.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Той се промъкна през отворен прозорец) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the woman looks through the keyhole) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""звънят на вратата"" implies that someone is knocking or ringing the doorbell, which suggests that the person inside the house is expecting a visitor.

"Response:  Option A (Пастата за зъби изплю от тръбата).
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl has a tube stuck in her teeth, and she needs to get it out. Option A suggests that the pasta for teeth will come out of the tube, which is the most logical outcome given the situation. Option B, however, implies that the girl will somehow manage to extract the dentist's paste from inside the tube, which doesn't make sense in this context. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the premise provided."
"Response:  Option B: Пацифистите проведоха парад. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the civilian deaths from war will increase.

The premise suggests that something will rise into the air, which aligns with the meaning of фейерверки (fireworks). Option B (Фризбито се насочи към главата ми) does not make sense in this context as it implies a frisbee would aim towards one's head, which is unlikely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Тя се притесняваше) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the girl was feeling anxious or uneasy about something, which aligns better with Option A than Option B.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (“From now on, I will mark my calendar”) is the correct cause for the change in behavior. The speaker mentions that they have been forgetting to mark their appointments in their calendar, but then decides to start doing so from that moment forward. This suggests that the decision to begin marking their appointments was made at the time of speaking, rather than before a new month began. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Уволнил е адвоката си) will occur.

Therefore, Option B is a more plausible explanation for what happened based on the given premise."

Losing a game would be a significant consequence for the team, making this outcome more plausible than the alternative.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Съжалявах за грешката си) is more likely as it aligns with the tone of the text. The speaker seems to be expressing regret or remorse for something they have done wrong, rather than boasting about achieving a goal. Therefore, option A is the better choice.

The premise suggests that the man's constant focus on himself has caused the woman to feel unheard and ignored, indicating that he may not be actively seeking to understand or engage with her. In contrast, asking her about herself implies a willingness to listen and show interest in her thoughts and feelings, which could potentially improve their communication dynamics.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Popped out) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Мина над мината) is more likely. The explosion of an enemy ship suggests that it was attacked by a mine, rather than simply sailing towards a port.

"Response:  Option B: Намерили са оръжието на мястото престъплението.  
Reasoning: The premise states that detectives are searching for evidence of a crime scene, which suggests that they have already identified the victim but need to find clues related to the weapon used in the murder. Therefore, option B is more likely."

"Response:  Option B: Many people will be unemployed. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""the economy of the country has worsened,"" indicating a decline in economic activity and potential job losses. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome, as many people may become unemployed due to the deteriorating economic conditions."
"Response:  Option B: Тя ги разпозна от квартала.  
Explanation: The premise states that the Border Guard recognizes the children from their quarter. This implies that the Border Guard has a way of identifying individuals based on where they live or reside, which is more likely to be true for a government agency like the Border Guard than for a random movement. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He told me the truth) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (шофьорът е бил заклещен на пътя) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Жената започни да ражда,"" option A is more likely. The woman has started to give birth."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Свалил е шапката) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the hat flew off. The wind (option B) does not provide a clear reason for why the hat would fly off without any visible force applied to it.
"Response:  Option A - She received an invitation. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl attends her friend's birthday party, indicating that she received an invitation. This is a more plausible explanation than option B, as it is unlikely for someone to buy a present for themselves without any prior knowledge or intention of doing so."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mayka mu gozade in park) is more likely. The premise suggests that the boy's temperature has risen, indicating that he may have a fever. Going to the park with his mother would be a common solution to help him cool down and feel better. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Искаше да впечатли гаджето си) is more likely as it suggests that the man wants to impress his girlfriend with a new hairstyle, whereas option B (Сложи си гел в косата) does not provide any context or motivation for why the man would be applying gel in his hair.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Взех лопата) is more likely to solve the problem of no electricity in the house.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Майката родила близнаци) is more likely to be the cause of the family moving into a larger house. The premise states that the family has grown since they last moved, implying that at least one additional child was born. This supports option B as the most likely cause for the family's move.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Тя видела финалата линия) is more likely. The marathon runner is looking forward to reaching the finish line, indicating that she has been running for a long time and is eager to complete her race.
"Response:  Option B: Чantaта с чипса беше заклещена.  
Explanation: The premise states that the machine spat out a change, implying that it was not functioning properly. Given this information, option B is more likely as it suggests that the coin slot was clogged or blocked, preventing the machine from dispensing change correctly."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Превъртай очи към него) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Платил е в брой.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the businessman's credit card application was rejected. This means that he did not write a promissory note or pay in full. Therefore, option B, ""Платил е в брой"" (paid in full) is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he shaves his nails) is more likely. The premise suggests that the man has a strange habit or quirk, and shaving one's nails is an unusual behavior that could be seen as humorous or peculiar. Option B (he hits himself with a hammer) does not fit the tone of the premise and seems less plausible in this context.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (брат му се скара с родителите им) is more likely. The premise states that the man is proud of his brother, but it does not provide any information about how their parents feel towards him or his brother's academic performance. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's pride in his brother stems from a personal relationship rather than an external factor like academic achievement.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Тя погледна звездите) is more likely. The child wants to learn about the Sun, so looking at stars is a more indirect way of learning about it compared to going to the library where she could find books or other resources related to the topic.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“Поставих плаката над вратата”) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the situation. The speaker mentions that they “заклести” the poster on the wall, which implies placing it above a doorway or entrance. Option B (“Сложих лента на гърба на плаката”) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of attaching a ribbon to the back of the poster. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option B:Architect has changed the plans."
"Response:  Option B: Той облизва лъжицата.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the man shook his hand, indicating that he wiped away the tear with his other hand. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

Response:  Based on the context of the passage, option B (Приближих се до подиума) is a more likely response to the situation described in the premise. The speaker has already arrived late for class and is trying to make their way to the front of the room without drawing attention to themselves. Therefore, it is more likely that they would try to sneak up to the podium rather than sit down in an obvious location like the back row.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Семейството му плати гаранцията) is more likely as a cause for why the man was released from prison. The premise suggests that the man's family paid his bail or fine, allowing him to be released from prison early. This is a common reason why people are released from prison before their sentences are complete. Option B (Нападнал е друг затворник) does not align with the information provided in the premise and is therefore less likely to be the cause of the man's release.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (their house caught fire) is more likely to be the cause of their loss.
"Response:  Option A: Консерва е рециклирана.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Настъпих алуминият кутия"", which means that the aluminum box has been crushed or damaged. Therefore, option A, ""Консерва е рециклирана"" (The can is recycled) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (learned how to communicate) is more likely. The premise states that the girl has joined a debate team, indicating that she needs to be able to express her thoughts and ideas effectively through communication. While learning how to use a computer can certainly be helpful in this regard, it is not as directly relevant to debating skills as being able to communicate clearly and persuasively. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Listened to music) is more likely as it can help improve one's mood.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they conducted a charity event to collect money rather than holding a garage sale. Therefore, option A (they fed the homeless) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Пътниците крещяха) is more likely. The word ""крещяха"" means to scream or shout loudly, which fits with the idea of passengers panicking as they plummet down a steep mountain.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (стана рано) is more likely. The man wants to see the sunrise, so he will wake up early to do so. Option A (той пътува на север) does not relate directly to seeing the sunrise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Haritaa se sgusti) is more likely to occur because it implies that the paper will be crumpled or wrinkled, rather than being recycled or preserved in its original state.
"Response:  Option B: Liaders of other countries outstretched help. 
Explanation: Given that a natural disaster has occurred in another country, it is more likely that leaders of other countries will send aid rather than form an alliance to address the issue. This option better aligns with the scenario presented in the premise."

"Response:  Option B: Тя е плешива.  
Explanation: The premise implies that the woman's hair has been pulled out by an impostor, which could result in her being perceived as unattractive or plain-looking. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
A) Намерил е ръкописа завладяващ.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the editor has reformulated an expression in the manuscript, indicating that he found something impressive or captivating about it. Option A better fits this context as it suggests that the editor was impressed by the manuscript itself rather than finding its meaning unclear."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They were in college) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise does not provide any information about a wedding or long-term relationship, suggesting that the man and woman may have had a brief romantic involvement while they were both in college.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Момичето го е издърпало) is more likely as it implies that the boy's hair was pulled by someone or something, rather than being raised by itself.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Настъпих буболечката) is more likely to be the cause of the bug being squashed. The premise suggests that something has happened to make the bug vulnerable or weakened, making it easier for an outside force like a spring to crush it. This is in line with the idea of a spring pushing down on the bug from above. In contrast, Option A (Спрингирах се с отблъскващи насекоми) does not fit as well with the premise, as it implies that the bug is trying to push away something rather than being pushed itself.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Отворих си очите"" (Opened my eyes), option A - ""Събудих се"" (Woke up) is a more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Помолих го да го намали) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Той печели под минималната заплата. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the family lived in poverty, indicating that they had limited financial resources. It is unlikely that the son was able to save money from a high-paying job, as he would have been required to spend most of his earnings on basic necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause - the son earned a low wage, leaving him with little disposable income to save."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Търсил си е работа) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Похитителят заплаши да нараni заложника) is more likely. The fact that the hostage-taker has threatened to harm the hostage suggests that they are not willing to compromise or negotiate, and are instead using violence as a means of achieving their goals. This is consistent with the idea that they are desperate and feeling cornered, which could lead them to act impulsively and aggressively. In contrast, option B (Похитителят е оставил заложника самостоятелно) does not align with the premise, as it implies that the hostage-taker left the hostage alone without any threat or coercion, which is unlikely given the context.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (музикантът си удари крака) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Детето сестраува да погледне под леглото й.  
Explanation: The premise states that parents rushed into their child's room, implying a sense of urgency or panic. This could be due to various reasons such as a medical emergency, an intruder in the house, or a natural disaster. In this scenario, it is more likely for the child to feel scared or anxious upon seeing their parents rushing towards them, especially if they are not expecting it. Therefore, option B is the more plausible answer."
"Response:  Option A - Родена е преждевременно.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman communicated with him on sign language, indicating that she was born prematurely. This is a more plausible explanation than option B, as being born gлуха (deaf) would not necessarily prevent someone from using sign language."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Водата се замърси) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Котката преследва птицата"", option B is more likely. The cat is chasing the bird, so it is more likely that the bird will be caught than for the bird to fly away."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option B (Преместила се е в нов град) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the phrase ""смени училището"" typically implies a change of school, rather than simply being free during the summer months. Additionally, the mention of a new city suggests that the protagonist has moved to a different location, which could be the reason for changing schools."
"Response:  Option B: Слугителите стачкува.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the owner of the factory refused to increase wages for employees. This suggests that there may be tension or dissatisfaction among workers, leading them to consider taking collective action such as a strike. Therefore, option B is more likely."

The leader is opposing extremists in their country, indicating that they are facing opposition or threat from these groups. This suggests that the leader may be at risk of being harmed or even killed by the extremists, making option B the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Option A (Пясъкът се заклещи в краката ми) is more likely to occur based on the given premise. The phrase ""ходих боси на плажа"" implies that the speaker was walking barefoot on the beach, which could potentially lead to sand getting stuck in their feet. In contrast, option B (""Вълните се сблъскваха с брега"") simply means that the waves are crashing against the shore, without any implication of how this might affect the speaker's feet. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Изпих чаша вода. 
Explanation: The premise states that you woke up feeling cold, so it's more likely that you would drink a glass of water to warm yourself up rather than putting on sports pants."
"Response:  Option A: Синът й се усмихна.  
Reasoning: According to the premise, the mother had fallen asleep while breastfeeding her baby. This suggests that the baby is content and happy, as they are sleeping peacefully. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дълбо в дънките ми"" (Deep in my dungeons), option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that something or someone has been hidden away for a long time, perhaps even forgotten. Option B does not fit this context as it implies a sudden and unexpected stop, rather than a deliberate hiding away."
Response:  Option A: Има кариес (There are cavities).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Събудих се с възпалено гърло) is more likely. The premise mentions that the protagonist woke up with muscle pain, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as overexertion or injury. However, the mention of an inflamed throat suggests that there may be an underlying infection or illness causing these symptoms. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Заложи всичките си пари) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the tone of the passage and the character's personality. The character seems to be someone who takes risks and is confident in their abilities, so they are more likely to invest all their money in a business venture without hesitation. Option B (Прибра се разорен) does not fit as well with the character's personality or the context of the passage, as it implies that the character would become discouraged and give up easily.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the fire spread due to stronger winds (Option A). The sentence ""Горския пожар се разпространи"" implies that the fire spread or grew in size, which is consistent with the idea of stronger winds contributing to its expansion. In contrast, the option ""Podpahlivachite biazhda"" suggests that the fire was intentionally set by someone, which does not align with the given premise. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for how the forest fire spread."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Майката му е сложила превръзка на раната) is more likely. The fact that the child's leg has been amputated suggests a serious injury, and applying a tourniquet would be a common first aid measure to stop bleeding and potentially save the child's life.

"Response:  Option A: Ухапах си езика.  
Explanation: The premise states that the person has drunk too much hot coffee, implying that their tongue may have been burned or irritated as a result. Therefore, option A, ""Ухапах си езика"" (I burnt my tongue) is the more likely outcome."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He flexes his muscles) is more likely. The premise mentions that his muscles are puffed up, indicating that he may be flexing them to show off or intimidate others. This is consistent with the idea of him swaggering or strutting around with exaggerated movements. Option B (He twists his wrists) does not fit as well with the given information, as it does not provide any clear indication of why he would be doing so.
"Response:  Option A: Той беше изненаден.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man was surprised, which means he had an unexpected reaction to the situation. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вярвах, че има добри намерения) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker believes their colleague has good intentions. This aligns with the context of a workplace setting where people often try to maintain positive relationships with their coworkers. Option B (Вярвах, че он знае по-добре) implies that the speaker thinks they know better than their colleague, which may not be the most constructive or respectful attitude in this situation.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (he was keeping a colony of ants in his room) is more likely. The owner of the house had requested for someone to come and destroy something, implying that there may be some sort of infestation or problem in the house. The mention of ""мравки"" (ants) specifically suggests that the owner has been dealing with an ant issue in their room, making Option B the most plausible choice."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She worked overtime) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Докосна горещата печка) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the baby's hand would move quickly. The other option, Option B (Той потупна главата на кученцето), does not provide any logical explanation for why the baby's hand would move quickly. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option B: Разпространиха анкета сред клиентите.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the company will conduct a survey among their existing customers to measure their satisfaction rather than offering a discount to new clients. This is because measuring customer satisfaction is an important aspect of evaluating the success of a business, and surveying existing customers provides valuable insights into how well the company is meeting their needs and expectations."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Дървеният под е изdraснал"", option A is more likely. The word ""издраснал"" means ""to be worn out"" or ""to be exhausted"", so it suggests that the floor has been used a lot and is now in poor condition. Option B does not fit this context as well, as it implies that the child was moving the table around, rather than the floor being worn out. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Врагът ми ми се подиграваше) is a more likely cause for the speaker's facial expression changing. The phrase ""ми ми"" suggests that the enemy was mocking or making fun of the speaker, which could explain why their face changed. Option B (Врагът ми вдигна юмрук) does not fit as well with the given context, as it means ""The enemy raised his fist"", which does not necessarily imply any kind of insult or mockery."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Udairi a lightning) is more likely to be the cause of the statue's burning. The premise states that the famous statue caught fire, which could be caused by a lightning strike. It does not mention anything about people coming to admire it, which suggests that the statue was alone when it burned down. Therefore, option A is the better choice.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man's beliefs were influenced by his parents rather than him being rejected by them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: Шофьорът заспа.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the car slows down gradually until it stops, indicating that the driver has fallen asleep. This is a more plausible explanation for why the car stopped in the middle of the road than running out of gas, as drivers are less likely to fall asleep at the wheel while driving."
"Response:  Option B: Сладоледът капеше от конуса.  
Explanation: The premise states that the person ate a candy on sunlight, which means it was exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period of time. As we know from physics, light can cause chemical reactions in materials, including food. In this case, the intense heat and UV radiation from the sun could have caused the candy to melt or deform, resulting in its shape changing. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Килимът изглеждаше мръsen) is more likely as it suggests that the carpet appears to be dirty or stained, while option B (Стените изgleдаха голи) does not provide any information about the state of the walls. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Главата ме боляше) is more likely to be the cause of the problem.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Приятелят ми се ядоса) is more likely to occur.

The man stands out in the crowd due to his unusual clothing choice, which suggests that he may have worn something eye-catching or distinctive, such as a red cloak. Option B (Носеше неонова жилетка) does not fit this description as neon clothing would not typically stand out in a crowd.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Обвинен е в лъжесвидетелство) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Iskash new vien) is more likely. The woman wants to change her hairstyle because she is bored with it, indicating that she seeks novelty or a fresh look.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They were deported) is more likely. The premise states that immigrants have been caught living illegally in the country, indicating that they may have been detained or arrested by authorities and subsequently deported back to their home country. This outcome is more likely than option A (They found work), as it is generally more difficult for undocumented immigrants to find legal employment in a new country without proper documentation or authorization.
"Response:  Option B: Публиката стана.  
Explanation: The premise implies that the speaker made a joke at someone else's expense, which could lead to embarrassment or discomfort for the person being targeted. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that the audience will become uncomfortable or awkward due to the joke."

"Response:  Option B: Biiftekът беше суров.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the steak was difficult to cut. This suggests that the steak may have been overcooked or underseasoned, making it tough and hard to chew. The option B choice, ""Biiftekът беше суров,"" better fits this explanation than option A, ""Ножът беше тъп,"" which implies that the knife was dull rather than the meat being tough."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (she has accumulated huge debts) is more likely to be the reason why a woman declared bankruptcy.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Чудех се дали е навъ̀н) is more likely.

Therefore, option A is a more plausible response to the given premise.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Колата ми се счупи,"" Option B is more likely. The phrase ""Обадих се на механик"" means ""I called a mechanic."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will choose to call a mechanic rather than go to the movies (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Беше анонимно) is more likely to be the cause of why you threw away the note. This is because anonymity can provide a sense of freedom to act without fear of consequences or judgment from others. Therefore, if you were feeling anxious about something and wanted to get rid of it quickly, throwing it away without leaving any trace could be a way to avoid being identified as the person who wrote it.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Жертвата вдигна ръцете си) is more likely to occur because it implies that the victim has taken action in response to the threat of the gun being pointed at them.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Планирах да prisъствам на погребението на чичо ми) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сънувах наясно) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""изгубих представа за времето"" means ""I lost track of time,"" which suggests that the speaker was in a state of confusion or disorientation. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this situation by suggesting that the speaker had a vivid dream."
"Response:  Option B: Отпечатъкът беше изчерпан.  
Reasoning: The document appears to be faint or blurry, indicating that it was printed with low ink levels or had been worn out over time. This suggests that the printout was not freshly made but rather an old one that has been used multiple times, which aligns better with option B."
"Response:  Option B: Феновете се втурнаха на терена. 
Explanation: The phrase ""На стадиона се пускаше националният химн"" implies that the national anthem is being played at a stadium. Fans are likely to stand up or move towards the field when they hear their national anthem being played, rather than turning towards a flag. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""На вкус е безвкусно"" (In taste it's without flavor), option B is more likely. The phrase suggests that adding something to the dish will make it less tasty, so option B, where you added salt to the dish, is a more plausible outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Raindrops left behind) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Тя препрочете книгата.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman was interrupted while reading her book. Therefore, it is more likely that she will re-read the book rather than making notes in it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Мъжът погледнал през прозореца) is more likely. The man looking out the window suggests that he is trying to get a better view of his surroundings, which is consistent with the turbulence described in the premise.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Тя отдръпна ръката си от него) is more likely. The premise suggests that the boy has been annoying the girl, so she will be more likely to withdraw her hand from him rather than push him away.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Цених мнението му) is more likely. The speaker is seeking advice from their friend, indicating that they value their opinion and want to hear their thoughts on the matter.
"Response:  Option B: Блата го удари в лицето.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the child stepped in mud, implying that he or she was standing in a dirty or wet area. Option B suggests that the mud hit the child's face, which is a more likely outcome given the context of the premise."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He will go home for the day) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Дървото падна на покрива) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the tree fell onto the roof of the house, rather than blocking the backyard.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Замахнах с брадвата към дървото) is more likely to be the cause of the tree splitting in two.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Двойката обяви, че се разделят) is more likely. The family is gathered to celebrate a double wedding, but instead of congratulating the happy couple, they are informed that the couple has decided to separate. This scenario suggests that there may be underlying issues or conflicts within the relationship that have led to their decision to break up.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She liked him) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Бях объркан) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They wanted to find a compromise) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Мъжът разтовари хранителните стоки в хладилника) will occur than Option B (Човекът извади пицата от фурната). This is because the premise mentions a timer in the kitchen, which suggests that food is being cooked or heated up, and therefore it is more likely that someone would be preparing or storing food in the fridge rather than taking out pizza from an oven.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Тя работи много) is more likely to happen because it implies that she will put in effort to achieve her goal, whereas option A (Тя се отпусна) suggests that she may give up easily.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Синът му наследи богатството му) is more likely. The phrase ""umral from old age"" suggests that the wealthy man has passed away, leaving behind a son who will inherit his fortune. This aligns with Option B, as the son inheriting the wealth is a common trope in literature and media. In contrast, Option A (""Синът му има проблеми със закона"") does not necessarily follow from the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Жената стъпи върху пламъците"", option B is more likely. The phrase suggests that a woman stepped onto flames, implying that there was an intense heat source present. Therefore, it is more likely that smoke would rise from the flames rather than the flames themselves going out."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Пропусnah закуската) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Камерите се насочиха към него) is more likely. The public figure will be the center of attention, and the cameras will focus on him as he steps out of the limousine. This scenario creates a dramatic and intense atmosphere that aligns with the premise's tone.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The woman will be more concerned about the water from the bathtub running out than the water in the bathtub becoming cold.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Присъедини се към братство) is more likely. The student wants to get to know other students in the university, which suggests that he may be interested in socializing and building relationships with his peers. Joining a fraternity could provide him with an opportunity to meet new people and make friends within the context of a shared interest or activity. Option B (Той е специализирал инженерство) does not provide any information about the student's desire to connect with others, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Търсех дребни) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""дребни"" means ""small"" in Russian, so it makes sense that the speaker might have been looking for something small. Option B (""Пренареждах хола"") does not fit as well with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Момчето избяга) is more likely. The premise states that ""Осата лети към момчето"", indicating that the bee is attracted to the boy, rather than the other way around.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (she was placed in a death chamber) is more likely to occur as punishment for her crime.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Чаят се паре) is more likely. When sugar dissolves in hot tea, it will disperse evenly throughout the liquid, resulting in a uniform sweetness.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Бил е призован на война) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the veteran was away from home for an extended period of time. The other option does not provide any specific explanation for why the veteran was absent.

The woman has no place in her wardrobe for all of her clothes, indicating that she may have a lot of clothing but lacks organization or storage space. This suggests that she might have neglected to do laundry recently, as there would be less need for extra storage if she had already done a load of wash.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Жена му роди) is more likely to happen because it implies that a new life will come into existence, which could potentially heal the protagonist's broken heart.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (The man's proposal for work be rejected) is more likely.

Response:  Option A: Топката влезе в дупката.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Вдишах праха на тавана"" (I breathed in dust from the ceiling), option A, ""Имам хълцане"" (I have a headache) is more likely. This is because the phrase ""Вдишах праха на тавана"" suggests that something unpleasant or irritating has been inhaled, such as dust or pollen, which could cause a headache."
"Response:  Option A - Клиентът е използвал фалшиви пари. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the cashier called the security because a client had used counterfeit money. This is more likely than the client leaving their headlights on, as it is illegal to use fake currency."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (From the box in the kitchen there has appeared a bad smell) is the correct answer. The premise mentions that something has happened inside the kitchen, specifically that a bad smell has appeared from the box, indicating that the event occurred within that space. In contrast, Option B (By mistake I threw away the list of purchases) does not provide any information about where the item was thrown away, making it less relevant to the given context. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Option A (Децата се възхищаваха на животните)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Бътрецета му се разпадаха) is the most likely cause of the man's illness. The premise suggests that the man's body is weakened, implying a gradual deterioration of his organs over time, rather than an acute failure of one organ like in option B (Белите му дробове бяха запушени).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Попитах приятеля си дали иска да отиде) is more likely. The speaker is asking their friend if they want to go to the concert with them, indicating that they are planning to attend the concert regardless of whether or not their friend joins them.
"Response:  Option B: Отворих прозорците.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that the air conditioner in the house broke down, it is more likely that opening windows will allow fresh air to enter the house rather than fetching an odeya (a traditional Bulgarian blanket)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ranica mu be tezha) is more likely. The man's pain in his back suggests that he may have injured himself or developed a condition that affects the muscles or vertebrae in his back. This could lead to a severe backache, making option B the most likely cause. Option A (Ranica mu be otvorena) does not provide any specific information about the nature of the man's injury, and it is unlikely that simply having an open wound would cause such intense back pain.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I baked a cake) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Купих подарък за майка ми"" means ""I bought a gift for my mom,"" so it suggests that the speaker has already purchased something for their mother. In this context, baking a cake would not make sense as a gift, but rather something that could be enjoyed together as a family on Mother's Day. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Пчела е ухапала градинар) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""uniщожени"" (destroyed) suggests a deliberate action, such as being stung by a bee, rather than something random like moles or voles digging up plants."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. From the premise ""Аз уцелих кибрита"" (I hit the crystal), it can be inferred that there was already a spark or flame present in the crystal before it was struck.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Parents died) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Имало е цунами) is more likely to occur as a result of a meteorite falling into the ocean.

Option B (Започни да вали градушка) does not seem directly related to the scenario described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Тя се обезводни) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Включих фурната) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The phrase ""Печката стана гореща"" suggests that something has caught fire or become hot, and including a frying pan in the mix would not make sense given this context. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the situation unfolded."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Лимонът се е плесенуaval) is more likely. The word ""плесенувал"" means ""to sour"", so it suggests that the lemon has become sour or acidic, rather than being a sweet drink made with lemons. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the country will abandon the land) than Option B (the country will colonize the land). This is because the premise suggests that the discovery of new lands has led to a reevaluation of priorities, with the possibility of the country turning its attention elsewhere rather than investing resources in colonizing a distant territory.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Разби се по целия под) is more likely. The word ""падна"" in the premise means ""fell"", so it's likely that the cup will break into pieces upon hitting the ground. Option B (""Приземи се в купчина пране"") doesn't make sense in this context as ""купчина пране"" means ""a puddle of water""."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the cover was uneven) is more likely to be the cause of Masata's difficulty in walking. The unevenness of the cover could have caused him to trip or lose his balance, leading to his fall.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (son confesses truth) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Взе аспирин.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man's head is throbbing with pain, indicating a possible migraine or tension headache. Taking aspirin would be a common treatment for such conditions as it helps to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Sirop for cough would not have any effect in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Приближаваше се към станцията) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the train was delayed.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Психичните заболявания са в семейството му) is more likely as it suggests that the man's mental health issues may be hereditary or due to environmental factors within his family rather than a specific diagnosis of depression.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Тя се задуши с храната си) is more likely. The woman choked on her food, which led to her death.
"Response:  Option B: Тя говореше с акцент.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman had an inflamed throat, which could cause her voice to sound different or with a distinct accent. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (she became rich) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A: Звънят.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the students left the classroom, so it is more likely that there was a sudden noise (звъня) rather than the teacher giving them homework (учител ми даде домашно)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Познатите й са свързани с нея) is more likely. The woman's claim of seeing a ghost may be met with skepticism by those around her, especially if they are not familiar with her or do not believe in the supernatural. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he nearly drowned in the ocean) is more likely. The premise states that the man has lost his hearing, which could be caused by exposure to loud noises or a near-drowning experience. Nearly drowning in the ocean would likely expose someone to very loud sounds underwater, which could lead to permanent hearing loss. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the man's hearing loss.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Балонът се спусна) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A: Той receive an injury.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the man lost his ability to speak after a blow to the head. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there was a crack in the concrete (Option A). The phrase ""жената се спъна натротоара"" suggests that the woman's body became entangled or stuck on something, and the fact that she had to call her name to be heard implies that she was unable to move or speak freely. Given this context, it is more plausible that she got caught on something unexpectedly, such as a crack in the pavement, rather than simply forgetting her name."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Мъжът е намокрил спасител) is more likely. The man has already been struck by lightning, so it's unlikely that he would have time to grab a life ring before being swept away by the water. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B: Инфекцията ми се разпространи is more likely. The premise states that the patient has been taking antibiotics, which can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the spread of infection. Therefore, it is more likely that the infection will spread rather than be eliminated.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (шофьорът натисна спирачката) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B (Slobbed the container onto a hot plate) caused the plastic box to melt.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (шофьорът удари телефонен стълб) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The boy has learned a whole night's worth of material, indicating that he has studied hard for his exam. This suggests that he will perform well or even excel in the examination, making option B the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Страхуваше се да се научи да плува) is more likely. The child was scared to learn how to swim because it's a new experience for them, not because there was someone working nearby.
Response:  Option B: Сърцето ми започна да бие по-бързо.
"Response:  Option B: В офиса ми беше шумно.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the building next to the office was under construction, which would likely cause noise in the office. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Семейството покани съседите на вечеря) is more likely. The family wants to get to know their new neighbors better, so they invite them over for dinner. This suggests a friendly and welcoming attitude towards their new neighbors, rather than trying to scare or intimidate them off.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Плувачът се гмурка в басейна) is more likely. The water is flowing out of the bathtub, indicating that someone or something has submerged themselves in the water. Option B (Плувачът се е носил в басейна) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that a person or object was carried into the bathtub.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Случайно си счупих зъба) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that something unexpected happened to the speaker's teeth, which aligns better with option B than option A (Поглъщах семе).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Джакета му беше разкопчан) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the child's jacket was torn.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Probiha й ушите) is more likely. The woman in the scenario is described as being upset, which could lead to her pulling or tugging on her ears out of frustration or discomfort. This behavior is a common physical response to emotional distress and is therefore more plausible than option A (Beše razseyalа от шума), which does not provide any context for why the woman would be experiencing ear pain.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“Изпих цята вода в него”) is more likely to happen because it directly contradicts the given information that there is water in the bottle. Option B (“Пазех го в хладильника”) does not provide any logical contradiction or conflict with the premise, making it less likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (В него имаше vulgar duwi) is more likely. The use of vulgar language in a television show would be considered offensive or inappropriate content that may have led to censorship. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Екипажът се сблъса с пирати) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Той реши загадчката) is more likely. The boy will feel confused by the riddle and then suddenly understand it after he solves it himself. This is a common trope in children's stories where the protagonist learns something important through their own efforts rather than relying on someone else to explain it to them.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Мъжът вдигна телефона) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Жената ме зяпаше"", Option A is more likely. The verb ""прегърнах"" means to hug or embrace, so it's likely that the speaker was physically comforted by the woman."
"Response:  Option B: Разгледаха всички експонати.  
Explanation: The sentence ""Групата напусна museja"" implies that they left a museum, so it's more likely that they were looking at all the exhibits rather than stealing them."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Приятелят ми ме защити) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the tire will be punctured if we push air into it (Option A). This is because pushing air into a damaged tire can cause further damage to the tire's structure and lead to a puncture. On the other hand, changing the speed of the motor may not have any significant impact on the tire's condition. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Баща й й четеше приказка) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Използвах молив) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Той беше в дългове) is the correct answer. The phrase ""отказаха му заем"" suggests that someone refused to lend him money, implying that he was already in debt. This aligns with Option A, as being in debt can make it difficult for someone to obtain loans or credit."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (there was a vacation) caused the girl to stay home from school. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Занесох го в контейнера) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Съквартиранttaта ми изсипа punsh) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the word ""изсипа"" means ""to defecate"", which suggests that the flatmate has soiled their pants. Option B (""Кучето ми се къса"") means ""My dog bites me"", which does not fit with the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Хвърли стол през стаята) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Кlonката изгоря) is more likely to happen because when a clinka is thrown into an open flame, it will most likely catch fire and burn.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Горещата вода беше изчезнала) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the man cannot find his towel. The absence of hot water in the bathroom would make it difficult or impossible for him to dry himself with a towel.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Те насърчавали децата си да си играят навътре) is more likely. The parents encouraged their children to play outside rather than save money for education.
Response:  Option A - Оbuvki se razhlavi.
Response:  Option A (He froze the leftovers)
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сложих лед върху него) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of the situation provided in the premise. The idea of applying lotion to a person's belly button does not make sense in this scenario, as there would be no logical reason for doing so. On the other hand, placing ice on someone's belly button could potentially provide some relief from discomfort or pain, depending on the individual's condition. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B (Chuh heard the conversation in the corridor) will occur. The fact that the office door was open suggests that someone entered the office, and since Chuh heard a conversation in the corridor, it is likely that he overheard the conversation from outside the office. Option A (Talking with a colleague at the desk) does not align with this scenario as there would be no one else present in the office to hear the conversation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Седнах си) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The man will look away from the fly, indicating that it has become a nuisance or an annoyance to him.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He died) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Той ускори tempoто си) is more likely. The fugitive senses that his rival is overtaking him, so he increases his speed to keep up or gain ground.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I imagined a solution) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""треперещия висяч мост"" (trepearshiya visyacha most) means ""hanging bridge"", which suggests that the protagonist is in a precarious position. Given this context, it is more likely that he will feel exhilarated or thrilled rather than terrified. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he made a bet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Настроил е будилника си) is correct. The reason for this is that the phrase ""момчето не можа да заспи"" implies that the child is having trouble falling asleep, which could be caused by a noisy or disruptive environment. Therefore, it makes sense that the child would turn on his alarm clock to try to fall asleep. Option B (""Той брои овце"") does not fit with the context of the sentence and seems unlikely based on the information provided."
