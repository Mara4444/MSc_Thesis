Option A: ""She typed up a letter."" This action can be done with the hands, which suggests that the girl's hands may have become blistered as a result.

Option B: ""She climbed up a rope."" This action requires physical effort and endurance, but it does not involve the use of the hands in the same way as typing up a letter. Therefore, it is less likely that the girl's hands would become blistered from climbing a rope."
"Response: 1-й вариант - ""The circus performer juggled while riding a unicycle.""

In contrast, the second variant (B) simply states the action without any additional details or imagery, which makes it less engaging and memorable."

Варыянт A:  The leg of the sofa came loose.

Answer:
The most effective way to convey the meaning is through Variance B (She bruised her knee). This is because it provides a more specific and tangible detail about the injury sustained by the woman, which can help the listener better understand the situation. In contrast, Variants A and B provide general information about the sofa or the woman's movement without providing any concrete details that could help the listener visualize the scene. Therefore, among these three options, Option B is the most effective in conveying the meaning of the sentence."
