It's a good strategy because it allows potential customers to experience the benefits of the product or service at a lower cost, which can increase their chances of becoming repeat customers. By offering a discount, the company can also generate buzz and excitement around its brand, which can help to attract more attention from potential customers. However, it's important for the company to make sure that the discount is not too high, as this could erode profit margins and harm the business in the long run.
