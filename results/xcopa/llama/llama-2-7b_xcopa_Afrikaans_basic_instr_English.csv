"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die item is in borrelfolie verpak,"" option A (Dit was broos) is the most likely answer. The word ""broos"" means ""wet"" or ""damp"" in Dutch, which fits with the idea of an item being packed in a damp or wet environment like a borrelfolio. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het 'n kaartjie-stoppie gekry) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ek het my sakke leeggemaak"" suggests that something has been emptied or cleared out, which could potentially refer to a cardboard box being empty rather than a weapon being found."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B is more likely to occur as it states that the termite has burrowed through the wood inside the house. This means that the termite has already gained entry into the house and is now causing damage from within. Option A, on the other hand, suggests that the termite has simply left or disappeared from the house without causing any damage. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome based on the provided information.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die patrol agent checked their passports) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the group of people reached the border, indicating that they have already crossed into a new country or region. Checking passports would be a standard procedure for border control agents when processing individuals entering or exiting a country. Therefore, it is more likely that the patrol agent checked their passports rather than accusing them of smuggling.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (It was a vacation) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Die kantoor was gesluit"" implies that something has been closed or shut down, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as a holiday break or an extended closure for maintenance. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the office was closed."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Sy het damme gespeel) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het nie meer energie gehad"" suggests that the person did not have enough energy to play or do anything else, which aligns with the idea of playing video games excessively. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person does not have any energy left."
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (more people have entered the town) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman lost her place in line. This is because there are more people entering the town, which means that the number of people in front of her has increased, making it more difficult for her to maintain her position in line. Option B (they got out of line) does not provide any logical reasoning as to why she would lose her place in line, especially since there is no indication that anyone else in front of her left their positions. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die meisie het haar neus vasgeknyp,"" option A (Die baba het op haar bib gespoeg) is the more likely cause. This is because the phrase ""het haar neus vasgeknyp"" suggests that something was put into or onto her nose, whereas ""het op haar bib gespoeg"" means she cleaned her nose with a cloth. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the girl's nose is red."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die gehoor het saam met die musiek geklap) is more likely. The phrase ""het hulle trefferliedjie gespeel"" suggests that the group played a song that resonated with their audience, and the use of the word ""gehoor"" implies that the listeners were actively engaged with the music. Therefore, it is more likely that the audience was enthusiastic and participated by singing along or clapping to the music."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die meisie het ná skool vir die straf bly) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of the word ""straf"" in this context suggests that the girl may have received punishment or consequences for her actions, rather than bringing an apple as a gift."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle kampbegeleider het vir hulle 'n spookverhaal vertel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The mention of a ""spookverhaal"" or ghost story suggests that the children were told a scary tale around the campfire, which aligns with the typical activities associated with camping trips."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het sy kop geslaan,"" option A (Hy het in sy gedagtes verdwaal) is more likely. The phrase ""geslaan"" means to hit or strike something, so it's unlikely that the person actually hit their head. Instead, they may have lost their train of thought or become distracted."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (My bankrekening was leeg) is the correct cause for the effect of having no money in my account. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man se pos bus was vol strooipos,"" option A (Hy het die strooipos verwyder) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person has control over removing the obstacles in their path. Option B (""Hy het 'n massa-e-pos gestuur"") suggests a more chaotic and unpredictable outcome, where the person may have little or no control over what happens next."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die matroos is in kwarantyn geplaas,"" it is more likely that he has been infected with a disease (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: He is exposed to the sickness directly."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het dit vir haarself opgesê) is the more likely cause. The fact that the girl learned the code from her own head suggests that she came up with it independently, rather than forgetting to write it down. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het die water in die glas gegooi,"" option A is more likely. The word ""geslaan"" means ""splashed"", so it suggests that the water splashed onto something else rather than being contained within the glass. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hy wou sy vriend se ondersteuning anbied) is more likely. The fact that the speaker has been thinking about their friend's words suggests that they are considering seeking support from them. This aligns with the idea of wanting to share one's problems with a close friend or loved one for emotional support.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het skuldig gevoel) is more likely. The phrase ""skuld"" implies guilt or responsibility for something, so it's likely that the speaker feels guilty about something rather than accusing someone else of wrongdoing."
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Die ketting het uitmekaar geval) is a more plausible explanation for why the chain broke than option B (Daar was 'n gebroke skakel in die ketting). This is because there are no indications of any broken links or damage to the chain itself that could have caused it to break. Instead, it seems more likely that the chain simply came undone due to wear and tear over time. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het moeg geword om te stry) is more likely. The couple had to struggle to find a compromise, indicating that they faced challenges in reaching an agreement.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Sy het in die hof getuig) is more likely. The fact that they have decided to stand in a public field suggests that they want to make their message visible to as many people as possible, which would be best achieved by standing in a prominent location such as a town square or marketplace rather than a secluded field. Additionally, the use of ""het"" instead of ""het"" in the premise implies that the action being described is something that has already happened or is happening at the moment, which supports the idea that they are actively trying to draw attention to themselves."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hy het warm klere in sy koffer gepak) is more likely. The fact that he packed warm clothing suggests that it may be cold where he is going, which supports option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hy het sy hand opgelig) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Stof het in sy oë gekom) is a more plausible explanation for why die man se oë het gewater. This is because the phrase ""het gewater"" suggests that there is water inside his eyes, which could be caused by something entering his eyes such as stock or any other foreign object. Therefore, option A is a more likely explanation than option B (Hy het 'n beskermende bril oor sy oë gesit), which implies that he has a protective glasses over his eyes, which would not explain why there is water inside his eyes."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (teenstander has a bad feeling for her) is more likely. The fact that the teenstander has a ""jammer gevoel"" suggests that they may have negative feelings towards the person being accused, rather than simply accusing them without any evidence."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het die student betrap terwyl hy bedrieg het) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the teacher discovered the student's cheating while the student was taking an exam, implying that the student had been dishonest in some way during the examination process. This aligns better with Option A than Option B, as it implies that the student's incorrect answers were not simply a result of poor understanding or misinformation, but rather a deliberate attempt to deceive the teacher through cheating.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ek het my stem verloor) is the correct answer. The phrase ""I lost my voice"" suggests that the speaker's vocal cords or ability to produce sound has been impaired, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as overuse, illness, or injury. It is less likely that the speaker would have difficulty producing sound due to not being able to hear themselves (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het dit in die mikrogolfoond gesit) is a more plausible explanation for how the spill occurred than option B (Ek het dit met plastiek toedraai). The use of ""het"" instead of ""had"" suggests that the action of sitting in the microwave oven happened immediately before the spill, rather than at some point in the past as would be implied by using ""had."" Additionally, the mention of ""mikrogolfoond"" specifically refers to a microwave oven, which is a common kitchen appliance used for heating food. Therefore, it seems more likely that the spill occurred due to carelessness while cooking or reheating food in the microwave oven."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hy het maagkrampe gehad) is the correct answer. The phrase ""siek gemaak"" suggests that something is wrong with their stomach or digestive system, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as food poisoning, a viral infection, or even a chronic condition like irritable bowel syndrome. It is less likely that they simply wanted to take a day off work for personal reasons without any underlying medical issue."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het op die swembad dek gehardloop) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for how the girl ended up in the pool. Option B (Sy het van die springplank af gespring) does not provide any context or evidence to support this conclusion. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the opening day for the movie) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""opening"" suggests that this is a new release or premiere, rather than a poorly reviewed film."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het gewig verlor,"" option A (Mense het hem geïsoleer) is more likely. The phrase ""gewig"" means ""hair"" in Dutch, so the sentence can be translated to English as ""The man lost his hair."" Therefore, it makes sense that he might feel isolated or lonely without his hair."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die meisie se hande het blase geword,"" option A (Sy het 'n brief getik) is more likely as a cause for her hand to be swollen. Writing a letter can cause strain on the fingers and hands, leading to swelling. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (the acrobat has swung from a trapeze) is more likely to occur as it aligns with the context of the sentence. The image of an acrobat swinging from a trapeze is more vivid and concrete than that of people clapping in embarrassment, making option B a more plausible outcome given the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (My vriend het my laat wag) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het my laten wag"" means ""left me waiting,"" indicating that the speaker's friend did not arrive as expected or promised."
"Response: 
Option A: Hulle het kernwapens ontwikkel.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that the warring countries want peace, it is more likely that they will develop nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence rather than negotiate a treaty. This option aligns with historical patterns of nations developing nuclear weapons during times of conflict or tension to gain an advantage over their adversaries."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het slaapmedikasie geneem,"" it is more likely that Option A (Hy het lomerig geword) is correct. The phrase ""slaapmedikasie"" suggests a sedative or sleeping pill, and ""lomerig"" means drowsy or sleepy in Afrikaans. Therefore, it is plausible that the person took a sleeping pill and became drowsy as a result."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die been van die bank het los geword) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het teen die bank gapestop"" suggests that something hit or struck the bank, which could potentially cause damage to it. Losing a beam or part of the bank's structure is more plausible than breaking one's knee from the impact. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die seun het die ballon vasgepers,"" option A (the ballon has burst) is more likely. The word ""vasgepers"" in Afrikaans means to burst or explode, so it suggests that the balloon has broken open and cannot fly anymore. Option B (the balloon has flown away) does not fit with the given premise as there is no indication of movement or flight in the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het hulle koffers uitgepak) is more likely. The fact that they have their bags packed suggests that they are preparing to leave the hotel, which aligns with the idea of them checking out.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het in die perskegebyt,"" option A (Die perske is gebrek) is more likely. The word ""gebrek"" means ""broken"" or ""damaged"", so it suggests that the pen is no longer functioning properly."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""My hand has become sticky,"" it is more likely that option A (Ek het 'n donut geëat) is the correct answer. The phrase ""sticky"" suggests a sweet or sugary substance, which aligns with the idea of eating a donut. Option B (""I had a headache"") does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het die deur gedruk,"" option A (Die deur het oopgegaan) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (the products are tested for quality assurance) is the correct cause. There is no evidence to suggest that the products are made by children or that they have been boycotted due to ethical concerns. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the activists are protesting outside the store.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het 'n gat in die muur geboor,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""het 'n gat in die muurgeboor"" implies that something (a mouse) has gone through a hole in the wall, so option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Haar suster het geskei) is the more likely cause for her being angry with her sister. The phrase ""afgunstig op"" in Dutch means ""angry at,"" so it suggests that the speaker's anger towards her sister is due to something their sister did or didn't do. Given the context of a family conflict, it is more likely that the speaker's anger stems from a perceived slight or betrayal by her sister rather than her sister being happy. Therefore, Option B is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het wyn op my hemp gemors,"" option A (Ek het 'n voorskoot aangetrok) is more likely. This is because the phrase ""hemp gemors"" suggests that something has caused frustration or annoyance, which could lead to an impulsive action like taking a shot of wine. The second option, ""Ek het my hemp verander,"" does not fit as well with the given premise, as it would imply changing one's mind rather than acting on impulse."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die kliënt het sy beursie deursoek) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""het sy beursie deursoek"" means ""is looking for their wallet,"" indicating that the client is actively searching for something they lost or misplaced, rather than simply giving away money without a second thought. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Mense het hom geld gegee) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""het hom geld gegee"" suggests that people have given money to the street performer, implying that they are more likely to be generous than hostile towards him."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hy het sy ouers gemis) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""seuntjie"" suggests a young child who has missed their parents, rather than simply wanting to eat something at a specific time."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Die vlieënier het deur die storm geflug) is more likely. The premise states that the pilots detected a storm ahead, indicating that they were able to fly through it rather than avoiding it or being blown off course by it. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die boom het sy blare laten val,"" option A (the blare had pleasant colors) is more likely. The word ""kleure"" in Dutch means ""colors."" Therefore, it is unlikely that the blare would have been hoisted up onto the ground, as suggested by option B."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Hy het besluit om 'n grap met sy suster te maak) is more likely. The fact that the protagonist has decided to play a trick on his sister suggests that he may be motivated by mischief or malice, rather than simply wanting to spend time with her.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sy pa het hom 'n koeldrank gegee om te drink) will occur. The reason being that giving a child a cold drink in this situation would be a more plausible explanation for why they are hesitant to go to the bathroom than stopping the engine of a car.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die kind het visvoer in die tenk gestort,"" it is more likely that option A (the fish has jumped out of the tank) is correct. The wording of the premise suggests that something inside the tank has been placed or deposited, rather than something being added to the outside environment. Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the information provided is that the fish has escaped from the tank."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sy has protested) is more likely. The passage states that ""Die vrou se politieke beskouings het verander,"" indicating that something significant has changed in their political views. This change is then contrasted with the fact that she has not left her party, suggesting that she may have become disillusioned or critical of her party's policies without actually leaving it. Protesting is a common way for individuals to express dissatisfaction with an organization or system without necessarily abandoning it entirely, making option B the more likely choice based on the information provided."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ek het dreinreiniger darein gooi) is more likely to be effective in unclogging the sink drain. Using a drain cleaner can help dissolve and break up any blockages or buildup inside the pipe, allowing water to flow freely again. Option A (Ek het die kraan oopgemaak) may not have as much of an impact on the clogged sink drain, as it only involves turning the faucet handle clockwise without actually addressing the underlying issue causing the clog.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the train has arrived at the station) is more likely. The premise states that the passengers got off the train, indicating that it had reached its destination. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man druk op die klam flap van die koevert,"" option A (Hy het 'n seël op die koevert gesit) is more likely. The word ""druk"" implies pressure or force being applied to something, which could cause it to bend or deform. In this case, if a person were sitting on the edge of a cover, their weight would be pressing down on the edge, causing it to bend inward. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what might happen when someone sits on the edge of a cover."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hulle het mekaar se geselskap geniet) is the correct answer. The fact that they have not had contact for a long time suggests that there may be some distance or conflict between them, rather than simply moving to different places.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy is of her position untslaan) is more likely. The premise states that the company's finances are being mismanaged, indicating that there may be a problem with leadership or management within the organization. It is unlikely that the employee would be able to take maternity leave if she is not even employed by the company anymore. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome in this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het die klok hoor tik) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker was late than option B (Ek wou die tyd kyk). This is because the phrase ""I heard the clock tick"" implies that the speaker was physically present near a clock and could hear its ticking sound, whereas ""I wanted to look at time"" does not provide any specific information about the speaker's location or proximity to a clock. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the speaker's lateness."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het die opstel met die hand geskryf) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's hand cramped up. This is because the phrase ""het krampe gekry"" suggests that the speaker's hand was already in a state of cramping before they tried to write with it. Therefore, it makes sense that the writer would have used their other hand to help them write instead of trying to force their cramped hand to do the job alone. Option B (Ek en my vrou het hande aan hande gehou) does not provide any logical explanation for why the speaker's hand cramped up and seems out of place in the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ek het die bout vervang) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Die bout"" refers to a lock or latch, so it is possible that someone may have replaced it with another one. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the door would not open."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Die egpaar het in die woonstel ingetrok) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sy wou die sonsondergang sien) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the sentence. The phrase ""die sonsondergang"" refers to a solar eclipse, which occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun, blocking its light. Therefore, option A better fits the meaning of the premise than option B (Sy het gedink sy het 'n weather lig gesien), which implies that the person thought they saw a storm."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy kon nie swem nie) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that someone threw a rescue buoy into the water, indicating that they were trying to save someone who was struggling in the water. If the person could not swim, it would be less likely for them to throw a rescue buoy into the water without any assistance. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sy druk die agterste sleutel) is more likely to occur as a result of the mistake made by the woman in the word processor. When a user makes an error while typing, it is common for them to try to correct the mistake by pressing the backspace key repeatedly, which can cause the cursor to move backwards and delete characters or words. In this case, the woman may have accidentally pressed the backspace key too many times, resulting in the deletion of the entire document. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het 'n slegte graad gekry) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het 'n slegte graad gekry"" means ""had a bad grade,"" indicating that the speaker believes the girl had a poor performance in her examination. This is supported by the context of the sentence, as it mentions the girl's friend being proud of her despite having a bad grade. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die grasperk was modderig,"" option A (Dit het oornag gegooi) is the more likely cause. The word ""modderig"" suggests that the area was wet or muddy, which could have caused the grass to grow poorly or be overrun with weeds. Option B (""Dit was vol onkruid"") does not provide any specific information about the cause of the poor growth and seems less relevant in this context."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Sy het die nag in 'n hotel oorgebly) is a more plausible explanation for why she woke up late than option B (Sy het vergeet om haar wekker in te stel). This is because it is more likely that someone would forget to set their alarm clock than to get lost in a hotel without realizing it.
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Hy het in die skaduwee gesit) is more likely to be the correct answer as there is no mention of the person going to the beach or sitting in shade. The context suggests that the person may have been exposed to sunburn medication.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Die navorsers het die teorie teruggetrok) is more likely. The premise states that the researchers have failed to prove the theory, indicating that they have retracted it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (the extension of the deadline) is a more plausible explanation for why the judges have not yet delivered their verdict. This is because there may be various reasons why the judges need additional time to deliberate and reach a decision, such as complexity of the case or conflicting opinions among the jurors. Therefore, it is more likely that the delay is due to an extension of the deadline rather than a poor decision made by the skeidsregters.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the slot has been locked) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, option A (Die vader het vir sy seun geld gegee) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the sentence. The use of ""het"" instead of ""has"" also suggests that the action occurred in the past. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het die sneeu in 'n sneeubal versamel) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""die oprit"" refers to a road or path, and ""geblokkeer"" means to block or obstruct something. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would try to collect the snow in a pile rather than moving it out of the way. Option B (Ek het die sneeu uit die pad geskuif) does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no reason why the speaker would want to move the snow away from the path instead of collecting it in one place."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die kajak het die strand bereik) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the kayakers have reached the shore, indicating a successful journey. Option B (Die kajak het 'n golf getref) does not align with the premise as it implies that the kayaks were struck by a wave or a storm, which would be an unlikely outcome given the context of the sentence.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Sy het die stuur losgelaat) is more likely to have occurred. The fact that the girl lost control of her bike suggests that she may have accidentally let go of the handlebars, leading to the bike crashing into something or falling over. It is less likely that she would have intentionally thrown the bike into a ditch without any explanation as to why she did so.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Water het op my vel gesprinkel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of the word ""gesprinkel"" suggests that water was poured or sprinkled onto something, which aligns with the idea of a cool breeze blowing over someone's skin. Option B (Ek het gevoel hoe koel lug oor my kom) does not convey this same sense of physical action and instead implies a more abstract feeling of coldness."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hulle was nat) is the correct answer. The fact that they returned to the beach after being wet suggests that they were not scared of a shark or any other danger, but rather because they got wet while playing near the ocean.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die water het uit die bad gestort) is more likely to be correct. The word ""het"" used in the premise indicates that the action of emptying the bathwater occurred before the action described in the conclusion, which suggests that the water was emptied from the bathtub rather than spilled onto the floor. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hy het sy ontrouheid aan haar bely) is more likely. The speaker feels guilty for lying to his wife, so he is likely to confess his infidelity to her directly rather than accusing her of being troubled or upset.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het gewag totdat die ink droog is) is a more likely explanation for why the ink has smudged on the paper. This is because the act of writing or drawing can cause the ink to smear or spread unevenly on the surface of the paper, especially if the ink is not yet fully dry. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Hy het 'n nagmerrie gehad) is correct. The phrase ""skree wakker geword"" suggests that something unexpected or unsettling has occurred, which could be interpreted as a nightmare. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the child woke up."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy pa het by die tafel gaan sit) is more likely to occur as it provides a logical explanation for why the children are sitting at the table. Option B (Sy pa het hom 'n less geleer) does not provide any clear reason or cause-and-effect relationship that would explain why the children are sitting at the table. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ek het met my arms gewaai) is a more plausible explanation for why someone might have their head turned in the direction of another person's pointing finger. It is less likely that someone would shout out the other person's name without any physical action to accompany it.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Die burgers het in opstand gekom) is more likely to occur as a result of the government's actions. The premise suggests that the government has been oppressive towards its citizens, leading them to rise up in protest or revolt. This implies that there will be some form of resistance or action taken by the people against the government, rather than simply registering to vote.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die seun was in die bos verdwaal,"" option B is more likely. The fact that the boy has called for help suggests that he is lost and needs assistance to find his way back. Option A does not provide any information about the boy finding a tent, so it is less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sy wou leer hoe om te teken) is more likely as it suggests that the woman wants to learn how to draw, which is a skill that can be taught through practice and instruction. The other option, Option B (Sy wou van ander kulture leer), does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of what ""and other culture"" refers to or why the woman would want to learn about another culture. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sy werksmaat het 'n bevordering gekry) is more likely. The fact that someone at work got a promotion suggests that they are doing well in their job and have earned recognition for their efforts, which could make others feel envious or left behind.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Hy het hallusinasies gehad) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Die man het buitelanders gesien"" suggests that the person has seen things outside of their own country, which could be interpreted as a hallucination or delusion. There is no evidence to suggest that the person meditated before seeing these visions, so option B (Hy het gemediteer) is less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man se hare het blou geword,"" option A (Hy het bleikmiddel daarin gesit) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""het blou geword"" suggests that something has turned blue, which could be caused by exposure to bleach or other chemicals. It is less likely that the hair would turn blue due to shampoo alone. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B is more likely. The artist has had a stroke of inspiration, rather than criticism, as the reason for creating new work.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hy is uit die weermag ontslaan) is the correct answer. The phrase ""van die huis af"" suggests that something has happened to him outside of his home, rather than him being away at university. Additionally, the use of the word ""onslaan"" implies a sudden or unexpected event, which aligns with the idea of someone being removed from the weather."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the bookrack was covered with dust) is a more likely cause for the books falling off the shelf than option B (an earthquake hit the library). The premise mentions that the books were ""uit die boekrak geval,"" indicating that they fell off the shelf, rather than being knocked over by an external force like an earthquake. Therefore, it is more likely that the bookrack was not securely fastened or had accumulated dust that caused the books to fall off, rather than an earthquake occurring in the library."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het 'n lig aangesteek) is more likely to be the correct answer as it implies that the electricity in the house has been turned off by using a fuse. This is a common method of controlling electrical power supply in homes before the widespread use of circuit breakers or smart switches.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ons het op die berg- en berghelling gery,"" option A (Dit het eng gelyk) is more likely as it means ""We had a hard time."""
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het botter in die sak gegooi) is a more plausible explanation for why the popcorn started popping. This is because butter is known to be a common ingredient used when making popcorn, and it can help to create the necessary heat and moisture conditions for the kernels to explode into fluffy pieces. In contrast, microwaving alone may not provide enough heat or moisture to cause the kernels to pop. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the electricity in the area went out) is more likely to be the cause of the boom heard in the distance. The other option (a strong wind forecast) does not align with the given information. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hy het die gehoor beledig) is more likely. The speaker has offended the listener by making incorrect observations, which suggests that they have insulted or hurt their feelings.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (a drop of blood has formed on my finger) is more likely to occur. The use of the word ""gesig"" in the premise suggests that the action occurred on or near the speaker's face, and the mention of a ""druppel"" specifically refers to a small amount of liquid, which is consistent with the idea of a single droplet of blood forming on the speaker's finger. In contrast, option A (a sweet drizzle has fallen onto my hand) does not provide any specific details that suggest the action occurred near the speaker's face or involved a small amount of liquid. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die vis het op die oppervlak van die tenk geswem,"" it is more likely that the fish died rather than being hungry. Therefore, option B (Dit was dood) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hy hetverkoue gehad) is a more plausible explanation for why die man se stem het hees geklink. This is because a person who has a cough may produce a harsher sounding voice due to the disruption in their respiratory system caused by the cough. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die hysbak het by die aangewese vloer aangekom) is the more likely cause of the flood. The phrase ""het opgegaan"" suggests that something has risen or grown, which could indicate that water has accumulated in the basement due to heavy rainfall or some other factor. This is supported by the fact that the word ""aangekomen"" means ""arrived,"" implying that the water has reached its destination after traveling through the building's foundation. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the flood based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hy het vir sy ouers gelieg) is a more plausible explanation for why the teenagers are not at home. It suggests that the teenagers may have lied to their parents about where they were going or what they were doing, rather than the parents having sent them away from home. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the toilet (Die toilet het oorstroom) caused the overflow rather than the water heater (Die waterverwarmer hetgebrek). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the owner sat a clog near the dog) is more likely. The phrase ""gebly"" in Afrikaans means to sit or place something nearby, which fits with the context of an owner sitting next to their dog. Option B (the owner tied a leash to the dog) does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het sy weerspieëling gesien"", option A (Hy het onder die uitgestrekte boom gestaan) is more likely as it provides a clear location for where the person was standing when they saw the weather phenomenon. Option B (Hy het oor die rustige meer gestaan) does not provide any specific location and seems less relevant to the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het haar teruggebel) is more likely. The fact that you have missed your friend's phone call suggests that she may be upset or angry with you, making it less likely for her to want to meet up with you in person. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hulse hond het van die huis afwegehardloop) is more likely as there is no indication of any valuable items being stolen from the house. The fact that the dog ran away suggests that it may have been startled or distracted by something outside, leading to its departure from the house. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the weather was cold) is a more likely cause for feeling dizzy than option B (my boss had a stiff feeling). The premise mentions that the speaker saw their breath when they exited the room, indicating that it was cold outside. This suggests that the temperature may have been a factor in the speaker's dizziness, rather than any physical discomfort caused by their boss. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (Hulle wou beter werksomstandighede hê) is more likely to be the cause of the workers forming a union. The workers are seeking better working conditions, which suggests that they are not satisfied with their current work environment and want improvements. This is more plausible than option B (Hullewerkgewer het hulle salarisse verhoog), as it does not provide any specific reasons for why the workers would form a union.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (a rotten smell) is more likely to be the cause of the apple tart filling the kitchen with an unpleasant odor.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het hoë hakke gedra) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""gesukkel om te loop"" suggests that something is preventing or hindering someone from running, which could potentially result in a high heart rate. Therefore, it is more likely that the person experienced physical discomfort rather than simply removing their shoes."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the water has boiled) occurred. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Al my sokkies was in die wasgoedwinkel,"" it is more likely that option A (Ek het sandal gedra) is correct. The use of the word ""sandals"" suggests a casual or informal setting, rather than a formal one where dress shoes might be expected."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het die steun van kiesers verloor) is more likely to be the reason for the politician's loss of support. The argument that the politician lost support due to corruption (option B) does not align with the given premise, as it suggests that the politician was already seen as corrupt before they lost support. However, according to the premise, the politician had previously enjoyed strong support from voters, indicating that there must have been some other factor responsible for their decline in popularity. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the politician's loss of support.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the couple got pregnant) is more likely. The premise suggests that the couple's relationship has been approved by their families, which implies that they are in a stable and committed relationship. Pregnancy is a common outcome for couples who are in a long-term, monogamous relationship, making it the most likely explanation for why their parents would disapprove of them getting married.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Die miljoenêr wou hê dat die gebou afgebrek moet word) is more likely as it suggests that the millionaire wanted the building to be demolished. This aligns with the idea of a wealthy person wanting to get rid of something they no longer need or want. Option B (Die miljoenêr het die fondse bygedra om dit te bou) means ""The millionaire had the funds drawn up to build it,"" which does not fit with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die verkoopspersoon het gesien hoe die meisie goedere in haar beursie sit) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the salesperson might have accused the girl of stealing. The premise suggests that the salesperson saw the girl sitting comfortably inside her purse, which could be interpreted as an indication that she was hiding something inside it. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Soldates are sent to fight) is more likely. The premise states that the country has declared war on its neighboring regions, indicating a military conflict. This suggests that soldiers will be deployed to fight against the enemy rather than being sent home for peaceful reasons. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (an unrest has broken out in the court) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het die koekies uit die pot gehaal) is the more likely cause. The smell of burning could be caused by something being taken out of a pot, rather than something being left inside it. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""It started raining heavily,"" option A is more likely. The sentence implies that the storm has intensified or worsened over time, making option A the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the fire alarm went off) caused the evacuation of the building. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Die vader het sy seun uit die huis gegooi) is more likely to occur as a result of their father's dislike for his son's alcoholism. The phrase ""het sy seun uit die huis gegooi"" means ""kicked his son out of the house,"" indicating that the father took drastic action in response to his son's addiction. Option A (""die pa het vir sy seun 'n bier gekoop"") does not convey the same level of intensity or consequences as option B, and it is less likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the secretary went home early) is more likely. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the premise that the elevator was not working, which suggests that the secretary left her office voluntarily rather than being forced to do so by a malfunctioning elevator.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Sy vriend het hom onderbreek) is a more plausible explanation for why sy friend got irritated than option B (Sy vriend het vir hom middagete gekoop). This is because ""onderbreek"" means to break something or someone's spirit, while ""kopen"" means to buy something. Therefore, it makes more sense that sy friend became irritated with sy due to some kind of conflict or issue rather than buying them lunch."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Die kassier het die meisie haar wisselgeld gegee) is more likely. The fact that the cashier gave the girl her money suggests that there was a transfer of funds from the cashier to the girl, which supports this answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Sy is verlam ná 'n ongeluk) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of the word ""verlam"" suggests that the person is unable to move or speak due to an accident or injury, rather than being transported to a hospital for medical treatment."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option B (the country has economic problems) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""Burgers het die nasionale vlag buite hulle huise opgehang,"" indicating that there are economic difficulties affecting the country. Additionally, the phrase ""Die land het economiese probleme ondervind"" suggests that there are financial challenges facing the nation. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the national flag is being hung outside people's homes than option A, which simply states that the country has gained independence without providing any context or evidence to support this claim."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het hulle aanhangers teleurgestel) is more likely. The fact that they lost the tournament suggests that their fans may be disappointed or disheartened by their performance.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het skaam gevoel) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het aandag gegee in die klase) is more likely as it suggests that the student actively participated in class, indicating a higher level of engagement and motivation compared to option B (Hy het vergeet om te studeer), which implies forgetfulness or lack of effort.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a natural disaster) is more likely as a cause for the city's collapse. The use of the word ""gebou"" (rubble) suggests that there has been significant destruction caused by an external force such as an earthquake or flood, rather than criminal activity. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the city's collapse."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hy het haar gesmeek om hom zurück te nemen) is more likely. The phrase ""het haar gesmeek"" implies that the speaker has made an effort to persuade or beg their friend to return, suggesting a sense of urgency or desperation in their request. This is consistent with the idea that the speaker wants their friend back badly enough to try to convince them through pleading or begging. In contrast, option B (""Sy het hem aan haer ouers voorgesteld"") suggests a more passive approach, where the speaker may have simply suggested their friend contact their parents for help without necessarily making any personal efforts to persuade them."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the ball has rolled away) is more likely to occur. The premise suggests that the two children are trying to reach the ball but it has rolled away from them, indicating that they are not able to successfully retrieve it. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (there was karton in the asblik) is a more plausible explanation for why the lid was off than option B (the lid was removed from the asblik). Therefore, I would choose option A as the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (dit was goedkoop) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het die potlood geslyp"" suggests that something was written with a pen or pencil, and therefore it would make sense for the cost of the item to be low. Option B (""dit was saai"") does not provide any context or information that would suggest why the item might have been expensive."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sy het haar kwitansies verloor) is the correct answer. The fact that she lost her receipts suggests that she may have misplaced them or they were not available to her at the time of payment, rather than the option of the dress not being paid for (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die skrape op my vel was diep,"" option A (Dit het vinnig genees) is more likely. The word ""vinnig"" means quickly or intensely in Afrikaans, so it suggests that the wound healed rapidly and effectively. Option B (""Dit het 'n litteken agtergelaat"") means ""It left a scar behind,"" which does not align with the idea of rapid healing."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hy het na die grond gekyk) is a more plausible explanation for why the man looked so strange to the passengers in the train. The phrase ""na die grond gekyk"" means ""to look at the ground,"" indicating that the man was gazing intently at something on the floor of the train. This could be due to various reasons such as he might have seen something interesting or important there, or maybe he was lost in thought and didn't notice where he was going. Therefore, option A is a more logical choice compared to option B (Hy het met homself gepraat), which implies that the man was talking to himself, which doesn't seem to be a feasible reason for his unusual behavior."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Miere het na die kruimels gekruip) is more likely to occur. The use of the word ""kruimels"" suggests that there are small crumbs or pieces of food on the floor, and the phrase ""Miere het na die kruimels gekruip"" implies that a mouse has crawled over those crumbs. This scenario is more plausible than the other option, as mice are known to be attracted to food sources and will often seek out crumbs or scraps on the ground."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die vrou se suster het haar hande saamgevou) is a more plausible explanation for why dievrou gave her sister a handkerchief than option B (Die vrou se suster het begin huil). This is because the phrase ""het haar hande saamgevou"" means ""gave her sister a handkerchief,"" indicating that dievrou actively gave something to her sister, rather than simply crying or sobbing uncontrollably. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information given in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy lippe was geskeur) is a more plausible explanation for why die man het 'n muntstuk geneem. The phrase ""geskeur"" means ""to cut off"" or ""to remove,"" so it suggests that something was taken away from the person, rather than them simply being worried about something. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het die verkeer rundom die teater verwag) is more likely. The premise mentions that the couple left early for the show, indicating that they were preparing to arrive at the theater before the performance started. This suggests that they were aware of the traffic around the theater and had factored it into their plans, rather than simply taking a wrong turn or getting lost. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Haar baas het haar geprys) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het nie by diewerkgebly"" suggests that something was done to her at work, which could imply that someone in a position of authority or power over her (her boss) may have taken some kind of action against her. Option B (""haar werksmaat het haar gedek"") does not fit with this interpretation as it would suggest that one of her coworkers had covered for her, rather than someone in a position of authority over her."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Hy het hulle saak ondersteun) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""het"" in the sentence suggests a more active and supportive role for the speaker, rather than a dismissive or derogatory one. Additionally, the phrase ""saak ondersteun"" implies a sense of solidarity and shared purpose with the activists, rather than a negative labeling of their actions."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (Hy het verhoogvrees gehad) is more likely to be the correct answer. The actor had a hard time flying for his performance, indicating that he may have experienced fear or anxiety before taking flight. This is supported by the fact that he had not flown before and was nervous about it, which are common causes of fear and anxiety among individuals who are new to flying. In contrast, option B (Hy het sy woorde uit sy kop geleer) does not provide any specific evidence to support the idea that the actor learned his lines from his head, and seems unlikely given the context of the situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het my kontant getel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ek was Verlore"" implies that something negative has happened to the speaker, and losing money is a common negative experience. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker lost their money rather than having found a card."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die ryp vrugte het in die songebly,"" option A (Dit is geëet) is a more likely outcome. The phrase ""ryp vrugte"" typically refers to something that has been burned or scorched, so it's likely that whatever was inside the sun will have been destroyed or severely damaged by the intense heat."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ek het die ontsteking aangeskakel) is the correct answer. The use of the verb ""het"" (I have) suggests that the speaker was responsible for causing the spark, rather than the engine overheating."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het 'n psigiater gaan sien) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het 'n psigiater gaan sien"" suggests that the person may have seen a psychiatrist or therapist, which could potentially explain their improved mood. Option B (""hy het 'n paar dae lank in die bed gebly"") does not provide any specific explanation for the improvement in the person's mood."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het 'n vuur in die kaggel aangesteek,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Ek het nie meer hout gehad nie,"" is the correct answer. This is because if there were no wood left to burn, it would be unlikely for the speaker to have started a fire in the ashtray."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Sy het 'n kramp in haar sy gekry) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het opgehou hardloop"" suggests that the woman has been running for a long time, which could potentially lead to muscle cramps or exhaustion. It's less likely that she would have a second seizure without any prior history of epilepsy or other medical conditions."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (My buurman het my ingenooi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het aan my buurman se deur geklop"" implies that someone knocked on their neighbor's door, which suggests a face-to-face interaction or visit. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's buurman (neighbor) answered the door rather than leaving their house."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Haar man het haarbekommernisse verkeerd verstaan) is the correct answer. The phrase ""van frustrasie gesug"" suggests that Haar is feeling frustrated or upset about something, and her husband's misunderstanding of her concerns could be a possible reason for this. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the student answered the question correctly) is more likely to occur. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Sy het na die plaas gegaan) is more likely. The phrase ""het geen eiers mehr"" suggests that the woman did not have any eggs left, implying that she went to the farm or a place where she could obtain eggs. Therefore, Option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het 'n geheim aan hom bekend gemaak) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the speaker has shared a secret with their friend, which implies a level of trust and intimacy in their relationship. Option B (Ek het hom 'n drukkie gegee) does not align with this interpretation and seems less plausible given the context.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sy het 'n vis gefang) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het geweier om in die meer te gaan"" suggests that someone went swimming in the lake, and the word ""gevang"" means ""caught."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person caught a fish while swimming rather than something being contaminated or infected."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy's bike is stolen) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Die student het 'n nat na die klas aangekom"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual happened to the student, and the fact that their bike is missing implies that it may have been stolen. Option B (""Sy fiets is gestolen"") is also possible, but it does not fit as well with the given information."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the user clicked the mouse) is a more likely cause for the cursor to move on the calculator screen. Therefore, answer choice A is correct.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (there was an accident on the main road) is more likely to be the cause of the driver's delay. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the line dried up) is more likely. The premise states that the line was hung outside, implying that it was exposed to the elements, including sunlight and dry air. As a result, it's possible that the line dried out completely over time, rather than developing spots or stains. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Die sonlig was helder) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het haar sonbril aangetrok"" suggests that she drew her sunshade, which would make sense if it were bright outside."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het het na die naghemel gekyk,"" it is more likely that Option A (Hy wens dit was somer) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het nacht"" means ""it is nighttime,"" so the speaker wishes it were summer instead of nighttime."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het vroeg gaan slaap) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that Ek was exhausted, which suggests that they went to sleep early. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het na die kapper gegaan,"" it is more likely that option A (Hy het sy hare laat groei) is the correct answer. The phrase ""na die kapper"" suggests that something happened after the person went to the barber, and since the word ""gegaan"" means ""went,"" it implies that the action of going to the barber occurred before any change in the person's hair length. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's hair grew longer after they got a haircut rather than their hair having already grown long beforehand."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Die seun het nie van die nuwe clas maat gehou nie) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the new teacher was not welcomed by the students, which implies that they did not accept or appreciate her arrival. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the students behaved in this manner.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het 'n glas melk gesoek,"" it is more likely that option A (Ek het koekies geëet) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""gesoek"" in Afrikaans means to drink or consume something, which aligns with the context of wanting a glass of milk. Option B does not make as much sense in this context, as baking bread would not involve consuming milk directly."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the driver turned on the headlights) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Die bestuurder het die hoofligte aangesteek"" implies that the driver turned on the headlights, which would help him see better during the rain. Option B (""Die bestuurder het die motor in die agterste rigting geskuif"") does not provide any information about the headlights or the driver's visibility during the rain. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het oorkant die straat geparkeer) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker parked their car at the corner of the street.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy had a writer's block) is more likely. The author struggled to come up with ideas for the concept presentation, indicating that they experienced a creative roadblock or ""writer's block."" This is a common phenomenon where an individual experiences difficulty in generating new ideas or expressing themselves creatively. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het gefel en gevra om met 'n toesighouer te praat) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker was asked to meet with a mediator. This is consistent with the idea of resolving conflicts through mediation. Option B (Ek het my identifikasie nommer gegee) does not align with this interpretation and seems less relevant to the context of mediation.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die deurbel het geklink) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""deurbel"" in Dutch means ""doorbell,"" so it would make sense that the sound of the doorbell being rung could be heard through the open window. Option B (Die gordyne het geskud) does not fit with the given premise as there is no mention of a gunshot."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het die lamp uitgekap) is a more plausible explanation for why there is no electricity in the house than option B (Ek het 'n lontgeblaas). This is because turning off the light switch or blowing a fuse are both common causes of loss of electricity in a household, while blowing a fuse is not typically associated with this problem. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het sy spiere in die spieëlgebrek) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the person's head was spinning. Option B (Hy het die balk oor sy kop oplig) does not provide any logical explanation for the person's condition. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hy het verward geraak) is more likely. The fact that the student tried to solve the calculations in his head suggests that he may have become confused or disoriented while attempting to do so, leading him to make mistakes or struggle with the problem. This is a common occurrence for many people when they are under pressure or struggling with complex tasks, and it is unlikely that they would simply pull out a calculator without any prior experience using one.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Die pa het die baba se luier verander) is the correct answer. The fact that the baby woke up suggests that something changed or happened to disturb the baby's sleep, and the only thing mentioned in the premise is that the father changed the baby's diaper. Therefore, it is more plausible that the change in the baby's diaper caused the baby to wake up rather than the father skudding the baby with a stick.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the boy has a shock) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het 'n skok gekry"" means ""had a shock,"" indicating that the boy was surprised or startled by something. This is consistent with the idea of him being hit with a water balloon without expecting it. Option B (""die seun het nat geword"") simply means ""the boy got wet,"" which doesn't fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Almal op die foto's het geweier om te glimlag) is more likely. The phrase ""het vergeet"" implies that the photographer forgot to use the flash, resulting in blurry photos. This is consistent with Option B, where all the people on the photo have squinted due to the lack of lighting."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ek was eensaam) is more likely to be the correct answer. The fact that the speaker declined an invitation to a birthday party suggests that they were feeling lonely or isolated, which aligns with option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het oefeninge gedoen,"" it is more likely that option A (Ek het energiek gevoel) is the correct answer. This is because doing exercises can increase energy levels, whereas being afraid can lead to feelings of anxiety or unease."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het die nat spons uitgedruk,"" option A (Dit het water opgeneem) is more likely. The word ""uitgedruk"" implies that something was taken out of a container or substance, which aligns with Option A's meaning of ""water has been absorbed."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die oord was vol.) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het 'n veerboot na die oord geneem"" implies that there were people waiting at the shore for the ferry to arrive, indicating that the location was already populated. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the ferry did not stop at the island."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sy was bang vir naalde) is more likely as a cause for why the teenagers got a tattoo. The phrase ""bang vir naalde"" means ""afraid of needles,"" indicating that the teenagers were scared or anxious about getting a tattoo but still decided to go through with it anyway. This choice better aligns with the given premise than Option B (""Sy wou in opstand kom""), which implies that the teenagers rebelled against something without further context or explanation."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het agterdogtig geword) is a more likely outcome than option B (Ek het die polisie gebel). This is because the speaker has already ""gone crazy"" over the unknown car parked outside their house, indicating that they are feeling anxious or worried about the situation, rather than taking action to report it to the police."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die bewyse het hom in die saak betrok) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of ""het"" instead of ""had"" suggests that the action of taking part in the case is ongoing or continuous, rather than something that happened in the past. Additionally, the phrase ""in die saak betrok"" implies a level of involvement or engagement, which supports Option A. Therefore, the most likely explanation for why the speaker's husband did not come home last night is that he is still involved in the case and has not yet returned home."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het van die lekkers ontslae geraak) is more likely. The phrase ""het van die lekkers ontslae geraak"" suggests that the person has become addicted to something sweet or tasty, which could lead to weight gain."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die meisie het op die ys getrap,"" it is more likely that she got glued (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Sy het die hele nag wakkergebly) is a more plausible explanation for why she had ringtone under her pillow. It's unlikely that she would have put it there intentionally and forgotten about it. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die vulkaan het uitgebars) is the more likely cause. The sentence ""Lava flowed out of the volcano"" implies that there was an eruption or explosion of some kind, which would result in lava flowing out of the volcano. This is a more plausible explanation than option B (Die vulkaan was slapen), as it does not provide any evidence to support the idea that the volcano was sleeping or inactive."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het almal op die partytjie geken) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that everyone at the party was attracted to her, implying that she was popular and well-liked by those around her. This supports the idea that she was enjoying herself at the party.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het my deur die tolhokkie laat gaan) is more likely. The phrase ""het my deur"" indicates that the speaker was physically led away by someone, which suggests a more forceful action than simply being left at the tollhouse. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hy het sy maatskappy-aandeel verkoop) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het sy maatskappy-aandeel verkoop"" suggests that the person sold their shares in the company, which could be a possible reason for them to have lost their fortune."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Die dokter was op verlof) is the correct answer. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is referring to a specific doctor who is not present or available at the moment, rather than indicating that the speaker has a sick feeling.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the house caught fire) caused the speaker to leave their bedroom through the window. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hy het lank gedoucheer) is the more likely cause for why the young boy's fingers are covered in soap. This is because the phrase ""het lank gedoucheer"" means ""he had a long bath,"" indicating that he was submerged in water for an extended period of time, which could explain how his fingers became covered in soap. In contrast, Option B (Hy het sy hande mit seep gespuit) means ""he spit his hands with soap,"" which does not align with the given premise as it implies that the boy intentionally put soap on his own fingers rather than having it happen accidentally during a bath. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for why the young boy's fingers are covered in soap."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek spuit die melk uit,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""suur gesmaak"" means ""sour taste,"" indicating that the milk tasted unpleasantly sour after being spat out. This supports the idea that something went wrong during the process of spitting out the milk. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het die bus gemis,"" it is more likely that Option A: ""Ek was vroeg by diewerk"" is correct. The sentence suggests that the speaker missed the bus because they were early for work, rather than being late for work."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die vragmotor het met die motor gebots,"" it is more likely that Option A: Die vragmotor het versnel is correct. The word ""gebots"" implies a collision or impact, which could potentially cause the engine to speed up rather than break down. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het gewen) is more likely. The premise suggests that the characters have manipulated their gun battles to achieve a specific outcome, which implies that they are skilled enough to control the situation and avoid losing. Therefore, it is more likely that they will win the battle rather than lose it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die soda bottel het gesis,"" option A (Ek het die bottel omgedraai) is the more likely cause. The word ""gesis"" suggests that something has been turned or twisted, which aligns better with turning a bottle than removing its cap."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Hy het op die dak geklim) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for how the boy got out of his house without an open window or door. Option A (Hy het deur 'n oop venster ingekruip) does not provide any context or evidence to support this conclusion. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Die vrou het deur die sleutelgat in die deur gekyk) is a more likely outcome than option A (Die besoeker het op die deur geklop). This is because there are no indications that someone knocked on the door or that a visitor arrived at the scene of the crime. The fact that ""die vrou"" (the woman) looked through the keyhole suggests that she was already inside the house when the murder occurred, making it less likely that an external force caused the noise heard by the neighbors."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het sy pak gefleck,"" it is more likely that he cleaned it (Option A) rather than hung it up (Option B). The word ""gefleck"" means to spot or stain something, so it makes sense that the person would try to remove the stains from their bag rather than leaving them there."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die tandpasta het uit die buis gespuit) is a more likely outcome than option B (Die meisie het die tandepasta uitgespuit). This is because the word ""buis"" in A refers to a container or vessel, while ""meisie"" in B refers to a female person. Therefore, it is more likely that something inside the container was expelled rather than a person doing the action of spitting out something."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Pasifiste het 'n optog gehou) is more likely. The passage states that ""die burgers het nie vir die oorlog bygevoeg,"" indicating that they did not support the war effort. This suggests that they may have protested or taken other forms of action against the war, rather than simply accepting it passively."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die meisie het die lint uit haar haren geruk,"" it is more likely that Option A (Sy het die lintvasgemaak) is correct. The phrase ""uit haar haren"" means ""from her hair,"" so it is unlikely that the lint was grown or childlike in appearance. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that someone made a knot or tied the lint into a bundle, which is what Option A suggests."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Hy het jonger gelyk) is more likely. The passage states that after undergoing plastic surgery, he looks younger than before. This suggests that the aging process has been reversed or slowed down, making him appear younger.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Uit die eier het 'n jong hoender gekom,"" option A (Die eier het uitgebroei) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""uit die eier"" means ""from the egg,"" so it is unlikely that the egg cracked itself or that someone else broke it. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hy is dood) is correct. The phrase ""het honger gesterf"" suggests that something has died or perished due to hunger, which implies that the person in question has passed away rather than escaped."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het sy balans op die leer verloor,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""het van die leer af geval"" means ""lost his balance."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person lost their balance rather than climbed up the learning."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die kind het geborsel,"" it is more likely that option A (Hy het 'n sluk soda gedrink) is correct because the word ""geborsel"" means ""born"" in Afrikaans, indicating that a child was born. Therefore, the sentence does not make sense if we assume that the child drank soda or made the bottle."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""a koue stroom het deur die venster ingekom,"" option B (Ek het geskrik) is more likely. The use of the word ""koue"" to describe the stream of cold air entering through the window suggests that it was a sudden and unexpected event, which would be more likely to cause fear or alarm than relaxation or enjoyment."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely. The fact that she received a scholarship to attend university suggests that she has good grades, rather than her classmates respecting her. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy hetlangs hom gewoon) is more likely as it suggests that the man simply ignored or dismissed the woman's advances without any romantic interest. This aligns with the theme of toxic masculinity and entitlement that is often seen in abusive relationships.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het mense tot jammerte aangetrok) is more likely as it suggests that Hunger caused him to steal food.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek wou privaatheid hê) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker wants to keep their conversation private, indicating that they value their personal space and may not want to share their feelings with others.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het sy hand geskud) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het sy hand"" means ""hit his hand,"" so it suggests that the speaker acted violently towards someone else's hand. Option B (Ek het hom geslaan) means ""I hit him,"" which implies a different target than the hand mentioned in the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the context provided."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the fireworks exploded in the air) caused the loud noise. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die meisie het haar naels gebyt,"" option A (Sy was bekommerd) is a more likely cause than option B (Sy was verbaas). This is because the word ""bekommerd"" has a negative connotation, indicating that something is troubling or worrying her, whereas ""verbaas"" means to be surprised or amazed, which does not fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Ek het die bladsy op die kalender omgedraai) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker noticed that it was Monday. The passage states that the speaker ""het die bladsy op die kalender omgedraai,"" indicating that they looked at the calendar to determine what day it was. This suggests that the speaker did not have any prior knowledge or memory of the date, but rather checked the calendar to confirm that it was indeed Monday. In contrast, option B (Dit was die begin van 'n nuwe maand) does not provide any specific evidence or context to support the idea that the speaker knew it was Monday without checking the calendar. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Hy het vir egskeiding aansoek gedoen) is more likely. The fact that the husband has sought divorce suggests that he wants to end his marriage with his wife, which aligns with the premise provided. Option A (Hy het sy prokureur afgedank) does not necessarily imply that the husband wants to get rid of his wife, as it could also mean that he simply fired his lawyer without any further implications for his marriage.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die meisie het die rubberbal laten val,"" option A (the ball bounced) is more likely to occur. The word ""gespring"" in Afrikaans means ""bounced."" Therefore, it is more likely that the ball will bounce after being dropped by the girl rather than melting."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Sy het haar antwoord uitgewys) is more likely. The premise states that the girl made a mistake in her exam, which implies that she may have answered incorrectly or forgotten information, leading to her answer being marked incorrect. Therefore, it is more likely that she will lose marks for her incorrect answer rather than simply raking the wrong answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sy teenstander het die pas gefang) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that ""teenstander"" is in the wrong position, and therefore it is more likely that ""pas"" should be used instead of ""teenstander"". Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle was ryp) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het die tamaties van die wingerdstokke gepluk"" implies that someone picked or plucked the tomatoes from a stalk of weeds, which could result in them being ripe. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the tomatoes were ripe."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hy het sy eks-vriendin vir middagete ontmoet) is more likely to happen as it suggests that the speaker will meet their ex-friend for lunch, which is a more plausible scenario than buying chocolate for them (option B).
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het die termometer laten vallen) is a more plausible explanation for why the mercury in the thermometer has risen. This is because the temperature outside has not changed, so it is unlikely that the weather has caused the mercury to rise without any external influence. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the dak of the hofgebou has blown away) is more likely to occur as a result of a tornado passing through the town. This is because the roof of a house is typically one of the most vulnerable parts of the structure to high winds and can be easily damaged or destroyed by a tornado. In contrast, while a highway may also be affected by strong winds from a tornado, it is less likely that the entire roof of a house would be blown off due to the sturdier construction of buildings along a highway. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sy punte het verbeter) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the speaker is expressing a desire to improve their performance, rather than having already achieved it. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het gemaklik gevoel,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""het op die grond gekniel"" means ""fell down"" or ""collapsed,"" which suggests a sudden and unexpected event occurred. Option B, ""ek het myself in 'n kombers toegedraai,"" means ""I threw myself into a corner,"" which implies a deliberate action was taken. Therefore, option A is more likely as it aligns better with the idea of something happening suddenly and without intention."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het die klip gepoleer,"" it is more likely that option A (dit het glad geword) is correct. The verb ""gepoleer"" means to smooth or polish something, so it would make sense for the surface of the clip to become smoother after being polished. Option B (dit het blink geword) does not fit with the context of the sentence as there is no indication that the clip has changed color."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het suiker by die koffie gevoeg,"" it is more likely that Option A (Die koffie het sterk geruik) is correct. The use of the verb ""het"" in the premise implies a past action, and the phrase ""by die koffie gevoeg"" suggests that sugar was added to the coffee. This would result in a strong smell, as mentioned in Option A. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hy het 'n papier sny) is correct. The phrase ""het 'n papier sny"" means ""he threw a paper away,"" which suggests that the speaker did not actually read or keep the newspaper. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the spyker has sunk into the wood) is the more likely outcome. The wording of the premise suggests that the hammer strike was powerful enough to penetrate through the spyker and cause it to sink into the wood. Option B (the spyker has turned into a puddle) does not align with this scenario as there is no indication that the spyker would transform into a liquid state after being struck by a hammer. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die visserman het die vis in die water gesleep) is more likely to occur because it aligns with the logical flow of events described in the premise. Option B (Die visser gooi die lyn weer uit) goes against this logic as it would require an additional action that is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het 'n puistjie) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sy het 'n puistjie"" means ""she had a tantrum,"" which aligns with the idea of being embarrassed about going to school. Option B (""Sy het haar braces afgetrok"") does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""My gesigsuitdrukking het opgelig,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as this implies a positive outcome (good news). Therefore, the answer is Option A: Ek het goeie nuus ontvang."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het my hande met 'n handdoek afgedroog,"" option B is the most likely cause. The fact that the speaker's hand was wet suggests that it came into contact with water or another liquid, rather than being covered in a damp cloth."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Die stoel het onder hom geskud) is a more plausible explanation for why someone might have lost their balance while sitting on a chair. This is because it suggests that something external to the person caused them to lose their balance, such as the chair collapsing or slipping away from underneath them. Option B (Hy het verf op die stoel gemors), on the other hand, does not provide any clear evidence or reason as to why someone would lose their balance while sitting on a chair, and seems unlikely in this context.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het hulle spel verloor) is the more likely cause for why the students lost their game. Therefore, answer choice A is correct.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het om vergifnis gefra,"" option A is more likely. The correct answer is (A) Ek het my fout bemoor."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hy het haar vrae oor haarself gefra) is a more plausible explanation for why she got her appointment cancelled than option B (Hy het onophoudelik oor homself gepraat). This is because it's more likely that someone would reflect on their own actions or decisions rather than talking to themselves in the third person when trying to figure out why something unexpected happened.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die meisie het 'n glimlag laten skyn,"" it is more likely that her eyes have turned red (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Dit het oor die myn gegaan) is a more plausible explanation for why the wind skipped over the sea. This is because the word ""myn"" refers to an ear of corn, which is not something that can be seen or observed directly from a distance. Therefore, it is unlikely that the wind would have skipped over the entire sea just to reach an ear of corn. On the other hand, option B (Dit het in die hawe ingeseil) suggests that the wind may have entered a hole or crevice somewhere along the coastline, but this does not explain why the wind would have skipped over the entire sea before reaching its destination."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hy het in 'n plas geloop) is the more likely cause of the foot injury. The phrase ""het in 'n plas gegooid"" means to have been thrown into a pond or lake, which could potentially result in an injury if someone were to fall from a height or hit their head on something underwater. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options given the information provided."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hulle het die moordenaar se identiteit ontdek) is more likely. The fact that they found a fingerprint at the crime scene suggests that they may have discovered the identity of the killer through forensic analysis. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ek het gefra vir 'n rit) is more likely to occur. The premise mentions ""baie verkeer"" on the highway, indicating a high volume of traffic, which could lead to congestion and delays. In this scenario, it's more likely that the speaker would have asked for a ride rather than taken an Uber pad."
"Response:  Option B: Baie mense het werkloosheid ondervind. 
Explanation: The premise states that the economy has gone backwards, indicating a decline in economic activity. This can lead to an increase in unemployment as businesses downsize or close due to reduced demand for their products and services. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hulle was op die punt om in die tegendeel verkeer in te loop) is more likely. The phrase ""het haar fluitjie by die kindersgeblaas"" suggests that something unexpected or unusual happened to the children, which aligns with Option A's description of them being on the brink of entering a dangerous situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het my oë op my vriend gedraai,"" it is more likely that option A (Hy het my die waarheid vertel) is correct. The use of the phrase ""my oë"" suggests a personal experience or feeling, which aligns with the idea of someone sharing their genuine thoughts or feelings with another person."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die bestuurder was op die pad vas) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""was op die padvas"" suggests that the driver was stationary or at a standstill, rather than moving forward as implied by option B (""Die bestuurder het 'n lifter opgetel""). Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why the car did not move with fuel in it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die baba is gebore) is more likely to be correct. The word ""gebore"" means ""born"", so it suggests that a baby was born. Option B (Die vrou het oggendkwaak gehad) does not make sense in this context as ""oggendkwaak"" is an unfamiliar term with no clear meaning. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hy het die hoed afgetrok) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Die man se hoed is weggewaai"" suggests that someone's hat has been blown away by the wind, which could be caused by a strong gust of air or a storm. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the person's hat might have disappeared."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sy het 'n uitnodiging ontvang) is more likely as it suggests that the main character received an invitation to the party, rather than buying a gift themselves.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sy ma het sy temperatuur geneem) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""voorkop was warm"" suggests that something was covered or hidden, which could potentially affect its temperature. Therefore, it makes sense that Sy might have increased his body temperature to compensate for any discomfort caused by the cold weather. Option B (""Sy ma het hom na die park geneem"") does not make as much logical sense in this context, as going to the park would not necessarily affect Sy's body temperature."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hy wou sy afspraakjie beïndruk) is more likely as it makes sense that someone would want to cancel their appointment due to an unexpected situation like running out of gas. Option B (Hy het gel in sy hare gesit) does not make much sense in this context and seems unlikely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het na 'n flitslig gesoek) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""na 'n flitslig gesoek"" means ""after a quick search,"" indicating that the speaker found what they were looking for quickly and easily. Option B (""Ek het 'n graaf opgetel"") means ""I have counted a grave,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die seun het sy hoërskoolopleiding voltooi) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that something significant has happened to the children after they completed their higher education, indicating that they have achieved a milestone in their lives. Option B (Die moeder het aan 'n tweelinggebore gegee), while possible, does not provide as much context or detail to support this conclusion.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Sy het die eindstreep gesien) is more likely as it implies that the runner saw the finish line, indicating that they are nearing the end of their race. Option A (Sy wou haar energie bespaar) does not provide any information about the runner's location or progress in the race. Therefore, Option B is the more likely answer based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, Option A (Die masjien het die geld uitgestort) is the more likely cause of the problem. The fact that the sales team has been skimming money from the company's accounts suggests that they may have been dishonest or unethical in their dealings with the business. This could potentially lead to financial difficulties for the company, such as overspending or mismanagement of funds. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the problem described in the scenario.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het my oë op hom gerol) is more likely to be the correct response. This is because ""my friend's dog has died"" implies that the speaker had a close relationship with their friend and their friend's dog, and therefore it would make sense for them to have been affected by its death. Option B (Ek het hom 'n drukkie gegee) does not fit as well in this context, as there is no indication of a close relationship between the speaker and their deceased friend's dog."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Hy het 'n skuldbewys geskryf) is correct. The premise states that the Sakerman's credit card was rejected, indicating that he may have written a bad check or had insufficient funds in his account to cover the payment. This is a common reason for a credit card rejection, and therefore option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hy het sy naels geknip) is a more plausible explanation for why die man vervloek was cursed than option B (Hy het sy teen gestamp). This is because ""naels"" means ""to curse"" or ""to put a spell on someone,"" while ""teen"" means ""to stamp."" Therefore, it makes more sense that the person who cursed him used magic to harm him rather than physically attacking him."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy broer het met hulle ouers in 'n argument beland) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that there is a conflict between the speaker's brother and their parents, which could lead to tension and arguments within the family. This scenario is more plausible than option B (Sy broer is in die regskool aanvaar), as it does not provide any context or evidence to support the idea that the speaker's brother is excelling in school.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het na die biblioteek gegaan) is more likely. The phrase ""wou meer oor"" suggests that the girl wants to learn about something in particular, which aligns with her going to the library to research or study. Option B (Sy het na die sterre gekyk) does not provide a clear reason for why the girl would want to look at the stars, and it may be less likely that she would go to the library to do so."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het die plakkaat bo die deur geplaas) is a more likely explanation for why the poster was found at the wall. This is because it implies that someone intentionally placed the poster there, rather than simply forgetting or losing it somewhere else. Therefore, Option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die argitek het diegebou gebou) is more likely. The premise states that the architect has approved the building plans, indicating that they have been satisfied with the design and are ready to move forward with construction. This suggests that the architect will be involved in the actual construction of the building, rather than simply approving the plans and passing them along to someone else. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Sy hand het geskud) is a more plausible explanation for why the person let their soup spill than option B (Hy het die lepel gelik). This is because it is unlikely that someone would intentionally drop a spoon in hot liquid, especially if they are trying to eat with it. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the person accidentally dropped their spoon while handling the hot soup, leading to the spill.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die direksie het die maatskappy ontbind) is more likely to occur. The executive head of the company has resigned, indicating that there may be a leadership crisis or a lack of confidence in the current management team. This could lead to the board of directors taking action such as dissolving the company or replacing the existing management structure. Option B (Die direksie het sy plaasvervanger gefind) suggests that the board of directors have found a replacement for the departing executive head, but without further context it is unlikely that this would be the most likely outcome given the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ek het die verhoog genader) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""ek het in die agterste ry gaan sit,"" indicating that the speaker went to the back seat, which is closer to the ground than the front seat. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker would have been seated higher up in the vehicle rather than lower down, as suggested by option A (Ek het laten by die lezing aangekom)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sy Familie het sy borgtog betaal) is more likely as it provides an explanation for why the person was released from prison early. It suggests that the family of the person paid off their debt to society, rather than resorting to violence or attacking another inmate. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option B (House has been burnt down) is more likely to be the correct answer. The fact that the family lost their belongings suggests that they may have had a fire-related incident, such as a house fire, rather than simply selling their home.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die blikkie is herwin) is more likely. The word ""herwin"" means ""to win again"", so it suggests that the aluminum can has been won or retrieved after being lost or stolen. Option B (Die blikkie is verpletter) means ""The can is crushed"", which doesn't align with the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het geleer om 'n rekenaar te gebruik) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the person has learned how to use a computer, which implies a higher level of technical proficiency rather than improved communication skills.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het na musiek geluister) is the more likely cause for the improvement in your mood. The sentence suggests that you listened to music, which can have a positive impact on one's mood by reducing stress and anxiety levels or providing emotional upliftment. On the other hand, option B (Ek het die skottelgoed gewas) does not provide any logical explanation for why your mood improved, making it less plausible as the cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het die haweloses gevoed) is more likely. The organization has a goal of collecting money, which suggests that they may have held a fundraising event or campaign to achieve this goal. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the passengers have screamed) is more likely. The word ""giggle"" suggests a less intense reaction compared to ""scream,"" which implies a stronger emotional response."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het die posbus nagegaan toe ek die huis verlaat het) is a more likely explanation for why the door was locked when he left the house. This is because ""posbus"" means ""to lock up"" in Afrikaans, so it implies that the speaker locked the door before leaving the house. Option B (Ek het die deur toe ik die huis verlaat het, gesluit) does not provide any information about whether the door was locked or not, only that the speaker closed the door after leaving the house. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man wou die sonsopkoms sien,"" it is more likely that Option A (Hy het noord gereis) is correct. The phrase ""die man"" refers to a male person, and the verb ""wou"" means ""he wanted."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the male person went north."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het die koerant gefouc) is a more plausible explanation for why the paper was found in the bin than option B (Die papier het gefouc). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Leaders of other countries have sent aid) is more likely to occur as a result of the natural disaster. The premise suggests that the leaders of other countries are already taking action to help those affected by the disaster, rather than forming an alliance to address the issue. Therefore, it is more likely that they would send aid directly to the affected areas rather than coordinating their efforts through an alliance.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die seun se klere het nat geword,"" option A (Hy het uit die swembad geklim) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""het nat geword"" suggests that something liquid has been poured or spilled onto the children, which would be consistent with them getting out of a pool. In contrast, option B (""Hy het in die swembad geval"") could suggest that they were already inside the pool when something happened to them."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Dit moes na die biblioteek zurückbesorgword) is correct. The fact that the book was quickly finished suggests that it may have been borrowed from a library or returned to its owner, rather than being lent to a friend.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Hy is in die tronk gegooi) is correct. The phrase ""tereggestel"" suggests that something or someone has been sentenced to prison, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sonlig het die kamer binnegekom,"" it is more likely that Option A (Ek het die gordyne oopgemaak) is the correct answer. This is because ""binnegekom"" means ""entered"" or ""went in"", which implies that someone entered the room. The phrase ""het die gordyne oopgemaak"" means ""messed up"" or ""made a mess"", which suggests that something was done to the room after someone entered it. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (her hair was cut off) is correct. The phrase ""het die bedrieër se hare geskeur"" implies that someone has had their hair cut off, which could be a punishment or consequence for lying. It does not make sense to assume that the person has become bald as a result of lying, so Option B is less likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het die manuskrip boeiend gefound) is more likely. The fact that the editor found the manuscript intriguing suggests that they were interested in it and wanted to learn more about it, rather than being unsure or uninterested. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het besef dat die kaartjie weg is) is more likely as it implies that the speaker has realized or become aware of the fact that their credit card has been cancelled. Option B (Sy het besef dat die kaart verval het) means ""He/She had a feeling that the card would expire"" and does not align with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het universiteit toe gegaan) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the two characters have become involved in a romantic relationship, which would not necessarily involve them getting married or staying together long-term. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information given.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ek het my eie liedjie geskryf) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker seems to be expressing frustration with the music being too weak to hear, and then immediately follows up by saying they have written their own song, implying that they are taking matters into their own hands and creating something better themselves. Option A (Ek het die volume verhoog) does not necessarily convey this sense of creativity or self-expression.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die seun se hare het opgestaan,"" option A (the girl got confused) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het myself met insek dwelm gespuit) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of the word ""myself"" in this context suggests that the speaker may have intentionally inserted an insect into their own body, rather than simply stumbling upon one by accident. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het my oë oopgemaak,"" it is more likely that option A (Ek het wakker geword) is the correct answer. This is because ""oë"" is a common Afrikaans word for ""eye,"" so the phrase ""my oë oopgemaak"" could be translated to ""I had an eye opening experience."" Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response: 
Option B: Ek het hom geflit vir die CD.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""My buurman se musiek het hardgeblaas,"" it's more likely that you asked your neighbor to lend you his music rather than asking him to turn it down. This option better fits the context of the situation."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Hy het minder as die minimumloon verdien) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the person has been living in poverty, indicating that their income is below the minimum wage level. Therefore, it is more likely that they have been earning less than the minimum wage rather than being frugal with their income.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hy het 'n stokperdjie aangeneem) is more likely. The fact that the student has completed his studies suggests that he has achieved something positive, and the use of the word ""aangeneem"" (which means ""enjoyed"") implies that he enjoyed his time at university. Therefore, it is more likely that he had a positive experience there."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Die verf het oral gespat) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the yellow paint has been mixed with blue paint, resulting in a green color. This is a logical consequence of mixing two different colors together.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ek het nie meer dingen gehad waaroor ek kon praat nie) is the correct answer. The speaker mentions not having anything to talk about anymore, indicating a lack of topics or interests to discuss. This suggests that the conversation has become stale or repetitive, rather than having simply ""spanned"" as suggested by option B."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het hom zurück by die huis verwelkom) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker's brother has been discharged from the hospital, indicating that he is no longer in need of medical care and can return home. This suggests that the speaker would want to welcome him back with open arms, rather than ignoring him altogether.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die openingstoneel van die toneelstuk het begin) is more likely. The premise suggests that something has happened at the beginning of the play, which implies that Option A is correct.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the kidnapper threatened to harm the gypsy) is more likely. The premise states that the kidnapper had an ulterior motive for taking the gypsy, which suggests that they may have been motivated by a desire to inflict harm or punishment upon him. This is consistent with the idea of a threat, as the kidnapper would be using the threat of harm to achieve their desired outcome. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the musician kicked the drum) is more likely. The phrase ""het op sy foot geklap"" implies that the action was performed with the feet, rather than with the hands or arms. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the child screamed out of a nightmare) is more likely. The phrase ""het na hulle kind se slaapkamer gehardloop"" suggests that something frightening or disturbing happened in the child's room, leading to their screaming. This implies that the child had a nightmare or bad dream, which is more consistent with option A than option B."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Sy is too early born) is a more plausible explanation for why she has difficulty communicating with her parents in their language. It is unlikely that a child would be born deaf from being ""too early"" born, as this is not a known medical condition or risk factor for hearing impairment. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Die water het besmet geraak) is more likely. The phrase ""besmet geraak"" suggests that something has contaminated or polluted the water, rather than simply withering away."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die kat had die vogel gefokk,"" it is more likely that the bird flew away (Option A). The use of the word ""gefokk"" implies a sudden and forceful action, which would not be able to catch or hold onto something as small and quick as a bird. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (school has closed for summer) is the correct answer. The reason being that ""vir"" means ""from"" in Afrikaans, indicating that school has been cancelled or closed for a period of time, rather than the family moving to a new town."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the workers have gone on strike) is more likely to occur as an effect of the factory owner's decision to increase the workers' wages without consulting them first. Workers may feel disrespected or undervalued by this decision and decide to take collective action to protest against it, such as going on strike.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the extremist has murdered him) is more likely. The premise suggests that the extremist group hated the individual, implying a strong negative sentiment towards him. Given this context, it is more plausible that the extremist group would resort to violent measures such as murder rather than simply influencing or inspiring him.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het kaalvoet op die strand geloop,"" option B (Golwe het langs die strand neergestort) is more likely. The word ""kaalvoet"" implies that the speaker has walked barefoot on the beach, which could result in sand getting stuck to their feet. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker would have sand on their feet rather than water."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Ek het sweatpants aangetrok) will occur as it suggests that the speaker has already taken action to address their discomfort. The act of putting on sweatpants implies a sense of preparation or proactivity, whereas drinking water may not necessarily address the initial feeling of coldness. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice given the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Haar seun het 'n lelike glimlag gegee) is a more plausible explanation for why die mother is quiet than Option B (Haar seun het gehuil). This is because the phrase ""het 'n lelike glimlag gegee"" means ""had a little smile,"" which suggests that the son's behavior was endearing or amusing to the mother, rather than upsetting her. Therefore, it is more likely that the mother is quiet in this scenario due to happiness or contentment rather than sadness or anger."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I made a hole in your pants) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""vasgemaak"" (made a hole) is a common idiomatic expression used in Afrikaans that refers to creating a small opening or hole in something, such as clothing. Therefore, it is more likely that you accidentally made a hole in someone's pants while trying to get rid of a tick than you accidentally stepped on them."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Sy tande het reguit geword) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ek het vandag met 'n seer keel wakker geword) is more likely. The phrase ""wakker geword"" suggests that the speaker had a sore throat or was feeling unwell in the morning, which aligns with the premise given. Option A (""Ek het gister by die gimnasium gewerk"") does not provide any information about the speaker's health or well-being."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Ander studente by die middagete het uitgesluit gevoel) is more likely to occur. The use of ""het"" instead of ""heen"" suggests that the other students have been excluded from the table, rather than simply sitting there."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sy het besluit om 'n draai te probeer maak) is more likely. The fact that the child landed on the trampoline suggests that they may have been thrown or jumped from a height, which could result in serious injury. Therefore, it is more likely that the child will try to make a turn to avoid further harm rather than simply getting back up again.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the post office has delivered the letter) is more likely. The sentence ""I left the letter at the post office"" implies that the speaker dropped off the letter at the post office for delivery, rather than sending it via a faster method such as courier or email. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened to the letter."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die dobbelaar was selfverteerd,"" option A (Hy het al sy geld gewed) is more likely. The phrase ""selfverteerd"" implies that the person has already taken care of their financial needs, suggesting that they have spent or invested their money wisely. Therefore, it is less likely that they would go back to their old ways of spending recklessly."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the wind has grown stronger) caused the fire to spread. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die kind het sy knie geskil,"" it is more likely that Option A (Sy ma het hom na sy kamer gestuur) occurred. This is because the phrase ""geskil"" suggests a serious injury or trauma to the knee, which would require immediate medical attention. It is unlikely that the child's mother would have simply put a bandage on the wound without seeking professional help first. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (Hy het sy testament onderteken) is more likely to be the correct answer. This is because the fact that the patient has signed his will suggests that he is aware of his impending death and has made arrangements for the distribution of his assets after his passing. It does not necessarily follow that he has received an organ transplant, as there may be other reasons why a person would sign their will before receiving such a procedure.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het 'n sluk van die brandende koffie geneem,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""het my tong verbrand"" means ""burnt my tongue."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die skrywer het vermy om in haar verhale bevooroordeeld te wees) is the more likely cause. The fact that the writer has a tendency to be biased in her stories suggests that she may have intentionally or unintentionally distorted the facts of the situation, leading to an incorrect conclusion about the editor's dismissal. Option B (Die skrywer het 'n belangrike sperdatum gemis) does not provide any information that would suggest the writer was responsible for the error in the story.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek was uitgeput) is a more likely cause for why Ek was tired at the end of the day than option B (Ek het die hele dag geslaap). This is because being exhausted from work or activities throughout the day is a common reason for feeling tired in the evening, whereas sleeping all day is less likely to result in exhaustion. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They have identified the patient's symptoms) is more likely. The passage states that ""Die dokter het die pasiënt gediagnoseer,"" indicating that they have diagnosed or identified the patient's symptoms rather than simply prescribing medication without proper evaluation. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het my vel gekrap,"" option A (dit was sweet) is a more likely cause than option B (het gejuig gevoel). This is because the phrase ""ek het my vel gekrap"" means ""I scratched my head,"" which suggests that something unpleasant or annoying happened to the speaker's head, rather than anything pleasant or enjoyable. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hy het sy humeur verloor) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het 'n noodoperasie ondergaan"" suggests a serious medical procedure, such as a heart attack or stroke, which could result in loss of consciousness or memory loss. However, there is no indication in the premise that hy had a heart attack or stroke. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man se arm spiere uitgestreek,"" option A (Hy het sy arms gefou) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""spiere"" means to stretch or extend, so it's unlikely that a person would pull their own arms out of their body. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het sy wenkbroue opgetrek,"" option A (Hy was verbaas) is the more likely cause. The word ""verbaas"" means surprised or amazed in English, which fits with the idea of someone finding something unexpectedly good. Option B (""Hy was ontmoedig"") means disappointed or disheartened, which doesn't fit as well with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het meglo dat sy bedoeling goed was) is a more plausible explanation for why your colleague made a mistake than option B (Ek het geglo dat hy beter weet). This is because it suggests that you believe your colleague may have had good intentions but still made an error, rather than implying that they are intentionally trying to deceive or manipulate you.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hy het meer begin oefen) is a more plausible explanation for why he might have started coughing. This is because ""oefen"" means to exercise or train in Dutch, so it suggests that the person may have been doing something physically demanding that caused them to start coughing. Option B (Hy het vroeër begin wakker word) means ""He woke up earlier,"" which does not provide any obvious reason as to why the person would be coughing. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die aanvaller se liggaam het leweloos geword) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""het haar aanvaller in die neus geslaan"" suggests that the attacker was hit in the nose, which could cause injury or bleeding. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome than option B (Die aanvaller het begin bloei), as it does not make sense for someone who has been hit in the nose to suddenly start growing."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the man's chicken was wrong) caused him to miss his shot. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hy het rotte in die kelder ontdek) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there are ants in the house. The other option does not make sense as there is no evidence to suggest that there are ants in the house or that they were found in the basement. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek was te moeg om enigiets voor te berei) is the more likely cause for not being able to go out to eat. This is because the phrase ""te moeg"" means ""too tired"" in Afrikaans, indicating that the speaker may have been too exhausted to prepare anything. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's fatigue prevented them from going out to eat rather than their gas having a long break."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sy het die dagboek beginweg steek) is more likely. The fact that the sister saw her brother reading her diary suggests that she may have been uncomfortable with him knowing her personal thoughts and feelings, leading her to take away the diary as a way of protecting her privacy.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sy het haar werk verlaat) is more likely. The fact that she did not have enough money to pay rent suggests that she may have lost her job or left work for some other reason related to financial difficulties.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hy het aan die warmstoof geraak) is the more likely cause for why the child's hand was burned. The phrase ""het aan die warmstoof geraak"" means ""he got too close to the hot stove,"" indicating that the child accidentally touched the hot stove with their hand, causing a burn. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (they have an uptake under customer spread) is more likely. This is because the premise mentions that the company wants to measure client satisfaction, which suggests that they are interested in understanding how their customers feel about their products or services. Having an uptake under customer spread would allow them to gather feedback from a larger number of clients, providing valuable insights into their overall level of satisfaction.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Die seun het die kussings van die bank afgegooi) is a more plausible explanation for why there are footprints on the floor. This is because it suggests that someone or something walked away from the bank, rather than simply sitting or lying down on the floor. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het my gesig beskerm,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""my vyand"" suggests that there is a rival or enemy who has spotted the speaker's signal fire. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the famous statue was vandalized (Option A). The phrase ""afgebrand"" means ""burned"" in Dutch, indicating that the statue was intentionally set on fire. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het die vrugte op die tafel gelos,"" option B is more likely. The word ""verswelg"" means to burst or explode, so it suggests that the fruit may have suddenly expanded or splattered onto the table. Option A's ""werp sade af"" means to throw water away, which doesn't make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Sy het haar enkel verwring) is more likely as a ligament injury can result in ankle swelling and pain, but it does not typically cause a dancer to ""gewys"" or show their toned muscles. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het geleer hoe om dit te maak) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het losgekom"" suggests that something has been released or unlocked, which implies a level of understanding or knowledge gained by the child. Therefore, it is more likely that the child learned how to do this rather than simply running around on the playground."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ek het die tyd verloor) is more likely. The fact that the speaker ""het die boek teruggegee"" suggests that they have already read it before and are now experiencing regret for having lost time reading it instead of doing something else."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy ouers het hem beïnvloed) is more likely. The text states that the speaker's parents had a similar upbringing, implying that they may have influenced each other's beliefs and behaviors. This suggests that the speaker's parents played a role in shaping their own worldview, rather than rejecting it entirely. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (“Dit het nie meer brandstof gehad nie”) is the more likely cause of the car’s slow movement. The fact that the car was running out of fuel suggests that it had insufficient power to maintain a steady speed, leading to a gradual decrease in velocity until it eventually came to a stop. Option B (“Die bestuurder het aan die slaap geraak”) does not align with this explanation as there is no indication in the scenario that the driver fell asleep at the wheel.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het die roomys in die son geëet,"" option A is more likely. The word ""verloren"" (lost) suggests that something has been misplaced or cannot be found, which implies that the roomies have lost their taste buds rather than having been dropped out of a keg. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het kunswerke in die kamer opgehang,"" it is more likely that Option A (Die mat het vuil gelyk) is the correct answer. The word ""opgehang"" implies that something was hung or placed in the room, which could potentially leave a mess behind. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the floor might look dirty."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ek het 'n hoofpyn gehad) is the correct answer. The phrase ""I went out early from work"" suggests that the speaker left work earlier than usual, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as feeling unwell or having a headache. It is less likely that the speaker's boss had a meeting, as this information is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker left work early."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die eienaar het die hondjie geskree) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het die hondjie geskree"" means ""had the dog scratched,"" indicating that the owner of the dog was responsible for any damage caused by their pet."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het my vriend om verskoning gefra,"" it is more likely that option B, ""My vriend het woedend geword,"" is correct. The use of the word ""woedend"" suggests a strong emotion, which aligns with the meaning of the verb ""verwys."" Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man het in die skare uitgestaan,"" it is more likely that option A (Hy het 'n rugsak gedra) is correct. The phrase ""uitgestaan"" implies a violent or forceful action, which aligns with the meaning of ""rugsak."" Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hy het sy getuienis voltooi) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has completed their oath or promise, rather than being accused of breaking it.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy wou 'n nuwe voorkoms hê) is more likely as it suggests that the woman wants to try something new or different, whereas option B (Sy wou by diegemeenskap inpas) implies that she wants to join a community or group.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (they are deported) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the immigrant was trapped and did not have legal permission to be in the country, indicating that they may have been in violation of immigration laws and could face deportation as a result.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Die gehoor het gelag) is more likely. The use of the word ""het"" in this context suggests that the audience was entertained or amused by the speaker's joke, rather than being confused or disoriented as might be the case with option B (Die gehoor het opgestaan)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het in die son gekyk,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""het my verblind"" means ""made me blind."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het verveeld gevoel,"" option A (ek het gesnuif) is more likely. The word ""gesnuif"" means to yawn or stretch, indicating a feeling of boredom or disinterest."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die mes was dof) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""dof"" in Afrikaans means ""foolish"" or ""silly,"" which fits with the context of the sentence. Option B (Die biefstuk was rou) does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Sy het onderhoudsgeld ontvang) is correct. The phrase ""het bankrotskapverklaar"" suggests that the company has gone bankrupt, which means they are no longer able to pay their debts or obligations. This would make it unlikely for them to have accumulated a large amount of debt as suggested in option B (Sy het groot skuld opgedoen). Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het gewonder of hy uit is) is more likely. The use of ""het"" instead of ""hout"" suggests that the speaker is wondering if their friend has left or gone out, rather than visiting them at home."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die blomblare het van die blom af kom) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het die blom afkom"" means ""to have taken the flower away,"" indicating that someone or something removed the flower from its original location. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the smell of the flower is no longer present near the speaker's nose."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het 'n jeugvriend raakgeloop) is more likely. The passage suggests that the woman has a strong sense of nostalgia for her youth, which could be due to the loss of a childhood friend or other significant person from her past. Option B (Sy het op haar kinders geskree) does not align with this interpretation as it implies that she has negative feelings towards her children, which is unlikely given the context.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hy het die papier onvolledig ingedien) is more likely. The fact that the student did not complete the assignment suggests that he may have forgotten or overlooked it, rather than submitting it late intentionally.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ek het 'n werktuikundige gebel) is more likely. The word ""gebrek"" in the premise suggests that something has broken or malfunctioned, which aligns with Option B's suggestion of a technical problem. Option A (""Ek was by die winkelcentrum"") does not provide any indication of a technical issue but rather implies that the speaker was at a shopping center."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the letter was lost or misplaced (Option A). The phrase ""I have lost the letter"" suggests that the speaker has actively searched for and cannot find the letter, rather than simply not receiving it (as suggested by Option B). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die voël het met sy vlerke geslaan,"" option A (Dit het eiers gelê) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""met sy vlerke geslaan"" suggests that something has been hit or struck with force, which could result in an egg breaking. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het in die oprit geparkeer,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Die motorhuis was oop,"" is correct. The word ""oep"" suggests that the parking lot was empty, indicating that there were no cars parked in the area where the speaker parked their car."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die misdadiger het die geweer op sy slagoffer gerig) is more likely to occur. The use of the word ""gerig"" in this context implies a deliberate and intentional act by the perpetrator, rather than an accident or unintentional action. Therefore, it is more likely that the perpetrator will aim their weapon at their victim rather than simply having their hands up."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het beplan om my oom se begrafnis by te woon) is more likely as it makes sense that someone would plan to attend their grandfather's funeral rather than a friend's wedding.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ek het die tyd verloor) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het die tyd verloren"" means ""lost time,"" which suggests that something happened to cause a loss of time. Option B (""Ek was naar"") means ""I went there,"" which does not provide any indication of lost time. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (the printer had low ink) is a more plausible explanation for why the document could not be printed. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die ondersteuners het na die vlag gedraai) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""gespeel in die stadion"" suggests that the national anthem will be performed in a stadium, where fans are likely to gather and sing along with the performer(s). Therefore, it is more probable that the fans will stand up and sing along with the anthem rather than running towards the field."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ek het sout darein gesit) is more likely to be the correct answer as it aligns with the context of the sentence better than option A (Ek het dit bedien).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die handdoek het die vloeistof geabsorbeer) is the more likely outcome. The premise states that the paper towel absorbed the liquid, indicating that it was able to effectively soak up the spill. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Sy het die boek weer gelees) is more likely. The fact that she was in the middle of her book when interrupted suggests that she had been reading it for some time, and therefore would be less likely to simply mark her place and pick up where she left off later. Instead, she would be more likely to start over from the beginning.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Die man het by die venster uitgekyk) is more likely to occur as a result of the turbulence encountered during flight. The passenger may feel anxious or scared due to the sudden drop in altitude, causing them to panic and try to escape through the window.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the girl ignored him) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the boy was scared, but it does not provide any information about why he was scared or how he reacted. Given this lack of information, it is reasonable to assume that the girl simply ignored him rather than resorting to violence.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het haar been geamputeer) is more likely to be the correct answer. The passage states that doctors have given the patient a ""kunslike ledemaat,"" which suggests that they have performed some kind of surgical procedure on the patient's leg. Amputation of a limb is a serious and invasive medical procedure that would only be considered in extreme circumstances, such as when a patient's life or health is at risk due to severe injury or illness. Therefore, it is more likely that the doctors have amputated the patient's leg rather than simply monitoring their vital functions."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sy ruk haar arm van hom af) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""vasgeknyp"" suggests that the boy has a strong grip on her elbow, implying that he may be able to overpower her and pull her away from him. This is in line with the idea of physical force being used against her. Option A (""Sy skud haar skouers vir hom"") does not necessarily imply any kind of physical violence or coercion, but rather a verbal insult or threat."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het sy mening waardeer) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker sought advice from their friend. This response indicates that the speaker values their friend's opinion and seeks their input as a way to validate or confirm their own thoughts and feelings. Option B (Ek het geweet ek was reg) suggests that the speaker already knew what they wanted to do before seeking their friend's advice, which may not be the case in this scenario. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die seun het in die modder getrap,"" option A is more likely. The word ""vasgeval"" means to become stuck or trapped, which fits with the idea of being caught in mud. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Mense het ondergrondswegekruip) is more likely to occur as a result of the snowfall. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the focus is on the impact of the snowfall on people's daily lives, rather than on any other aspect of the weather event. Therefore, it is more likely that people will be affected by the snowfall by having to find alternative routes for their travel or activities, such as going underground, rather than the school being closed due to the snowfall.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die werknemer se skof is verby,"" it is more likely that he left work early. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Die boom het op die dak geval) is the more likely cause of the damage to the house. The phrase ""op die dak geval"" suggests that the tree fell onto the roof of the house, causing damage. This is a more plausible explanation for the damage than option B (Die boom het die agterplaas in skaduwee gehou), which implies that the tree fell behind the house and caused damage from there."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Ek het die hout in die kaggel gestapel) is a more plausible explanation for why the wood was broken than option B (Ek het die byla teen die hout geswaai). This is because the word ""gestapel"" specifically implies that something has been piled up or stacked, which could potentially lead to breaking or crushing of the wood. In contrast, the phrase ""geswaai"" does not provide any specific context or mechanism by which the wood might have been broken. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the couple announced that they are getting divorced) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the couple has made an announcement about their separation, which implies that their relationship has ended. Option B (the couple announced that they are having a baby) does not align with the information provided in the premise and would require additional context or evidence to support it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sy het hom geken) is more likely. The fact that the boy received a valentine's card suggests that he was the recipient of someone else's affection, rather than being the one who sent it himself. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek was verward) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""met my kop geknik"" suggests that the speaker was confused or perplexed by their friend's explanation, rather than agreeing with it. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Hulle wou 'n regverdige besluit neem) is more likely. The fact that they are considering a compromise suggests that they may not be able to reach an agreement, but their willingness to take a decision implies that they are still trying to find a solution.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Die man het die kruideniersware in die yskas gelos) is more likely to happen because it makes sense that a person would take food from a kitchen rather than throwing something out of an open window.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het afgetrok) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the woman has a specific goal in mind, which implies that she has taken deliberate action towards achieving it. Option B (Sy het hard gewerk) does not necessarily imply that the woman took any deliberate actions towards achieving her goal, but rather that she worked hard in general. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sy seun het in regsprobleme beland) is more likely. The phrase ""het van ouderdom gesterf"" suggests that the speaker's son has died due to old age, which implies a natural cause of death rather than an inheritance of wealth. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die vlamme het uitgegaan) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the flame has gone out, indicating a decrease in temperature or intensity of the fire. Option B (Rook het uit die vlamme opgekom) implies an increase in temperature or intensity of the fire, which is less likely based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (her rear wheel is flat) is more likely to be the cause of her difficulty riding her bike. This is because a flat rear tire can make it difficult or impossible for someone to ride their bicycle, while other causes such as a motor accident are less likely given the context of the situation. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het deur my wekker geslaap,"" it is more likely that option A (I have overslept) is correct. The word ""geslaap"" in Afrikaans means to oversleep or sleep too long, which aligns with the context of waking up late. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Kameras het in sy rigtinggeblink) is more likely to be the correct answer. The fact that the public figure has been taken out of the limousine suggests that there may have been some kind of disturbance or incident involving security cameras. Therefore, it is more likely that the cameras captured footage of the event rather than the family attending a press conference.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die badwater het louwarm geword) is more likely. The word ""lank"" suggests that something has become longer or stretched out, which could indicate a decrease in temperature rather than an overflow of water from the bathtub. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Hy het by 'n broederskap aangesluit) is more likely to result in meeting other students on campus. Joining a fraternity or sorority often involves participating in events and activities with other members of the organization, which can provide opportunities to meet new people and make friends.  
Option B (Hy het ingenieurswese as hoofvak gestudeer) may also lead to meeting other students on campus, but it is less likely to result in this outcome due to the specific focus of the student's studies. Ingenieurswese (engineering) is a field that typically requires a high level of specialization and dedication, which may limit the amount of time available for socializing and meeting new people."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek was op soek na los geld) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions ""die bank kussings"" being counted, which suggests that someone is looking for money in a bank. This aligns with Option A, which states that the speaker was searching for loose change. On the other hand, Option B does not make sense in this context as it refers to tidying up a room, which has no relation to finding money in a bank."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Die seun het Weggehardloop) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het na die seun toe geflug"" suggests that something was thrown or flew towards the boy, which could potentially harm him. It is less likely that the boy would have picked a flower while being attacked by an insect."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Sy is in die doodstraf geplaas) is more likely. The premise states that the woman is guilty of a crime, which typically carries a punishment of death in many legal systems. Therefore, it is more probable that she will be sentenced to death rather than being required to perform community service.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the sucker has dissolved) is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy is vir die oorlog opgeroep) is more likely as a cause for his condition. The fact that he has difficulty walking suggests that he may have suffered an injury during warfare, such as a gunshot wound or explosion. This is more plausible than option B (Hy is in 'n geveg beseer), which implies that he was attacked by some kind of creature or monster, which is less common and less likely to result in a foot injury.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Die polisie het die misdadiger gejaag) is more likely to occur. The fact that the police are searching for the criminal suggests that they are actively trying to apprehend them, rather than simply providing support to the victim.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het dit laten val) is more likely as it implies that the speaker intentionally caused the damage to the car. Option B (Ek het dit gelai) suggests that the speaker may have accidentally damaged the car while driving carelessly or recklessly, which does not align with the tone of the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Sy has an extensive wardrobe) is a more plausible explanation for why she no longer had space in her closet. It's unlikely that she would have sold all of her clothes to buy new ones without any left over. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Sy vrou het geboorte gegee) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Die man se hart was gebrek"" suggests that something significant has happened to the person's heart, implying a physical or emotional trauma. Given this context, it makes more sense for the woman to have given birth rather than leaving him, as giving birth would be a life-altering event that could potentially lead to emotional distress or even physical harm. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Sy werksaanbod is regres) is more likely to occur as a result of him not being able to get the job he wanted.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hy het die gehoor gegroet) is more likely. The premise states that the person spoke to the whole room, indicating that they addressed a large group of people directly rather than speaking through a microphone. Therefore, it is more likely that they greeted the audience directly rather than speaking into a microphone.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the munt has sunk to the bottom) is more likely. The premise states that the coin was thrown into the fountain of water, indicating that it was fully submerged in the water. Since coins are denser than water, they will sink when placed in water rather than floating or breaking apart. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the ball went into the hole) is more likely. The premise states that the player hit the ball towards the hole, indicating that it was intended to go into the hole rather than being pulled back by an external force. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het die stof op die zolder ingeasem,"" option A (ek het hik) is the most likely outcome. The word ""hik"" means to throw or fling something, so it suggests that the speaker threw the substance onto the roof. Option B (""gesneeu"") does not fit with the context of the sentence and is therefore less likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the client used false money) is more likely to be the cause of the security breach. The premise states that the client had access to the cash register's security features, indicating that they were able to manipulate or bypass them in some way. This suggests that the client may have intentionally used false money to make it appear as though the transaction was legitimate, rather than simply forgetting their real money. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the security breach.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die vullis het die kombuis sleg laat ruik) is the more likely cause of the problem. The fact that the fridge has been left unplugged for a long time suggests that it was not used regularly, which makes it less likely that the eggs inside would have gone bad due to an accidental spill or other mishap. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that the eggs were simply forgotten and left unattended in the fridge, leading to their spoilage.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the children chased the animals) is more likely. The premise states that the children went to the zoo after school, indicating that they were actively seeking out the animals rather than simply observing them passively. This suggests that the children were excited or curious about the animals and wanted to get closer to them, leading to the possibility of chasing or interacting with them in some way.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy niere het gesak) is a more plausible explanation for why die man se asemhaling was hard. This is because ""gesak"" means ""sneeze,"" so it suggests that the person had difficulty sneezing due to some obstruction or blockage in their nasal passage. Option B (""Sy longe was verstop"") does not provide any specific reason for why the person found it difficult to breathe through their nose, making it less likely as an explanation for this situation."
"Response: 
Option B: Ek het my vriend gefrag of hy belangstel om te gaan. 
Explanation: The premise states that you had an extra ticket for the concert, which implies that someone else was also invited to go with you. Option B better fits this scenario as it suggests that you asked your friend if they were interested in going, rather than simply asking them for advice."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het komberse gebring) is more likely to be the correct answer as it aligns with the context of the sentence. The word ""kombers"" means ""to break"" or ""to shatter"", so it makes sense that the person has brought something broken into the house. Option B does not make as much sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die seun se rug is seer,"" option A is more likely. The word ""rug"" in this context refers to a mat or blanket, so it's unlikely that the young boy would have been swept away by an ocean current. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ek het vir haar 'n koekgebak) is the correct answer. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker bought a cake as a gift for their mother's birthday.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the gardener has buried the daffodils) is a more plausible explanation for why the bulbs have disappeared from the garden. The other option, that echidnas have dug them up, seems less likely as there are no known echidna populations in this area. Therefore, we can conclude that the gardener may have accidentally or intentionally buried the daffodil bulbs while maintaining the garden.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the flame went out) is more likely to occur as it suggests that something happened to extinguish or reduce the flame, whereas option B (the firewood ignited) does not provide any information about what caused the flame to increase.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (they want to restore their personal relationship) is more likely. The fact that they are arguing over a ""skikking"" suggests that there may be an underlying issue or conflict that needs to be addressed before any resolution can occur. It's unlikely that they would simply ignore each other without discussing the matter further, especially if it involves something as important as their personal relationship."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hulle ouers is dood) is the correct answer. The fact that the children are in an orphanage suggests that their parents have passed away, rather than being injured or abused by them.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there was a tsunami. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die stapper het 'n giftige slang teëgekom,"" option A (Sy het uitgedroog) is more likely. The phrase ""giftige slang"" suggests that something harmful or toxic has been encountered, which could cause someone to become weakened or drained of energy. Therefore, it is more likely that person would feel exhausted rather than panicked in this situation."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ek het die oond aan) is a more plausible explanation for why the water is hot. This is because the word ""oond"" means ""water"" in Afrikaans, so it's possible that someone might have accidentally poured hot water into another container or pot instead of cold water. Option B (Ek het die skottel in die oond gesit) doesn't make as much sense in this context, as there is no mention of a skillet being involved."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Die suurlemoen het gesmelt) is more likely to occur. The word ""gesmelt"" means melted in Afrikaans, so it suggests that the large molecules have been broken down into smaller ones, which is a physical process that can happen when something is heated up. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B: Die land het die land gekoloniseer is the most likely outcome. The premise states that the new territory has been discovered, indicating that it is not already inhabited by a different civilization. Therefore, it is more likely that the discovering civilization will colonize the new territory rather than leaving it untouched.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Dit het oor die hele vloergebrek) is a more likely explanation for what happened to the glass. The fact that it broke over the entire floor suggests that it may have been subjected to some kind of impact or stress that caused it to shatter. Option B (Dit het in 'n stapel wasgoed beland) does not provide any specific details about how the glass ended up broken, and does not take into account the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the floor was uneven (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy seun het die waarheid bely) is more likely. The father discovered that his son was lying to him when he found out that his son had stolen money from him. This suggests that the son was not trustworthy and had hidden the truth from his father. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man se kop het van pyn gebars,"" Option A (Hy het hoesstroop geneem) is more likely. The phrase ""van pyngebars"" suggests that the person's head was struck with a blunt object, which could cause a concussion or other injury to the brain. This would lead to confusion and disorientation, rather than simply feeling hungry."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (Dit het die stasie genader) is the most likely cause of the delay. The train has reached the station ahead of schedule, indicating that it is running faster than expected. This suggests that there may be a problem with the train's speed or performance, rather than an issue with the schedule itself. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the delay.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (geestesongesteldheid has been passed down through generations) is a more plausible explanation for why die man het terapie undergone than option B (he was diagnosed with depression). The passage states that ""het family history of mental illness"" suggests that the condition may have been inherited or passed down through generations. This implies that the man's experience of geestesongesteldheid may be related to his genetic makeup rather than simply being caused by external factors such as stress or trauma. In contrast, option B does not provide any specific evidence or reasoning to support the idea that the man was diagnosed with depression. Therefore, based on the available information, it seems more likely that the man's geestesongesteldheid resulted from an inherited predisposition rather than a recent diagnostic label."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she swallowed her tongue (Option A). The phrase ""het haar keel vasgehou"" means ""she held her throat,"" which implies that she tried to stop something from entering her mouth, rather than inserting something into her own throat. Additionally, the phrase ""sy het in haar kos gestik"" means ""she stuck her tongue in her throat,"" which would not be possible if she had already swallowed it. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Haar stem het rasperig geklink) is correct. The use of the word ""rasperig"" suggests a harsh or grating quality to her voice, which aligns with the idea that she had a rough or hoarse throat."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die hond het die sappige biefstuk op die tafel dopgehou,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Dit het gespoeg,"" will occur. The use of the word ""dop"" (meaning ""dropped"") suggests that the dog has dropped something on the table, rather than Option B's ""Dit lê neer,"" which means ""It fell."" Therefore, Option A is a more plausible interpretation of the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Sy has fired her workers) is correct. The passage states that Sy ""besigheid het succes behaal,"" which means she achieved success, but does not provide any indication of how she did so. Given that she fired her workers, this would be a possible explanation for her success. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the clock rang) is more likely as it provides a clear auditory cue that can be heard by the protagonist in the story. The other option (the teacher gave homework) does not provide any sensory information that could have caused the protagonist to leave the classroom. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (her kinship) is more likely. The fact that she claims to have seen a ghost suggests that she has some kind of personal connection or experience with the supernatural, which could be interpreted as evidence of her kinship with it. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A, where her kinsfolk are skeptical of her claim.
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Hy het byna in die see verdrink) is the more likely cause of him losing his hearing. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that he almost drowned in the sea rather than being involved in an explosion. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die ballon het leeggegooi) is more likely to occur as it implies that the balloon has deflated or emptied out. The other option, Option B (Die ballon het in die lug opgestaan), suggests that the balloon has risen into the air, which does not align with the given premise. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hy het 'n beroerte gehad) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het sy spraakvermoë verloren"" suggests a sudden and severe loss of speech abilities, which could be caused by a brain injury or stroke, rather than simply feeling deeply depressed."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (there was a crack in the concrete) is more likely to be the correct answer. The mention of ""die sypaadjie"" (the sidewalk) and ""die sement"" (the cement) suggests that the event occurred outdoors and involved physical infrastructure, which aligns with the possibility of a crack or fissure forming in the concrete due to age or wear and tear. In contrast, Option B (they heard their name being called) does not fit as well with the given information, as it implies an auditory stimulus rather than a visual one."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Die lewensredder het agter hom aan ingespring) is more likely to occur because it implies that the person who threw the canonball was able to escape danger by jumping into the water behind them. This suggests that they were able to react quickly and effectively to the situation, making option A the most plausible outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ek het antibiotika geneem,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""My infeksie het verdwyn."" This is because taking antibiotics can help to treat an infection by killing or stopping the growth of the bacteria causing it, leading to its disappearance."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die verkeer lig het geel geword,"" it is more likely that Option A (the driver pressed the brakes) occurred. The phrase ""het op die rem gedruk"" means ""pressed the brakes,"" indicating that the driver took action to slow down or stop the vehicle. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (ek het die houer in warm water geweek) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""gesmelt"" implies that the plastic has been melted, which can only occur through heating it above its melting point. Heating the plastic in warm water would not result in smelting, but rather softening or warming of the material. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how the plastic holder was damaged."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the driver crashed into a phone pole) is the correct answer. The phrase ""gebrek"" means ""broken"" or ""damaged,"" so it suggests that the car may have been damaged in some way during the accident. Additionally, the mention of a ""telefoonpaal"" specifically refers to a phone pole, which further supports this option."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hy het die eksamen gemis) is correct. The premise states that the young man has studied for the entire night, implying that he may have overslept or missed the exam entirely. This outcome is more plausible than him having passed the exam, as there is no additional information to suggest that he would have done well in the exam.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy was bang om te leer swem) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het aan die rand van die swembadvasgeklou"" suggests that the person was hesitant or afraid to enter the pool, rather than being in a life-threatening situation. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (My hartklop het vinniger geword) is a more likely response. The use of ""het"" instead of ""gevoel"" in this option suggests that the speaker's heart has become stronger or faster, which aligns with the physical sensation described in the premise. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (My kantoor was oorvol) is correct. The word ""gebou"" means ""building"", so ""my kantoor was in aanbou"" can be translated to ""my office was under construction"". Therefore, option A is a plausible interpretation of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die gesin het die bure vir aandete genooi) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary suggest that the children are intentionally seeking out new books to read, rather than simply passing by them without noticing.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the swimmer has been thrown into the pool) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het uit die swembad gestort"" means ""has been thrown into the pool,"" indicating that the swimmer was not swimming in the pool but rather was thrown or pushed into it. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het per ongeluk 'n saadjie ingesluk) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""in 'n stukkie waatlemoen"" suggests that something has happened suddenly or unexpectedly, which aligns better with Option A than Option B (""Ek het per ongeluk my tandgebrek"")."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Sy baadjie was oopgesluit) is the more likely cause of the situation described in the question. The word ""baadjie"" suggests that something has been knocked or struck, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as an object falling or being dropped. In contrast, Option B (Sy skoenvaters was los) does not provide any context to suggest why sy's baadjie might have been lost. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sy is door geraas afgelei) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman has an ear plug in her ear. This is because ""geraas"" (noise) is a common reason why people might insert something into their ears to block out sound. On the other hand, option B (Sy het haar ore deurboor) does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no indication that the woman's ear was actually pierced. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het al die water darein gedronk) is the more likely cause for why the speaker's water bottle is empty. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dit het vulgêre taal bevat) is a more plausible explanation for why the television program was cancelled. The use of coarse language may have been offensive or inappropriate for some viewers, leading to complaints and ultimately the cancellation of the show.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Die bemanning het verdrink) occurred. The phrase ""het vergaan"" means ""to sink,"" indicating that the crew of the ship may have drowned or died at sea. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened to the crew than Option B (Die bemanning het seerowers teëgekom), which means ""The crew has been rescued."""
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hy het die raaisel opgelos) is more likely. The premise suggests that the sun has caused something to dissolve, which implies a chemical reaction or change in state, rather than simply asking for a hint. Therefore, it is more likely that the sun has actually dissolved the rock rather than just asking for a hint about how to do so.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die telefoon het gebel,"" option A is more likely. The word ""gebel"" in Afrikaans means ""hung."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person hung up the phone rather than picked it up."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die vrou het na my gekyk,"" option B is more likely. The use of the word ""het"" (had) in the sentence suggests that the action of looking at her has already occurred, implying a past event. This implies that the speaker experienced discomfort or unease after being looked at by the woman, rather than embracing her. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hulle het foto's van die uitstallings geneem) is more likely. The group left the museum with photos of the exhibits, indicating that they were interested in documenting their visit rather than simply viewing the exhibits without taking any souvenirs.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (My vriend het my aan die man voorgestel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""voorgestel"" means ""proposed,"" so it suggests that someone else suggested the idea to your friend rather than your friend coming up with it themselves. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how you came to start studying Dutch."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het lug in die band géén pomp) is a more plausible explanation for why the band on my bike was flat than option B (Ek het ratte op die fiets geskakel). This is because ""lug"" means to pump up or inflate something, so it makes sense that if the band on your bike was flat, you might need to pump it up again. On the other hand, ""skakel"" means to shake or tremble, so it's less clear how this would cause the band on your bike to become flat. Therefore, option A is the better answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Haar pa het vir haar 'n storie gelees) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""het bleek gelyk"" suggests that something unexpected or surprising has happened, and the fact that her father read her a story implies that he did something nice for her. Option B (Haar pa het haar voorkop aangeraak) does not fit with this interpretation and seems less likely given the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het 'n potlood gebruik) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of a pen without ink suggests that the speaker may not have access to a writing instrument with ink, which could make it difficult for them to sign their name.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die man se lening is geweier,"" option A (Hy was in die skuld) is more likely. The phrase ""geweier"" implies that something has been borrowed or lent, which suggests that the person had already taken out a loan. This aligns with Option A, where it states that the person was in debt. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sy het waterpokkies gehad) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the girl did not go to school, implying that she may have had other activities or experiences that occupied her time instead of attending school. Having a pet is one such activity that could take up a significant amount of time and attention, making it more plausible than learning mathematics.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ek het dit na die vullisbak geneem) occurred. The phrase ""na die vullisbak"" suggests that the speaker took the food from the fridge after cleaning it, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (My kamermaat het punch gemors) is the correct answer. The phrase ""het punch gemors"" suggests a loud noise or disturbance, which could be caused by someone hitting something or making a lot of noise. It does not provide any indication of a lost dog. Therefore, Option A is the most likely explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Hy het sy rekenaar afgeskakel) is more likely. The phrase ""het sy rekenaar afgeskakel"" means ""lost their calculator,"" which suggests that the person may have misplaced or lost something important to them, such as a calculator. This is a more plausible explanation for why someone might feel upset than Option B (""hy het 'n stoel oor die kamer gegooi""), which means ""he threw a chair across the room."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the takkie has burned) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""het 'n takkie in die kampvuur gegooi"" implies that something was thrown into a fire, and since fires typically produce heat and flames, it's unlikely that the fire would have gone out without any external intervention. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the warm water was gone) caused the problem. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Hulle het hulle kinders aangemoedig om buite te speel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the parents want their children to go to university, but they are not able to save enough money for tuition fees. Therefore, it is more likely that they would encourage their children to play outside to earn extra money rather than start a savings fund for education.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die skoene het los geword) is more likely. The word ""los"" in this context means ""lost"", so it's more likely that the shoe has simply come undone rather than being torn or cut off."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het die oorblyfsels in die yskas gesit) is more likely. The phrase ""het die helfte van die vorige dag geëet"" implies that someone has eaten a meal from the previous day, which suggests that they have leftovers. This is consistent with the idea of storing food in a fridge or freezer to preserve it for later use. On the other hand, ""gespaar"" means ""to save,"" which does not necessarily imply that something was already consumed. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het ys daarop gesit) is a more likely explanation for what happened to your enkel than option B (Ek het lotion daarop geruik). This is because ""geswel"" means ""swollen"" in Afrikaans, so it suggests that your elbow may have become swollen or inflamed due to some reason. On the other hand, ""geruik"" means ""smelled"", so it's less likely that you would smell something on your elbow unless there is an underlying issue causing the swelling. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ek het met my kollega by my lessenaar gepraat) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""by my lessenaar"" suggests that the speaker had a conversation with their colleague at their desk or workplace, rather than in a separate room."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ek het gaan sit) is more likely to occur than option B (Ek het 'n tydskrif deurgekyk). This is because sitting is a more common and practical activity for a person compared to reading a whole book quickly.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Die vlieg hetweggebuig) is more likely to occur because it implies that the fly will move away from the touch.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hy was besig om te sterf) is correct. The fact that he wrote a will suggests that he was aware of his impending death and wanted to make arrangements for after his passing.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hy het sy tempo versnel) is more likely. The phrase ""het gevoel dat sy mededingers hom inhaal"" suggests that the speaker feels like they are being left behind or overtaken by their competitors, which could lead them to speed up their pace in order to catch up."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ek het 'n oplossing gekry) is more likely. The speaker has already come up with a solution to the problem, indicating that they have taken action to address it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die reisiger het op die wankelrige hangbrug geloop,"" it is more likely that hy was in ecstasy (Option B). The use of the word ""wankel"" suggests a sense of instability or uncertainty, which could be heightened by the experience of walking on a swaying bridge. This would likely create a feeling of fear or anxiety rather than euphoria or ecstasy."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hy het sy vriende ontmoet om na die wedstryd te kyk) is more likely. The phrase ""hy het sy vriende ontmoet"" suggests that the speaker will meet with friends to discuss or watch the race, rather than making a wager with them."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hy het sy wekker ingestel) is more likely. The phrase ""die seun kon nie aan die slaap raak nie"" suggests that the child was unable to fall asleep, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as being overtired or having trouble relaxing in bed. It is less likely that the child would have created a creature, as this would require a level of cognitive ability and imagination that may not be typical for a young child."
