Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he was drunk) is a more likely cause for his state of being passed out in the bathroom. The fact that he was found in a bathtub filled with water suggests that he may have been unconscious or unable to move due to alcohol intoxication. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (لقد أفرغت جيوبي) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""لقد أفرغت جيوبي"" means ""I have forgotten my password,"" indicating that the speaker has difficulty remembering their login information. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the white ant has disappeared from the house) is true. The phrase ""ghazt al-nimal al-abya"" suggests that something has happened to the ants in the house, implying that they are no longer present or have left the area. This is supported by the fact that the word ""ghazt"" means ""to disappear"" or ""to vanish."" Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response: أكثر  LIKELIHOOD ليس Option A (The customer's journey to the border).
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the customer will face difficulties during their journey to the border due to the closure of borders. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A: لقد كانت عطلة (There was a break)
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there was a break or interruption in the office rather than it being summer. The use of the past tense ""كان"" (kana) suggests that the event occurred in the past, and the phrase ""لقد كانت عطلة"" specifically implies that something happened to interrupt or disrupt the office's operations. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: لعبت الداما (Option A)
Explanation: The phrase ""من الفتاة"" in the premise indicates that the girl has lost her energy or vitality, suggesting that she may have been overworked or exhausted. Option A, ""لعبت الداما,"" means ""she was tired,"" which aligns with this interpretation of the premise. Therefore, option A is a more likely cause for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (more people entered the class) is a more likely cause for the woman's disappearance from her seat. The passage states that ""the room was full of students,"" indicating that there were many people present in the classroom at the time the woman disappeared. This suggests that it is unlikely that she simply got up and left without anyone noticing, as Option B implies. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the girl pressed her finger into her own nose) caused the bleeding than option B (the child hit his head). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the audience listened to the music in silence) is more likely. The premise highlights the success of the band's music, suggesting that they have a strong following and their fans are eager to listen to their work. In this context, it is more likely that the audience would listen to the music in silence rather than trying to sing along with the band during their performance.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the girl stayed after school for extracurricular activities) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the girl wanted to thank her PE teacher, which suggests that she had a positive experience in the class and wants to express gratitude. Staying after school for extracurricular activities is a common way for students to spend time with their teachers outside of regular classes, so it's more likely that the girl would do this rather than bringing the teacher flowers during class hours.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the warden informed them of the situation) is more likely. The text states that ""الشباب المخيم شعروا بالخوف,"" indicating that they were afraid, which suggests that they had received some information or warning about the situation. It does not make sense that they would have started a fire themselves without any prior knowledge or reason to do so. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for their actions."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (he has suffered a concussion) is more likely. The phrase ""ضرب رأسه"" (hit his head) suggests that the man may have experienced a traumatic injury to his brain, leading to a concussion or other forms of brain damage. This is supported by the mention of ""صدمة دماغية"" (a blow to the head), which specifically refers to a type of injury that can cause brain damage. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
Response:  Option B: لقد استحققت زيادة في الراتب (You have already increased your salary)
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (he deleted the spam email) occurred. The reason being that the premise states that the man's inbox was filled with unwanted emails, indicating that he may have taken steps to clear out his inbox, including deleting any spam messages. Option B (he sent an electronic message to a group) does not align with this scenario as it implies that he sent a message to a specific group of people, rather than simply cleaning out his inbox.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option B (Likely to recover from the illness) is the more likely cause of the man's condition. The passage states that ""the sea was in his bones,"" indicating that he had a chronic or long-term illness rather than a recent injury. Additionally, the phrase ""he recovered"" suggests that the man's condition improved over time, which is consistent with Option B. Therefore, the answer is option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She had forgotten that she wrote it) is more likely. The premise states that the girl forgot that she wrote the note, indicating a lack of memory or forgetfulness, which aligns with option A. Option B (She had written it for herself) does not fit well with the premise as there is no indication in the text that the girl wrote the note for her own benefit.
"Response: 
Option B: أصبح الكأس ممتلئًا.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""الماء سكبت الماء"", it is more likely that the water has risen to fill the cup rather than the cup becoming lighter. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (he wanted to offer support) is more likely. The fact that he stayed silent when his friend was talking suggests that he may have been trying to show empathy or understanding rather than simply thinking about his words.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (شعرت بالذنب) is more likely. The phrase ""شعرت بالذنب"" means ""I felt guilty,"" indicating that the person experienced a negative emotion after making a mistake. Option B (""لقد رفعت تهم"") means ""I already had a feeling of guilt,"" suggesting that the person was experiencing guilt beforehand, rather than feeling it for the first time after making a mistake. Therefore, option A is the better fit based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the provided information, option B (there was a missing episode in the series) is more likely to be the cause of the confusion. The statement ""السلسلة انفصلت"" (the series has been cut off) suggests that there are gaps or missing episodes in the series, which could explain why some viewers are confused about the plot. Therefore, option B is the better answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They have been brainwashed) is more likely. The couple's sudden change in belief without any logical explanation suggests that they may have been influenced by an external factor such as brainwashing. This is a common tactic used by cults or extremist groups to manipulate individuals and alter their beliefs. Therefore, option A is the most plausible cause for the couple's sudden shift in ideology.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I have witnessed in court) is more likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he has packed his big coat) is more likely. The man expects cold weather in his journey, so he would pack a warm coat to prepare for it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he raised his hand) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the man's eyes are watering) is a more likely cause than option B (he has placed thoughts in his eyes). The premise explicitly states that the man's eyes are watering, indicating that there may be an irritant or allergen present that is causing this reaction. It does not suggest that he has intentionally placed thoughts in his eyes. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B ( Khamsa will feel regret for her actions ) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the student did not understand the lesson (Option A). The phrase ""he has forgotten"" suggests that the student's memory of the material is lacking, rather than the student providing incorrect answers (Option B)."
"Response:  Option B: لقد نفذ مني التنفس (My anger has taken over)
Explanation: The sentence ""لقد نفذ مني التنفس"" means ""My anger has taken over"", which suggests that the speaker's emotions have become uncontrollable and have taken over their thoughts and actions. This aligns with the premise of the situation, where the speaker feels like they are unable to stop themselves from speaking or acting impulsively due to their anger. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she put him in the microwave (Option A). The phrase ""الأطعمة المجمدة"" can be translated to ""the full stomach,"" indicating that the person was already feeling satisfied or content beforehand. Additionally, the mention of ""الميكروويف"" specifically suggests that the action took place in a kitchen setting, where a microwave oven would typically be found. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why her baby died."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he was experiencing symptoms of a cold) is the correct answer. The phrase ""موظف تظاهر بالمرض"" suggests that the employee was showing signs of illness, which aligns with option A. Option B does not provide any context or evidence to support the idea that the employee wanted to take a day off for personal reasons. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She fell into the pool) is a more likely cause than option B (She jumped from the balcony). The phrase ""سقطت الفتاة في المسبح"" (She fell into the pool) implies that she was not intentionally jumping or falling from any height but rather accidentally fell into the water. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the film received bad reviews) is more likely to be the cause of the movie's poor performance at the box office.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (الناس عزلته) is more likely to occur because it implies that people have lost their weight due to some reason or another, rather than gaining weight as implied in option B (الناس أمدحوه).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she wrote a letter) caused her hands to cramp up. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the audience was shocked) is more likely to occur. The actor's sudden transformation into a different person while riding a rollercoaster would likely cause surprise and confusion among the audience members.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (My friend made me wait) is more likely. The use of the word ""صبري"" (my patience) suggests that the speaker has been waiting for something or someone, and the phrase ""جعلني أنتظر"" (made me wait) implies that this was done intentionally by their friend. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's patience has run out."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They have developed new weapons) is more likely to occur. The fact that several countries are involved in a war suggests that they may be developing new weapons to gain an advantage over their enemies. This is supported by the statement ""الدول المتحاربة أرادت السلام,"" which implies that these countries want peace but cannot achieve it through conventional means, leading them to develop new weapons."
Response: أصبح نائماً (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She has already been injured) is more likely. The premise states that the woman was hit by a car, indicating that she may have sustained injuries as a result. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome.
Response: لقد انفجرت البالونة (Option A)
Response: أكثر التعاون يختلف بين Option A (لقد فكّروا حقائبهم) و Option B (ذهبوا إلى المطار).
Response: لقد ع�ست في الخوخ (Option A)
"Response: أصبحت يداي لزجة (Option A)
Explanation: The text states that the speaker's hand has become a snake, indicating that they have transformed into a reptile. This is an impossible transformation for a human to undergo, making option A the most likely answer."
Response:  Option A: The door has been opened.
"Response:  Option A (the products were tested to ensure quality).
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the products were tested to ensure their quality rather than being manufactured by children's labor. The phrase ""to ensure the quality of the products"" suggests a focus on testing and inspection, which aligns with option A. In contrast, option B does not fit well with the given information as it implies direct involvement of children in the manufacturing process, which is unlikely. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (جرذ زحف من الحائط) is more likely to occur. The word ""ظح"" in Arabic means ""to dig"" or ""to excavate"", so it's possible that the speaker has dug a hole in the ground. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (her sister was happy) is more likely to be the cause of her mother's feeling guilty. The premise states that the woman felt guilty because she had a good time without her sister, implying that her sister was not present or did not participate in the activity with her. Therefore, it is more likely that her sister was happy and enjoying herself elsewhere, rather than launching something.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (“لقد ارتديت المئزر”) is more likely to occur. The phrase “النبيذ على قميصي” suggests that a person has been bitten by an adder, which can cause severe pain and swelling. The sentence “لقد ارتديت المئزر” means “I have been stung by the adder,” indicating that the person has already experienced the effects of the snakebite. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The thief has hidden his money) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: الناس أعطوه التغيير (People have changed).
Explanation: The premise suggests that people have been influenced by the street musicians' performances, leading to a change in their behavior or attitude towards music. This implies that Option A, where people have changed, is more likely to occur."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he has lost his parents) is a more likely cause for the little boy's tears than option B (it was time for his nap). The loss of loved ones can be a significant source of emotional distress for children, and it is plausible that the little boy in the scenario is grieving over the loss of his parents.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the pilot controls the plane through the storm) is more likely. The phrase ""رصد عاصفة"" (monitoring the storm) suggests that the pilot is actively navigating the plane through a severe weather condition, rather than simply flying away from it. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the trees' roots will intertwine with each other) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the boy decided to play a game of chess with his friend) is more likely. The premise mentions that the boy was in a good mood, which suggests that he might have been inclined towards engaging in an activity that he enjoys, such as playing chess with his friend. Option B (the boy decided to perform a magic trick on his friend) does not align with this inference, as it implies a more elaborate and potentially showy act rather than a simple game of chess.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (giving him a drink) is more likely to happen as it aligns with the child's request for water. Option B (stopping at a rest stop) does not directly address the child's request or provide an explanation for why he cannot go to the beach.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the fish swam away from the shore (Option A). The phrase ""السمكة سبحت نحو الطعام"" means ""the fish swam away,"" while ""قفزت السمكة من الحوض"" means ""the fish jumped out of the water."" Therefore, Option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (she participated in an protest) is more likely to have influenced her political views. The premise suggests that she has changed her perspective on politics due to recent events, which aligns with the idea of participating in a protest or activism. Option A (she no longer identifies with the party) does not necessarily imply a change in political views, but rather a shift in affiliation.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“لقد فتحت الصنبور”) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase “فتحت الصنبور” means “opened the tap,” indicating that water is flowing out of it. This suggests that the sink is not clogged or blocked, but rather that the tap has been turned on intentionally or accidentally. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the sink is draining slowly than option B (“لقد سكبتُ فيه منظف الصرف”), which implies that something is blocking the drain.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the plane landed at the airport) caused the car to move. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the man pressed the wet side of the towel) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the man applied pressure to one side of the towel, causing it to become wet. Option A (he put a label on the dry side) does not align with this interpretation.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (they have lost contact with each other) is a more likely cause for their disappearance than option B (they moved to different cities). The passage states that they were all close friends who used to meet regularly, but now they have lost touch with each other. This suggests that there was a breakdown in communication or a disruption in their social circle, rather than a deliberate decision to move away from each other. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for their disappearance.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (She has been fired from her job) is more likely to be the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option A: سمعت الساعة تدق (I heard the clock tick)
Explanation: The correct answer is Option A because it better fits the context of the sentence. ""سمعت"" means ""heard,"" and ""الساعة"" means ""the clock."" Therefore, the speaker is saying that they heard the clock ticking. This makes sense in the context of the sentence, as the speaker is trying to explain why they are late. In contrast, Option B does not make much sense in this context, as there is no clear reason for the speaker to want to check the time if they were already aware of it."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B (“I and my spouse have been arguing a lot lately”) is the correct cause of the writer’s hand cramp. This is because the premise mentions that the writer has been experiencing this problem recently, which suggests that it may be related to their personal life or emotional state rather than any physical activity such as typing.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (the key has been changed) is the more likely cause of the problem. The passage states that ""the locksmith had replaced the key,"" indicating that a new key was used to unlock the door. This suggests that the issue with the lock may have been caused by the use of an incorrect or damaged key rather than any problem with the lock itself. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the couple will move into the apartment (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I thought I saw a light) is more likely to be the correct answer. The woman in the scenario is outside during sunset, which means she would have seen the sky turning orange or red due to the setting sun. It's unlikely that she would mistake this for a light source, especially since there are no other details provided about the light. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the woman was confused.
"Response:  Option B: The water was polluted.
Explanation: According to the premise, the man could not swim in the sea because it was polluted. This suggests that option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (the woman accidentally pressed the backspace button) is more likely to be the cause of losing the text. Therefore, the answer is (B).
"Response:  Option B: لقد فازت بمسابقة (She won a competition)
Explanation: The text states that the woman has ""won a competition,"" indicating that she achieved something positive and impressive. This contradicts option A, where it says she obtained a low degree, implying something negative or unimpressive. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (The trees were wet with dew) is a more likely cause for why the grass was green at night. The passage states that ""the grass was green,"" indicating that it was not wet or covered in dew. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the woman stayed at a hotel) is the correct cause. The sentence ""لقد نمت المرأة"" means ""The woman has slept,"" indicating that she spent the night somewhere. Option B (""you forgot to set the alarm clock"") does not provide any evidence or context that would suggest why the woman did not wake up on time. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the woman overslept."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (sitting in the shade) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The man wants to avoid the heat of the sun, so sitting in the shade would provide him relief from the heat. Going to the beach (option B) may not necessarily help him escape the heat as he might still feel warm even near the coastal area.
"Response:  Based on the given text, option B (and before the theoretical researchers) is more likely. The passage states that ""the researchers have already proven their theory,"" indicating that they have conducted successful experiments to support their hypothesis. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would retract their findings or change their minds about their theory without any new evidence or compelling reasons."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (المباراة ذهبت إلى المتابعة) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that the match was postponed due to a security concern, rather than a decision made by the judge. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (she has locked the door) is correct. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (giving the father some money) is more likely to happen as a result of the situation described in the story.
"Response: 
Option A: جمعت الثلج في كرة ثلج.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the snow blocked the path, indicating that Option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the cat reached the shore) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the action of reaching the shore was successful, whereas option B (the waves carried the cat) implies a less direct and more uncertain outcome.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (She had a stroke) is more likely to occur as it implies that the girl's condition has deteriorated significantly, leading to a loss of control over her body functions. Option A (She fainted) does not convey the same level of severity in the girl's condition.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The water has reached my skin) is more likely to occur than option B (I felt a cold breeze above me). This is because the premise mentions ""the water"" reaching the speaker's skin, indicating that they are in contact with liquid water, whereas feeling a cold breeze does not necessarily imply being near water."
"Response:  Option A: لقد كانا مبللين (We were already asleep)
Explanation: The sentence ""لقد كانا مبللين"" means ""we were already sleeping"", which suggests that they had been in a state of deep relaxation or unconsciousness before being awakened by the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for their arrival at the beach."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The water has flowed out of the basin) is more likely. The fact that the water has been drained from the basin suggests that it may have overflown or leaked out, rather than being absorbed into the ground as suggested by option B (The water has percolated into the earth).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (اعترف بخيانته لها) is more likely to occur. The husband's realization of his own guilt and responsibility towards his wife's happiness will lead him to apologize and make amends, rather than blaming her for her unhappiness.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (“I waited until the water boiled”) is a more plausible explanation for why there are bubbles on the tongue than option B (“The water has already been spilled on the mirror”). This is because waiting until the water boils would allow enough time for the water to reach its boiling point and produce steam, which could then rise up onto the tongue and create the sensation of bubbles. In contrast, option B does not provide any logical explanation for how the bubbles got onto the tongue. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had a cold) is the correct answer. The phrase ""كان لديه كابوس"" suggests that he had a common cold, which can cause nasal congestion and difficulty breathing. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the child was snoring."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the child sat on his father's lap) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he has already spoken his name) is the correct answer. The passage states that he ""has been talking about himself,"" implying that he has already mentioned his name at some point during the conversation. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the citizens revolted) is more likely to occur. The government's suppression of dissent has led to increased frustration among citizens, which could potentially boil over into widespread protests or even violence. This scenario aligns with the premise provided.
Response: لقد أقام خيمة (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (I wanted to learn about other cultures) is more likely. The premise mentions that the woman traveled abroad, indicating that she was interested in exploring new places and experiences outside of her own culture. This aligns with option B, which suggests that she wanted to learn about different cultures. Option A (I wanted to learn how to draw) does not fit as well with the premise, as it does not mention anything about traveling or learning about other cultures.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (زميله في العمل عمل متأخراً) is the more likely cause. The man's colleague at work has been working for a long time, indicating that he may have gained experience and knowledge in his field, which could be the reason why he was able to get promoted.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he had hallucinations) is a more likely cause for why he saw two men fighting in his dream. Hallucinations are a common symptom of various mental health conditions such as schizophrenia or psychosis, and can also be caused by certain medication or drugs. Therefore, it is more plausible that the man's experience was due to an underlying medical condition rather than him simply daydreaming or fantasizing.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the man's beard has become thicker) is a more likely cause for his hair to have grown longer than before. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (You have already created a new work) is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he left his home due to being drafted into the army (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the books were blown away by a strong gust of wind) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""سقطت الكتب من على الرف"" suggests that the books were lifted off the ground and blown away by some external force, rather than being swept away by water or another liquid substance. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response: لقد أشعلت الضوء (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he seemed afraid) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the man's behavior was unusual and caused concern, indicating that he may have been afraid or nervous about something. Option B (he seemed happy) does not align with the information provided in the premise and is therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the kettle's whistling started) is a more likely cause for the tea to spill than option B (the microwave exploded). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the strong gusts of wind) is more likely to cause a tree branch to fall onto the power line. The phrase ""توقعت التنبؤات الرياح القوية"" implies that the wind is strong enough to cause significant impact, which aligns with Option B. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the audience has been offended) is more likely. The speaker's use of inaccurate information to make a point undermines their credibility and could potentially offend or alienate their audience.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“My soul has been parched by the heat”) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase “قطرة عرق” (qutrah ‘arq) means “parched,” indicating that the speaker’s soul has been affected by the heat. Option B (“A drop of blood fell onto my face”) does not fit with the context of the sentence and is therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the whale died from drowning (Option B). The phrase ""السمكة طافت على سطح الحوض"" translates to ""the whale was floating on the surface of the water,"" indicating that the whale's body was found in a state of decomposition after death. This suggests that the whale did not die recently, as there would be no visible signs of decay if it had only been dead for a short time. Therefore, Option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he was suffering from a cold) is the correct answer. The phrase ""صوت الرجل بدا غاضباً"" suggests that the man's voice was hoarse due to a cold or flu, rather than having stopped smoking."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The ladder reached the designated spot) is more likely to be the correct cause. The premise states that the ladder ""ftched"" or reached a specific location, indicating that it was able to reach its intended destination. This suggests that the ladder was able to climb up to the designated spot without any obstruction or interference from other objects in the room. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (the child lied about their father) is the correct cause. The fact that the teacher asked the student to explain why they think their father would make such a claim suggests that there may be some suspicion or doubt regarding the student's explanation, which could indicate that the student fabricated the story.
"Response: 
Option A: المرحاض فاض (The water tank burst)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the water tank burst caused the flooding in the building rather than the sinkhole. The phrase ""حمام الفيضانات"" specifically refers to a water tank or reservoir, suggesting that the source of the flood is internal to the building rather than an external factor like a sinkhole. Additionally, the mention of ""المرحاض فاض"" (the water tank burst) in the premise further supports this conclusion."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the owner put a rope around the dog's neck) is more likely. The phrase ""بقي بالقرب"" suggests that the dog is close to its owner, implying that the owner has some control over it. Option B (""the owner left the dog on the leash"") does not fit with this context as it implies that the owner intentionally left the dog unattended. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why the dog did not move away from its owner."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the man stopped under the extended tree) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the man was ""under"" the tree, indicating that he was located beneath it, which supports option A. Option B (the man stopped above the muddy lake) does not fit with the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (she has accepted his invitation for dinner) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the dog ran away from home) is the correct cause for their disappearance. The fact that the family's valuables are still intact suggests that they did not take anything with them when they left, and the mention of ""their"" house implies that they were living there at some point. Therefore, it seems more plausible that the dog simply wandered off or got lost rather than being taken by someone else."
"Response: 
Option A: The weather was cold.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""رأيت أنفاسي عندما أخرجت"", it is more likely that the cause of feeling chilly is due to the cold weather rather than a tight dress. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the employees formed a union to demand better working conditions (Option A). This is because the phrase ""شكّلوا نقابة"" suggests that they took collective action to address their grievances, rather than simply hoping for improved working conditions or expecting their employer to raise their wages without any effort on their part."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (رائحة العفن ملأت المطبخ) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""خبزت فطيرة"" means that a pot of food has been boiled over, indicating that the food has been cooked for too long or at too high a temperature, resulting in a burnt or overcooked taste. This suggests that the smell of burned food is more likely to emanate from the kitchen."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She was running away from a high-rise building) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""كانت ترتدي حذاء عالي الكعب"" can be translated to ""She was running away from a high-rise building,"" indicating that she was escaping something or someone in a tall structure. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: لقد غطيت الوعاء (Already filled up)
Explanation: According to the premise, the water level has risen above its normal level, indicating that the sea has flooded the land. This means that the water level has increased, not decreased, as suggested in option A. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The cat has been in the washing machine) is more likely. The phrase ""كل جواربي كانت في الغسيل"" means ""All cats have been in the washing machine,"" implying that it's a common or expected occurrence for cats to be in the washing machine. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he has been accused of corruption) is more likely to be the effect.
"Response: أصبح الزوجان حاملاً (Option A)
Explanation: The premise states that everyone rejected their marriage proposal, which means they are not married yet. Option A is more likely because if they were already married, it would be unnecessary to reject a proposal for them to get married again."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the millionaire wants to destroy the building) is more likely. The premise states that the building was designated for a specific purpose, implying that it has value or significance. Destroying the building would be an unusual action for someone who values their property, so it is more plausible that the millionaire wants to preserve the building rather than harm it.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the salesman sees the girl putting something in her bag) is more likely to be the correct cause. The salesman's observation of the girl placing an item in her bag suggests that she may have stolen something, which aligns with the initial premise. In contrast, option B (assisting the salesgirl in finding the lost item) does not directly address the issue of theft or provide a clear explanation for why the salesman would suspect the girl of stealing.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (the soldiers were not included in the evacuation) is more likely to occur. The statement ""الدولة الحرب على الأراضي المجاورة"" implies that a state of war has been declared over the disputed territories, suggesting that military action will be taken. Given this context, it is less likely that civilians would be included in an evacuation effort."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the two witnesses swapping places) is more likely to cause a miscarriage of justice in the courtroom. This is because by switching positions, they can manipulate the evidence and create confusion among the judges and lawyers, leading to an incorrect verdict.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She took the cake from the jar) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the action of taking something from a container is being described, which aligns better with Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (العاصفة ازدادت سوءاً) is more likely to occur. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the storm caused damage, which aligns with option A. Option B (لقد هرعت للدخول) does not fit as well with the given information.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option B: إنذار الحريق انطلق will occur. This is because there are flammable materials nearby, such as the building's contents, and an ignition source (the fire) has been introduced to the scene. The likelihood of a fire spreading quickly through the building and causing significant damage increases with each passing moment. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate response based on the given circumstances.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur, i.e., the father will buy his son a bike. This is because the premise states that the father is generous towards his son, indicating that he would be willing to spend money on him. Option B, where the father throws his son out of the house, goes against this characterization of the father as generous and loving towards his son.
"Response: أ) السكرتيرة ذهبت للمنزل لهذا اليوم
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the lawyer went to her office for this day because she has a lot of work to do there. The other option does not make sense in this context as the car was not broken down."
"Response:  Option B: صديقه اشترى له الغداء.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the man's friend became rich overnight, which means that he must have invested his money wisely or started a successful business. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the friend bought him dinner as a way of showing appreciation for his friendship."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the guard did not notice that he gave the girl the money) is more likely to occur. The reason for this is that the wording of the premise suggests that the guard was distracted or not paying attention when giving the money to the girl, which increases the likelihood that he may have overlooked the fact that he gave her all his money.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the woman was placed in a coma) is the correct cause. The phrase ""was placed in a coma"" suggests a deliberate action taken to induce unconsciousness, rather than an accident or injury sustained while traveling to the hospital. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why the woman is unable to move her body."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the country was facing economic difficulties) is more likely to be the cause of the citizens' lack of interest in national education. The premise states that the citizens have withdrawn from their national identity, indicating a disconnection or disinterest in things related to their country. Economic difficulties can lead to feelings of hopelessness and disillusionment among citizens, causing them to turn away from national issues and focus on more immediate concerns such as making ends meet. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They have disappointed the fans) is more likely. The phrase ""خسر البطولة"" (lost the championship) suggests that the team did not win the competition they were participating in, which would naturally lead to fan disappointment."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (شعرت بالحرج) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that (A) he was not paying attention in class. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the crime rate has increased in the city) is a more plausible explanation for why the building collapsed in the middle of the city. The increase in criminal activity could have led to a weakening of the structure's foundation or caused it to become unstable, ultimately leading to its collapse. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She has cut off all ties with him) is more likely. This implies that she no longer wants to be in contact or have any relationship with him, which could be due to various reasons such as a breakup or a falling out. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (their heads have collided) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (there was a weak spot in the sail) is more likely to be the cause of the shipwreck. The premise states that the ship's hull was breached by a rock, indicating that there may have been a weakness or vulnerability in the sail that allowed it to be damaged. Option B (the sail was from the same batch as the ship) does not provide any information about the likelihood of the shipwreck being caused by a weak spot in the sail. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the pen was cheap) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the employee refused to pay the fine because ""الفستان لم يناسبني"" (the fine did not suit me). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (“لقد شفيت بسرعة”) is more likely to occur. The phrase “الخدش في جلدي كان عميقاً” suggests that there is a deep-seated feeling of sadness or depression in the speaker’s heart, which may lead to quick relief or escape through sleep. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he was dreaming) is more likely. The man's experience of receiving strange thoughts from a passenger in the plane suggests that he was in a state of dreaming rather than having a conversation with himself.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (النمل زحف إلى فتات) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""ترك الطفل"" means ""the child left,"" implying that the child was separated from its parents or caregivers. The word ""فتات"" specifically refers to women or girls, suggesting that the child may have been left alone with a group of females who are not its mother or primary caregiver. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the woman's sister-in-law) is more likely to be the cause of her husband's death. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She was in a state of trance) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""الرجل أخذ النعناع"" suggests that the man took something from her without her knowledge or consent, which could indicate a state of trance or hypnosis where she is not fully aware of what is happening around her. This is supported by the fact that the word ""شفتاه"" means ""trance"" or ""hypnosis."" Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option A (They have planned a trip to the seaside) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for their sudden departure from town. The phrase ""they had planned a trip"" implies that they made arrangements in advance, which supports this interpretation. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (colleague covered for her) is more likely. The reason being that if she has been absent from work for an extended period of time, it's possible that her colleagues have taken over her tasks or responsibilities to ensure continuity in their team's work.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he supported their case) is the correct cause. The text states that he ""supported their case,"" indicating that he took their side and advocated for them. This suggests that he was actively involved in helping them, rather than simply ignoring or dismissing their claims. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had a passion for acting) is the correct answer. The phrase ""يرتعش قبل أدائه"" can be translated to ""He was enthusiastic before his lines,"" suggesting that he had a strong emotional response to the script or dialogue, which aligns with having a passion for acting. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (لقد عددت نقودي) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""لقد كنت تائهة"" implies that the speaker has made a mistake or forgotten something, while ""لقد عددت نقودي"" means ""I have counted my money"". Therefore, option A is the better fit for the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Option B: لقد تشبّت (She has definitely melted)
Explanation: The premise ""الفاكهة الناضجة ظلت في الشمس"" implies that the ice cream has been exposed to direct sunlight for a long time, causing it to melt. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer as it suggests that the ice cream has indeed melted due to exposure to heat from the sun."
Response:  Based on the given information in the scenario, option B (the temperature inside the engine has risen) is a more likely cause for the car to stop working than option A (the air conditioning system has been turned on). This is because an increase in temperature inside the engine can cause it to overheat and shut down, while turning on the air conditioning system would not directly affect the engine's performance.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (he has been in a coma for several days) is more likely.
"Response: لقد أشعلت نارًا في المدفأة (Option A)
Explanation: The sentence ""لقد أشعلت نارًا في المدفأة"" means ""I lit a fire in the basement."" This implies that there was already an existing fire in the basement, rather than it being cold outside. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she has a new job) is the correct cause for her stopping to dance. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (جارتي دعتني للدخول) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""لقد طرقت باب جارتي"" implies that Jarty has already passed through a door, so it is unlikely that she would turn back and enter the same room again. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (her husband did not understand her fears) is more likely to be the cause of the woman's unhappiness. The premise suggests that the woman's husband was insensitive to her feelings and failed to comprehend her concerns, leading to their marital problems. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the woman's unhappiness than option B (her husband ignored her before).
"Response: 
Option A: The teacher praised the student for their answer. 
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the teacher praised the student for their correct answer to the question. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""لقد نفذت البيض من المرأة"", it is more likely that she went to the supermarket (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I revealed my secret) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""لقد قابلت صديقاً قديماً"" suggests that the speaker has shared a long-held secret with someone they consider a close friend. Option B (""I gave him/her shelter"") does not fit the context of the sentence as well, as it implies a more temporary or casual relationship than what is implied by the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the woman deliberately left her ring in the lake) is more likely. The premise states that the woman ""tried to avoid going to the lake,"" implying that she did not want to go there but was forced to do so anyway. This suggests that she may have intentionally left something behind as a way of coping with the situation. Option A (""I accidentally dropped my ring"") does not fit with this interpretation and seems less plausible given the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the student missed class (Option A). The phrase ""مبللاً"" used to describe the reason for absence implies that the absence was unintentional or unexpected, rather than a deliberate decision to skip class. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that the user's movement caused the mouse to move on the screen rather than the mouse itself moving on its own. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the ship has already passed) is more likely. The sentence ""السائق أخذ طريقًا مُلتويًا"" implies that the carrier took a route that was not his usual one, indicating that he had to take an alternative path due to some obstacle or detour. This supports option B as the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: الملابس البيضاء ملوثة (The white clothes are stained)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the white clothes will be stained than for the cat to have jumped off the balcony. The phrase ""علقت الكتان الرطب على خيط الغسيل"" suggests that the cat is sitting on a wet surface, which would not allow it to jump off the balcony. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""المرأة وضعت نظاراتها"", option A (the sun was rising) is a more plausible cause for why she woke up than option B (she had driven her car)."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he was looking at the sky) is the correct cause for his smile. The fact that he was looking at the sky suggests that he may have been enjoying the beauty of nature or appreciating its vastness, leading to a sense of wonder or awe, which could result in a smile. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for his smile.
"Response: أخيراً (B) 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""شعرت بالتعب"", it is more likely that the speaker stayed awake throughout the night than went to sleep early. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: أخترoption A: كان ينمو شعره (The man's beard grew).
Explanation: The premise states that the man went to the barber, indicating that he had a beard in the first place. Therefore, it is more likely that his beard grew rather than him having a longer beard."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I ate too much ice cream) is more likely to be the cause of the stomachache.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the car's headlights lit up the darkness ahead) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (“لقد أوقفت سيارتي في الشارع المقابل”) is more likely to be true because it implies that the speaker’s car has been parked in front of the building, which is a more common location for parking than near the entrance (option B).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the writer experienced a block due to writer's fatigue (Option A). The passage states that the writer had been working on the manuscript for a long time and had reached a dead end, indicating that they were feeling burnt out or exhausted from their efforts. This suggests that the writer's creative energy was depleted, making it difficult for them to continue writing. In contrast, Option B implies that the writer simply forgot about the manuscript, which seems less plausible given the context of the passage.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (“المُساعد أغلق الخط عليّ”) is the more likely cause of the problem. The phrase “أغلق الخط عليّ” means to close a file or document, indicating that the speaker has intentionally prevented access to their personal data. This suggests that they are aware of the issue and have taken steps to resolve it themselves, rather than simply forgetting their password as suggested by option B (“لقد قدمت رقم الهوية الخاص بي”).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (لقد رن جرس الباب) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""لقد رن جرس الباب"" means ""The door has been opened."" This implies that someone or something has opened the door, allowing air to enter the room. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the generator has broken down) is the cause of the power outage. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response: 
Option A: لقد قام بتحريك عضلاته أمام المرآة (He has indeed moved his limbs towards the mirror)
This option is more likely because it aligns with the information provided in the premise. The fact that he has moved his limbs towards the mirror suggests that he is trying to see himself in the reflection, which is a common action people take when they want to check their appearance. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (he has already studied) is more likely. The student has already studied for his exams, so it is less likely that he will try to cheat by using a calculator or erasing the answers.
Response:  Option A (The father's negligence was the reason for the child's forgetfulness)
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the baby drowned in the water) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ramiya al-fatata bi-al-baaloon al-maa'ee 'ala as-sabbi"" suggests that the girl was submerged in water, which could lead to drowning or other serious injuries. Option A (""the boy suffered a brain hemorrhage"") does not align with this scenario."
"Response:  Option B: Every person in the picture rejected the absurdity. 
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that every person in the picture rejected the absurdity of using a puppet instead of themselves as the model for the camera app. This option better aligns with the tone and theme of the scenario, as people are unlikely to accept such an absurd idea without questioning or rejecting it outright."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I was alone) is the most likely cause for rejecting the invitation to a birthday party. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response: لقد تمارين (I had a premonition)
Explanation: The correct answer is option A, ""I had a premonition."" This is the most likely cause based on the premise provided."
Response: لقد أمتصت الماء (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the mansion was located on a cliff) is more likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (كانت تخاف من الإبر) is the correct answer. The phrase ""كانت تخاف"" means ""I was afraid,"" indicating that the speaker experienced fear or anxiety related to something. In this case, the context of the conversation suggests that the speaker may have been afraid of something related to their work or personal life, rather than simply wanting to sleep. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker might be tired all the time."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (أصبحت مشبوهة) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""مشبوهة"" means ""haunted"" or ""ghostly"", indicating that the strange car may be inhabited by a supernatural entity. Therefore, it is more plausible that the car has become haunted rather than having been in contact with a parking ticket."
"Response: لقد سلم نفسه المجرم (The criminal has confessed)
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the criminal has confessed to the crime rather than there being no evidence against him. This is because the phrase ""لقد سلم نفسه"" implies a level of guilt or responsibility for the action taken by the criminal, which suggests that he has admitted to committing the crime. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (لقد تجنب الكافيين) is more likely to occur. The man has decided to reduce his weight by skipping meals, which will lead to a decrease in his calorie intake and ultimately result in weight loss. Option A (لقد قطع الحلويات) does not align with this outcome as reducing food portions alone may not necessarily lead to significant weight loss.
Response: لقد انزلقت (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (and put her baby in the crib) is the more likely cause. The woman was found unconscious under her bed, indicating that she may have been unable to care for her child during the night. It is therefore more plausible that she placed her baby in a safe location such as a crib before falling asleep.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (البركان ثار) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the parkinson's disease patient has a tremor in their hand, indicating that they have a neurological disorder that affects movement. This aligns with the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which include tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with movement. Therefore, it is more likely that the patient has Parkinson's disease rather than being in a coma ( Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she wanted to leave the party) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I have allowed myself to be driven by my emotions) is more likely. The phrase ""لقد دفعت لضابط الحظيرة"" suggests that the speaker has willingly or intentionally let their emotions control them, rather than being forced or coerced into it. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given context."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (“he has already sold his shares”) is the correct cause. The text states that the manager has already sold his shares, indicating that he has taken this action before the event occurred. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response: أختر option A: الطبيب كان في إجازة (The doctor was in a hurry)
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the doctor was in a hurry because he had an appointment or some other urgent matter to attend to. This could explain why the man felt the need to interrupt him."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (the house was burning) is the correct answer. The text states that the person woke up from a nap through the window, implying that there was an emergency situation such as a fire in the house. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the person woke up through the window.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (لقد أخذ حماماً طويلاً) is the more likely cause for why the baby's bottom has become red. Taking a long bath can dry out the skin and make it more prone to irritation or rashes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: لقد بصقت الحليب (Option A)
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the cat was poisoned than that it had a toy inside its stomach. The phrase ""لقد بصقت الحليب"" means ""the cat has been poisoned,"" indicating that this outcome is more plausible based on the information provided in the premise. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I delayed my work) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the car will crash (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (they won the competition) is correct. The passage states that the team ""managed to win"" the competition, indicating that they were successful in their efforts. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (“لقد قلبت الزجاجة”) is the more likely cause of the broken glass. This is because the phrase “لقد قلبت” means “it has been cracked” or “it has broken,” indicating that the glass was already damaged before it shattered. Option B (“لقد قمت بتقليص الغطاء”) means “you have already tightened the screws,” which does not match the context of the situation. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the boy was sucked out of his home through an open window) is more likely. The premise states that the boy was outside when he was locked out of his house, indicating that he may have been able to exit through a window or other opening. Option B (the ceiling collapsed) does not provide any information about how the boy left the house. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the boy ended up outside.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The woman saw a path through the door) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""رن جرس الباب"" (ran jars al-bab) means ""saw a path through the door,"" indicating that the woman was able to see a way through the locked door without needing to break it open. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he has been locked in his fridge) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the girl pressed the button that activated the robot) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the girl was pressing a button, indicating that she had some level of control over what happened next. Option A (the robot sent the baby flying) does not align with this idea as it implies that the robot would have acted independently without any input from the girl. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Option B: عقد المسلمون موكب (The Muslims agreed to a truce)
Explanation: The passage states that ""the war ended"" and ""the Muslims agreed to a truce,"" indicating that the second option is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the girl's hair was tied) is the correct answer. The premise states that the girl's hair was tied to her scalp, which suggests that she had her hair tied back or in a ponytail. This is consistent with the idea of a girl tying her hair back, rather than the hair being tied to her scalp naturally. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he became older) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the eggshell cracked) than option B (the eggwhite broke). This is because an eggshell can crack without breaking the entire egg, whereas an eggwhite cannot break without also breaking the shell. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response: لقد مات (Option A)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (لقد تسلق السلم) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""الرجل فقد توازنه على السلم"" means ""The man has lost his balance due to the calmness,"" indicating that he has become too relaxed or complacent, leading him to lose his balance. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome than option B (لقد سقط من السلم), which means ""The man has fallen from the calmness."""
"Response:  Option A (The child had already digested food)
Explanation: The premise states that the child was vomiting, indicating that they had recently ingested something. Since the child has already digested food, it is less likely that they would be experiencing a reflux of undigested food from their stomach to their mouth. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option B: لقد ارتجفت (You have already digested)
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the student received a scholarship to attend college (Option A). The phrase ""received a scholarship"" suggests financial assistance, which aligns with the idea of the student's family struggling to pay for their education. Additionally, there is no mention of the student having earned good grades or achieving academic success, which further supports Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She was living with him) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""من الصبي"" in Arabic means ""from a young age"", indicating that she had been living with him for an extended period of time. This suggests that she may have been his daughter or ward, rather than being under his spell as suggested by option B."
"Response: لقد سرق المتشرد الجائع الطعام (Option A)
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the thief stole the food because he was hungry rather than not having money. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: أردت الخصوصية (I wanted to be alone)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""اتصلت بصديقتي للتحدث"" (I contacted my friends to complain), it is more likely that the speaker wanted to be alone rather than feeling a sense of unity with their friends. The phrase ""أردت الخصوصية"" (I wanted to be alone) suggests that the speaker was seeking solitude or isolation, which aligns better with the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Option A: لقد صافحت يده (He has already stretched his hand)
Explanation: The sentence ""الرجل مد يده"" means that he is reaching out with his hand, so option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The fireworks exploded in the air) is a more likely cause than option B (The plane flew towards the head).

Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she was surprised) is more likely. The phrase ""عضّت الفتاة"" implies that something unexpected happened to her, which aligns with the meaning of surprise. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (“I have scheduled an appointment”) is the correct cause for the change in the calendar page. The passage states that the user has made changes to their schedule, indicating that they have scheduled appointments or meetings that need to be recorded in their calendar.

"Response: لقد أخذت الطماطم من العنب (Option A)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""لقد أخذت الطماطم من العنب"", it is more likely that the cat took the mouse from the bush rather than the cat being angry or skittish. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (he has already accepted his friend's offer to eat dinner) is more likely. The text states that he wants to become Romanian, which suggests that he is interested in exploring his cultural identity and heritage. It is unlikely that he would be thinking about food at this moment, especially since he has already agreed to eat dinner with a friend. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the air conditioner broke down) caused the temperature to rise. This is because breaking down of an air conditioner would disrupt its cooling function, leading to a rise in temperature inside the room or building. On the other hand, option B (the weather has become hotter) does not provide any specific reason as to why the temperature should have risen beyond what is expected for this time of year. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the information provided.

Option A (The court session adjourned suddenly) does not provide any information about the cause of the delay or congestion.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (ركعت على الأرض) is the more likely cause of feeling relaxed. The phrase ""ركعت على الأرض"" means to lie down or recline on the ground, which suggests a sense of comfort and relaxation. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response: أصبح زلق (Option A)

Response: لقد ع�ت السمكة الحبل (Option A)

"Response:  Based on the premise ""تعبير وجهي أضاء"", option A (I received good news) is more likely to be the cause of the smile."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the man's weight has increased under his chin) is a more plausible explanation for why he can no longer see his reflection in the mirror. As the weight of the body accumulates around the neck area, it can push down on the chin and create an obstruction that blocks the view of the reflection in the mirror. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that they lost because of their own mistakes (Option A). The phrase ""لقد خسروا لعبتهم"" suggests that they made errors or poor decisions during the game, rather than blaming their coach for lack of training (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response: لقد ندمت على خطئي (Option A)
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (he was talking without stopping about himself) is more likely to be the cause of her feeling suffocated. The fact that he was talking non-stop about himself suggests that he may have been dominating the conversation and not giving her enough space to express herself or feel heard. This can indeed make a person feel suffocated or uncomfortable in a conversation. Therefore, option B is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (وجنتيها احمررت) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""وجنتيها"" means ""her imagination"" or ""her fantasy,"" indicating that she may have created a vivid mental image of something. This aligns with the idea that her thoughts are racing and she is lost in thought. Option B (""لقد ظهر غراماتها"") means ""Her secrets have been revealed,"" which does not fit the context of the premise as it suggests that someone else has discovered her hidden thoughts rather than her own mind wandering."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the ship sank) is the more likely cause of the disaster. The phrase ""انفجرت"" (infjirat), which means ""exploded,"" suggests that there was a sudden and violent event that led to the destruction of the ship. This is consistent with the idea that the ship sank due to an accident or natural disaster, rather than simply disappearing into thin air. Therefore, option B is the better answer."

The phrase ""الرجل ثقب قدمه"" can be translated to ""the man was drunk,"" indicating that he had consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B ( many people are facing poverty) is more likely to occur. The premise states that ""the economy of the country has receded,"" indicating a decline in economic activity and potential job losses, leading to an increase in poverty rates. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (They were asleep during the accident) is more likely to be the cause of their injuries. The sentence ""كانوا على وشك المشي في حركة المرور القادمة"" suggests that they were unconscious or asleep during the car crash, which could have caused them to sustain injuries without realizing it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for their injuries compared to option B (They knew each other from before)."
Response: لقد أخبرني بالحقيقة (Option A)
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the driver was drunk) is true. The fact that the car swerved into a tree suggests that the driver may have been impaired or distracted while driving, rather than simply being unable to see the road ahead due to the fog.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the baby was born) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""began with childbirth"" suggests that the story will focus on the birth of a child, rather than the woman's morning sickness. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the man's hat blew away) is the correct cause. The phrase ""هبت بعيدا"" suggests that the hat was blown away by a strong gust of wind or other external force, rather than being taken by someone else as suggested in option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (لقد تلقت دعوة) is more likely. The phrase ""حضرت الفتاة"" suggests that the girl was invited to a celebration or party, and the fact that she has not yet responded implies that she received an invitation but has not yet accepted it. Option B (""لقد اشترت هدية"") does not fit with this context as it means ""I bought a gift,"" which does not align with the scenario described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She felt her father's forehead) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""She felt her father's forehead"" implies that the speaker was physically touching or feeling their father's forehead, which suggests a more direct and immediate action than taking one's mother to the park (option B). Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer based on the context provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (he put perfume in his hair) is a more plausible explanation for why he smells good than option A (he wants to impress his friend). This is because applying perfume to one's hair can indeed make them smell nice, whereas wanting to impress someone through personal hygiene may not be as effective or direct a means of achieving that goal.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (she had already seen the end of her life) is more likely. The text states that she ""had already seen the end of her life,"" indicating that she was aware of her own mortality and had accepted it.

"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the baby hit the washing machine) caused the damage to the machine. The phrase ""ركض الصبي"" (the baby hit) suggests a sudden and accidental impact, which could potentially damage the machine. Option B (""the small hole was drilled"") does not provide any context or explanation for how the damage occurred, making it less plausible as the cause of the problem. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I have fed him) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""مات"" (died) suggests that the dog has passed away, and therefore it is unlikely that the speaker would be angry with him or give him food after his death."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man's business was rejected because he wrote a letter of recommendation for someone else (Option A). This is because the phrase ""he refused to write a letter of recommendation"" suggests that the man did not fulfill his obligation or duty to provide a letter of recommendation, rather than him paying money as suggested by Option B."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he has already told lies) is the correct cause. The statement ""لقد قصّ أظافره"" suggests that he has lied before, which implies a pattern of dishonesty. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A is correct. The phrase ""علقت الملصقة على الحائط"" implies that the string was tied to a hook or a nail on the wall, which would place it above the door. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the architect made changes to the blueprints) is more likely. The phrase ""وافق على خطط"" means ""agreed upon"" or ""approved,"" indicating that the architect reviewed and modified the plans rather than building the structure himself."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the man's hand was already injured) is the more likely cause of his fall. The premise states that the man fell while holding onto a rope, indicating that he may have lost his balance or been pushed, but it does not suggest that his hand injury caused him to fall. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (The CEO's decision will have a different outcome) is more likely. The reason for this is that the premise states that ""the CEO has made up his mind to resign,"" implying that he has already decided on his course of action. This means that any attempt by the board of directors to convince him otherwise would be unsuccessful, resulting in a different outcome than what they had planned. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I have approached the site) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (his family paid his debt) is the correct cause. The text states that he was released from prison after his family paid off his debt, indicating that they were responsible for his release rather than him attacking a colleague while incarcerated.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the alloy has been crushed) is more likely to occur.

Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (They have already donated) is more likely to be the correct answer. The text states that ""they have set a goal to collect money"" and ""have already donated,"" indicating that they have already taken action towards their goal. Therefore, it is more likely that they will continue to donate in the future rather than starting from scratch by organizing a fundraising event."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the car crashed) is more likely to occur as it directly relates to the situation described in the premise.

Response: لقد أعدت تدوير الورقة (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (leaders of other countries formed an alliance) is more likely to occur as a result of the natural disaster affecting the ummah. This is because forming an alliance requires coordination and cooperation among multiple parties, which may be challenging in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster.

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (It was expected that he would return to his book) is more likely as it aligns with the tone of the passage which suggests a sense of routine and predictability in the man's daily activities. The fact that the speaker mentions ""it was expected"" implies that this outcome was anticipated by the narrator or the reader. Option B (He had been asked by a friend) does not fit well with the context as there is no indication in the passage that the man has any friends who would ask him to do something."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the criminal was punished by death) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""ضوء الشمس دخل الغرفة"" (Light enters the room), option A is more likely. The word ""فتح"" (open) in Arabic implies a physical action of opening something, such as doors or windows, rather than simply unlocking them. Therefore, it is more likely that the light entered the room through an open door or window rather than being unlocked from outside."
Response: لقد سحبت شعر المحتaal (Option A)
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A is true.

Option B (I wrote my own songs) does not align with this interpretation and seems less relevant to the given context.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the girl had hit him) is the correct answer. The phrase ""شعر الفتى كان يرتفع"" can be translated to ""The boy's hair was standing up,"" indicating that he was in a state of excitement or agitation. This is consistent with the idea that the girl may have hit him, causing his hair to stand up in surprise or fear. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the person has been bitten by an insecticide) is the correct answer. The phrase ""لقد تم سحق الحشرة"" suggests that a chemical or insecticide was used to eliminate the cockroach infestation, which could have caused the person's allergies to act up. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the person's symptoms."

Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (“I forgot everything”) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker was unable to continue the conversation than option B (“The conversation became too advanced”). The passage states that the speaker “forgot everything,” indicating that they were unable to recall any of the topics or details from their previous conversations with the other person. This suggests that the speaker’s memory loss was not due to the complexity of the conversation but rather due to an internal failure to retain information. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I was happy to see him outside the hospital) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A ( started the playhouse opening) is more likely to happen because it implies that the event has already begun or started, whereas option B (the actors left the stage) suggests that something happened after the event had already started. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the imposter directed the innocent to commit a crime) is more likely. The phrase ""الخاطف هدد بإيذاء الرهينة"" suggests that the imposter was manipulating or deceiving the innocent into committing a crime, rather than simply abandoning them. Therefore, option A is the better fit for this scenario."
"Response:  Option A: The musician played it. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""the musician played it,"" suggesting that the music was performed by a musician rather than being simply imagined or created through some other means. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."

The phrase ""أسرع الوالدين إلى غرفة نوم"" suggests that the parents were quicker than usual to reach their child's room, which implies that the child was asleep in his/her bed. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She was born before the event) is a more likely cause than option B (She was born small). This is because the premise mentions that the woman spoke in a language that was not her native tongue, indicating that she may have been born in a different location or culture where the language was spoken.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (المزارع ماتت) is more likely to occur as a result of the flood in the area. The phrase ""الماء ملوثاً"" means ""the water has risen,"" indicating that there will be an increase in water levels, which could lead to flooding and damage to crops and property. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the school started summer vacation) is the correct answer. The sentence ""المدرسة أطلقت الصيف"" means ""The school has started summer vacation,"" indicating that the reason for the girl's absence from school is because summer vacation has begun. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."

The passage suggests that the leader's actions had a profound impact on the rebels, leading them to change their ways and become more peaceful. This implies that the leader's influence was significant enough to alter the behavior of the rebels, rather than the other way around. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the waves are breaking on the shore) is more likely to occur. The wording of the premise suggests that the two men are standing on the beach, implying a coastal location with a shoreline.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I drank water from the sea) is more likely to cause you to feel cold in the middle of the night. Drinking water from the sea can lower your body temperature quickly, making you feel colder than usual.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I have decided to try to change his heart) is more likely. The speaker has already tried another approach ( Option A ) and failed, so it's unlikely they would repeat the same action again without any changes or new strategies. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The email was sent to the spam folder, indicating that it may have been flagged as suspicious or unsolicited by the recipient's email provider.

Explanation: The premise ""أخذت رشفة من القهوة الحارقة"" means that the speaker has taken a sip of hot coffee. This implies that their tongue has been burned by the heat of the coffee. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (“I have been feeling tired all day”) is a more plausible cause of the symptoms than option B (“I have studied all day”). This is because feeling tired after studying is not an uncommon occurrence, especially if one has been studying for an extended period of time. However, feeling tired all day without any obvious reason may indicate other underlying causes such as fatigue, stress, or illness. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the doctor has identified the patient's symptoms) is the correct cause. The premise states that the doctor has diagnosed the patient, indicating that they have identified the patient's symptoms and used them to make a medical assessment. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause.

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he has lost his senses) is the correct answer. The phrase ""خضع لعملية جراحية طارئة"" suggests that he has undergone a surgical procedure, which could potentially result in loss of sensation or cognitive impairment. Option B (he has suffered a heart attack) does not fit with this context as it would not be expected to result in loss of sensation. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the ligament has been stretched) is a more likely cause of the man's knee pain. The premise mentions that the patient has experienced sudden and severe pain in his knee, which suggests that there may have been an injury or trauma to the area. Stretching or tearing of the ligaments around the knee joint can cause significant pain and discomfort, making option B a more plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (لقد شعر بالإحباط) is more likely. The phrase ""رفع الرجل"" means to lift or raise someone, while ""حاجبيه"" means to feel weak or faint. Therefore, the sentence suggests that the person may have felt weak or faint due to some reason, rather than being startled or surprised."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (I trusted he knew better) is a more likely cause for why the speaker did not correct their colleague's mistake. This is because the speaker implies that they had faith in their colleague's abilities and assumed that they would recognize and correct any errors. Therefore, it seems more plausible that the speaker did not correct their colleague's mistake due to a lack of suspicion or scrutiny rather than assuming their colleague was intentionally incorrect.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B ( began to wake up suddenly) is more likely. The premise states that the man stopped snoring, indicating that he was no longer asleep or in a deep sleep state. Therefore, it is more likely that he would wake up suddenly rather than start practicing sports.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (جسد المهاجم أصبح بلا حياة) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""مهاجمها"" in the premise refers to a woman's soul or spirit being affected by something, and the word ""جسد"" means body. Therefore, it can be inferred that the woman's physical body will become lifeless as a result of the attack. Option B (""المهاجم بدأ ينزف"") does not align with this interpretation and implies that the ghost will start moving away, which does not make sense given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, it is more likely that the man's mistake was due to his own error (Option A). The passage states that ""the man had made a mistake,"" implying that he was responsible for the error. There is no indication in the passage that external factors such as the game being rigged or someone else's fault caused the man's loss. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the mice have found their way into the wall) is the correct cause for the problem. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option B (the guest stayed longer than expected) is more likely to be the cause of the host's discomfort. The passage states that ""the guest had overstayed his welcome,"" indicating that he remained at the house for a longer period than originally planned or agreed upon. This suggests that the guest's extended stay may have caused inconvenience or discomfort for the host. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for the host's unease."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (حصلت على مذكرات جديدة) is more likely. The girl's brother reading her diary suggests that he has discovered something personal and intimate about her, which could be hurtful or embarrassing for her. It is unlikely that she would start keeping a new diary to hide her old one from him. Therefore, it is more likely that she has acquired a new diary as a replacement or addition to her existing one.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she quit her job (Option B). The phrase ""she was short of money for rent"" suggests that she may have been struggling financially, leading her to seek other means of income or even leave her job altogether."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the child's hand was slapped) is a more likely cause for the pain in his head. The premise suggests that the child's hand was hit with force, which could potentially cause injury to the head or face area. Option B (the child fell and hit his head) does not align with the given information as there is no mention of the child falling or hitting his head. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the child's pain in his head.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (They have already offered discounts to new customers) is more likely. This implies that the company has taken a proactive approach to retain existing customers by offering them incentives, rather than solely focusing on acquiring new ones through surveys or other means. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the boy was pulled into the earth) is more likely. The premise states that ""الأرضية الخشبية أصبحت خدش,"" indicating that the ground became soft or muddy, which could make it easier for someone to sink into the earth. Option A (the boy was buried under the sand) does not fit with this description as sand is typically not soft enough to allow a person to sink into it easily. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
"Response: لقد غطيت وجهي (Option A)
Explanation: The correct answer is Option A because it better fits the context of the sentence. ""لقد غطيت وجهي"" means ""I have been deceived,"" which implies that someone has tricked or fooled you in some way. This makes more sense given the context of the sentence than Option B, which suggests that an enemy has attacked you."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the fire) caused the famous statue to collapse. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (الفاكهة تسقط البذور) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""لقد تركت الفاكهة"" implies that something has already happened, specifically that the cake has fallen. This suggests that the outcome of the situation is already determined and cannot be changed. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (she had a miscarriage) is the more likely cause of her stomach pain. The phrase ""مزقت رباطاً"" suggests that she experienced a spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, which can cause abdominal pain in some cases. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (She had learned how to tie her shoelaces) is the correct answer. The sentence ""كانت مفتوحة"" (meaning ""she was open"") suggests that she had already learned how to tie her shoelaces, rather than having difficulty with it. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why she was able to play outside without any supervision."
Response: لقد أعدت الكتاب (Option A)
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the father's influence caused his son to hold such beliefs. Therefore, option A (the father influenced him) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the driver lost control of the car) is more likely to be the cause of the accident. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the man swallowed the sun) is more likely. The phrase ""الرجل أكل الآيس كريم"" means ""The man ate the sun crystal,"" indicating that the man consumed something shiny and precious, not something as large and heavy as a planet like Earth. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the carpet started to slip) caused the floor to become uneven. Therefore, the answer is (A).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (I had a headache) is more likely to be the cause of the employee's absence from work. The passage states that the employee was absent without any notice, which suggests that they did not inform their employer ahead of time or provide an explanation for their absence. This implies that the employee may have been feeling unwell or experiencing some other personal issue that prevented them from coming to work. Option B (the manager approved the leave) is less likely, as there is no indication in the passage that the manager granted the employee leave or that the employee requested it.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the cat has scratched the sofa) is more likely to be the cause of the damage. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (صديقي غفر لي) is more likely to happen. The phrase ""غفر"" means ""to forgive"", so it suggests that the friend will forgive the person who wronged them. This implies a positive outcome where the friendship is restored. Option B (صديقي أصبح غاضباً) means ""my friend became angry with me"", which implies a negative outcome where the friendship is damaged or lost. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (he was carrying a briefcase) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""مميزاً بين الحشد"" can be translated as ""dressed in formal attire,"" indicating that the man was dressed professionally for an occasion or event. Carrying a briefcase would be a common accessory for someone dresses in formal attire, while wearing a suit with a bow tie and holding a cane are less practical and less commonly associated with everyday life. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (لقد اتهم بالشهادة الكاذبة) is more likely. The speaker seems to be accusing the witness of lying under oath, which suggests that they are trying to discredit or undermine the witness's testimony.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I wanted to fit in with everyone) is more likely. The premise highlights the woman's desire to blend in with society, indicating that she wants to be accepted and appreciated by others.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they were deported (Option B). The text states that they were ""qabd al-mhajirun"" meaning they were taken away or deported from their country of residence without any legal basis. This implies that they were forcibly removed from their homes and sent back to their countries of origin, rather than finding a job in the host country."
"Response: 
Option A: ضحك الجمهور (The audience laughed)"
"Response:  Option B: The sun has burned my skin.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""The sun has burned my skin,"" it is more likely that option B is correct. The phrase ""الشمس قد حرقت بشرتي"" means ""the sun has burned my skin,"" indicating that the speaker has been affected by the heat of the sun. This is a common occurrence during hot weather conditions, where people may experience sunburns or discomfort due to exposure to direct sunlight. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option A: لقد شخرت (Shakhrat means ""to be affected"" or ""to feel"")
Explanation: The sentence structure in this option suggests that the speaker is feeling something, which aligns with the meaning of Shakhrat. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (السكين كان باهتًا) is the correct answer. The phrase ""كان من الصعب"" means ""it was difficult,"" and ""قطع اللحم"" means ""to cut meat."" Therefore, the sentence implies that cutting meat was a difficult task, which supports option A. Option B (""اللحم كان خام"") means ""the meat was raw,"" but does not align with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she has received a large sum of money) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I asked him if he had left his light on) is a more likely explanation for why the light in my friend's house was still on than option B (I decided to go over there). This is because asking someone directly if they have left something on is a more direct and straightforward approach than deciding to go to their house without any clear reason or intention.
"Response: 
Option A: بتلات الزهرة سقطت (The sun has set)
Explanation: The premise ""وضعت الزهرة تحت أنفي"" means that the sun has set below the horizon, which implies that it is nighttime. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the woman had a friend who was a child) is the correct answer.

Therefore, option A is the better choice.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""صرخت الطير بأجنحتها"" (The bird chirped with its beak), option A is more likely. The word ""بأجنحتها"" can be translated to ""with its beak"", indicating that the bird chirped using its beak, rather than flying upwards. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the car stalled due to a full gas tank (Option B). The phrase ""ممتلئاً"" in Arabic specifically means ""full"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the victim's hand raised) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""وجه المجرم"" (the criminal's face) suggests that the action being described is something the criminal did, rather than something the victim did in response to the crime. Therefore, it is more likely that the victim's hand was raised in defense or resistance against the criminal, rather than the criminal placing their hands around the victim's neck."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (planning to attend a friend's wedding) is the correct answer. The phrase ""نهاية الأسبوع"" (end of the week) suggests that the event is taking place at the end of the week, which aligns with the timing of a traditional Muslim wedding ceremony. Additionally, the mention of ""جنازة"" (wedding) in the premise further supports this conclusion. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the speaker lost their job due to Option A: ""I was dreaming of the night."" This suggests that the speaker's mind was elsewhere during work hours, indicating a lack of focus or attention in the workplace. Therefore, this option is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker lost their job."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (the paper was too thin) is a more plausible explanation for why the text could not be read. The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that the ink was from a different page or that the writing was illegible due to the quality of the paper. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the fans attacking the stadium) is more likely to occur. The premise mentions ""الملعب"" (the stadium), which implies a physical location that can be attacked or invaded by a group of people. Option A (""التفت المشجعون إلى العلم"") does not imply any physical action towards a specific location."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (لقد وضعت الملح فيه) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""الحمض"" (al-hammad) can be translated as ""the explosive,"" and ""وضعت"" (wa-da'a) means ""I placed."" Therefore, the sentence suggests that the speaker placed something inside the explosive, which is consistent with the idea of a bomb maker preparing an explosive device."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (she has already read the book) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the man's thoughts turned to his safety) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (they have racked up their memories) is the more likely cause.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (he slapped her hand far away from him) is more likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I already gave my opinion) is more likely to be the correct cause. The speaker has already expressed their opinion and does not seem to be open to changing it, indicating that they have already formed a strong belief or conviction about the matter.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (الطين علق على حذائه) is more likely to occur. The word ""علق"" in Arabic means ""attached"" or ""stuck"", so it suggests that the boy's head is stuck to the tin can. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the people are panicking underground) is more likely. The premise mentions that our country has received several shocks from the earthquake, implying a significant impact on the population. People may panic and try to seek safety underground, leading to chaos and confusion. Option A (schools closed) does not necessarily imply a direct connection to the earthquake's effects on the population.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the employee has resigned from their job (Option B). The phrase ""لقد هدد بإستقالته"" means ""he had submitted his resignation,"" indicating that the employee intentionally left their job. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option (A) is correct, i.e., ""لقد قمت بتعبئة الخشب في الموقد"". This is because the phrase ""الخشب"" (the wood) is used as a direct object after the verb ""قمت"", indicating that the action of cutting the wood occurred before the action of moving it to the other side."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the couple announced that they will get a divorce) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""the family has been troubled by the husband's infidelity,"" which suggests that there are issues in the marriage that have led to tension and conflict. It is unlikely that the couple would decide to have another child together after such problems have arisen, as it may only add to their stress and make their situation more difficult. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the couple might announce that they will get a divorce."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I was surprised by him) is more likely.
"Response: لقد أومأت برأسي على تصريح صديقي
Explanation: Based on the text, it seems that the speaker had a preconceived idea about their friend's behavior before they even talked to them. This suggests that the speaker may have been biased or made assumptions without having all the facts. Therefore, option A (the speaker was mistaken) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (they want to find a middle ground) is more likely. The phrase ""يلقون العملة"" (they will reach an agreement) suggests that the parties involved are willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution, rather than taking a strict or absolute stance (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the man removed the trash from the kitchen) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""لقد انطلقت الساعة في المطبخ"" suggests that something has started in the kitchen, and the man removing the trash from there is a plausible explanation for what might have caused this event to occur. Option B does not provide any context or information that would suggest why the man left his house with a bucket of bait."
Response: لقد أهدأت (Option A)
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the son's legal problem) is more likely to cause the wealthy man's death. The phrase ""مات الرجل الغني بسبب الشيخوخة"" suggests that the man died due to a legal issue involving his son, rather than inheriting his wealth. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The woman's hair has grown longer due to her devotion to God, not because of any external factor such as a sudden increase in the amount of gold dust present in the air.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the woman's driving license was revoked) is the correct answer. The statement ""she was driving her car"" implies that she had a valid driver's license at some point, but it has since been revoked. This is supported by the fact that the sentence mentions ""her car,"" indicating that she still owns and operates the vehicle, despite no longer having a valid driver's license. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the woman's car was involved in an accident."
Response: لقد أعددت الفطور (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (حضر عائلته المؤتمر الصحفي) is more likely to occur. The public figure has a reputation to protect, and it would be more damaging for them to attend a press conference where they are accused of wrongdoing than for their cameramen to have been involved in any misconduct. Therefore, the public figure is likely to distance themselves from the situation by not attending the press conference.
"Response:  Option A: أصبح ماء الحمام فاترًا.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman was in the bathtub when she suddenly felt like she was floating in water that had turned into milk.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (لقد تخرج في الهندسة) is more likely to occur. The student wants to interview other students in the university, which suggests that he/she is conducting research or gathering information for a project related to the university. Therefore, it is more likely that the student has already graduated from the university rather than joining a fraternity.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the reason for the increase in the number of people seeking psychotherapy is Option A: ""I searched for some answers."" This suggests that the individual was actively seeking help or support rather than simply rearranging their living space (Option B)."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (الشرطة طاردت المجرم) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the computer was stolen) is the correct answer. The phrase ""لقد أسقطته"" (meaning ""it has been stolen"") suggests that the computer was taken without permission, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (she has thrown away her clothes) is a more likely cause than option A (she has acquired a large wardrobe). The fact that she has thrown away her clothes suggests that she may have been feeling overwhelmed or frustrated with her current wardrobe, leading to the decision to get rid of some or all of it. In contrast, acquiring a large wardrobe without any context or explanation does not necessarily imply a specific reason for doing so. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (his wife left him) is the correct answer. The phrase ""كان محطماً"" (he was divorced) suggests that the man's marriage had ended, which aligns with Option A."

This will increase his confidence and motivation at work, making him more productive and efficient. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the speaker was clear in all areas) is a more likely cause for why his voice sounded normal to everyone else. This is because if he had a cold or any other medical condition that affected his vocal cords, it would have been noticeable to those around him as well. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker's normal voice was due to his ability to project his voice clearly throughout the room rather than any underlying medical issue.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the bill has been immersed in water) is more likely to occur than option B (the bill has been cut in half). This is because when a bill is immersed in water, it can become damaged or discolored, but it will not necessarily be cut in half.
"Response:  Option B: الكرة تراجعت إلى اللاعب  
Explanation: According to the premise, the ball will move towards the player, so option B is the correct answer."
Response: لقد تعثرت (You have been poisoned)
"Response:  Option B: الزبون ترك مصابيحه الأمامية مضاءة.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (“I accidentally deleted my shopping list”) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker’s Google Home app stopped showing their to-do list. This is because the speaker mentions that they “accidentally deleted” their shopping list, implying that it was not intentionally removed. In contrast, option B (“I made a mistake while creating my shopping list”) does not provide any specific details about how the error occurred or what might have caused it. Therefore, based on the given information, option A is the more likely explanation.
Response: أعجب الأطفال بالحيوانات (Option A)
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (“كليتيه كانت تفشل”) is the more likely cause of the man’s high temperature. This is because the phrase “كليتيه” refers to a fever or high body temperature, indicating that this is the reason for the man’s discomfort. Option B (“كانت رئتيه متدفقة”) does not provide any indication of a possible cause for the man’s high temperature, making it less likely as an explanation.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I asked my friend if he was interested in joining) is a more likely explanation for why you have an additional ticket to the event. This is because asking your friend directly shows that you are actively seeking his participation, rather than simply relying on him for information or advice. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the windows are open) is more likely to cause a draft in the living room. Therefore, the answer is (B).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the eyebrow was open) is more likely to be the cause of the pain in the forehead. This is because an open eyebrow can put pressure on the nerves that run through the forehead, causing discomfort or pain. In contrast, a closed eyebrow may not have as much impact on these nerves, making option B less likely to be the cause of the pain.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she bought a gift for her mother) is the correct answer. The sentence ""لقد اشتريت هدية لأمي"" means ""I have already bought a present for my mother,"" indicating that the speaker has already purchased something for their mother as a gift. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the dog's digging) caused the nest to be destroyed. The reason for this is that dogs are known to dig and burrow into soil, which could potentially disrupt a bird's nest. On the other hand, Option B (the squirrels burying nuts) does not seem to be a plausible explanation for destroying a bird's nest, as squirrels do not typically target birds' nests or engage in such behavior. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause.
Response: لقد انطفأ اللهب (Option B)
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (they wanted to resolve their personal relationship) is more likely. The fact that they reached a settlement suggests that they were motivated by a desire to put their personal differences aside and find common ground.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the parents died) is the correct cause. The phrase ""والداهم ماتوا"" suggests that the parents passed away, which aligns with the first part of the premise where it states ""أُرسِلَ الأطفال إلى دار للأيتام"". Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response: 
Option A: حدثت موجة تسونامي.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""سقط نيزك في المحيط"", there has been an earthquake in the surrounding area. This implies that a tsunami may occur as a result of the earthquake. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response: أصبحت جافة (Option A)
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (and placed the egg in the fridge) is a more likely cause than option A (became frozen).

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the lemon has been squeezed) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the country has expanded its territory) is more likely. The premise states that a new land was discovered, indicating an expansion of the country's territory rather than it shrinking. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the boat has capsized in a pile of clothes) is more likely. The premise mentions that the boat has sunk to the bottom of the sea, indicating that it has been submerged underwater. This suggests that the boat has not simply tipped over or fallen onto land, but rather has fully sunk into the water. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given information.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur, i.e., the son will eventually confess the truth to his father. This is because the phrase ""امسك الأب ابنه"" (the father embraced his son) suggests a deep emotional connection between them, making it more plausible for the son to open up to his father about his mistake. In contrast, option B does not provide any context or indication of why the father would blindly believe his son's denial without questioning him further. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (لقد تناول الأسبرين) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""يرتعش من الألم"" suggests that the man's head is in pain, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as a head injury or illness. However, the mention of ""شراب السعال"" (a type of alcoholic drink) and ""الأسبرين"" (a type of drug) implies that these substances may have contributed to or exacerbated the man's condition. Therefore, it is more likely that he has taken one of these drugs rather than simply drunk too much water."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he was approaching the platform) is the correct cause for his delay. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he has a mental illness (Option A).

"Response:  Option B: Her memories are linked to her emotions.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman saw a bird, implying that she experienced an emotion related to seeing the bird (e.g., joy, wonder). Therefore, it is more likely that her memories are linked to her emotions, as people tend to associate their memories with their emotional experiences."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he was swallowed by the earth) is a more likely cause than option B (he was killed in an explosion). The premise mentions that the man disappeared without a trace, implying that he was consumed or absorbed into the ground rather than being destroyed in an explosion. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the balloon burst) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""انفجر البالون"" (lit. ""the balloon exploded"") suggests that the balloon has already burst, indicating that this outcome is more probable than the other option ( Option B: ""ارتفع البالون في الهواء"")."
