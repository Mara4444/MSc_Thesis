"Response:  Based on the premise ""Artikkel var pakka i boblefilm"", option A (Det var ømfintlige) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg tømde lommene mine,"" it is more likely that option A (Eg fann ei billettstubbe) is correct. The phrase ""tømde lommene mine"" means ""I emptied my pockets,"" suggesting that something was found in the speaker's pockets. Option B (""Eg fann eit våpen"") means ""I found a weapon,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The termites are eating through the tree in the house, indicating that they have entered the house from outside. Option A is less likely as there is no indication of them leaving the house.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Patruljen sjekka passane deira) is more likely. The patrol will check the passes of those who have reached the border, indicating that they are taking a more proactive approach to enforcing immigration laws. This suggests that they may be more vigilant in detecting and preventing illegal activities such as smuggling.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kontoret var stengt"", it is more likely that option A (Det var ei ferie) is the correct answer. The phrase ""stengt kontoret"" means closed office, implying that no work was being done during this time. Therefore, it is unlikely that it was summer break or a vacation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ho spelte dam) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Jenta fekk ikkje meir energi"" suggests that the person is feeling tired or lacking energy, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as stress, fatigue, or illness. Therefore, it is more plausible that they would choose to rest or sleep rather than engaging in physical activity like jumping over a wall."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinna mista plassen si i køen"", option A (Fleire kom til) is the most likely cause. The word ""mista"" in Norwegian means ""lost"", so it's likely that the woman lost her place in line. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta klemte på nesen sin,"" it is more likely that barnet salivra på salla (Option A). The Norwegian sentence structure suggests that the child is squeezing its nose, which could potentially lead to saliva dripping from their nose onto their shoulder or clothing."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Publiken klappa saman med musikken) is more likely to occur. The use of the word ""klappa"" in Norwegian implies a physical reaction such as clapping, which suggests that the audience is actively participating in the music performance by expressing their enthusiasm through bodily gestures. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ho vart verande der etter skulen for å halde på) is more likely. The phrase ""ho vart verande"" means ""he/she was waiting"", indicating that the student had been waiting for a long time to see the teacher after school. This suggests that the student may have been eager or enthusiastic about seeing the teacher, rather than simply giving them an apple as a gesture of appreciation."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ein leiar i leiren deira hadde fortalt dei ei gåte) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Dei unge legarne vart redde"" suggests that something was taken away from them, and the use of the word ""leiar"" implies a sense of confusion or misunderstanding. Option B does not fit with this context as it refers to placing marshmallows on a fire, which has no relation to the given premise. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened to the young ones in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Han vart tapt i tankar) is a more likely explanation for why he couldn't lift his head. The phrase ""slo hovudet"" means ""lost in thought,"" suggesting that he was so deeply engaged in his thoughts that he lost awareness of his physical surroundings and was unable to move or act. Option B (Han hadde eit hjerneslag) means ""He had a brain attack,"" which would be less relevant to the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (“My bank account balance was low”) is a more plausible explanation for why the person did not receive their salary than option B (“I deserved a pay raise”). This is because there is no indication in the text that the person has been working particularly hard or deserves an increase in pay. The fact that they mention their bank account balance being low suggests that they may have experienced financial difficulties, which could be the reason why they did not receive their salary.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (he deleted spam) is correct. The premise states that his email inbox was full of spam, indicating that he had a lot of unwanted emails in his inbox. Deleting these emails would be the most logical solution to free up space in his inbox. Option B suggests that he sent out a mass email, but there is no indication in the premise that this occurred. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (He was exposed to the disease) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Sjømannen var sett i karantene"" implies that he was placed under quarantine, indicating that he had been exposed to a contagious illness. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option A (Ho told himself the code) is a more plausible explanation than option B (Ho forgot to write it down). This is because there is no indication that Ho was unable to remember the code or that he had difficulty recalling it later on. In fact, the passage states that Ho ""learned"" the code, suggesting that he was able to commit it to memory without needing to write it down. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg helte vatnet i glaset,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Vatnet sløkte tørsten min"" (The water evaporated and quenched my thirst) will occur."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He wanted to offer his friend support) is more likely. The text states that the man was quiet when his friend had finished speaking, indicating that he may have been reflecting on what his friend said or considering how he could help. This suggests that he wanted to offer his friend support rather than simply thinking about what his friend had said.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ulykka var mi skuld,"" option A (Eg følde skuld) is more likely. The use of the word ""skuld"" implies a sense of responsibility or guilt, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kjedene gjekk frå kvarandre,"" option A is more likely. The word ""gjekk"" implies movement or action, suggesting that something inside the chain was moving or acting upon it. Option B does not provide a clear explanation for why the chain would be broken. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dei vart trøytte av å krangle) is more likely as it suggests that the group was unhappy or annoyed with each other, which could have led to a compromise being reached.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Ho henta ein leiar for valkampanjen) is more likely to be the correct answer. The passage states that Ho ""bestemte seg for å stille som presidentkandidat,"" indicating that he decided to run as a candidate for president. This suggests that Ho may have prepared a platform or manifesto for his campaign, rather than relying solely on legal arguments to support his candidacy. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han had packed warm clothing in his bag) is more likely. The sentence suggests that he was prepared for cold weather by bringing appropriate clothing, which aligns with Option A. Option B does not provide any information about the type of luggage he used or how much he packed, making it less relevant to the context.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He took a stupid piece) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Støvet kom i augo hans) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's eyes were cloudy. The word ""støvet"" in Norwegian means ""dust,"" so it is possible that something got into his eyes, causing them to become cloudy or irritated. Option B (""Han la ein skyggeskje over augo"") does not provide a clear reason as to why the man's eyes are cloudy."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Motstanderen hennar skuldde ho for å fuska) is more likely. The use of ""skuld"" (guilt) in this context suggests that the opponent deliberately cheated to win the matches, rather than simply feeling sorry or regretful about their actions."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han fekk med seg studenten som fuska) is more likely. The fact that the teacher ripped up the exam suggests that there was a deliberate act of sabotage or cheating involved, rather than simple mistakes made by the student.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Eg mista røysta mi) is the most likely cause of why the speaker stopped talking. This is because ""mista"" means ""lost"" or ""missed,"" suggesting that the speaker may have lost their train of thought or forgotten what they were going to say. Option B (Eg vart utan andedrag) means ""I was without breath,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence as it does not provide a clear reason for why the speaker stopped talking."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Eg sette han i mikrobølgeovnen) is the correct answer. The use of a microwave oven to thaw frozen food is a common practice, while covering something with plastic wrap may not be effective or safe for cooking purposes. Therefore, option A is the most plausible solution.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (He had stomach cramps) is the correct answer. The phrase ""magekramper"" is a common Norwegian term for stomach cramps or abdominal pain, so this option is a plausible explanation for why he was late to work as he was feeling unwell."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta landa i bassenget,"" option A (Ho sprang på bassengdekk) is the most likely cause. The word ""sprang"" implies a sudden and forceful movement, which aligns with the idea of landing in a pool or basin. Option B (""Ho hoppa frå springbretta"") does not fit as well with the given context, as it means ""She jumped from a trampoline,"" which would not result in landing in a pool."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (The tickets to the movie were sold out) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Bileta til kinoen var utsolde"" implies that there are no available tickets left for the movie at the cinema, which suggests that the film is popular and has been selling well. This supports Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Folk isolated him) is more likely. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""Mannen mista vekt,"" which means ""The man lost weight."" This implies that he was previously overweight or obese, and has now lost some of this excess weight. Isolating oneself from social situations can be a common coping mechanism for people who are struggling with body image issues or low self-esteem, so it's possible that the man in question may have chosen to isolate himself as a way to deal with his weight loss. On the other hand, giving someone compliments could potentially make them feel uncomfortable or defensive if they are not used to receiving positive feedback. Therefore, option A is more likely based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Henderne til jenta vart blære,"" option A (Ho skriv opp eit brev) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""henderne til jenta"" means ""the girl's legs,"" and ""blære"" means ""pain."" Writing a letter may be a way for the girl to express her pain or frustration."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Publiken jubla i undring) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the audience will be in a state of amazement or wonder due to the circus artist's juggling skills. The second option does not align with the given premise as it mentions an acrobat swinging from a trapeze, which is not related to juggling. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg mista tålmodigheten min,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Venen min lét meg venta"" means ""My patience will make me wait."" This suggests that the speaker is willing to be patient and wait for something to happen, rather than taking action themselves. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dei forhandla ut ein pakt) is more likely. The text states that ""dei stridande landa ville ha fred,"" indicating that they wanted peace, rather than developing nuclear weapons or negotiating a treaty. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han vart døsig) is correct. The phrase ""han tog sovemedisin"" suggests that he took a sleeping pill, which could potentially cause death or unconsciousness. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Benet på sofaen slapp av) is more likely to happen as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman might be feeling relieved after sitting on the couch. Option B (Ho fekk blåmerke på kneet) does not provide any context or reason why the woman would have a blue mark on her knee. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen klemte ballongen,"" option A is more likely. The word ""sprakk"" means ""spoke"" in Norwegian, so it's unlikely that the balloons spoke. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dei gjekk til flyplassen) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg beit i fersken,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Persiken er blåskadd"" (The strawberry is bruised) is correct. The word ""fersken"" means ""strawberry"", so the speaker is suggesting that the strawberry is damaged or hurt in some way."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Henderne mine vart klebrige,"" it is more likely that option A (Eg åt ein donut) is the correct answer. The word ""klebrige"" in Norwegian means sticky or gooey, so it is unlikely that the speaker had a sweet tooth."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg trekte på døra"", it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Døren opna seg"". This is because the verb ""trekke"" means to pull or tug, which suggests that there was a force applied to the door, causing it to open."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (the products were tested for quality assurance) is the correct cause of the activists' boycott. This is because the scenario mentions that the activists are protesting against the company's ""quality control,"" suggesting that there may be concerns about the safety or effectiveness of the products being produced by the company. It does not provide any evidence to suggest that the products were made through child labor, which would be the implication of option B. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the activists' actions."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg borra eit hull i veggen,"" option A is more likely. The word ""borra"" means to dig or bore a hole in Norwegian, so it's likely that something was inserted into the wall rather than something coming out of it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Sysken hennar skilde seg) is more likely. The phrase ""sysken hennar"" implies that there was a rift or separation between the two sisters, which suggests that they were not in good terms with each other. This is supported by the fact that the speaker is following her sister's misfortune, implying that she may have had negative feelings towards her sister. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg spilde vin på skjorta mi,"" option A (Eg tok på meg eit forklæde) is more likely. The word ""spilde"" in Norwegian means ""to waste or spend foolishly,"" so it's unlikely that the speaker would have taken a shower with their shirt on. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given text, option A (Kunden leita i lommeboka si) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""leita i lommeboka"" means ""to take out of the wallet,"" indicating that the customer is paying for something using their own money or credit card. Option B (""Kunden gjev henne pengane"") means ""The customer gives her money,"" which does not align with the context provided in the passage. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Folk gav han skifte) is more likely. The word ""trekte"" in the premise implies that something was taken from him, which aligns with Option A's interpretation of people giving him change. Option B does not make sense in this context as it would imply that he sent people away, which is not a feasible or logical outcome based on the information given."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den vesle guten gret til barnevaktaren sin,"" option A (Han savna foreldra sine) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""vesle guten"" suggests that the child is small or young, and the fact that he/she is greeted by the babysitter implies that the child is not with his/her parents at the time of the greeting. Therefore, it is more likely that the child has been separated from his/her parents than that it was lunchtime."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Pilotane flaug gjennom stormen) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Treet kasta blada sine"", option A (Blada vart farga) is more likely. The word ""farga"" in this context means ""went away"". So, the sentence implies that the tree cast its shade somewhere else, rather than collecting it on the ground. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He decided to play a prank on his sister) is more likely. The text suggests that the boy was in a bad mood, and playing a prank on his sister might be a way to distract himself from his negative emotions.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Far his gave him a drink) is more likely. The premise suggests that Barnet's father gave him something to drink, rather than stopping the car at a gas station.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the fish will jump out of the aquarium than to swim towards the food. Therefore, option A (Fish jumps out of the aquarium) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ho bytte parti) is more likely to be the outcome. The premise suggests that the woman's political opinion has changed, indicating a shift in her beliefs or values. This change is more likely to occur through a process of reflection and reevaluation, such as switching parties, rather than through a one-time event like participating in a protest.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Eg helte avløpsrensar i det) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of a person trying to stop their sink from running by fixing the leaky drain pipe.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Toget kom til stasjonen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He stengde the convolute) is more likely. The man pressed down on the wet seal of the envelope, indicating that he closed or sealed it.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Dei liked to be together) is the correct answer. The fact that they did not have contact suggests that there was a deliberate effort to avoid each other, rather than simply moving away to different towns.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ho vart kasta frå stillinga si) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ho vart kasta"" means ""he was cast away,"" which implies that he was removed from his position as a manager due to poor performance or misconduct. This is supported by the statement ""Revisoren forvalta ikkje selskapets pengar,"" which suggests that he was not managing the company's finances properly. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Eg høyrde klokken tikka) is a more likely cause than option B (Eg ville sjekka tida). This is because the word ""tikka"" in Norwegian means ""ticking"", so it suggests that the speaker heard the sound of a clock ticking. Option B does not provide any context or clues to suggest why the speaker would want to check the time."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Eg skreiv essayet for hand) is a more plausible explanation than option B (Kona mi og eg heldt hand). The phrase ""han hadde ein kramper i handa"" suggests that there was some kind of discomfort or cramp in his hand, which could make it difficult to write an essay. Therefore, option A is a more logical choice as it takes into account the physical limitation caused by the cramp. Option B does not provide any explanation for why he would hold hands with someone else while experiencing this discomfort."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Eg byttet ut bolt) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Boltane trekkte seg saman"" suggests that something is wrong with the bolt, and therefore it is more likely that the problem can be solved by replacing the bolt rather than turning the key."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Paret flytta inn i leiligheten) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ho ville sjå solnedgangen) is more likely as it aligns with the context of a person sitting outside enjoying nature's beauty. The phrase ""ho trudde ho"" doesn't make sense in this context and seems out of place. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han kunne ikkje symja) is more likely. The sentence ""Mannen hadde på seg ein livvest i vatnet"" implies that the man was wearing a life vest in the water, but the word ""ikkje"" suggests that he couldn't swim or didn't know how to use the life vest properly, leading to the conclusion that he couldn't keep himself afloat. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ho slette dokumentet) occurred. The reason being that pressing the backspace button does not result in deleting a document, but rather erasing one character to the left of the cursor position. Therefore, if the user accidentally pressed the backspace button while typing, they might have deleted an entire word or sentence instead of just one character.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ho fekk ein dårleg karacter) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ho fekk"" means ""he/she got"" in Norwegian, and ""dårleg"" means ""stupid"". Therefore, the sentence suggests that the person in question has a stupid character."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gresset var mudderig,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Det regna over natta,"" is the correct answer. The word ""mudderig"" means dirty or messy in Norwegian, so it suggests that there was a lot of rain at night. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ho sovna over,"" option A (Ho overnatt på eit hotel) is the most likely cause. The sentence suggests that the speaker may have overslept or missed an appointment because they stayed at a hotel. Option B (""Ho gløymde å stilla vekkerklokka"") does not make sense in this context as it means something like ""I forgot to turn off my alarm clock."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen sette på solkrem,"" option A (Han sat i skuggen) is the most likely cause. The word ""solkrem"" means sun cream in Norwegian, so it's unlikely that the man would be sitting directly in the sun without protection. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Forskarane trekte tilbake teorien) is more likely. The text states that ""forskarane beviste teorien,"" indicating that scientists proved the theory, but then goes on to say that they retracted it. This suggests that the scientific evidence supporting the theory was not strong enough to withstand scrutiny, leading to its retraction. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the match went into overtime) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the fans were disappointed. The other option does not provide any clear reasoning for why the fans would be upset.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Låsen sprang opp) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Far gave sonen nokre pengar) is more likely. The word ""nokre"" in this context means ""money"", so it suggests that Far gave his son a large amount of money. This is consistent with the idea that he wanted to help him financially. Option B (""Far took sonen sin i handa"") does not convey the same meaning and is therefore less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eg skotta snøen ut av vegen) is more likely. The sentence ""Sneen hadde stengt oppføringsveggen"" implies that there was a blockage or obstruction in the way of the snowplow's path, making it difficult for the plow to clear the road. Therefore, option B, which involves scattering the snow out of the way, is more likely to be effective in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kajakkarane padla på rora sine"", option A is more likely. The word ""padla"" means ""reached"" or ""arrived"", so it's likely that the kayaker reached the coast."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ho lét handvalet gå) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""mista kontrollen over sykkelen"" suggests that the rider lost control of their bicycle, which could lead to a crash or fall. Option B (Ho krasja inn i eit gjerde) implies that the rider hit something hard with their bike, but it does not necessarily imply loss of control. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Vatn sprutast på huden min) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Eg sette på ventilatoren"" suggests that the person is using a ventilator, which is typically used in medical settings to help patients breathe. The word ""vatn"" means water in Norwegian, so it's possible that the person is experiencing excessive sweating due to heat or other factors. Option B (Eg følde kjøleg luft gå over meg) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""kjøleg"" means cold air in Norwegian, and it would be unlikely for someone to feel cold air when they are already using a ventilator. Therefore, option A is the best answer based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dei var våte) is more likely as a cause for why surfers returned to the beach. The premise suggests that something unusual happened at the beach, such as heavy rain or rough seas, causing the surfers to retreat back to shore. Option B (Dei saw an whale) does not align with the given information and seems less plausible as a reason for their return.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vatnet gjekk ut av karet) is more likely to occur. The word ""gjekk"" in Norwegian means ""went out"", so it's clear that the water will come out of the bathtub rather than stay inside or splash onto the floor. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He confessed to her about his infidelity) is more likely. The man in the scenario is feeling guilty about cheating on his wife, indicating that he has already acknowledged his wrongdoing to himself. Therefore, it is more likely that he will choose to confront his wife directly and be honest about his actions rather than simply feeling guilty without taking any action.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Blekk på plakatet blei smurt,"" option A (Eg venta på at blekk skulle tørka) is the most likely cause. The word ""venta"" in this context means to wait or expect something, so it implies that the speaker was waiting for the paint to dry before continuing with whatever task they were doing."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had a nightmare) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Barnet vakna og skreik"" suggests that something frightening or disturbing occurred during the night, which could be interpreted as a nightmare. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why he woke up screaming."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Far hans sette seg ved bordet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Venen min snudde hovudet mod mig,"" option A (Eg ropa navnet hans) is the most likely cause. The sentence suggests that someone turned their head towards the speaker, implying a physical action that could be caused by an external force such as a sudden movement or a sound. Option B (Eg sveiv med armene) does not fit with this context and implies a different type of action, such as waving one's arms in frustration or excitement."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Borgarane gjorde opprør) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Han skreik etter hjelp) is more likely. The fact that the boy was lost in the forest suggests that he may not have had the resources or knowledge to set up a tent, especially if he was alone and scared. Therefore, it is more likely that he would have shouted for help rather than trying to find shelter on his own.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan reiste utanlands,"" it is more likely that she wanted to learn about other cultures (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (one of his colleagues had a breakthrough) is more likely. The sentence ""Mannen var misunneleg på kollegaen sin"" implies that the man was jealous of his colleague's success or achievement, rather than the other way around. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had hallucinations) is the correct answer. The man's experience of seeing UFOs and aliens suggests that he may have been experiencing some kind of psychological or neurological event, such as a hallucination, rather than being in a state of meditation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen fekk blonda hår,"" it is more likely that he used bleach rather than shampoo to lighten his hair. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Ho criticized the new work) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""Kunstneren had created a new piece of art,"" implying that the artist has produced something new and innovative. However, the critic Ho did not approve of this new work, as the passage notes that he ""criticized the fyrre artwork."" Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he was drafted into the military) is the correct answer. The phrase ""flytta bort frå heimen"" suggests that something significant has happened to him, and the fact that he was ""utleidd frå militæret"" further supports this interpretation."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Regular were covered with dust) is the correct answer. The statement ""dey fell out of bookshelf"" implies a gradual process rather than a sudden event like an earthquake, which would be less likely to cover them with dust."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Eg tendra eit lys) is more likely to occur. The sentence ""Strømmen i huset mitt gjekk av"" means ""The current in my house went out,"" indicating that there is a power outage. Therefore, it is more likely that someone will turn on a light to brighten up the room rather than changing the breaker."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vi gjekk på berg- og dalbane,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct, as the sentence suggests an unpleasant or negative experience on a roller coaster."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Eg helte smør i veska) caused the popcorn to burn. This is because heating butter in a pan can lead to burning or scorching, especially if the heat is too high or the butter is not stirred properly. In contrast, warming up the popcorn in the microwave oven may be less likely to result in burning, as the microwaves will cook the kernels evenly and at a lower temperature than a traditional stove top. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the burnt popcorn.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, option A (Strømmen i kvartalet gjekk ut) is more likely to be the cause of the power outage. The phrase ""gjekk ut"" means ""went out,"" indicating that there was a loss of electricity supply from within the quarter. This suggests that an internal issue with the electrical system occurred, rather than external factors such as strong winds ( Option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he offended or hurt the audience's feelings (Option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Det dryppa eit svettkrølle frå andletet mitt) is more likely to occur than option B (Ein bloddråpe danna seg på fingeren min). This is because sweating is a common bodily function that can occur when a person is nervous or anxious, while bleeding from the finger is less likely to happen without any obvious cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fisken svevde på overflaten i tanken,"" it is more likely that the fish was dead (Option B). The phrase ""svevde på overfladen"" means ""floating on the surface,"" which suggests that the fish's body was no longer functioning or moving, indicating death."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Røysta til mannen høyrde hæs,"" option A (Han var forkjøla) is the most likely cause. The word ""forkjøla"" means ""to be drunk"" in Norwegian, so it is likely that the man was intoxicated rather than having stopped smoking."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Elevatoren kom til den utpekte etasjen) is a more plausible explanation for why the doors to the elevator opened at the designated floor than option B (Heisaren vart fast mellom etasjer). This is because there is no indication in the premise that the elevator was stuck between floors; rather, it simply states that the doors opened at the designated floor. Therefore, it is more likely that the elevator actually reached the desired floor and opened its doors accordingly."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (he lied to his parents) is the correct answer. The premise states that the ten-year-old snuck out of the house, implying that he did not have permission from his parents to do so. Therefore, it is likely that he lied to them in order to leave the house without their knowledge or consent.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Toalettet hadde overfloom) is a more plausible explanation for why there was water in the basement than option B (Vassoppvarmaren gjekk i stykker). This is because it is unlikely that the hot water tank would burst and flood the basement without any warning signs or other indications of potential failure. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hunden var verand når eiaren sin,"" option A (Eigaren la ein krage på valpen) is the most likely cause. The word ""verand"" in Norwegian means ""changed"", so it suggests that something unexpected happened to the dog. Option A aligns with this meaning by stating that the owner put a collar on the dog, which is an unusual action for someone who has changed their pet. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen fanga speglinga si,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""under det store treet"" suggests that the man is standing beneath a large tree, which could potentially create a shadow that would reflect in the water. Option B does not provide any context that would suggest why the man might be standing above the red sea."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Eg ringde henne tilbake) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hunden deira rømde heimefrå) is the more likely cause for the dog's disappearance. The phrase ""deira"" in Norwegian means ""their"", indicating that the dog belongs to someone or something. Therefore, it is more probable that the dog wandered off from its home rather than being stolen by an animal."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg saw a ghost when I looked out,"" option A is more likely to be correct because it matches the context of the sentence better than option B does. The word ""kold"" (cold) in Norwegian is often used to describe weather conditions, so it makes sense that the speaker would say ""It was cold outside."" Option B, however, doesn't quite fit with the rest of the sentence, as there isn't really anything in the premise that suggests the speaker felt tight or constrained in any way."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Dei ville ha bereit arbeidsvilkår) is more likely as the reason for wanting to form a union. The text states that the employees wanted better working conditions, indicating that they were not satisfied with their current work environment. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg bake ei eplepaie,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something sweet is being baked in the kitchen, which would produce a pleasant smell. Option B does not provide any context or clues to suggest why the kitchen might be filled with a warm aroma."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ho hadde på seg høge hælar) is more likely as it provides a physical explanation for why the woman was struggling to walk. Having high heels on can make it difficult to walk comfortably, especially if they are too tall or uncomfortable to wear. Option B (Ho took off her shoes) does not provide any specific reason why the woman would be struggling to walk, and could potentially be due to other factors such as fatigue or disability.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (vatnet kokte) is the correct answer. The phrase ""dampen steig opp av vatnet"" suggests that something is rising or coming up from the water, which could be caused by evaporation if the water is hot enough to produce steam. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person's hair is damp."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Alle sokkene mine var i vaskeriet,"" it is more likely that option A (Eg hadde på meg sandaler) is correct. The reason is that if all of one's shoes were in the washing machine, it is unlikely that they would have been wearing sandals at the time. Sandals are typically worn in warmer weather or for specific activities such as beach trips or hiking, so it is less likely that someone would be wearing them while doing laundry. Therefore, option A is the more plausible choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (He lost support from voters) is more likely. The argument made by the politician was seen as absurd, indicating that he may have lost credibility with his constituents. This could lead to a decrease in support for him among voters.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the couple went away) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Milionæren ville at bygningen sollte rivast ned) is correct. The sentence ""Bygningen var dedikert til millionaren"" implies that the building was dedicated to a wealthy person, and therefore it would make sense for them to want to tear it down. Option B does not provide any context or reason as to why the wealthy person would give money to build something."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Salgskonsulenten saw jenta leggja merchandise in vesken hennar) is the more likely cause. The wording of the premise suggests that the sales consultant saw something unusual or suspicious in the girl's bag, implying that she may have been attempting to steal something. This is supported by the fact that the word ""klandra"" means ""to steal"" in Norwegian. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the information given in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Soldatar blei samla with family) is more likely. The text states that ""soldatar"" was sent out to fight in a war, indicating that they were not able to take their families with them. Therefore, it is more likely that the soldiers were separated from their families during the conflict."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Det braut ut eit opprør framfor rettsbygningen) is more likely to occur as a result of the controversial decision being made by the court. This is because an uprising or protest is often seen as a way for people to express their dissent or opposition to a decision that they feel is unjust or unfair. In contrast, giving oneself up in lieu of arrest is typically seen as a last resort or a sign of surrender, rather than a proactive response to a controversial decision. Therefore, option A is more likely to be chosen as the outcome based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta lukta noko brennende,"" option A (Ho tok kjeksene ut av kruka) is the more likely cause. The word ""lukta"" in Norwegian means ""smelled"", so it's likely that something burning caused a strong odor. Taking cookies out of an oven would be a common action that could result in this situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Det regna som ein tømmerskel,"" option A (Orkan vart verre) is more likely. The phrase ""tømmerskel"" means a heavy downpour or storm, so it's likely that an intense storm was present during the event described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (Elevatoren slutta å fungere) is the most likely cause of the building's evacuation. The fact that the elevator stopped working suggests a technical failure or malfunction, which could be a significant safety concern for people inside the building. Therefore, it is more likely that the building was evacuated due to an issue with the elevator rather than the fire alarm going off.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Far sparka sonen sin ut av huset) is more likely. The phrase ""sparka sonen sin"" means to kick out or throw out someone, which suggests that the father is taking a harsher approach towards his son's alcoholism than buying him a beer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sekretæren gjekk heim for dagen) is more likely. The fact that the lawyer's office is located in a building with an elevator suggests that there may be other people present who could have caused the noise, such as secretaries or clients. However, since the premise states that only the lawyer's assistant was present, it is more likely that she was responsible for making the noise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen var irritert på venen sin,"" option A is more likely. The man was annoyed at his vein, which suggests that he may have had a problem with it or been frustrated by it in some way. Therefore, option A is the most plausible cause for why the man's vein broke off."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kassereren gav jenta vekslinga) is more likely. The word ""gav"" in Norwegian means ""gave"", so it implies that the cashier gave the woman a change."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ho blei lam i ein ulykke) is the correct answer. The phrase ""sett i ein rullestol"" suggests that the woman was sitting in a wheelchair, which implies that she may have been injured or disabled in some way. This supports the idea that she ended up in the hospital due to an accident or illness. Option B does not provide any specific details that support this conclusion."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Landet feira sjølvstende) is more likely to be the cause of the country's flag being raised outside its home territory without permission. This is because the premise suggests that the country is experiencing financial difficulties, which could lead to a lack of resources for international missions and flag-raising ceremonies. Therefore, it is more plausible that the country would raise its own flag rather than borrowing or renting another nation's flag.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dei inspirerte tilhengjarane sine) is more likely. The use of the word ""inspirerte"" suggests that the team's performance had a positive impact on their fans, rather than causing them to be disappointed or frustrated."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Venen min sa at eg hadde mat fast i tennene mine,"" option A (Eg følgde mig flau) is more likely. This is because the phrase ""hadde mat fast i tennene mine"" suggests a feeling of discomfort or unease, which would be consistent with following oneself in a subdued or hesitant manner."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He was bored in class) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the situation provided. The sentence ""Han var oppteken i klassen"" means ""He was bored in class,"" indicating that he lacked interest or engagement in his academic work. This is a common cause for poor performance in school."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (an earthquake) is more likely to be the cause of the building's collapse than option B (increase in crime). An earthquake can cause widespread destruction and damage to buildings, including collapses, while an increase in crime may not necessarily lead to a building collapse. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Han bad henne take him with her) is more likely. The use of the word ""bad"" in this context implies a sense of urgency or importance, which suggests that he wants to be taken with her."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the ball rolls away) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Rakunen ransa søppelkassa"", option A is more likely. The word ""rakune"" means to throw or drop something carelessly, so it's more likely that there was trash in the pocket than the pocket itself being made of trash."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen skarpa blyanten,"" option A (Det var billeg) is the more likely cause. The word ""billeg"" means ""sharp"" in Norwegian, so it suggests that something was sharp or pointed enough to pierce through the boy's head. Option B (""Det var kjedeleg"") does not provide any context that would suggest a sharp object as the cause of injury."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ho mista kvittinga si) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ho mista kvittinga si"" means ""I lost my ticket,"" indicating that the speaker has misplaced their train ticket and cannot retrieve it. This is a common occurrence and a plausible reason why someone might not have their money back after buying a dress. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Skrape i huden min var djup,"" option B is more likely. The word ""arr"" means wound or scratch in Norwegian, so it's likely that the speaker has a deep wound rather than just a superficial scrape."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han stirra på jorda) is more likely. The man is staring at the ground, indicating that he may be lost in thought or preoccupied with something else rather than talking to himself.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Myrene kravla til smulkane) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sysken til kvinna foldte hendene) is more likely as it suggests that the woman's son gave her a hug, which is a common gesture of affection and support. Option B (Sysken til kvinna byrja å gråta) implies that the woman's son started crying, which may not be as likely or appropriate in this context.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen tog en mint"", option A is more likely. The word ""sprekke"" means ""to speak"" in Norwegian, so it's unlikely that the man was unable to speak due to a dry mouth. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dei forventa traffic around the theater) is more likely. The text states that they were supposed to see the show early, implying that they were running late due to traffic.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Sjefen hennar roste ho) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""sjefen hennar roste ho"" means ""the boss hit her,"" indicating that the woman was physically abused by her employer. This is a serious issue that can have severe consequences for the victim's well-being and safety. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han støtta deira sak) is more likely. The man signed a letter of support for the activists, indicating that he agrees with their cause and wants to help them in some way. This contradicts option B (Han Fordømte dei som gale), which suggests that he condemns or criticizes the activists.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had stage fright) is the correct answer. The text states that he ""flattra"" before his performance, which suggests a strong feeling of anxiety or nervousness. This is consistent with the definition of stage fright, which is a common phenomenon where performers experience excessive fear or anxiety when performing in front of an audience."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Eg telde pengane mine) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Eg var fortaft"" means ""I was lost,"" so it makes sense that the person might have told someone where they kept their money. Option B (""Eg opna eit kart"") means ""I opened a card,"" which doesn't fit with the context of being lost."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dei mogne fruktane blei liggjande i sola,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Det vart et,"" is correct. The word ""vart"" in Norwegian means ""was,"" so the sentence would translate to ""There were fruit lying in the sun."" Option B, ""Han krympa opp,"" does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of a person or entity expanding or growing."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (Eg starta på) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""bilen gjekk i stykker"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the car's engine or transmission, which could potentially cause it to stop working properly. The other option, ""motoren overopphetast,"" means ""the motor overheated,"" but this does not necessarily explain why the car stopped working. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the car suddenly stopped running."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Han var liggjaring i senga i flere dager) is more likely. The man's failure to seek medical attention despite his severe back injury suggests that he may be experiencing emotional or psychological distress that is preventing him from seeking help.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Eg hadde ikkje lenger ved) is more likely as it implies that there was no longer anything burning in the house, whereas option B (Det var kaldt i huset) simply means that it was cold inside the house without any implication of a fire.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ho slutta å jogga,"" option A (Ho has a cramp in his side) is more likely as a cause for stopping to run."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg banka på døra til naboen min"", option B is more likely. The word ""banka"" means to knock, so it's unlikely that the neighbor invited you in. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Mannens misforståelse av hennes bekymringar) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the man misunderstood the woman's concerns, which could lead to a lack of empathy or understanding towards her feelings. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Studenten svara spørsmålet rett) is more likely to be the cause of the teacher's praise. The premise states that the teacher praised the student for answering the question correctly, indicating that the student's correct answer was the reason for the praise. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan fekk ikkje meir egg,"" it is more likely that she went to the grocery store (option B). The phrase ""ikkje meir"" means ""not any more,"" indicating that she has run out of eggs and needs to restock."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Eg avsløra ei hemmelighet for han) is more likely. The phrase ""eg avsløra"" means ""I will reveal"" in English, indicating that the speaker plans to share a secret with the old friend. This suggests that the speaker wants to reconnect with their friend by sharing something personal or meaningful. Option B (Eg gav han eit klem) means ""I gave him a hug,"" which is a more casual and less significant gesture compared to revealing a secret. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ho heldt seg frå å gå i sjøen,"" option A (Ho fanga ein fisk) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""heldt seg"" means ""kept himself"" or ""held back,"" so it's unlikely that he would have caught a fish in this situation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Paraplyet hans var brote) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the student came to class wet and wet. It is unlikely that someone would steal his umbrella without him noticing or caring. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the user clicks on the mouse) is a more likely cause for the cursor to move on the screen than option B (the user moves the mouse). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Det har vore ein ulykke på hovudvegen) is the correct answer. The phrase ""took a wrong turn"" suggests that the driver made an error while driving, which could lead to an accident or other unfortunate event. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the driver took a detour through the woods."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Linen has dried) is more likely. The sentence ""Det våte lakenet på vasklinjen ute"" implies that the towel was recently wet and has now had time to dry. Therefore, it is more likely that the towel has dried than that it is flecked."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ho la på seg solbrilla,"" Option A (Solskjellet var sterkt) is the most likely cause. The sentence suggests that the sun was shining brightly, which could have caused discomfort or even burns if proper protection was not worn. Therefore, it is more likely that the person had to call for a taxi due to the unpleasant weather conditions rather than because they were feeling hungry."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen stirra på nattehimmelen,"" it is more likely that he was gazing up at the night sky (Option B). The phrase ""stirra"" suggests a deliberate act of looking or gazing, and the context implies that he was admiring the beauty of the night sky rather than wishing for summer weather."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg følde meg utmattet,"" option A is more likely. The correct answer is (A) Eg gjekk tidleg til sengs."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Han hadde ikkje hatt hår) is more likely as it implies that the man did not have hair to begin with, rather than his hair growing long.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Drengen took it upon himself to welcome the new classmate) is a more likely cause than option B (Drungen liked him not). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that there was a positive interaction between the two boys, rather than a negative one.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg hadde lyst på eit glas mjølk,"" option A (Eg åt kake) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sjåføren tømte på forlykta) is more likely. The word ""tømte"" in Norwegian means to empty or drain something, so it's unlikely that the driver would have switched cars behind them."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Eg parkerte tvers over gata) is more likely. The text states that ""the parking spaces in the building were empty,"" indicating that there was no available parking space inside the building. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker parked their car across the street or near the entrance of the building rather than inside the building where the parking spaces are empty."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (Ho had write-blocks) caused the delay. Write-blocks are a common phenomenon where a writer experiences difficulty in starting or continuing to write due to various reasons such as lack of inspiration, fear of failure, or distractions. It can be a significant obstacle for writers, especially those who rely heavily on their writing skills for income. Therefore, it is plausible that Ho experienced write-blocks and missed the deadline as a result.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Eg bad om å føre snakke med ein leiar) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""bad om"" means ""want to"" in Norwegian, so it suggests that the speaker wants to speak with someone specific. Option B does not provide any context or reason for why the speaker would give their identification number to someone. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the speaker's actions based on the provided information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vinden blåste gjennom det oppne vinduet,"" option A (Dørklokken ringte) is more likely. The wind blowing through an open window would not cause a doorbell to ring."
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Eg trekte ut lampen) caused the power surge in the house. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vektløftaren grunt,"" option A is more likely. The word ""grunt"" suggests that the weightlifter was making a noise while lifting the barbell, which is consistent with Option A. Option B does not fit as well because it implies that the weightlifter was looking at himself in the mirror, which is unlikely given the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (He was confused) is more likely. The student may have been struggling to understand the problem or how to use a calculator, leading to confusion and frustration.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Faren bytte bleie til barnet) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that something was exchanged for the child, implying a transaction or trade, which is consistent with Option A. Option B (Farenrokka spedfølet forsigtig) does not provide any information about an exchange or transaction.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the boy has a headache) is more likely. The premise mentions that the boy is ""kasta"" (cast), which implies that he is experiencing some discomfort or pain. A headache is a common symptom of many things, including stress, fatigue, and illness, so it is plausible that the boy has a headache due to one of these reasons. Option B (the boy was wet) does not provide any context or explanation for why the boy might have a headache, making it less likely as an answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Fotografane vart uskarpe) is more likely. The use of ""gløymde"" in the premise suggests that something was done incorrectly or poorly, which aligns with the meaning of ""uskarpe"". Therefore, it is more likely that the photographer made a mistake while using the flash, resulting in underexposed images."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (Eg was alone) is the correct answer. This is because there is no indication in the scenario that the person was outside of the city, so it is more plausible that they were alone rather than being somewhere else entirely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg traina,"" option A (Eg følde meg energisk) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg pressa den fuktige svampen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Det hadde teke opp vatn,"" will occur. This is because the word ""fuktig"" means moist or damp in Norwegian, indicating that the mushroom is likely to absorb water rather than have water come out of it. Therefore, option A, where the water takes up space inside the mushroom, is a more plausible outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the resort was booked) is more likely. The sentence ""Dei ferjeborna tok ein ferje til feriestaden"" implies that the people took a boat to the resort, which suggests that it was not located on an island. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ho var redd for nålar) is more likely. The phrase ""var redd for"" means ""was afraid of,"" so it suggests that the person was scared or worried about something. Option B (""opprør"") means ""rebellion,"" but given the context of the sentence, it seems less likely that a ten-year-old would be thinking about causing trouble or rebelling against authority figures."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Eg vart mistenksom"". This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the car was parked outside the house without permission, which could lead to suspicion or curiosity from the owner of the house. Option B, ""Eg ringde politiet"", implies a more direct action taken in response to the situation, but does not necessarily convey the same level of uncertainty or suspicion as option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bevisane implicierte ham) is more likely. The text states that ""the defendant gave himself up,"" indicating that he had something to hide or was trying to avoid responsibility. This suggests that there may have been evidence against him, which could imply his guilt. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He held himself back from caffeine) is more likely. The premise states that the man decided to go down in weight, which suggests that he may have been trying to limit his calorie intake or exercise more. Holding oneself back from caffeine can help with this goal by reducing energy levels and making it easier to stick to a healthy diet and exercise plan.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta trakk på isen,"" option A (Ho glytt) is more likely. The word ""glytt"" means ""glided"" or ""slid,"" so it suggests that the girl was able to move smoothly across the ice without any difficulty. Option B (""Ho skjelva"") means ""She stumbled,"" which would suggest that the girl had trouble moving across the ice and may have even fallen."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ho vart stående oppe heile natta) is the correct answer. The phrase ""hadde ringar under augo"" suggests that she was experiencing some kind of discomfort or pain, which could be caused by standing for a long time. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vulkanen gjekk i utbrot) is more likely. The sentence ""Lava rennte ut fra vulkanen"" implies that there was an eruption of lava from the volcano, which means that the volcano was in a state of activity. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ho tok på seg sko,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that Ho took off his shoes, which implies that he was at a place where it was acceptable or expected to remove one's shoes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ho lét meg gå gjennom tollboaa) is more likely. The phrase ""let me go through the toll booth"" implies that the speaker has intentionally stopped at a toll booth and is willing to pay the fee. Option B (""Heldt meg på ved tolla"") means ""Was held up at the toll,"" which suggests that something unexpected happened to the speaker while passing through the toll booth. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (He sold his shares in the company) is the correct answer. This is because the passage states that he ""sold all of his shares"" in the company, indicating that he actively made a decision to sell them rather than simply losing or mismanaging his money."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Legen was on leave) is the correct answer. The phrase ""mannen gjekk til legen"" suggests that the man went to the doctor's office, implying that he was feeling unwell or sick. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man went to the doctor's office."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (the house was on fire) caused the smoke coming from the room through the window. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fingrarne til guten vart prune,"" option A (Han took a long bath) is the more likely cause. The word ""prune"" in Norwegian means ""to take a bath."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker meant for the phrase to be interpreted as ""He took a long bath,"" rather than ""He scrubbed his hands with soap."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg spytt ut mjølka,"" it is more likely that option A (Mjølka smaka sur) is correct. The word ""spytt"" means ""to spit out"" in Norwegian, so it implies that something unpleasant or sour was spat out, which fits with the idea of mjølka being sour. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg mista bussen,"" option A (Eg var tidlig på jobb) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the car was damaged (Option B). The phrase ""lastbilen kolliderte med bilen"" implies a collision occurred between two vehicles, and the word ""knust"" specifically means ""crushed."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dei vann) is more likely to happen.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Eg snudde flaska) caused the problem. The fact that the lid was loose suggests that someone may have accidentally knocked or jostled the bottle, causing it to leak. It is less likely that option B (Eg skru av lokket) would be the cause, as this action would not typically result in a leaky bottle. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Han klatrer opp på taket) is more likely. The text states that the boy was locked out of his house, indicating that he does not have access to the windows or any other means of entering the house from inside. Therefore, climbing up onto the roof would be the most feasible way for him to enter the house. Option A (He kravla inn gjennom et opent vindu) is less likely as there is no indication in the premise that the window is open or unlocked.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Kvinna peika gjennom låghullet i døra) is more likely to occur as it provides a logical explanation for why the visitor would be looking through the keyhole of the door. Option A (Besøkaren banka på døren) does not provide any specific reason why the visitor would be knocking on the door.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen flekka drakten sin,"" option A (Han har det i vaskeria) is the more likely answer. The word ""flekka"" in Norwegian means to wash or clean something, so it's likely that the man put his dirty laundry in the washing machine rather than hanging it in a closet."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tannkremet sprut ut av røret) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that something is being forced or pushed out of the toothbrush holder, rather than simply being spat out by someone. Therefore, it is more likely that the toothpaste will come shooting out of the toothbrush holder than for the girl to spit out the tooth cream.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Pacifists set up a protest) is more likely to be the chosen action for the pacifists in this scenario. This is because setting up a protest is a common form of peaceful resistance used by activists and pacifists to bring attention to their cause, particularly when there are civilian deaths or other human rights abuses occurring during a war. Holding a parade, on the other hand, may not be as effective in drawing attention to the issue of civilian casualties in a war.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta trekte båndet ut av håret sitt,"" option A (Ho knyttede båndet) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Han saw younger. This is because the premise states that he underwent plastic surgery, which is a common procedure used to improve one's appearance and make them look younger. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Det kom eit kyllingeteig ut av egget,"" option A (Egget klekka) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""kyllingeteig"" specifically refers to a chicken egg, so it is unlikely that the egg spoke or broke open of its own accord. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fangen svelte,"" option A (Han døydde) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen mista balansen sin på stigen"", option B (Han faller ned fra stigen) is more likely to happen."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han tok ein slurk med brus) is more likely as it implies that Barnet took a drink with ice cubes, which would make him thirsty and lead to his coughing. Option B (Han opna soda-kannen) does not provide any information about what caused Barnet's coughing.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eg skjelva) is more likely. The use of the word ""skjelva"" suggests a strong or violent movement, which aligns with the idea of a cold air strike causing discomfort or unease. Option A (""Eg slapp av"") means ""I let go,"" which does not convey the same sense of movement or disruption as the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Klassekameratanaene hennes respekterte henne) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the text states ""Studenten fikk et stipend til å gå på høgskole,"" which implies that the students received a scholarship to attend college. This suggests that they may have been impressed by or respected her academic achievements, rather than simply having good grades. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta gjorde narr av guten,"" option A (Ho budde ved sida av han) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""gjorde narr"" means to make a story or tell lies about someone, so it's possible that the girl made up a story about the boy being cruel to her. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Han oppfordrar til medkjensle) is more likely. The phrase ""stal mat"" suggests that the man was hungry and in need of food, so he may have been asking for help or support from others rather than not having any money."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg ringde venen min for å prate,"" option A (Eg ville ha privatliv) is the most likely cause. The fact that the speaker called a friend to talk suggests that they are seeking social interaction, rather than feeling lonely or isolated."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Eg slaughan) is more likely. The word ""slo"" means to hit or strike someone, so it suggests that the speaker may have physically harmed the man who refused to give them money. Option A (""Eg gav han handa"") does not convey any violent or aggressive action, but rather a peaceful act of giving. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg bukka,"" option A is more likely. The word ""bukka"" means ""egg"" in Norwegian, so it's unlikely that a frisbee would be flying towards someone's head."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta bitte på neglene sine,"" it is more likely that option A (Ho var uroleg) is correct. The word ""uroleg"" means ""surprised"" in Norwegian, so it fits better with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Eg teikna ei avtale på kalenderen) is more likely as it directly relates to the context of scheduling an appointment or making a deal on the calendar.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han sparka advokaten sin) is more likely. The man's reaction to discovering his wife's affair is anger towards her, rather than seeking legal action or divorce. Sparking one's lawyer suggests a more immediate and intense response, as opposed to filing for divorce which can be a lengthy and emotionally draining process.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the ball bounces) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ho giska på svaret) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Motstandaren hans fekk passet) is more likely. The phrase ""fekk passet"" means ""got a pass"", so it suggests that the opponent successfully passed the ball to their teammate. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg plukka tomatane frå vinranken"", it is more likely that option A, ""Dei var mogne"" (They were ripe) is the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the speaker picked tomatoes from the vine, implying that they were ready to be harvested and eaten."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Han møtte eks-kjæresten sin til lunsj) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the thermometer broke) caused the mercury to rise. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the roof of the courthouse was blown off) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the tornado had a significant impact on the city's infrastructure, including buildings, and it is unlikely that a motorway would be ""farleg iskjel"" (a Norwegian phrase meaning ""very cold"") due to the damage caused by the tornado. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Notane Hans gjekk opp) is more likely. The phrase ""notane Hans"" means ""Hans' notebook,"" implying that Hans did not bring his notes to class. This suggests that he may have forgotten or overlooked them, making it less likely for him to cheat on the exam."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg følde meg komfortabel,"" option A (Eg knela ned på jorda) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""knela"" means to kneel or crouch down, indicating that the person may be seeking a comfortable position. Option B (Eg sveipte mig i et teppe) does not align with this meaning as it implies wrapping oneself in a blanket, which would not provide comfort. Therefore, option A is the best answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the Norwegian sentence ""Eg polerte steinen,"" the most likely effect is that it was shining. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg la sukker i kaffen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Kava lukta sterkt,"" will occur. The phrase ""la sukker"" means ""to sugar"" in Danish, so it suggests that the coffee will taste strongly of sugar."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen smugla gjennom papirane,"" option A is more likely. The word ""smugla"" implies a gradual or continuous process, rather than a sudden or violent one. Therefore, it is more likely that he has a paper cutter or knife to gradually slice through the papers."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg slo på nagelen med hammaren,"" option A is more likely. The word ""slo"" means ""hit"" or ""struck"", so it's likely that the nail was struck into the tree rather than becoming rusted."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Fiskaren sleit fisken inn) is more likely to occur as it implies that the fisherman will catch a fish by pulling it inwards towards him. Option B (Fiskaren omkastar linjen), on the other hand, suggests that the fisherman will change the direction of the line, but does not necessarily imply that he will catch a fish. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ho has gotten a fine) is more likely. The sentence ""Ho har fått ein finn"" means ""He/She has gotten a fine,"" not ""He/She took off his/her teeth."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Andletet mitt lyste opp,"" option A (Eg fekk gode nyheter) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""andletet"" means to be filled with joy or delight, so it suggests that something positive has happened. Option B (Eg mista tålmodigheten min) means ""I lost my patience,"" which does not fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg tørka hendene med eit handkjøtt,"" option B is the most likely cause: ""Henderne mine var våte."" The word ""tørka"" in this context implies that water was used to clean or wet something, so it's unlikely that the handkjøtt itself would be wet. Therefore, the most likely explanation for why the hands were wet is that they were exposed to water."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (stolen vakla under him) is more likely to be the cause of the man losing his balance while sitting on a chair. This is because the word ""vakla"" in Swedish means ""to slip or slide,"" indicating that the man's chair may have slipped out from underneath him rather than him simply spilling something on it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dei mista spelet) is the most likely cause for why the team lost. The phrase ""gav kvarandre skulda"" suggests that the team made mistakes or had errors throughout the game, leading to their loss. Option B (Treneren deira avlyste) implies that the coach was responsible for the team's loss, but the context of the sentence does not provide enough evidence to support this conclusion. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg had a good day"", option A (Eg angra på feilen min) is more likely. The premise suggests that something went wrong, so it's more likely that the speaker is feeling frustrated or disappointed rather than happy about their day."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han spurte henne om seg sjøvl) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the man directly asked his date for her hand in marriage, rather than simply talking about himself without any intention of proposing.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta glemte eit smil,"" it is more likely that she had a dimple. The word ""dimple"" means a small indentation or depression in something, such as a person's skin. It is unlikely that she forgot an smile because a smile is a facial expression that people make voluntarily or involuntarily to express happiness or other emotions. Therefore, option B (Dei hadde dimple) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fiendshipet sprengde opp,"" option A (Han gjekk forbi gruva) is the most likely cause. The word ""sprengde"" in Norwegian implies a sudden and violent explosion or bursting open, which suggests that something inside the mine has exploded. Given this context, it is unlikely that someone could have simply sailed into the harbor after such an event occurred. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han gjekk inn i ei pølse) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the man's foot was sore. Going inside a sausage would not be a common or plausible reason for a foot to be sore. Option B (Han trilla på glasskjær) does not provide any logical explanation for the man's foot soreness.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (They found out who the murderer was) is more likely. The premise states that the detectives are searching for clues at the crime scene, which suggests that they are trying to identify the perpetrator of the crime. Therefore, it is more likely that they will find evidence that leads them to the identity of the murderer rather than just finding a weapon at the crime scene.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Det var mykje trafikk på motorvegen,"" option A (Eg tok ein omveg) is more likely. The sentence suggests that there was heavy traffic on the highway, making it difficult to drive straight through. Taking a detour would be a logical solution to avoid the traffic. Option B (Eg bad om å føye en tur) does not make sense in this context as it means ""I asked for a trip,"" which has nothing to do with dealing with heavy traffic on the highway."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Many were unemployed) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dei was in the process of crossing the street) is more likely. The use of ""visselpipa"" (whistle) suggests that someone was trying to signal or alert something/someone, which makes sense if they were in the middle of crossing the street."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg rulla augo på venen min,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""eg rulla augo"" means ""I rolled my eyes,"" indicating that the speaker was expressing disbelief or annoyance at something. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the premise than option B, which suggests a sarcastic remark."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the driver was drunk) is more likely. The phrase ""bilikken vart tom for bensin"" suggests that the car ran out of gas, which could cause a driver to become intoxicated if they are unable to find a way to refuel their vehicle. This scenario is more plausible than option B, where the driver takes up a hitchhiker despite being under the influence of alcohol or drugs."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Barnet vart født) is true. The fact that the woman ""byrja å føda"" suggests that she is pregnant and about to give birth, rather than having already given birth. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hatta til mannen vart blåst bort,"" option A (He took off his hat) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""blåst bort"" suggests that something was blown away or removed, which aligns with the idea of someone taking off their hat. Option B (There was wind outside) does not provide a clear explanation for why the man's hat would be blown away."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ho fekk ei invitasjon) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Jenta var med på bursdagsfestet til ein klasskamrat"" implies that she was invited to a classmate's birthday party, rather than purchasing a gift for them. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Moren took him with her to the park) is more likely. The premise mentions that the young man had a fever in his head, which could be alleviated by spending time outdoors in a cooler environment like a park. Taking him to the park would make it more likely for him to feel better rather than taking his temperature.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen spreidde seg med køln,"" option A (Han ville imponera på kjæresten sin) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""spredde seg med køln"" suggests that the man was trying to impress his girlfriend or partner, rather than simply playing with his hair."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Eg leita etter ein lommelykt) is more likely as it suggests that the person is looking for a light source after dark. Option B (Eg tok opp ei spade) does not make sense in this context as taking up a shovel would not be related to finding a light source. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (son took outgoing degree from further education) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ho saw the finish line) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker was running at a slow pace in order to see the finish line ahead, implying that they were close enough to see it and had a clear goal in sight. Option A does not provide any context for why the speaker would want to save energy, so it is less likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Maskinen spytt ut veksla) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""spytt"" in Norwegian means ""to spit out"", so it's possible that the machine spat out the money instead of just being stuck."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hunden til venen min døydde,"" option A (Eg rulla augo på ham) is more likely. The phrase ""til venen min"" means ""to my friend,"" implying that the speaker has a close relationship with the person they are referring to. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker would use affectionate language towards their friend, such as rolling one's eyes in annoyance rather than giving them a slap."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He wrote a debt settlement letter) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen er forbanna,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""han klippte neglene sine"" means ""he cut his nails."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen var stolt af broren sin,"" option A (Broren hans kom i krangel med foreldrene deres) is the more likely cause. The use of the word ""stolt"" suggests that the man takes pride in his brother's accomplishments or qualities, rather than being upset by a conflict with their parents."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ho gjekk til biblioteket) is more likely. The premise mentions ""ho"" which means ""he/she"", indicating that a person went to the library to learn about the solar system. Option B does not make sense in this context as it refers to looking at stars, which are not related to learning about the solar system."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Eg plasserte plakatet over døra) is a more likely cause than option B (Eg la tape på baksida av plakatet). This is because the text explicitly states that the placard was placed on the wall, indicating that it was not attached to the back of the door.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Arkitekten bygde bygningen) is correct. The premise states that the architect approved the building plans, indicating that they were satisfied with them and gave their approval. This suggests that the architect had a role in designing and constructing the building, rather than simply making minor adjustments to the plans.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen lét skjeen sin falla,"" option A (Han skjelv) is the more likely cause. The word ""skjelv"" means to tremble or shake, which aligns with the idea of a man feeling uneasy or nervous after seeing his own fall. Option B (""Han slikka skeden"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""He licked the stone,"" which has no connection to the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Styret oppløyste selskapet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg kom seint til foredraget,"" option A (Eg tok plass i bakre rekkje) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Familien hans betal borga) is more likely to be the correct answer. The text states that the man was released from prison, indicating that he served his sentence and was now free. It does not mention anything about him being sent to another institution or having any financial obligations to fulfill. Therefore, it is more likely that he returned home to his family and they paid for his bail.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Dei selde huset sitt) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Familien mist alle egdomane sine"" implies that something was lost or taken away from the family, which suggests that they no longer have their own homes. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the family does not have its own home anymore."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg tråkka på aluminiumsduksene"", option A (The boat was made of aluminum) is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ho learned to use a computer) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Stemninga mi vart bere"", it is more likely that option A (Eg høyrde på musikk) is the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the speaker was listening to music, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dei gjev dei heimlause mat) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the organization's goal was to collect money, which suggests that they may have held a fundraising event or campaign rather than an auction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Rullbanen kasta seg nedover den bratte fallen,"" option A is more likely. The word ""kippte"" means ""tipped over"" or ""fell,"" indicating that the passengers were thrown off their feet due to the steepness of the roller coaster's descent. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Eg sjekka postkassa dann eg gjekk ut av huset) is a more likely outcome than option B (Eg trengde døra da eg gjekk ut av huset). This is because the sentence ""Eg var rasande"" implies that Eg was angry, which could lead to Eg checking the mailbox instead of needing the door."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han reiste nordover) is more likely. The sentence ""Mannen ville sjå sola gå opp"" implies that he wanted to see the sunrise go up, which means he traveled northward to be in a position to witness it. Option B (Han stod opp tidleg) does not make sense in this context as standing up early has no relation to seeing the sunrise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg foldte avisen,"" option A (Eg gjenvinnde papiret) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Leiarar i andre land sende nødhjelp) is more likely. The text states that ""folket"" (the people) are going through a natural disaster, implying a large-scale crisis that requires external assistance. Option A (forming an alliance with other countries) may be considered later in the decision-making process if the situation becomes more dire, but sending aid is the most immediate response to a natural disaster."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Klærne til guten vart våte"", option A (Han klatrer ut av bassenget) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""vart våte"" suggests that something wet or liquid was involved in the situation, which would make it difficult for a child to climb out of a bathtub. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened next."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Det skulle ha vorte gjeve tilbake til biblioteket) is the more likely cause for why the student did not return the book. This is because the passage states that ""Studenten skunda seg å lesa boka ferdig,"" indicating that the student intentionally failed to read the entire book. Therefore, it is more likely that he would have returned the book to the library rather than keeping it without permission."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han vart kasta i fengsel) is correct. The text states that the man was ""avretta,"" which means he was sentenced to prison. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Solskin gjekk inn i rommet,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Eg opna gardina,"" is the correct answer. The word ""solskin"" means sunlight in Norwegian, so it is unlikely that the person opened a door to enter the room. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg drog håret frå han som lagar,"" option A (Ho fekk parykken av) is the most likely answer. The phrase ""droeg håret"" means to take or get something away from someone, so it's likely that the speaker got a wig or hairpiece from the person who was styling their hair."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han fann manuskriptet overtydande) is more likely. The word ""overtydande"" means ""obvious"", so it suggests that the editor found the mistake obvious or clear. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (Ho skjøna at kortet ikkje var der) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the scenario that the credit card has expired or been cancelled, which would be the most obvious explanation for why the user cannot access their account. Therefore, it is more plausible that the user simply forgot about their credit card or misplaced it, leading them to believe that it was not available.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dei gifta seg) is more likely. The man and woman are described as being in love, which suggests that they may have a strong emotional connection and potentially consider marriage or other long-term commitments together.
"Response: 
Option B: Eg komponerte min egen song. 
Explanation: The premise states that the music was too weak to hear, indicating that there was not enough volume or clarity in the sound. Option B suggests that the speaker composed their own song, which would provide a solution to this problem by allowing them to create music with sufficient volume and clarity. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ho hadde hår som stikka opp,"" option A (Ho took it with him) is the most likely answer. The phrase ""stikka opp"" means ""to stick up"" in Norwegian, so it's possible that Ho took his hair with him when he left."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bleken vart knust,"" option A (Eg sprøyte meg med insektkjeld) is the most likely cause. The word ""bleken"" means to break or shatter in Norwegian, so it's likely that the person was injured by a sharp object like a insect sting."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg opna augo,"" it is more likely that option A (Eg vakna) is the correct answer. The phrase ""opna augo"" means ""to wake up,"" so it suggests that the person will wake up from their sleep. Option B (""Eg slapp av"") means ""to take a break,"" which does not align with the context of the sentence. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Musiken til naboen min var høyt,"" option A (Eg bad han om å skrute ned lyden) is more likely. The speaker wants to reduce the volume of their neighbor's music, not borrow a CD from them."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option B (he won under minimum wage) is the more likely cause of their poverty. The passage states that ""familiene [their] til mannen levde i fattigdom,"" indicating that they were living in poverty. It also mentions that he was ""sparsam med innteka sine,"" which could suggest that he was being careful with his income, but it does not necessarily mean that he was earning a low wage. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for their poverty."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han leita etter ein jobb) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the student is actively seeking a job after graduation, indicating that he/she is motivated to start working as soon as possible. Option B (Han tok opp ein hobby) does not convey the same sense of urgency or motivation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Malinga spreier overalt) is more likely to occur because it does not make sense for the artist to mix blue paint with yellow paint if they want to create a green color. Green is created by mixing blue and yellow together, so in this scenario, Malinga would be spreading both colors everywhere rather than mixing them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Eg hadde ikkje meir å snakke about) is the correct answer. The speaker mentions that they did not have anything else to talk about, indicating a lack of topics or ideas to discuss. This suggests that the conversation was uneventful or unproductive, which aligns with option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eg gave him the cold shoulder) is more likely. The use of ""eg"" in this context suggests that the speaker is referring to themselves, and the phrase ""gave him the cold shoulder"" implies a deliberate act of rejection or indifference towards someone. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Opening scene in the play begins) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Han truga å såra gisselen) is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""truga å såra"" means ""he tried to hurt"" in Norwegian, indicating that the person was actively trying to harm or injure the hostage. This suggests that they were motivated by a desire to cause harm rather than simply letting go of the hostage. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information given."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ein bom vart høyrt på heile scenen,"" option A is more likely. The word ""klappa"" means to tap or pat, so it's likely that the musician tapped their foot rather than slapped their drum."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Barnet vakna og skreik etter eit mareritt) is more likely. The fact that the child woke up and screamed after a nightmare suggests that they may have had a distressing dream or experience during their sleep, which could be causing them to feel frightened or anxious upon waking up.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ho vart fødd for tidleg) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Kvinna kommunikerte med teiknspråk"" suggests that the woman was communicating with someone or something using a language that is not human, which could be interpreted as being born too early. Option B (""Ho var døv frå ho vart født"") does not provide any evidence to support this interpretation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Det var tørke i området,"" option A (Vatnet vart forurenset) is the most likely effect."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Katten jagte fuglen,"" it is more likely that the cat will catch the bird (Option A). The wording of the premise suggests a pursuit or chase, which implies that the cat will be successful in capturing the bird."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Skulen slept out for summer) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Jenta bytte skule"" means ""The girl changed school,"" indicating that she left her old school and started attending a new one. This suggests that she may have moved to a different location during the summer break. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option B (Ansatte gjekk i streik) is more likely to occur. The reason is that the owners of the factory are unwilling to increase wages for workers, which suggests they may be resistant to compromising with their employees. This could lead to a strike by the workers as a form of protest or pressure tactic to demand better treatment from management.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Dei Ekstremistane Drap Han) is more likely. The premise suggests that there is a strong animosity between extremists in the country, which could lead to violent actions such as murder. Therefore, it is more likely that the protagonist will be killed by the extremists rather than them being influenced by him.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Bølgjer krasja langs kysten) is more likely. The word ""krasja"" means ""to crash"" or ""to pound"", so it suggests that there are strong waves crashing against the coastline. This is a more plausible explanation for why someone's feet might get stuck in sand than the other option, which simply means ""sand sticks to feet""."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Eg drakk eit glas vatn) is more likely. The premise mentions ""kjelde"" (which means ""cold sweat"") and ""vatn"" (which means ""water""), indicating that the person may have consumed something cold or liquid to alleviate their discomfort. Option A (""Eg tok på meg joggingbukkar"") does not provide any indication of what the person did before they woke up in the middle of the night."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moren stilla sonen,"" option A is more likely. The word ""stilla"" means ""cold"" in Norwegian, so it's likely that the son has frozen to death rather than melting or quenching."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg har eit hull i buksa mi,"" it is more likely that option A (Eg zippa opp jeansane) is the correct answer. The phrase ""hull i buksa"" means ""hole in my pants,"" indicating that there is a hole in the speaker's pants. This suggests that they are experiencing some discomfort or inconvenience due to this hole, which could be addressed by ziping up their jeans. Option B (""Eg snubla på trottoaren"") does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of walking on the sidewalk."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drengen hadde på seg tannar,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tannar"" means teeth in Norwegian, so it's likely that the boy has a toothache rather than having a hole in his tooth."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg trente på gym i går,"" it is more likely that option A will occur, as going to the gym can help improve physical fitness and reduce muscle soreness. Option B, however, suggests a negative outcome such as having a sore throat, which may not be directly related to exercising at the gym."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Andre studentar ved lunsjbordet følde seg utelate) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ho sprang opp i lufta) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg la brevet i postkassa,"" option A (Postkontoret leverte brevet) is more likely. The verb ""levere"" means to deliver or send something, which aligns with the idea of posting a letter in a mailbox. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (He knew all his money) is more likely. The sentence ""Han vidde alle pengene sine"" means that he had full knowledge of all his financial assets, implying a high level of financial literacy and control over his wealth. This suggests that he was unlikely to have lost all his money unexpectedly or without knowing it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A: Vindane vart sterkere (The wind was stronger) caused the fire to spread. The passage states that ""Skogbrannen spreidde seg"" (the fire spread), indicating that the fire grew in size and intensity. This suggests that a strong wind may have contributed to the fire's rapid expansion. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause of the fire's spread."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Moren hans sende han til rommet sitt) is more likely. The premise suggests that Barnet's knee was injured, and sending him to his room may be a way for his mother to deal with the situation rather than treating the injury directly. Option B (Morhan la eit bandasje på saerhet) does not make sense in this context as it implies that his mother would put a bandage on his knee, which would not address the underlying issue of the injury.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he signed his will) is the correct answer. The fact that he survived the deadly disease suggests that he was able to make arrangements for his estate before passing away.
"Response:  Based on the Norwegian sentence ""Eg tok ein sipp av den brennende kaffen,"" the most likely effect is Option B: Eg brann tunga mi (My tongue burned). This is because the verb ""took"" in the original sentence implies that something hot was taken into the mouth, causing burning sensation on the tongue."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Skribenten unngjekk partisk i forteljingane sine) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The use of the word ""sparke"" in the premise suggests that the author is being too biased or one-sided in their storytelling, rather than simply missing a deadline. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg følde meg utmattet,"" option A (Eg sov heile dagen) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""utmattet"" suggests feeling exhausted or drained, which could lead to sleeping for an extended period of time."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (Ho identifistere symptomene til pasienten) is the more likely cause. The patient's symptoms are not related to a pillow or any other external factor but rather to an underlying medical condition that needs to be properly diagnosed by a healthcare professional. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg klóra meg på huden,"" option A (Det var svettende) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he lost his consciousness) is the correct answer. The text states that he underwent an emergency operation, which could potentially result in loss of consciousness due to anesthesia or other medical complications. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why he may have lost his hereditary rights.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Arms musculature bulged out,"" option A (Han bøygde armane sine) is the more likely cause. The verb ""bøyge"" means to swell or bulge, which fits with the idea of the man's arms growing larger. Option B (""Han freidde armane sine"") means to relax or unwind, which does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen lyft augebryna,"" option A is more likely. The word ""lyft"" means lift in English, so it's likely that the man was surprised or amazed by something he saw or experienced."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Eg trudde han hadde gode intensjonar) is more likely. This is because the word ""trudde"" in this context implies a sense of uncertainty or doubt, rather than certainty or confidence. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is expressing their own confusion or uncertainty about what the other person did, rather than asserting with absolute conviction that they had good intentions."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He starts to train more) is more likely. The premise suggests that he wants to improve his physical fitness, which can be achieved through regular exercise and training. Option B (He starts to wake up earlier) may also have some benefits for his health, but it is not directly related to improving his physical fitness.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kroppen til angriparen vart livlaus) is more likely. The phrase ""slo angriparen i neset"" implies that the woman struck the man in the nose, which could cause him to lose consciousness or even bleed. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome than option B (Slagsmannen byrja å blø), as it does not provide any logical explanation for why the man would start bleeding after being struck in the nose."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Piltene gjekk forbi øyet,"" option A (Mannen sikta feil) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""gjekk forbi øyet"" means ""went past his eye,"" implying that he was looking in one direction but something went past him in another direction. This suggests that he may have been distracted or not paying attention, leading to a mistake or error in judgment. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He found rotters in the cellar) is more likely. The mention of a ""kjeller"" (cellar in Norwegian) suggests that the setting is Nordic, and rotters are common pests found in basements or cellars in Norway. Therefore, it is more plausible that the homeowner encountered rotters in his cellar rather than having a maur farm in his room."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Eg var for trøytt til å laga noko) is the most likely cause. The host was too tired to cook something.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ho byrja å gjemme dagboken) is more likely. The brother's actions are motivated by a desire to keep the diary for himself, so he will likely try to hide it rather than getting a new one.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ho gave up her job) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Handen til barnet trekkte seg raskt tilbake,"" option A (Han rørte ved den varme ovnen) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (offering a discount to new customers) is more likely to increase customer satisfaction. This is because offering a discount can be seen as an incentive for customers to try out the company's products or services and provide feedback that can help improve their overall experience. On the other hand, asking customers to fill out a survey may not necessarily lead to increased satisfaction, as it does not directly address any issues or concerns they may have.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the boy threw a pencil from the couch) is more likely than option B (the boy slipped on the floor). The premise mentions that the boy was sitting on the couch, indicating that he was in a relatively stable position and unlikely to slip or fall. In contrast, throwing an object requires some degree of movement and effort, making it more plausible that the boy stood up or moved his arm while seated on the couch. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg har skilt andletet mitt,"" option A (Fienden min hånte meg) is more likely as it implies that the speaker's enemy mocked or ridiculed them after they had split their hair. This fits with the context of the sentence and the idea of someone feeling embarrassed or ashamed about something personal like splitting one's hair. Option B (""Feiden min riste opp ein knytnep"") does not fit as well in this context and seems less plausible."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the statue was struck by lightning) caused the burning of the famous statue. Therefore, the answer is (A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg lét fruktane liggja ute på bordet,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Frukta gjev frø,"" will occur. The word ""liggja"" in Norwegian means ""to lie,"" so the sentence implies that the fruit is lying on the table. This suggests that something may be happening to the fruit, such as it being eaten by an animal or insects laying eggs on it. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible outcome than Option B, ""Fuglar swarma på frukt,"" which means ""The birds swarm on the fruit."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ho peika på tærne) is the most likely cause for a ballerina to experience pain in her leg after a performance. This is because ""peka"" means ""to bend"" or ""to twist"" in Danish, which could refer to the dancer bending or twisting her leg while performing, potentially causing injury. Option B (Ho vridde anklen) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""vride"" means ""to break"" in Danish, which would indicate that the dancer's ankle was broken during the performance rather than simply experiencing pain from bending or twisting it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Skosnørene til barnet var løyst,"" option A is more likely. The word ""løyst"" implies that something was loose or detached, which fits with the idea of a child learning to tie their shoes. Option B does not fit as well with the premise, as it refers to playing on a playground, which has no direct connection to tying one's shoes."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg vart forvandla til boka,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Eg gav boka tilbake,"" is correct. The verb ""forvandla"" means to change or transform, but in this context, it seems unlikely that the speaker would have transformed into a book and then given it back. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Foreldra hans påverka han) is more likely. The text states that ""Mannen heldt på liknende trussingar som foreldra sine,"" indicating that he was influenced by his parents' actions. Therefore, it is more likely that he was affected by their behavior than that they rejected him."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (the car ran out of gas) caused the accident. The driver may have been unaware of the low fuel level or failed to notice the warning signs, leading to a sudden stop without enough time to react.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen åt is i sola"", option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that something has happened to the man's taste buds, rather than the ice melting from the sun. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg hengde kunstverk i rommet,"" option A is more likely. The word ""skitent"" in Norwegian means ""dirty"" or ""unclean,"" so it's possible that the teapet was dirty or stained."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Eg hadde hovudverk) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""tidleg frå jobb"" suggests that something happened earlier in the day related to work, and ""hovudverk"" means ""headache,"" so it's possible that the speaker experienced a headache due to work-related stress or fatigue. Option B (""Bossen min hadde eit møte"") does not provide any information about work or a headache, making it less likely as the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Eigaren skjelte på valpen) is more likely. The word ""skjelte"" in Norwegian means to scold or reprimand someone, so it's likely that the owner yelled at the puppy for getting on the carpet."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg bad venen min om unnskylding,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tilgav"" means to forgive or pardon, so it suggests that the speaker's venom was able to forgive them. Option B does not fit with this meaning as ""vart"" means were in English, and does not convey a sense of forgiveness."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen stod ut i mengda,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ryggsekke"" (backpack) suggests that the man was carrying something on his back, which could be a distinguishing feature in a crowd. Option B does not provide any additional information to support this inference."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A is more likely. The sentence ""Han avslutta vitnemålet sitt"" means that he finished his testimony, indicating that he has completed his statement and there is no need to consider him as a witness who lied. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinnan farga håret sitt,"" option B (Ho ville verte i lag med dei andre) is more likely as it suggests that the woman wants to be in line with others, rather than seeking a new appearance."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Dei vart deporterte) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the undocumented immigrant was taken into custody and deported, indicating that they were removed from the country. Therefore, Option B is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Publiken lat lat) is more likely. The phrase ""publiken lat"" means ""the public laughed,"" so it suggests that the joke was well-received by the audience."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg saw into the sun,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""saw into"" implies a direct gaze or look, which could potentially cause temporary blindness due to exposure to intense light. Option B, while possible, does not convey the same sense of immediate harmful effects from looking directly at the sun."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg kjene meg lei"", option A (Eg snorkla) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Steiken var vanskeleg å skjera,"" option A (Kniven var kjempete) is the most likely cause. The word ""vanskeleg"" means ""difficult to cut,"" so it's unlikely that the knife was blunt or dull. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ho got a release of alimony) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""erklært seg konkurs"" means ""declared bankruptcy,"" which suggests that Ho's financial situation has become unmanageable and they are unable to pay their debts. As a result, Ho may be eligible for a release of alimony payments."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Eg undra om han var ute) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary suggest that the speaker is wondering or speculating about the whereabouts of their friend rather than making a firm decision to visit them.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg la blomsten under nesen min,"" option A (Blomstrene kom av blomsten) is the most likely explanation for why the person's nose is blooming. This is because the phrase suggests that something inside the person's body is causing the flowers to grow, rather than any external factor like a fragrance or a pollen. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ho trefte ein barndomsvenne) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of the word ""trefte"" (meaning ""to meet"") and the phrase ""barndomsvenne"" (meaning ""old friend from childhood"") suggests that the speaker has encountered someone they knew in their youth."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He sent the paper incomplete) is more likely. The fact that the student had to ""trek"" forward suggests that he/she was not able to send the paper earlier, implying that it was incomplete or partially completed at the time of sending."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Eg gjekk til kjøpesenteret) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the speaker went to a shopping center, rather than calling a mechanic.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It was anonymous) is more likely to be the correct answer. The fact that it was anonymous suggests that the person who made the note did not want to take responsibility for it, which could indicate that they were trying to hide something or avoid consequences. This aligns with the idea of ""kasta bort noten"" meaning ""to throw away a note,"" as in to dispose of something unwanted or incriminating. In contrast, option B (""It was unnecessary"") does not provide any insight into the motivations behind making the note, and therefore seems less relevant to the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fuglen flappte med vengane sine,"" option A (Det la egg) is the most likely outcome. The verb ""flappe"" means to flap or wave, so it's unlikely that the bird will actually fly upwards. Instead, it's more likely that the bird will simply move its wings without actually flying. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Garasjen var open) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Brotmannen sikta våpenet mot offeret sitt"", option A (Brotmannen la ned våpenet) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg saw forward to holy day,"" option A is more likely. The speaker is looking forward to attending their uncle's funeral, not a wedding."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg mistar rekna på tida,"" it is more likely that option A (Eg var dagdrømmar) is the correct answer. The phrase ""mistar rekna"" means to forget something, and ""dagdrømma"" means a daydream or fantasy. Therefore, the sentence suggests that the speaker forgot something, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the printer had little ink) is the more likely cause of the document being printed with a faint image. As the printer has limited ink, it may not have been able to produce a clear and detailed image, resulting in a faint or blurry printout. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Fansen storma ut på banen) is more likely. The fans are upset by the national anthem being played during a football match, leading them to storm onto the pitch in protest.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dippa smaka blanda"", option A (Eg tente det) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""tente"" means ""to taste"" in Danish, so it suggests that the speaker will try or test something to see if it tastes good. Option B (Eg sette salt i det) does not make sense in this context as ""sette"" means ""to put"" in Danish, and it would not be a suitable response to the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Handkjøttet oppnådde væsken) is more likely. The word ""oppnådde"" in Norwegian means ""to absorb"", so it's likely that the hand cream absorbed into the wall."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ho bokmerka sida si) is more likely. The speaker has already started reading a book but was interrupted in the middle of it, so they are more likely to continue reading from where they left off rather than starting over from the beginning.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mannen trekka seg i setebeltet) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the man was physically moving himself towards the window, rather than simply looking out of it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen trilla,"" it is more likely that jenta prikk han than jenta ignerer han. The word ""prika"" means to prick or stab someone, while ""ignere"" means to ignore someone. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dei amputerte beina hennar) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the patient's legs were artificially lengthened, which implies that they had been shortened or amputated in some way. Option B (Dei følgde med på vitalt) does not provide any information about the patient's legs being altered in any way.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ho rykte armen frå han) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Eg sette pris på meiningen hans) is more likely to be the correct cause. The phrase ""eg hadde rett"" means ""I was right,"" indicating that the speaker believes they were justified in their actions. This aligns with Option A, where the speaker sets a price on the other person's opinion, implying that they value their own perspective over others'. In contrast, Option B does not fit as well with the given premise, as it implies that the speaker knew they were right all along, without providing any context for why this might be the case."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drengen trakk i leire,"" option A is more likely. The word ""trakk"" in Norwegian means to pull or drag, so it's likely that the boy pulled something towards him rather than hitting someone with his fist."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Folk gøymede sig under jorden) is more likely. The sentence suggests that people are hiding or burrowing underground to escape the snowfall, which is a common response in areas with heavy snowfall. Option A (Skolane stengde) means that schools were closed, but it does not necessarily imply that people are hiding underground.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han gjekk heim for dagen) is more likely. The phrase ""han gjekk heim for dagen"" means ""he went home early,"" indicating that he left work earlier than usual. This suggests that he may have been feeling unwell or tired, which could be a reason why he didn't want to go to work."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Treet skadde huset,"" option A (Treet fell onto the roof) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Treet spalte seg i to,"" option A (Eg stabla ved i peisen) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that something has split or broken in two, which aligns better with Option A's description of planting a seed in the ground than Option B's description of swinging an axe towards a tree."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the parents announced they were going to separate) than option B (the parents announced they were going to have a baby). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta sende guten eit valentinskort,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ho likte han,"" is correct. The phrase ""guten eit valentinskort"" means ""good evening card,"" indicating that the sender of the card is expressing affection or fondness towards someone. Therefore, option A is a more appropriate response to this premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg nikka med hovudet mitt når venen min sa det,"" option A (Eg var forvirra) is the most likely cause. The sentence suggests that the speaker is confused or disoriented, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dei ville finne eit kompromiss) is more likely. The phrase ""Vennane kasta ein mynt"" suggests that there are two opposing views or interests at play, and finding a compromise is more likely than making a fair decision."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that mann took out the food from the fridge (option A). The sentence ""Timeren i kjøkkenet gjekk av"" implies that something happened in the kitchen, and since the timer is not a common kitchen appliance, it is unlikely that mann took out the pizza from the oven (option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ho worked hard) is more likely to lead to achieving the ambitious goal.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Sonen hans arva formuen hans) is more likely. The rich man died because he was old, not because his son had health problems or inherited his wealth.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Flammane gjekk ut) is more likely. The phrase ""Ho trampet på elden"" means ""He stepped on the fire,"" so it's likely that the person caused a disturbance or created a hole in the fire, rather than the smoke rising from the fire. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sjåførartillatinga hennar vart trekt back) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman's car was towed away. The other option (Ho hadde ein bilulykke) does not provide any context or evidence to support the claim that the woman's car was towed away due to an accident. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg sov gjennom vekerklokkaret mitt"", option A (Eg laga frokost) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something was made or prepared by the speaker, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kameraet gjekk i hans retning) is more likely. The fact that the man's identity was kept secret until he emerged from the limousine suggests that there were measures taken to protect his privacy, such as limiting access to him or using a decoy to distract attention away from him. Therefore, it is more likely that cameras were positioned in a way that would allow them to capture his image without revealing his true identity.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinna blei verande i badekaret,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Badvatnet vart ljummet"" means ""The water was warm."" Therefore, it is more likely that the woman got hot in the bathtub rather than the water coming out of the tap."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han vart med i et brorskap) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg lyfte sofaen,"" it is more likely that option A (Eg leitar etter småpengar) is the correct answer. The phrase ""lyfte sofaen"" means to lift or move a couch, which suggests that something heavy has been moved recently. Given this context, it makes sense that someone might be looking for small change (småpengar) to help pay for the cost of moving the couch."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vespa flåg mot guden,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Drengen rømde bort,"" is correct. The word ""flåg"" in Norwegian means to fly or hover, but it can also be used as an adverb meaning quickly or suddenly. In this context, it suggests that something unexpected happened quickly, such as the boy running away. Option B, ""Drengen plockte en blomme,"" does not fit with the given premise and is therefore less likely to be correct."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Ho blei dømmt til døden) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg rørte sukkeret i den varme te,"" it is more likely that the sugar dissolved in the hot tea. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Veteranen gjekk med ein halte,"" option A (Han vart innkalla til krigen) is the most likely cause for why he returned home early from his military service."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Brotmannen rømde fra politiet,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Politiet tok seg av offeret,"" is correct. This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the thief escaped from the police, rather than being caught by them. Therefore, it is more likely that the consequence will be that the police took care of the victim, rather than chasing after the thief."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Eg fall av) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Den bærbare datamaskina ville ikkje slå på"" implies that the laptop would not turn on, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as a dead battery or a hardware issue. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ho fekk ei stor garderobe) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Kvinna fekk ikkje rom i skapet sitt"" suggests that there was not enough space for a woman's belongings in her home, implying that she had a large wardrobe or many clothes. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen var hjertbroten,"" option A (Kona hans fødde) is the most likely cause. The word ""hjertbroten"" means ""heartbreak"" in Norwegian, indicating that the man's heart was broken by his wife leaving him. Therefore, it is more likely that she left him than he left her."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Tilbodet hans om jobb vart trekt tilbake) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the man's application was rejected or withdrawn, rather than being qualified for a job he wanted.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Han helste publikum) is more likely. The phrase ""tydleg i heile salen"" suggests that Hans was speaking loudly in front of a large audience, indicating that he may have been trying to capture everyone's attention or make an impactful statement. This is consistent with Option A, as it implies that Hans was attempting to communicate something important or dramatic to the public. In contrast, Option B (Han tala inn i mikrofonen) simply means that Hans spoke into the microphone, without providing any context or indication of how he did so. Therefore, based on the given premise, Option A is the more likely explanation for why Hans was tydleg i heile salen."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg kasta ein mynt i fontenen med vatn,"" option A is more likely. The word ""sokk"" in Norwegian means ""to sink"" or ""to submerge,"" so it's likely that the coins will sink to the bottom of the fountain rather than float away."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bollen gjekk inn i holet) is more likely to occur.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg anda inn støvet på taket,"" option A (Eg hadde hikke) is more likely. The word ""hikke"" means to scratch or rub something, which could potentially move dirt or dust around, but it does not necessarily mean that you would end up with more dirt on your head than when you started. Option B (Eg nyste) means to sneeze, which could potentially blow dirt or other particles onto your head, making it more likely for there to be more dirt on your head afterward."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kunden brukte falske pengar) is more likely. The premise states that the customer rang after vaulting, implying that they attempted to use false money. This is a common tactic used by thieves to avoid detection when stealing from a store. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the customer rang after vaulting.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Avfallgade kjøkkenet lukta vondt) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the kitchen smells bad. The other option does not provide any clear reason for why the kitchen would smell bad. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Barna jagte dyrene) is more likely. The premise suggests that the family visited a zoo or wildlife park, where children are often fascinated by the animals they see and may even try to catch them. This implies that the children were actively engaged in trying to interact with the animals, rather than simply observing them passively.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Nyrane his gjekk ut of kraft) is the more likely cause for why the man's strength has decreased. This is because ""nyrane"" means ""to weaken"" or ""to become weaker,"" indicating that the man's strength has been reduced over time. Option B (Lungane his was samla), on the other hand, means ""His lungs were closed,"" which does not provide any insight into why the man's strength may have decreased. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Eg spurte venen min om han var interessert i å gå) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Eg opna vindauga) is more likely to cause a drop in temperature inside the house as it allows cold air from outside to enter the house. Option A (Et tok ut tepper) would not have any significant impact on the temperature inside the house.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gutten har vond rygg,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, i.e., his rucksack was open. This is because the word ""vond"" in Norwegian means ""found,"" implying that something was discovered or noticed, rather than simply being assumed to be true without evidence. Therefore, the sentence suggests that there is a possibility that the boy's rucksack was not closed properly or was left unzipped, leading to the contents spilling out."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (It was her birthday) is more likely as it provides a specific reason for buying a gift for Mom. Option A does not provide any clear reasoning or context for why you bought a cake for your mom.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ei bi stakk gartnaren) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Narcissane i hagen vart øydelagde"" suggests that someone has been taking care of a garden, and the use of the word ""bi"" (by) implies that it was done by an individual or a small group rather than a large-scale excavation project like Option B (Eikarar gravde opp glomer). Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg treffte fyren,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Flammen blei slokna."" The word ""treffte"" means ""struck"" or ""hit"", so it implies that something was struck with force, causing damage or injury. This suggests that the fire was extinguished rather than produced."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dei ville ikkje halde på med å diskutere det i retten) is more likely. The text suggests that the parties are not interested in discussing the matter in court, which implies a lack of willingness to engage in legal proceedings.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Foreldra deira døydde) is more likely. The reason for this is that the phrase ""barna vart sendt til eit barnehjem"" implies that the children were sent to an orphanage, which suggests that their parents are no longer able to care for them. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as death, abandonment, or poverty, but it is unlikely that the parents would simply have forgotten about their children. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that a tsunami occurred (Option A). The phrase ""meteorite landed in the sea"" suggests that an object has entered the ocean, which could potentially cause a tsunami if it is large enough. Tsunamis are also known to occur when there is a sudden displacement of water, such as from an earthquake or volcanic eruption, so this option seems more plausible than Option B, which simply states that it started raining without providing any additional context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fagmannen møtte ei giftig slange,"" it is more likely that option A (Ho vart dehydrated) is correct. The phrase ""giftig slange"" suggests that something harmful or toxic was encountered, which could lead to dehydration as a result of the body's natural response to the poison."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Oven varm,"" option A (Eg sette på ovnen) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg pressa sitronkjelen"", option A is more likely. The word ""pressa"" implies a forceful action that could potentially cause damage or discomfort to something, like a fruit. Therefore, it's more likely that the orange will be squeezed rather than simply having water come out of it."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Landet gjekk frå land) is more likely. The phrase ""landet oppdaga nytt land"" suggests that a new land was discovered or found, rather than colonized by an existing land. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Det sprakk i stykker over heile golvet) is more likely. The use of the word ""heile"" (meaning whole or entire) suggests that the glass shattered into many pieces, rather than just landing in a pile."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gólvet var ujevnt,"" option A (The table was flat) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sonen hans vidkjente sanninga) is more likely. The father's lie will be exposed by his son, who will reveal the truth.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen hadde eit tungt hode,"" it is more likely that he took aspirin (Option B) than hoste sirup (Option A). Aspirin is a common medication used to relieve headaches, while hosting sirup is not typically associated with this symptom."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Toget sakta ned,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that he was getting closer to the station, so option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han's hairdresser had an inherited character) is the correct answer. The premise does not provide any evidence to suggest that Han was diagnosed with depression. Therefore, option B (He was diagnosed with depression) is less likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ho svelte maten sin) is a more likely cause for why a woman might grab her neck than option B (Ho kvalte seg i maten). The phrase ""svelte maten"" means to choke or strangle someone, while ""kvalte seg i maten"" means to bite into something. Therefore, it makes more sense that if a woman were grabbing her neck, she would be experiencing discomfort due to choking or strangulation rather than biting into something."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Røysta hennar høyrde raspig ut) is more likely. The use of the word ""røysta"" in this context suggests that the person's voice was distorted or altered in some way, which could be due to a variety of factors such as a cold or allergies. Option B (Ho snakka med ein aksent) does not provide any specific information about the nature of the person's voice change."
"Response: 
A) He saw the juicy steak on the table.

Explanation: The sentence ""Hunden saw the juicy steak on the table"" implies that the dog was looking at something edible, which means it's more likely to salivate than for it to lie down. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ho sparka dei ansatte) is the correct answer. The phrase ""hadde suksess"" suggests that the business was successful, but the word ""spark"" implies a sudden or unexpected end to the success. Therefore, it is more likely that the business failed or experienced difficulties rather than continuing to be successful."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bjella rangde) is more likely as it provides a concrete action that could have caused the students to come out of their classroom. Option B (Læraren gav dei lekser) does not provide any specific information about what might have prompted the students to leave their classroom.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kjennarar hennar var skeptiske) is more likely. The use of the word ""hevda"" in the premise suggests that the woman's claim was not taken seriously by those around her, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han drukna nesten i hav) is more likely. The text states that he was nearly drowned in the sea, indicating a water-related incident as the possible cause of his hearing loss. Option B (Han vart nesten drepen i ein eksplosjon) does not provide any information about an explosion causing his hearing loss. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet lét ballongstrengen gå"", it is more likely that option A, ""Ballongen har late av luft"" (The balloon has lost air). This means that the balloon's buoyancy will decrease, causing it to descend or fall."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (He had a stroke) is the correct answer. The phrase ""mista evne"" means ""lost ability,"" which suggests that something unexpected has happened to him, such as a stroke or other medical condition."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinna snubla på fortauet,"" option A is more likely. The word ""sprekk"" in Norwegian means a crack or fissure, so it's possible that there was a crack in the concrete that caused the woman to fall. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sjømannsvakten hoppa inn etter ham) is more likely. The phrase ""hoppa inn"" means to jump into something, in this case, the water, and it implies a sense of urgency or danger. It's unlikely that the man would drink his life guard as it doesn't make much sense in the context of the situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg tok antibiotika,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Infeksjonen min gjekk over,"" is correct. The use of antibiotics would suggest that the infection has cleared up, rather than spreading further."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fjernlyset var gult,"" option A is more likely. The driver pulled on the brakes, which would cause the car to slow down or stop."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Plastikbeinet smelt"", option A (Eg la beinet i varmt vatn) is the most likely cause. This is because melting plastic requires heat, and immersing the bead in hot water would provide enough heat to melt it. Option B (Eg la behållaren på den varme komfyren) may not provide enough heat to melt the plastic, as a warm compartment might not reach the necessary temperature for melting."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sjåføren trefte ein telefonstolpe) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that something unexpected happened to the driver, and hitting a telephone pole is a more plausible scenario than simply driving off the road without any explanation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen studied all night,"" option A is more likely. The premise suggests that Dringen did not study enough to pass his exam, so it is more likely that he failed rather than passed."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He was afraid to learn how to swim) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the young boy did not want to get into the bathtub. It also aligns with the context of the situation where the boy may have had a fear or phobia of water.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg la handa mi på brystet mitt,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""la handa"" means to hit or strike someone, so it's unlikely that the speaker would feel their heart beating if they were being struck. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Kontoret mitt var overfylt) is true. The text states that the building next to the office was under construction, indicating that there may have been a lot of activity and noise in the area surrounding the office. This could potentially cause disruptions and make it difficult for employees to focus or work effectively. Therefore, Option A is the most likely explanation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Familien inviterte naboane over til middag) is more likely. The text states that the family wants to get to know their new neighbors better, which suggests that they would be proactive in reaching out to them. Inviting them over for dinner is a common way to build relationships with new neighbors, as it allows for face-to-face interaction and the opportunity to share food and conversation. In contrast, waving from the garden may not be as effective in initiating a connection with the new neighbors.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vatnet sprutte opp fra bassenget,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Svimjaren dykkja ned i bassenget"" (The swimmer dived into the water) is the correct answer. The word ""sprutte"" means ""to burst out"" or ""to come up from"", indicating that something emerged from the water. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that a person or object dived into the water, rather than simply floating or hovering above it."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eg sprakk ved ein feil tann) is more likely. The phrase ""sprakk"" means to crack or break in Norwegian, so it's likely that the person's tooth was damaged due to a mistake or accident rather than randomly picking up a piece of watermelon."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen snubla,"" option A is more likely. The word ""snubla"" means to sneeze or blow one's nose, so it suggests that something may have irritated the person's nasal passages, causing them to sneeze or blow their nose. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Ho vart distrahert av lyd) is the more likely cause of Ho's hearing loss. The passage states that Ho was ""distracted by noise,"" which could have caused him to turn up the volume too high and damage his hearing. This is a more plausible explanation for Ho's hearing loss than option B (Ho fekk borte i øyra), as there is no evidence in the passage to suggest that Ho had any underlying ear problems or infections that could have caused his hearing loss."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg fyllede på vatnflaska mi,"" option A is more likely. The word ""fylle"" means to fill in Norwegian, so it's likely that the speaker filled up the water bottle with water rather than drinking all of it."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that option A (the show contained vulgar language) is the correct answer. The author mentions that the show was ""sensurred,"" which suggests that it may have been considered offensive or inappropriate content. Additionally, the use of vulgar language is a common reason why shows are censored or banned in some countries."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Skipet vart vraka,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mannskapet drukna"" (The crew drowned) will occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Han bad om eit hint) is more likely. The use of the word ""bad"" in this context implies that the character is asking for help or a clue, rather than solving the puzzle on their own."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Telefonen ringde"", option A (Mannen la på telefonen) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ho stirra på meg,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""stirra på"" means to look at or stare at someone, so it's likely that the speaker is feeling uncomfortable or self-conscious about being looked at. Option B does not fit the context of the premise as well, as it implies that the speaker is feeling uneasy or discomforted for a different reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dei took tickets of the exhibitions) is more likely. The sentence ""Gruppa forlét museet"" implies that something happened to a group of people at the museum, and taking tickets suggests that they may have been evicted or asked to leave. It's less likely that they simply saw all the exhibits without purchasing tickets."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Vennen min stod opp for meg) is more likely. The use of ""stod"" instead of ""byrja"" suggests a stronger sense of intention and planning behind the introduction, which aligns with the idea that the friend was actively involved in setting up the meeting."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Eg pumpte lukt inn i dekk) will solve the problem of a flat tire on a bicycle than option B (Eg bytta gir på sykkelen). This is because pumping air into the tire will increase its pressure and make it less likely to be flat.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ho saw something strange,"" option A is more likely. The use of the word ""saw"" implies that there was a visual observation, which suggests that the speaker observed something unusual with their own eyes. Option B does not provide any context or evidence to suggest that the father followed his daughter's thoughts, making it less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Penna vart tom for blekk,"" option A (Eg brukte ein blyant) is more likely. The word ""blekk"" in Norwegian means ""ink,"" so it's likely that the speaker used a pen to write something."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen vart nekta for eit lån,"" option A (Han var i skuld) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta vart heime frå skulen,"" it is more likely that option A (Ho hadde kyllingvauke) is the correct answer. The phrase ""kyllingvauke"" means ""sickness"" or ""illness"" in Norwegian, so it suggests that the girl was feeling unwell at home after school. Option B (""Ho likte å læra matte"") does not provide any information about why the girl might be feeling unwell."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ruskposen var full"", option A is more likely. The word ""dumppa"" in Norwegian means ""to wash up"" or ""to clean up"". So, it's more likely that the speaker took care of the dirty dish by washing it rather than putting it in the sink."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eg støvsugde teppet,"" option A is more likely. The word ""støvsugd"" means ""vacuumed,"" so it's unlikely that your roommate gave out a lot of punch. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Han kasta ei stol over rommet) is more likely to occur as it suggests a physical action that could potentially cause damage or disruption in the room. Option A (Han slukkte av datamaskina si) does not suggest any direct physical action that could cause harm.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jenta kasta ein kvist i leireldet,"" option A (Kvisten brann) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""kasta ein kvist"" means to throw a stick or branch into the fire, so it's reasonable to assume that if someone throws a stick into the fire, it will burn."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen gjekk ut av dusjan,"" option A is the most likely cause. The word ""gjekk"" means ""came out of"" in Norwegian, indicating that the man emerged from the shower. Therefore, it is unlikely that he did not find a towel (option B) or that it was not warm water (option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dei oppfordra borna sine til å leka utanfor) is more likely. The parents are encouraged to encourage their children to play outside instead of setting aside a savings fund for education expenses. This suggests that they may not prioritize saving money for their children's future educational needs as much as other factors such as providing them with opportunities to engage in physical activity and develop social skills through outdoor play.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mannen la av lappene på skoene sine,"" option B is more likely. The sentence implies that the man removed the laces from his shoes, which would make them less tight. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He ate half of the food) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Klokka mi var hovna,"" option A (Eg la is på det) is more likely. The phrase ""la"" means ""to put"" or ""to place,"" so it's likely that the speaker is suggesting that they placed something on top of the clock. Option B (Eg smurde kremi på det) does not make as much sense in this context, as ""smurre"" means to spread or sprinkle, but there is no indication that anything was spread or sprinkled on top of the clock."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Eg overhørte samtalen i hallen) is more likely. The sentence ""Døren til kontoret mitt var open"" implies that there was an opportunity for someone to listen in on the conversation without being noticed. Overhearing a conversation in a hallway is a common way for people to eavesdrop unnoticed."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Eg tok plass) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Flygen surra bort) is more likely. The man gave a small angle to the wing, indicating that he wanted the plane to take off.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han var døyande) is more likely. The phrase ""han skrev et testamente"" implies that he was alive when he wrote the will, so option A is a more plausible explanation than option B (Han var enkjeman)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He increased his speed) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Eg fann ei løysing) is more likely. The speaker seems to have found a solution or answer to the problem they were thinking about.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den reisende gjekk på den skjelvande hengebryggen,"" option B is more likely. The word ""ekstatisk"" means excited or thrilled, which fits with the idea of someone walking on a swaying bridge. Option A, ""forferdleg,"" means disappointed or displeased, which does not fit as well with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He met his friends to watch the game) is more likely. The text states that he looked forward to the team winning, indicating that he was invested in their success. Meeting with friends to watch a game together would be a common activity for someone who wants to support their favorite team.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han sette vekkerklokka) is more likely. The phrase ""Gutten kunne ikkje sovna"" suggests that the boy was having trouble sleeping, so setting an alarm clock would be a reasonable solution to help him wake up at a specific time. Option B (Han telde sauer) does not make sense in this context as it means ""He told lies,"" and has nothing to do with helping someone fall asleep or waking them up at a specific time."
