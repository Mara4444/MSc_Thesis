Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (She was fragile) is the correct answer. The article was wrapped in paper bubble, which suggests that she was delicate or fragile.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai vidé mes poches,"" it is more likely that Option A (J'ai récupéré un ticket) is correct. The phrase ""vidé"" means ""emptied,"" so it suggests that the speaker has removed something from their pockets. The idea of finding a ticket or any other object in one's pocket does not fit as well with this premise."
"Response: 
Option B: Les termites ont dévoré le bois de la maison."
"Response:  Option B: The agent of patrol has accused them of smuggling.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Les voyageurs atteignirent la frontière,"" it is likely that they have reached the border crossing. As they are being checked by an agent of patrol, he may accuse them of smuggling goods or contraband, rather than verifying their passports. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (C'était un jour férié) is the correct answer. The sentence implies that the office was closed because of a holiday, rather than being open during the summer months. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille est à court d'énergie,"" Option B is more likely. The phrase ""elle a sauté la corde"" means she jumped rope, which is an activity that can help to increase energy levels. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (More people have entered the line) is the more likely cause for why the woman lost her place in the queue.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille s'est pincée le nez,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""s'est pincée"" means ""has pinched,"" indicating that the girl accidentally poked or pinched her nose. It is unlikely that the baby would have bava (bavé in French) on its bib or soil its diaper without any external influence. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The public applauded at the rhythm of the music) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the girl brought a apple to the teacher) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: They have grilled marshmallows over the campfire. 
Explanation: The mention of ""guimauves"" in the premise suggests that the story takes place in French-speaking Canada or France, where marshmallows are commonly referred to as ""guimauves."" Therefore, it is more likely that the young campers were grilling marshmallows over the campfire rather than being told a scary story by their counselor."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Il a eu une commotion cèrebrale) is more likely. The phrase ""s'est cogné la tête"" suggests that the person has hit their head, which can cause a concussion or other forms of brain injury. This is a more plausible explanation than simply getting lost in one's thoughts, as there are no indications in the premise that the person was experiencing any kind of mental confusion or disorientation."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mon compte était vide) is more likely to be the correct answer. The fact that the check was refused suggests that there were insufficient funds in the account, which is consistent with Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he sent an email in mass (Option B). The phrase ""la boîte de réception"" suggests that there was a large amount of emails in his inbox, implying that he received many unwanted messages. Sending an email to multiple people at once would be a common way for someone to deal with a large volume of spam emails."
"Response:  Option A: He was in quarantine.
Explanation: The phrase ""le marin était en quarantaine"" suggests that the sailor was placed in isolation or quarantine due to illness. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She memorized the code) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai versé de l'eau dans le verre,"" it is more likely that the water has filled the glass (Option B)."
"Response: 
Option B: He was reflecting on his friend's words."
"Response: 
Option A: Je me sentais coupable.
Explanation: The premise states that the accident was my fault, which implies that I feel guilty or responsible for it. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (La chaîne était enroulée autour d'un pneu) is the more likely cause of the chain breaking. The premise suggests that the chain was wrapped around a tire, which could put excessive pressure on the chain and cause it to break. Option B (Il y avait un maillon cassé dans la chaîne) does not provide any specific information about the cause of the chain breaking, making option A the more plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They had enough of fighting) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She has testified at trial) is more likely. The woman has already taken significant steps to present herself as a viable candidate by going through the legal process of testifying in court. This suggests that she may be serious about running for public office and willing to go through the necessary formalities. Option A (She has hired a campaign director) could also be possible, but it's less likely given the context provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He journeyed with a large suitcase) is more likely. The man expected cold weather for his trip, so he would likely pack warm clothing in a large suitcase rather than just bringing along some extra layers of clothing in his carry-on bag.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (He made a mistake) is more likely. The student knew the answer to the question but still made a mistake while answering it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Les yeux de l'homme ont été trempés,"" option A (Il a de la poussière dans les yeux) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (son adversary accused her of cheating) is true. The fact that she has won five matches in a row suggests that she is performing well, but her opponent accusing her of cheating implies that they are feeling threatened by her success and are trying to find an excuse to explain their loss.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Il a surpris l'étudiant en train de tricher) is more likely. The fact that the professor tore up the exam suggests that the student was caught cheating, rather than simply providing incorrect answers.
"Response:  Option B: Je suis resté sans souffle.
Explanation: The premise ""Je me suis arrêté pour arrêter de parler"" suggests that the speaker has stopped talking abruptly, which could be due to various reasons such as losing one's voice or being unable to speak anymore. However, among these two options, option B - ""Je suis resté sans souffle"" (I have remained without breath) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker has stopped talking. This is because when someone loses their voice, they may not be able to produce any sound even if they want to talk, whereas if they are simply out of breath, they might still be able to make sounds but would need to take a break to catch their breath."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Je l'ai mis au micro-ondes) caused the food to thaw. The microwave oven emits electromagnetic radiation that can quickly heat up or decompose certain materials, including frozen foods. This could explain why the food has thawed out of its own accord without any external influence. In contrast, option B (Je l'ai recouvert d'un film plastique) may not have had enough impact to cause the food to thaw, especially if the plastic wrap was not tightly sealed around the food.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Il avait des crampes d'estomax) is the correct answer. The employee claimed to have stomach cramps as an excuse for not coming to work, which could be a common and believable reason for taking a day off.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille est tombée dans la piscine,"" it is more likely that she fell into the pool rather than running or jumping from the terrace or diving board. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (C'était le jour de la première du film) is more likely. The fact that tickets are being sold suggests that the movie is popular and people want to see it, which makes it less likely that the movie received bad reviews.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Les gens l'ont isolé) is the more likely explanation for why the man lost weight. The fact that people have isolated him suggests that they may be treating him differently or avoiding him due to his weight loss, rather than simply giving him compliments.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (She has tapped a letter) is the more likely cause for her hands to have swollen. This is because tapping can cause inflammation or redness in the fingers, leading to swelling. Grimping on a rope may also cause hand swelling due to the pressure applied, but it is less likely compared to tapping a letter.
"Response:  Option B: The acrobat made a jump on a trapeze. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the artist performed a trick involving a trapeze rather than juggling with a monocycle. Trapeze artistry is a common circus act that involves aerial acrobatics and flips, while juggling with a monocycle is not typically associated with circus performances. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je n'ai plus de patience,"" it is more likely that option A (Mon ami m'a fait attendre) is the correct answer. The phrase ""m'a fait attendre"" implies that my friend made me wait, which aligns with the negative sentiment expressed in the premise."
"Response: 
Option B: They have negotiated a treaty.  
Explanation: The premise states that countries in war want peace, so they are more likely to negotiate a treaty rather than develop nuclear weapons."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Il est devenu somnolent) is correct. The phrase ""l'homme a pris des somnifères"" suggests that the man took sleeping pills, which would cause him to become drowsy or somnolent. This effect is more plausible than Option B (Il avait de la fièvre), as there is no indication in the premise that the man had a fever."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (She has injured her knee) is more likely to occur than option A (The leg of the sofa has detached). This is because the injury to the knee is a direct result of falling onto the ground, whereas the leg of the sofa detaching would be an unlikely and unrelated occurrence.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le garçon a serré le ballon,"" it is more likely that the ballon will be damaged or broken (option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Le ballon est éclaté."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They are at the airport) is more likely. The premise mentions that they have recorded themselves in their hotel room, implying that they are currently away from home and traveling somewhere else. Since an airport is a common place for people to depart or arrive when traveling, it is more likely that they are at the airport rather than their hotel room.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai mordu dans la pêche,"" it is more likely that the pêche (fish) is meurtrie (wounded). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mes mains sont devenus collantes,"" it is more likely that option A (J'ai mangé un donut) is the correct answer. This is because a sugary food like a donut can cause sticky hands due to the sugar content. In contrast, having a sweet tooth does not directly cause sticky hands. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai poussé la porte,"" it is more likely that the door will open (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the products have been fabricated by child labor) is a more plausible cause for the protesters to have boycotted the products than option A (the products have undergone quality assurance tests). This is because using child labor in production is often associated with unethical or exploitative practices that may be of concern to social activists and consumers who advocate for fair labor standards.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A: Une souris est sortie du trou (A mouse has come out of the hole). The reason being that a small creature like a mouse can easily fit through a hole in the wall, whereas dust or debris may not be able to pass through the same opening. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Sa sœur était heureuse) is the most likely cause of the woman's jealousy. The fact that her sister was happy suggests that there may be a perceived threat to the woman's own happiness or relationship with her partner, leading to feelings of envy or insecurity.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (J'ai changé de chemise) is more likely. The act of spilling wine on a shirt would typically result in staining or ruining the garment, so it makes sense that the speaker might change into a new one rather than trying to clean or cover up the stain with a tablier (a type of apron).
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Le client a fouillé son portefeuille) is more likely. The phrase ""ouvrit la caisse enregistreuse"" suggests that the cashier opened the register, implying that money was involved in some way. It makes no sense for the customer to give the cashier money if they have already found their own funds in their wallet. Therefore, it is more plausible that the customer had to search through their own belongings rather than receive payment from someone else."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (On lui a given de l'argent) is more likely. The premise states that the street performer attracted a crowd, which suggests that he was successful in his performance. It is unlikely that he would have been able to do so if he had simply sent the crowd away. Therefore, it is more likely that he received money from the people who watched him perform.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (C'était l'heure du goûter) is more likely. The fact that the boy cried at his babysitter suggests that he was hungry or uncomfortable during their time together, rather than missing his parents.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the pilot has survolé (flown over) the storm rather than having deviated from it. This is because the radar of the pilot would have detected the storm before it was close enough to be a threat, allowing the pilot to fly around it safely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Les feuilles ont changé de couleur) is more likely. The premise states that l'arbre a perdu ses feuilles, indicating that all of the leaves have fallen off the tree. This implies that there are no longer any green leaves on the tree, which means that they must have changed color or dropped off entirely. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the tree has lost its leaves.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he decided to make a joke with his sister) is more likely. The fact that he was in a bad mood suggests that he may have been looking for a way to lighten the atmosphere or distract himself from his negative emotions, which could lead him to try to make his sister laugh.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Son father stopped at a service station) is more likely. The fact that the child complained about having to go to the bathroom suggests that they may have been in need of relief, and stopping at a service station would provide an opportunity for them to use the restroom.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the fish has swum towards the food (option B).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she has changed her political affiliation (Option A). The premise states that ""les opinions politiques"" of the woman have changed, indicating a shift in her political beliefs rather than an increase in political engagement."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (J'ai ouvert le robinet) will unclog the sink than Option B (J'ai versé du nettoyant de drainage dedans). This is because opening the faucet may help to flush out any blockages in the pipe, rather than introducing a new substance into the system that could potentially cause further clogs.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Les passagers sont descendus du train,"" option A is the most likely cause. The passengers have disembarked from the train, indicating that it has arrived at its destination. Option B does not provide any information about the arrival of the train or the actions of the passengers."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man pressed his wet elbow onto the envelope rather than putting a stamp or sealing it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They loved being together) is more likely. The friends have lost touch because they enjoyed spending time with each other and valued their friendship. This suggests that they may have drifted apart due to busy schedules or personal reasons, rather than moving to different cities.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she was renounced from her position (Option A). The reason being that mismanaging company funds can lead to serious consequences such as termination of employment.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai regardé l'horloge,"" it is more likely that the speaker heard the tick of the clock (Option A)."
Response:  Option B: Ma femme et moi nous sommes tenus par la main. (My wife and I are holding hands.)
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le boulon est serré,"" option A is the most likely cause. The premise suggests that the bolt is tightened, making it unlikely that turning the key would loosen it. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (La ville a condamné l'appartement) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She thought she saw a lightning) is more likely. The woman was sitting outside on the porch, indicating that she was in an outdoor location where it would be difficult to see the sunset. Additionally, the mention of ""un éclair"" suggests that the woman may have been distracted or confused, leading her to misinterpret what she saw. Therefore, option B is more plausible than option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the water was shallow) is more likely. The man wore a life jacket in the water, indicating that he knew how to swim or had some means of flotation. Therefore, it is unlikely that he did not know how to swim.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She has pressed the backspace key) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (elle a eu une mauvaise note) is the correct answer. The premise states that the girl was bragging to her friends, which suggests that she may have been boasting about something positive, such as a good grade or achievement. However, the mention of a ""mauvaise note"" implies that she did not do well in school, which would be a negative outcome that she might not want to share with her friends. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La pelouse était boueuse,"" option B is the most likely cause: It was full of mud. The word ""boueuse"" in French specifically means ""muddy."" Therefore, it is more likely that the grass was covered in mud rather than having rained heavily during the night (option A)."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option B (elle a oublé de régler son réveil) is the correct answer. The fact that she has overslept suggests that she may have forgotten to set her alarm clock or turn off her phone's sleep mode, leading to an unexpectedly long nap.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme s'a mis de la crème solaire,"" it is more likely that he went to the beach (Option B). This is because sunscreen is typically applied at the beach or other outdoor locations where one will be exposed to direct sunlight."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Les chercheurs ont rétracté la théorie) is more likely. The passage states that ""les chercheurs ont prouvé la théorie,"" indicating that they have provided evidence supporting the theory. However, it does not mention anything about them retracting the theory or individuals accepting it. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible outcome based on the information provided in the passage."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Les fans du match ont hué,"" it is more likely that Option A (The match was played in prolongation) is the correct answer. The fans were shouting because the match went into overtime, rather than because of an incorrect call by the referee."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Je ferme la serrure) will occur. The premise states that the speaker has put their combination on the lock, indicating that they have the necessary key or code to open the door. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the speaker will be able to successfully open the door by using their combination.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La foule s'est intensifiée,"" option B (Le père saisit la main de son fils) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La neige bloquait l'allée,"" option B is more likely. The premise suggests that the snow was blocking the path, so it is unlikely that the speaker gathered all of the snow into a ball. Instead, they would have needed to clear the snow from the path in order for people or vehicles to pass through. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Option B: The kayak has hit a wave.
Explanation: According to the premise ""Les kayakistes ont ramé leurs rames,"" the kayakers have paddled their kayaks. This implies that they are moving forward through the water, making it more likely that they will encounter waves or other obstacles in their path. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (She has crashed into a fence) is more likely to occur than Option A (She has let go of the handlebars). This is because the phrase ""she has lost control"" implies that something unexpected or unintentional has happened, such as hitting an obstacle like a fence. It is less likely that she would simply release the handlebars without any external cause."
Response:  Option B: Je sentais l'air frais passer sur moi.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Les surfeurs sont retournés à la plage,"" it is more likely that they were wet (Option A). The phrase ""retournés"" means ""returned,"" indicating that they had been at the beach before and are now returning there. It does not suggest that they saw a shark or were scared by one. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The water has eclaboussé (splashed) onto the floor, indicating that it was not completely drained from the bathtub. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he will accuse her of infidelity rather than admitting to his own infidelity. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'encre sur l'affiche était éclaboussée,"" option B (I have spilled water on the poster) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option B (Il a mouillé le lit) is the correct answer. The fact that the child woke up screaming suggests that they may have had a nightmare or an upsetting dream, which could result in them wetting the bed. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for why the child woke up crying.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Son father gave him a lecture) is more likely. The boy placing his feet on the table may be seen as disrespectful or defiant behavior, leading to a scolding from his father rather than simply sitting next to him.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (J’ai crié son nom) is the more likely cause. The fact that my friend turned his head in my direction suggests that he may have heard something or sensed someone calling out to him, which aligns better with Option A than Option B (Je lui ai fait signe).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Les citoyens se sont révoltés) is more likely. The government has been oppressing its citizens for a long time, leading to widespread discontent and frustration among the population. As a result, there may be an increased likelihood of civil unrest or rebellion against the government. Therefore, Option A is the most appropriate choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he cried for help than set up a tent. The boy was lost in the woods, which means he would be disoriented and unable to find his way back. Crying for help would be a logical response to this situation, as it would alert any potential rescuers to his location and allow them to provide assistance. Setting up a tent would not necessarily accomplish this goal, as it may not be easily visible from a distance or provide adequate protection against the elements.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (She wanted to know other cultures) is more likely. The woman traveled abroad to learn about different cultures, indicating that she had an interest in exploring new experiences and broadening her horizons beyond her own culture. This aligns with the idea of cultural curiosity and openness, which are common motivations for traveling abroad. In contrast, Option A (She wanted to learn how to draw) does not necessarily require international travel and could be achieved through local classes or online tutorials.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Son collègue a été promu) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the man's jealousy. The other option does not provide any specific reason for the man's feelings of insecurity.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Il avait des hallucinations) is the correct answer. The fact that he saw ""des extraterrestres"" suggests that his experience was not based on reality but rather on his own imagination or perception. Hallucinations are a common symptom of various mental health conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and psychotic episodes. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the man's claim."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Il y a mis de l'eau de Javel) is the correct answer. The phrase ""il y a mis"" implies intentional action, suggesting that someone has deliberately added something to the man's hair, rather than simply using shampoo as in option B. Additionally, the use of ""de l'eau de Javel"" specifically refers to a type of hair dye, further supporting this conclusion."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she has felt an inspiration) is more likely. The artist has created new works, indicating that she was feeling inspired and motivated to create something new. Criticizing previous work would not necessarily lead to creating new pieces.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Il a été libéré de l'armée) is the correct answer. The son has left home, which suggests that he may have completed his military service or been discharged from the army. This is supported by the fact that the father mentions ""il a été libéré de l'armée"" when talking to the mother about the son's departure."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Les étagères étaient couvertes de poussière) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why books would fall off an etagère. A sudden earthquake or tremor may not necessarily cause books to fall off a shelf, but dust and dirt can make them slippery and increase the likelihood of them falling.
"Response:  Option B: J'ai réinitialisé le disjoncteur.
Explanation: The premise states that the electricity in the house has gone out, which suggests that there may be a problem with the electrical system. Reinitializing the circuit breaker is a common solution to this problem, as it can help restore power to the house. On the other hand, turning on a light bulb would not necessarily solve the issue of a complete loss of electricity in the house. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""On a fait la montagne russie,"" option A, ""Ça faisait peur,"" is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (J'ai versé du beurre dans le sac) caused the popcorn to start bursting. Adding butter to the popcorn can make it more susceptible to overheating and popping, especially if it is not cooked properly. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the popcorn bursting.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Les prévisions de météo annonçaient des vents violents) is more likely. The fallen tree may have been blown over by strong winds, causing it to come into contact with the power line.
"Response: 
Option B: He offended the audience.
Explanation: The speaker made comments that were considered inappropriate or insulting to some members of the audience, leading them to feel offended or disrespected. This option best captures the idea conveyed by the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me suis piquée avec l'épingle,"" it is more likely that a drop of blood (Option B) has formed on your finger rather than a drop of sweat (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le poisson flottait à la surface de l'aquarium,"" it is more likely that he was dead (Option B). The reason being that a fish floating at the surface of an aquarium would typically be a sign of death rather than hunger."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La voix de l'homme était rauque,"" option A (Il avait un rhume) is the more likely cause. Rhinitis, or a common cold, can cause hoarseness in the voice due to inflammation of the vocal cords. Fumar, or smoking, does not directly affect the vocal cords and would unlikely cause hoarseness. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B: The ascender has gotten stuck between two floors is a more plausible explanation for why the elevator doors have opened. This option aligns with the information provided in the premise that the elevator has stopped at an intermediate floor without reaching its destination.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He lied to his parents) is more likely. The fact that she ran away suggests that there may have been some underlying issue or conflict that led her to leave home without her parents' knowledge or consent. It is less likely that they would put her in the house against her will without any explanation or warning.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (La toilette était débordée) is a more likely cause of an overflowing bathroom than option B (Le chauffe-eau est cassé). This is because a clogged or overflowing toilet is more common than a broken water heater causing an issue with the shower or bathtub drain. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the owner put a collar on the dog) than Option B (the owner kept the dog on a leash). The premise states that the dog ""is still near its owner,"" which suggests that the dog is not being held back by a leash but rather is free to roam nearby."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme a attrapé son reflet,"" option A (Il se tenait sous l'arbre tentaculaire) is the most likely cause. The man caught his reflection under an umbrella tree, which suggests that he was in a position to see himself reflected in the water below. This is consistent with the idea of someone standing near or above a body of water and catching their own reflection. Option B (Il se tenait au-dessus du lac calme) does not provide any specific information about where the man was located relative to the water, making it less likely as a cause for why he caught his reflection."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Je l'ai rappelée) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Leir chien s'est enfui de chez lui) is the most likely cause of the problem. The family has searched the neighborhood, indicating that they have looked for their dog in the surrounding area but could not find it. This suggests that the dog may have escaped or run away from home, rather than something valuable being stolen from their house.
"Response:  Option A: The time was cold.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Je voyais mon souffle,"" we can infer that the speaker could see their breath in the air. This suggests a cool or cold temperature, as it would be difficult to see one's breath in warm weather. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They wanted better working conditions) is more likely. The passage states that the employees formed a union to improve their working conditions, indicating that they were not satisfied with their current conditions and wanted changes. An increase in salary would not necessarily motivate them to form a union unless it was accompanied by other demands for improved working conditions.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (a warm scent filled the kitchen) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme avait du mal à marcher,"" option B is the more likely cause: She removed her shoes. This answer choice aligns with the information provided in the premise, as removing one's shoes can help alleviate foot pain or discomfort. Option A does not make sense in this context, as wearing high heels would exacerbate rather than relieve foot pain."
"Response:  Option A: L'eau a bouilli (The water has boiled).
Explanation: According to the premise ""La vapeur s'est élévée du pot d'eau,"" steam has risen from the pot of water. This suggests that the water has reached its boiling point and is producing steam. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Toutes mes chaussettes étaient à la blanchisserie,"" it is more likely that Option B (Je portais des bottes) is correct. The fact that all of my socks were at the laundry suggests that I had been wearing boots or other footwear that required socks, rather than sandals."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he has lost the support of electors) is more likely to be the reason for his downfall as an argument can only persuade people who are willing to listen. If he has lost their trust or support, it will be difficult for him to convince them otherwise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The couple has escaped) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Le millionnaire voulait que le bâtiment soit démoli) is more likely. The fact that the building was dedicated to a millionaire suggests that it may have been built as a personal project or gift, rather than something that he contributed to financially. Therefore, it is more likely that he would want to demolish the building if it no longer served his purposes or if he wanted to make way for something else.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Le vendeur a vu la fille mettre des marchandises dans son sac) is more likely. The vendor has accused the girl of stealing, indicating that they saw her taking something without permission. Option B does not provide any evidence to support this claim.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Des soldiers have been sent to fight in the war) is more likely. The sentence mentions that the country has declared war on its neighbor, indicating that there will be military action involved. It does not mention anything about soldiers being reunited with their families, which suggests that they are instead preparing for or engaged in combat.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (une émeute a éclaté devant le palais de justice) is more likely. The use of the word ""controversial"" in the premise suggests that there may be strong feelings or opinions involved, which could lead to an angry reaction such as an émeute."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille a senti quelque chose qui brûlait,"" Option B is the more likely cause. The phrase ""quoi qui brûlait"" suggests that something hot or burning was felt, which could be caused by leaving the biscuits in the oven for too long. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Il pleuvait à verse"", option A is more likely. The storm has indeed worsened."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (the elevator has stopped working) is the cause of the evacuation. The fact that the building has been evacuated suggests that there is an issue with the structure or occupancy that requires immediate attention, and the failure of the elevator could be a contributing factor. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Le père a jeté son fils hors de la maison) is more likely. The father being angry with his son for his alcoholism would lead him to take drastic measures such as kicking him out of the house rather than offering him a drink.
"Response:  Option B: The elevator was out of order.  
Explanation: Given that the lawyer had to go upstairs to reach her office, it is more likely that the elevator was not working, rather than the secretary being absent or the staircase being blocked by an obstacle."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme s'est énervé contre son ami,"" option B is the most likely cause of his anger: His friend offered him a meal."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (La caissière a données à la fille son change) is more likely. The girl has given her money to the cashier, so it's reasonable to assume that the cashier would give her back her change. Option B (Le caissier a oublié de donner un reçu à la fille) is less likely because there's no indication in the premise that the cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she was put into a wheelchair after an accident (Option A). This is because being taken to the hospital on a stretcher suggests that she may have been injured or ill enough to require medical attention, but does not necessarily imply that she became unable to walk.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (the country was confronted with economic difficulties) is the correct answer. The mention of citizens hanging their national flag in front of their homes suggests a sense of patriotism and pride, but does not necessarily indicate any particular reason for doing so. Economic difficulties could be a motivating factor for people to show their support for their country in this way.
"Response: 
Option B: They have inspired their fans.
Explanation: The team has lost the tournament but still managed to inspire their fans. This suggests that they have shown determination, hard work, and passion despite not winning the championship. Their fans are motivated by their example and will continue to support them in future endeavors."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mon ami m'a dit que j'ai de la nourriture coincée dans les dents,"" option A is more likely. The speaker feels embarrassed or gênée about having food stuck in their teeth, rather than feeling proud of it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Il a oublié d'étudier) is more likely. The boy failed his history exam because he did not study for it, rather than being attentive in class.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a tremblement de terre) is more likely to be the cause of the building collapse in the city center. Earthquakes are known to cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially if they occur close to populated areas. The increase in criminal activity (option B) may also contribute to the collapse of a building, but it is less likely to be the sole cause of an entire building collapsing in a central location.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (She presented him to her parents) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Their heads have collided) is more likely to occur than Option A (The ball has rolled away). This is because when two children simultaneously reach for a ball, it is more likely that they will collide with each other rather than the ball rolling away.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Il y avait du carton dans la poubelle) is the most likely cause. The fact that there was cardboard in the trash suggests that someone may have thrown away something with packaging, such as a box or package, rather than simply rummaging through it for food scraps.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le garçon a aiguisé le crayon,"" option B is more likely. The boy sharpened the pencil, making it more likely that he found the task boring rather than cheap."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (La robe ne me correspondait pas) is more likely to be the cause of the woman's dissatisfaction with the cashier's service. The fact that the cashier refused to give her money back suggests that there was an issue with the quality or fit of the item she purchased, rather than simply losing a receipt.
Response:  Option B: Ça a laissé une cicatrice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (He was looking at his phone) is a more plausible explanation for why the passengers were staring at him. It is unlikely that he would be engrossed in self-talk while riding a train, as this behavior is generally associated with social isolation or discomfort rather than introspection. In contrast, checking one's phone can provide an innocuous explanation for why someone might be preoccupied with their surroundings without drawing attention to themselves.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Les fourmis se sont glissées sur les miettes) is more likely. The fact that the child left crumbs on the floor suggests that they were not careful enough to avoid leaving any behind, making it more likely for ants to be attracted to them.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (La sœur de la femme a croisé les mains) is the more likely cause. The fact that the woman gave her sister a handkerchief suggests that she may have wanted to comfort or console her, which could lead to the sister crossing her arms in response. Option B (La sœur de la femme se mit à pleurer) does not align with this interpretation as it implies a stronger emotional reaction than what is suggested by the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Il a pris une pièce,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""Ses lèvres étaient fendues"" means ""His lips were split,"" indicating that he had an injury to his mouth or face caused by something sharp or heavy. This is a plausible explanation for why someone might be in pain after taking a piece of something. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that they have anticipated traffic around the theatre. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Her colleague at work has covered for her) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Il soutenait leur cause) is true. The use of the word ""militants"" suggests that the person signed a petition related to an important social or political issue, and the fact that they have been denounced as being foolish by someone else does not necessarily mean that they do not support their cause. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Il avait la peur de la scene) is more likely. The phrase ""le cœur de l'acteur battait en éclats"" suggests that he was experiencing intense fear or anxiety before his performance, rather than simply memorizing his lines."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me suis perdu,"" it is more likely that Option A (J'ai compté mon argent) is the correct answer because ""compté"" means ""counted"" in French, which does not relate to getting lost or being disoriented. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Les fruits mûrs s'attardèrent au soleil,"" option A (Il a été mangé) is the most likely answer. The phrase ""s'attardèrent"" means ""were delayed,"" indicating that something happened to cause the fruit to remain in the sun longer than expected. Option A suggests that someone or something consumed the fruit, causing it to be delayed. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La voiture est tombée en panne,"" it is more likely that the cause of the breakdown is Option B: The engine has overheated. This is because an overheating engine can cause a vehicle to stop working properly or even stall completely, which aligns with the symptoms described in the premise. In contrast, option A (I have lit a contact) does not necessarily explain why the car stopped working."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he stayed in bed for several days (Option B). This is because a back injury would typically require some form of medical attention or treatment, such as physical therapy or medication, rather than simply going to see a psychiatrist (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai allumé un feu dans la cheminée,"" it is more likely that Option B, ""Il faisait froid dans la maison,"" is the correct cause. This is because starting a fire in the chimney suggests that one was trying to warm up the house, which would be necessary if it were cold inside."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme a arrêté de courir,"" option B (She had a second wind) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ma voisine a quitté sa maison) is more likely. The fact that my neighbor has left her house suggests that she may not be present to answer the door, making it less likely for me to have struck the door without an invitation.
"Response:  Option A: Son mari a mal compris ses préoccupations.  
Explanation: The woman sighed with frustration, indicating that her husband had not understood her concerns. This is supported by the fact that she was trying to explain something to him but he did not seem to be paying attention or understanding what she was saying. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the woman's reaction."
"Response: 
Option A: L'étudiant a répondu correctement à la question. 
Rationale: The premise states that the professor has praised the student, indicating that the student has performed well or answered correctly to a question. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the student indeed responded correctly to the question."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme n'had plus d'œufs,"" it is more likely that she went to the supermarket (Option B) than to the farm (Option A). This is because eggs are typically sold in a supermarket rather than being produced directly at a farm."
"Response: 
Option B: I hugged him."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Il semblait contaminé) is more likely. The woman avoided going into the lake because she thought it was contaminated, not because she had caught a fish.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (his parapluie was broken) is more likely than option B (his bike was stolen). The student arrived in class wet, indicating that he may have gotten caught in the rain without an umbrella. It is less likely that someone would steal his bicycle and leave him stranded in the rain.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A: The user has clicked on the mouse. This is because when an user clicks on something on their computer screen using a mouse, the cursor will move accordingly. Therefore, if the cursor has moved on its own without any input from the user, it is more likely that they have simply clicked somewhere by accident or through a glitch rather than moving the mouse themselves.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (an accident occurred on the main road) happened. The fact that the driver took a detour suggests that there was an obstacle or hazard on the main road that required them to take a different route. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the driver took a detour.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: The linge is taché (the clothes are stained). This is because hanging wet clothes outside to dry can lead to stains from dirt or debris on the surrounding surfaces.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme a mis ses lunettes,"" option A is the most likely cause. The woman putting on her sunglasses suggests that she may be outside or in a bright environment, which could make it necessary for her to wear sunglasses to protect her eyes from the sun's glare. Option B does not provide any context that would suggest why the woman might have called a taxi."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme regardait le ciel nocturne,"" it is more likely that he found it magnificent (Option B). The phrase ""regardait le ciel"" suggests a sense of wonder or admiration for the night sky, rather than wishing for something else to be different."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me sentai épuisé,"" option B is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker stayed awake all night, which would indeed make them feel exhausted in the morning. Option A, ""Je me suis couché tôt,"" implies that the speaker went to bed early but does not necessarily imply exhaustion."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme est allé chez le coiffeur,"" it is more likely that he had his hair cut (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Le garçon n'aimait pas son nouveau camarade de classe) is more likely. The fact that the boy played mean tricks on his new classmate suggests that he may not have gotten along with him or had negative feelings towards him.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'avais envie d'un verre de lait,"" option A (Je mangeais des biscuits) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Il s'est mis à pleuvoir,"" it is more likely that the driver turned on their headlights (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Je me suis garé near the entrance) is more likely. The premise states that the building's parking lot was empty, so it is unlikely that you parked in front of the building. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (She had a blockage of the author) is the correct answer. This is because the author missed the deadline for submission of the project, indicating that there was an external factor preventing them from completing the task. It is unlikely that the author edited their own brouillon without any outside influence or interference.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (J'ai demandé à parler à un superviseur) is more likely because it suggests that the speaker was able to reach a higher-level authority figure within the company, whereas Option B (J'ai fourvi mon numéro d'identification) does not provide any indication of how the speaker attempted to contact the company or what their outcome may have been.
"Response:  Option B: The rideaux trembled.
Explanation: According to the premise ""Le vent soufflait à travers la fenêtre ouverte,"" there was wind blowing through the open window. This means that the rideaux (or curtains) were likely to be moving or trembling due to the wind. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: J'ai fait sauter une bouée.  
Explanation: The premise states that the electricity in the house has gone out, which suggests a larger issue such as a power grid failure or a blown fuse rather than simply turning off a light switch. Therefore, option B, ""I have blown a fuse,"" is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option B: He has lifted the bar above his head.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Il a été confus) is more likely. The student tried to do calculations in their head but failed, indicating confusion or difficulty with mental math skills. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the father changed the baby's diaper) than Option B (the father shook the baby gently). This is because changing a dirty diaper can cause a baby to become drowsy or fall asleep, whereas shaking a baby gently may not have this effect.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the boy will have a commotion cerebral (Option A). The phrase ""a commotion cerebral"" suggests a serious injury to the brain, which could result in long-term cognitive or physical impairments. Being ""trempé,"" on the other hand, means being wet or soaked, which would not necessarily cause any lasting harm. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Tout le monde sur les photos refusait de sourire) is more likely. The idea that everyone in the photos refused to smile suggests that there may have been some discomfort or awkwardness during the photo shoot, which could result in unflattering expressions on people's faces. This is more plausible than the alternative of the photos being blurry due to forgetting to use the flash.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Je me sentaisalone) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me suis entraîné,"" option A is the most likely cause: ""Je me sentais énergique."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai pressé l'éponge humide,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Il a absorbé de l'eau"" will occur. When you press an already-wet sponge, water will be absorbed by the sponge rather than flowing out of it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The station was on an island) is more likely. The fact that the passengers took a ferry to reach the station suggests that it is located on an island or in some other remote location that can only be accessed by boat. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She wanted to rebel) is more likely as it suggests that the adolescent made the decision to get tattooed as an act of defiance or nonconformity, rather than out of fear of needles.
"Response: 
Option B: I have called the police.
Explanation: The premise states that an unknown car is parked outside your house, which could be a potential threat or danger to you or your family. In this situation, it would be reasonable to call the police as soon as possible to report the incident and seek their assistance. Option A suggests that you are becoming suspicious or paranoid, but given the circumstances described in the premise, calling the police is the most logical course of action."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The fact that there were no evidence against him suggests that he might have been innocent or had an alibi. It does not necessarily imply his guilt as suggested in Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (éviter la caféine) is more likely to lead to weight loss. The reason being that reducing or eliminating caffeine intake can help reduce overall calorie consumption, as it can suppress appetite and increase fat burning. On the other hand, stopping sugar-rich snacks like bonbons may not have as significant an impact on weight loss, especially if they are replaced with other high-calorie foods.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille a marché sur la glace,"" it is more likely that she will have glided (Option A) than trembled (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme avait des boucles sous les yeux,"" Option A is the more likely cause. The woman stayed awake all night because she had bags under her eyes, indicating that she did not get enough sleep. This suggests that she was tired or exhausted, which could have been caused by staying up late to take care of her child. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why the woman had bags under her eyes."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La lave coulait du volcan,"" option A (Le volcan a fait une éruption) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme a mis ses chaussures,"" option B is more likely. The woman wanted to leave the party because she had put her shoes on, indicating that she was ready to go."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai payé le préposé au péage,"" it is more likely that she let you pass through the toll booth (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Il a vendu ses actions de la société) is more likely. The director's failure to pay his debts could be due to him selling his shares in the company rather than gaspilling his fortune.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Le docteur était en congé) is the correct answer. The phrase ""le médecin"" does not provide any indication of illness or medical condition, only mentioning the doctor being away on vacation or leave. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man went to see the doctor."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the house was on fire) than Option B (the house was empty). This is because if someone had left their room through a window while the house was on fire, they would be in danger of being injured or killed by the flames or smoke. It is less likely that someone would leave their room through a window if the house were empty.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he made mousse with soap) is the more likely cause of the boy's scraped fingers. The premise suggests that the boy's fingers were injured while he was doing something to his hands, such as making mousse, which could have caused him to accidentally scrape them against something. Option A (taking a long shower) does not provide any information about how the boy's fingers became scraped or injured.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je crache le lait,"" it is more likely that Option A (the milk had an acid taste) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai raté le bus,"" it is more likely that Option B: J'etais en retard au travail is true."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option B: The car was crushed. This is because the phrase ""the truck entered into collision with the car"" implies that there was a significant impact involving both vehicles, leading to damage or destruction of one or both of them. Given that the truck is larger and heavier than most cars, it is more likely that the car would be crushed in such an accident."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They have won) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I have returned the bottle) is the more likely cause. The fact that the bottle has sifted suggests that it was not properly sealed or closed, which could be due to returning it without properly resealing it. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the bottle sifted.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (He was climbing up) is a more likely explanation for how the boy got out of his house than option A (He entered through an open window). The premise states that the boy was ""enfermed"" or locked outside of his house, suggesting that he may have been unable to enter through a window without assistance. Therefore, option B is a more plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La sonnette a sonné,"" it is more likely that Option A: Le visiteur frappa à la porte occurred. This is because the sound of the doorbell suggests someone is at the door, which aligns with the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme a taché son costume,"" option A (Il l'a fait nettoyer) is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: La fille a craché le dentifrice.  
Explanation: The premise states that la fille has pressed the tube of dentifrice, implying that she has squeezed it with force. As a result, it is more likely that she would have spat out the toothpaste rather than it having sautéed from the tube."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Les pacifistes ont organisé un défilé) is more likely. The passage states that ""les morts civiles de la guerre ont augmenté,"" indicating an increase in civilian deaths due to war. This suggests a somber and serious tone, which would be more fitting for a funeral procession than a peaceful protest march. Therefore, it is more likely that les pacifistes have organized a défilé rather than a manifestion."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille a arraché le ruban de ses cheveux,"" option A is more likely. The fact that she tore it off suggests that she was not attached to it, which supports this answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Il a vieilli) is correct. The passage states that he has undergone plastic surgery, which could potentially make him look older, not younger. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the egg has hatched) than Option B (I have cracked the egg). Therefore, the answer is (A) The egg has hatched.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le prisonnier mourut de faim,"" it is more likely that he died of hunger (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme a perdu son équilibre sur l'échelle,"" it is more likely that he has fallen from the ladder (Option B). The phrase ""perdu son équilibre"" suggests that he lost his balance, which could only occur if he was already on the ladder. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'enfant a fait un rôt,"" it is more likely that he took a gulp of soda (Option A). The word ""rôt"" suggests something hot or burning, which does not match with opening a can of soda."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Un courant d'air froid est entré par la fenêtre,"" option B: Je tremblais, is the most likely answer. The cold air entering through the window would cause a person to shiver or tremble."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ses camarades de classe la respectait) is more likely. The fact that the student received a scholarship suggests that they have achieved something notable, such as good grades or academic achievements, which would likely earn them the respect of their peers.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She lived next to him) is a more likely cause for her teasing him than option B (She was in love with him). The fact that she lived next to him suggests that they had a close proximity, which could have led to playful bantering or joking around. However, if she were in love with him, it's unlikely that she would be teasing him so casually without any romantic intentions. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Il a incité à la pitié) is more likely. The phrase ""Le vagabond affamé"" suggests that the person is hungry and poor, and therefore more likely to appeal for pity rather than money."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I felt lonely) is a more likely cause than Option A (I wanted to be alone).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme m'a tendu la main,"" it is more likely that option A (Je lui ai serré la main) is correct. The phrase ""tendu la main"" means to offer or extend a hand in friendship or help, so it would be appropriate for the person to accept the offered handshake. Option B (Je lui ai given a slap) does not fit with the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me suis écroulé,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""seized"" suggests a sudden and unexpected collapse or fall, which could be caused by a loud noise such as fireworks or an object flying towards one's head. Option B does not align with this context and seems less plausible given the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille s'est mordue les ongles,"" option A (Elle s'inquiérait) is a more likely cause than option B (Elle était surprise). This is because the phrase ""s'est mordue les ongles"" suggests that the girl bit her nails out of habit or nervousness, rather than being surprised by something unexpected. Therefore, it is more plausible that she was worrying about something than that she was taken aback by something unexpected."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (C'était le début d'un nouveau mois) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (He has turned to his lawyer) will happen. This is because the husband's initial reaction to discovering his wife's infidelity may be anger or betrayal, leading him to seek legal advice to protect himself and their marriage.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the ball bounced (Option A). The phrase ""laissa tomber"" implies that the girl dropped the ball, which would cause it to bounce rather than saunter or glow. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she has effaced her response) is more likely. The premise states that she made an error in her exam, implying that she may have erased or corrected her answer rather than simply guessing it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le joueur a attaqué son adversaire,"" it is more likely that his opponent took the pass (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai cueilli les tomates de la vigne,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ils étaient mûrs"" (They were ripe) is the correct answer. This is because the sentence suggests that the speaker picked the tomatoes from the vine, implying that they were already ripe at the time of picking."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Il a rencontré son ex-petite amie pour déjeuner) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: The time has warmed up.
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Le mercure dans le thermomètre a augmenté,"" which means that the mercury in the thermometer has risen. This indicates that the temperature outside has increased, not that the thermometer itself has been dropped or lost. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the roof of the palace of justice has exploded (Option A). The phrase ""une tornade est passée par la ville"" suggests that a tornado has passed through the city, which could potentially cause significant damage to buildings, including the palace of justice. While ice can also be dangerous on roads, it is less likely to cause structural damage to a building like the palace of justice. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the student's notes have increased rather than him cheating on the exam. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me sentai à l'aise,"" option A (Je me suis agenouillé sur le sol) is a more likely cause than option B (Je me suis enveloppé dans une couverture). This is because the phrase ""me sentai"" suggests a physical position or action, such as kneeling, rather than being wrapped in a blanket."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai poli la pierre,"" it is more likely that the stone became smooth (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the café was sucré) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He tore up the papers.
Explanation: The phrase ""l'homme fouilla"" means ""the man searched,"" implying that he was looking for something in the newspapers. Since he was searching through them, it is more likely that he tore them up rather than cutting himself with paper. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the clou has been enfoncé into the wood) is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le poisson a mordu la ligne,"" it is more likely that the fish bit the line than the pêcheur (fisherman) retrieved the fish or reformed the line. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has removed her earring) is more likely. The premise states that she was ""gênée"" or embarrassed to go to school, which could be due to various reasons such as feeling self-conscious about her appearance or being anxious about something specific related to school. Removing an earring is a common way for someone to feel more comfortable or confident in their appearance, especially during adolescence when many teenagers are sensitive about how they look. Therefore, it is more likely that the girl removed her earring rather than having a button."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mon expression s'est éclairée,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""s'est éclairée"" means ""has brightened up,"" which suggests that something positive has happened to the speaker's face or mood. Therefore, option A is the best answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me suis essuyé les mains avec une serviette,"" it is more likely that the servant was wet rather than the hands. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: ""Mes mains étaient mouillées."""
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the tabouret moves under him) is the more likely cause of the man losing his balance. The premise states that the man lost his equilibrium ""on the stool,"" implying that he was sitting or standing on it when he lost his balance. It is less likely that he would accidentally spill paint on the stool while in a stable position, as this would not affect his ability to maintain his balance. Therefore, option A is the better choice."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Je regrette mon erreur) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Il lui a posé des questions sur elle-même) is more likely as it suggests that the man was interested in getting to know his partner better, whereas option B (Il parlait sans cesse de lui) implies that he was self-centered and only thinking about himself.
Response:  Option B: Her dimples appeared.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the enemy ship exploded above the mine) than Option B (the enemy ship entered the port).

"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme s'est percé le pied,"" option A (Il est tombé dans une flaque) is the most likely cause."

Explanation: According to the premise, the economy of the country has declined. This means that there are fewer job opportunities available, leading to an increase in unemployment. Therefore, option B is the most likely effect."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They were going to enter into traffic) is more likely. The guard's action of whistling at the children suggests that they were about to cross the street without proper supervision or safety measures in place, which could have put them at risk of being hit by a vehicle. Therefore, it is more likely that the guard was trying to prevent them from entering into traffic rather than recognizing them in their neighborhood.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (He made a sarky remark) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The chauffeur took an autostop) is more likely. The reason being that taking an autostop is a common occurrence in many parts of the world where public transportation is scarce or non-existent.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme est entrée en travail"", option A: Le bébé est né is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Il faisait du vent dehors) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the man's hat was blown away by the wind.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She received an invitation) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le front du garçon était chaud,"" it is more likely that Option A: Sa mère lui a taken the temperature.

Explanation: The premise states that the man ""s'est aspergé de parfum,"" which means he sprayed himself with perfume. This suggests that he was trying to impress someone, most likely his date or romantic partner. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Je cherchais une lampe de poche) is more likely. The fact that the electricity in the house has gone out suggests that there may be a problem with the power supply, which could cause lights to go out throughout the house. It is less likely that someone would take a pelle (a type of shovel) to fix the issue.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (the son has obtained his high school diploma) is more likely to be the reason for the family's move into a larger house.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She saw the line of arrival) is more likely. The premise states that the runner continued to walk slowly, indicating that she was not trying to conserve her energy. Therefore, it is unlikely that she stopped walking to see the finish line, as this would require her to slow down or stop completely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (La machine a craché le change) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the boy kicked the vending machine in the first place. The other option, Option B (Le sac de chips était coincé), does not provide any clear reason as to why the boy would kick the vending machine.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le chien de mon ami est mort,"" it is more likely that option A (Je lui ai fait tourner les yeux) is correct. The phrase ""tourner les yeux"" means to cry or become emotional, so it suggests that the speaker is upset about their friend's dog dying rather than being physically affectionate towards them."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he wrote a check (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme est maudit,"" option A (Il s'est coupé les ongles) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""L'homme est maudit"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the man, and cutting his own nails would be an unusual and self-inflicted act of misfortune rather than a physical injury caused by accident or natural occurrence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme était fier de son brother,"" option A is more likely. The man was proud of his brother, so it is more likely that his brother got into an argument with their parents rather than achieving something impressive like getting accepted to law school."

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (J'ai placé l'affiche au-dessus de la porte) is the correct answer. The fact that the poster is stuck to the wall suggests that it was placed there intentionally, rather than being accidentally stuck due to a spill or other unintentional contact with the wall. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the poster is stuck to the wall.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B - The architect has modified the plans - is true. This is because the client approved the plans for the building, indicating that they were satisfied with them as they stood. If the architect had built the building without modifying the plans, it would be unlikely that the client would have approved them in their current form. Therefore, it makes sense that the architect made changes to the plans before constructing the building.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme a laissé tomber sa cuillère,"" it is more likely that he dropped his spoon due to shaking (Option A). This is because the phrase ""laissé tomber"" implies a sudden and accidental action, rather than a deliberate act like licking the spoon (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Le council of administration has dissolved the society) is more likely. The reason for this is that the phrase ""le PDG a démissionné"" implies that the CEO has resigned, which could lead to the dissolution of the company by the board of directors. It is less likely that the board would find a replacement for the CEO if they have already decided to disband the company."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Je me suis approché du podium) is more likely. The fact that you are approaching the podium suggests that you have arrived late to the conference and want to make an entrance or get attention from the audience. Option A (Je me suis assise au dernier rang) does not convey this sense of urgency or importance.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sa famille a payé sa caution) is the correct answer.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They nourished the homeless) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Les passagers ont crié) is more likely. The sudden drop of the roller coaster would be startling and cause passengers to cry out in surprise rather than laugh.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'etais furieuse,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""claquai la porte"" means ""slammed the door,"" indicating a strong emotion or reaction.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Les dirigants d'autres pays ont envoyé des secours d'urgence) is more likely. The nation has suffered a natural disaster, which would require immediate assistance from other countries to help with relief efforts and rescue operations. Therefore, it is more likely that other countries will send aid rather than forming an alliance to address the crisis.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (J'ai ouvert les rideaux) is more likely as it provides a direct explanation for how the light entered the room. Opening the curtains allows sunlight to enter through the windows, whereas unlocking the door would not directly affect the amount of light in the room. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sa perruque est tombée) is correct. The phrase ""tiré les cheveux"" implies that someone has pulled or yanked the impostor's wig off, rather than causing them to become bald. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened to the impostor's appearance."

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I composed my own song) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Les cheveux du garçon were stuck,"" it is more likely that Option A (the girl deflated them) is correct because the word ""stuck"" implies a state of being fixed or adhered to something, which could be caused by the girl pulling or tugging on the boy's hair rather than simply tearing it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le bug a été écrasé,"" it is more likely that Option A (Je me suis aspergé de répulsif) is the correct answer. The phrase ""écrasé"" means ""crushed"" or ""squashed,"" indicating that the mosquito has been killed. Asperse means to spray something with a repellent, so this option makes sense in the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai ouvert les yeux,"" option A (Je me suis réveillé) is a more likely cause than option B (Je me suis détendu). This is because opening one's eyes typically requires waking up from sleep or some other state of unconsciousness, rather than relaxing or releasing tension."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Je lui ai demandé de le baisser) is the correct answer. The speaker is expressing frustration with their neighbor's loud music and asking them to turn it down, rather than requesting to borrow the music or complaining about its volume.

Option B does not fit as well, as it implies that the musician struck a drum, which would produce a different type of sound."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (the child had a fear of looking under his bed) is more likely. The fact that the parents rushed into the room suggests that they were concerned about their child's safety or well-being, which could be related to a specific phobia or anxiety. It is less likely that the child would have an nightmare that causes them to scream without any obvious reason.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she was born preterm (Option A). Gesture language is not typically associated with deafness or hearing impairment, and a person who is born preterm may have difficulty developing speech and language skills.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Les récoltes ont péri) is more likely. The phrase ""une sécheresse s'est produite"" implies a prolonged period of dry weather, which could lead to crop failure due to lack of water. Contamination of water supply is less likely in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le chat a poursuivi l'oiseau,"" it is more likely that Option A (L'oiseau s'est envolé) will occur than Option B (L'oiseau a attrapé un ver).

The premise suggests that the chef was opposed to the extremists in his country, implying that he had a differing opinion from theirs. It is unlikely that they would resort to violence against someone who disagreed with them, especially if they were influential figures in society. Instead, they may have tried to persuade or manipulate the chef through various means, such as propaganda or psychological manipulation. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Le sable m'est collé aux pieds) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker has walked barefoot on the beach, implying that their feet have come into contact with the sand. This is a common occurrence when walking on a beach, and it is unlikely that waves would crash along the coast while someone is walking there. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option B: J'ai bu un verre d'eau.
Explanation: The premise states that the person woke up in the middle of the night feeling cold. Drinking water would not necessarily make them feel warmer, as it does not provide direct warmth or insulation. In contrast, putting on a sweatpant can help keep the body warm by providing additional layers of clothing. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Son fils pleura) is more likely. The phrase ""a réduit son fils au silence"" implies that the mother has silenced her son, which could be upsetting or distressing for him. Therefore, it is more likely that he would cry rather than smile in this situation."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me suis entraîné au gymnase hier,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Je me suis réveillé avec des douleurs musculaires,"" will occur.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely.

Instead, she would be more likely to tend to his injury by putting a bandage on it.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he has received a organ transplant (Option B). This is because there are many advances in medical technology that have made it possible for people to survive diseases that were once thought to be fatal.

Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for how the man could have survived his terminal illness.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme a levé les sourcils,"" option A (Il était surpris) is the most likely cause."

"Response:  Option A (He had discovered rats in the basement)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the homeowner had discovered rats in the basement rather than having a termite infestation in his bedroom. The mention of an ""exterminator"" suggests that the issue at hand is related to pests or insects, and given the location of the discovery (basement), it is more plausible that the homeowner found signs of rodent activity there."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (J'ai été trop fatigué pour préparer quoi que ce soit) is the correct answer.

The brother's reaction of being surprised suggests that he values his privacy and personal space, and finding him reading his journal without permission could be seen as an invasion of that space. Therefore, it is more likely that she would try to protect her brother's privacy by hiding the journal rather than getting him a new one.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She did few hours extra) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La main de l'enfant se retire rapidement,"" option A (Il a touché le poêle chaud) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (distributed a survey to customers) is more likely. The company wants to measure customer satisfaction by gathering feedback through a survey.

Offering a discount to new customers may not directly address the goal of measuring customer satisfaction.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Le garçon a traîné une chaise sur le sol) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the floor would be scratched or marked.

The phrase ""la célèbre statue a brûlé"" suggests that the fire was sudden and unexpected, which aligns better with the idea of lightning striking the statue than people intentionally visiting it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - The fruit dépose des graines will occur. This is because the phrase ""les fruits"" (meaning ""the fruits"") suggests that multiple fruits are involved, and the action of ""laisser"" (meaning ""to leave"") implies that the fruits were left in a location where they could potentially drop their seeds or produce offspring. In contrast, Option B - Les mouches envahissaient le fruit does not make sense in this context, as there is no indication that any insects were present near the fruits. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (elle s'est tordu la cheville) is more likely to be the correct answer as it provides a specific injury that could occur in the knee joint, whereas option A (elle a pointé ses orteils) does not provide any logical explanation for how the dancer may have injured herself.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He was running on the playground) is more likely as it provides an explanation for why the child's shoe laces came undone.

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The tat was sale) is more likely. The premise mentions that ""I hung artworks in the room,"" implying that there were walls or a surface to hang things from. If the tat was sale, it would be difficult to hang anything on it."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (J'avais mal à la tête) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Je suis parti plus tôt"" suggests that the speaker left earlier than expected or planned, which could be due to various reasons such as feeling unwell or having a headache.

Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (She has received a pension) is the most likely cause of her financial difficulties.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je mets la fleur sous mon nez,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Les pétales sont tombés de la fleur,"" is correct.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me suis garé dans l'allée,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Le garage était ouvert,"" is the correct answer. This is because ""garé"" means ""parked,"" and therefore the speaker must have parked their car in an open garage rather than a full one."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the criminal pointed the weapon at his victim) than Option B (the victim raised their hands). This is because the premise states that the criminal had the weapon aimed at the victim, indicating that they were in a position to harm or threaten them.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (the printer was out of ink) caused the printed document to be illegible. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Les supporters se sont précipités sur le terrain) is more likely to occur. The fact that the national anthem has been played in a stadium suggests that there are many people present, and therefore it is more likely that they will rush onto the field rather than turn towards a flag.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le dip était fade,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Je l'ai servi,"" is correct. The phrase ""était fade"" means ""was bland"" or ""tasted bad,"" so it is likely that the speaker served the dip without adding any flavor to it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La serviette a absorbé le liquide) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has relieved her book) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (L'homme regarda par la fenêtre) is more likely because it suggests that the man was curious about what was happening outside the plane during the turbulence, rather than simply trying to hold onto his seat belt for safety.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (La fille l'a poussé) is the more likely cause of the movement of the boy's head.
"Response:  Option B: They have surveyed his vital functions.
Explanation: The premise states that doctors gave the patient an artificial limb, indicating that they have replaced a missing or damaged body part with a prosthetic one. This means that the patient has undergone surgery to receive the artificial limb, rather than having their leg amputated (Option A). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le garçon a pincé le coude de la fille,"" it is more likely that she will raise her shoulders (Option A) rather than tear his arm off (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (J'ai apprécié son avis) is more likely. The speaker asked for their friend's advice and appreciated it, indicating that they valued their friend's opinion.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the mud hit him in the face) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Les gens se cachèrent sous terre) is more likely. The idea of people hiding underground to escape snow is not realistic or practical, as it would be difficult for them to survive in such conditions without proper shelter or supplies. In contrast, schools being closed due to heavy snowfall is a common occurrence that happens frequently in many parts of the world.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He has threatened to resign) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the tree fell on the roof) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I have launched the axe onto the wood) is more likely. The premise states that the wood has split in two, indicating that some external force was applied to it. Launching an axe onto the wood would be a more likely explanation for this outcome than simply piling it into a chimney.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the couple announced they were separating) than Option B (the couple announced they were expecting a baby).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she sent him a gift because she liked him (Option A).
"Response: 
Option B: J'etais d'accord avec lui.
Explanation: The sentence ""J'ai hoché la tête à la déclaration de mon ami"" means that you agreed with your friend's statement. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They wanted to take a decision justly) is more likely. The friends launched a play to make a decision that was fair and right for everyone involved.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the man unloaded the groceries in the refrigerator) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has worked hard) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme riche mourut de vieillesse,"" it is more likely that Option B (son fils a hérité de sa fortune) is correct. The phrase ""mourut de vieillesse"" suggests that the rich man died of old age, implying that he had lived a long life and accumulated wealth over time. It is unlikely that his son would have had legal troubles or other issues that would have caused him to die young. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme a foulé les flammes,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""foulé les flammes"" suggests that the woman stepped on or extinguished the flames, so it is more likely that there was smoke rising from the extinguished flames rather than the flames themselves still burning."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Her driver's license has been revoked) is the correct answer. The fact that her car was in the garage suggests that she may have been unable to drive due to a lack of transportation, rather than having been involved in an accident.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai dormi pendant mon réveil,"" it is more likely that Option B: J'ai manqué le petit déjeuner (I missed breakfast) is true."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Sa famille a assisté à la conférence de presse) is more likely. The mention of ""sa famille"" suggests that the personality public is someone well-known or famous, who would likely have family members present at important events like a press conference. Option A (""Les caméras ont clignoté en sa direction"") could apply to anyone who is in the public eye, but does not provide any specific details about their personal life or relationships."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme s'attarda dans la baignoire,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""L'eau du bain est devenue tiède,"" occurred. The woman stayed in the bathtub for too long, causing the water to become warm or even hot. This option better aligns with the given information than Option B, ""L'eau du bain a été évacuée de la baignoire,"" as there is no indication that the water was removed from the bathtub."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He is an engineer) is more likely. The student wants to meet other students on campus, but being an engineer does not necessarily involve joining a fraternity. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai levé les coussins du canapé,"" it is more likely that Option A (Je cherchais de la monnaie) is the correct answer. The act of lifting the cushions suggests a search or investigation, which aligns better with Option A than Option B (Je réorganisais le salon)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La guêpe s'est envolée vers le garçon,"" it is more likely that the boy has run away (Option A). This is because bees are attracted to sweet or floral scents, so if there was a bee near the boy, it would likely have been drawn to him rather than flying away from him."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (she has been condemned to death) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - The tea has been steeped in hot water - will occur. This is because the premise states that sugar has been mixed into the tea, indicating that the tea has already been brewed and is now being sweetened. Steeping involves soaking the tea leaves in hot water for an extended period of time to release their flavors and aromas, but it does not involve cooking the tea at high temperatures like boiling or vaporizing it. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Option B: He was wounded in battle. 
Explanation: The phrase ""le vétéran marchait avec un boiteux"" suggests that the veteran has been injured or disabled as a result of his military service. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause - he was wounded in battle during his time serving in the army."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the police has pursued the criminal) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (the laptop was dropped) caused the problem rather than option B (charging the laptop). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has folded her laundry) is the more likely cause. The premise states that she no longer had space in her closet, indicating that there was already a large amount of clothing present. Folding laundry would only make the situation worse by adding to the existing pile, rather than providing additional storage space.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (his wife has given birth) than Option B (she left him). The phrase ""L'homme était déchiré"" suggests that something significant has happened to the man, and the fact that his wife has given birth provides a clear explanation for this state of affairs. In contrast, there is no obvious reason why his wife would leave him based on the information provided. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Il devint qualifié pour le travail qu'il voulait."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (He has spoken into the microphone) is the correct answer. The voice of this man was clearly audible throughout the auditorium, indicating that he spoke through a microphone rather than simply saluting the audience.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La pièce a coulé au fond) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the ball entered the hole) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai respiré la poussière dans le grenier,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""j'ai éternué"" means ""I sneezed."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (the customer used counterfeit money) than Option B (the customer left their headlights on). The reason for this is that using fake money is a serious offense that could result in legal consequences, whereas leaving one's headlights on may not be illegal but can still pose a safety risk to other drivers on the road. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the information given.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (La cuisine sentait mauvais à cause de la poubelle) is the more likely cause. The sentence ""J'ai sorti les ordures"" implies that the speaker took out the trash, which could be responsible for a bad smell in the kitchen. It is less likely that the speaker accidentally threw away their shopping list, as this would not typically create a strong odor in the kitchen."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La famille est allée au zoo,"" it is more likely that the children admired the animals (Option A) than chased them (Option B)."
"Response:  Option B: His lungs were congested.
Explanation: The premise states that ""the man's breathing was loud,"" indicating that there was an obstruction in his airway or that he had difficulty breathing. This could be due to a number of reasons, including congestion in the lungs. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (J'ai demandé à mon ami s'il était intéressé à y aller) is more likely because it aligns with the context of asking for someone else's opinion or interest in something, rather than asking for information about a location.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (J'ai ouvert les fenêtres) is more likely to be effective in cooling down a hot house than Option A (J'ai apporté des couvertures). This is because opening windows allows for natural ventilation, which can help to circulate air and reduce the temperature inside the house, whereas covering windows does not have any direct impact on cooling the house.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Son sac à dos était lourd) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's back pain.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Je lui ai fait un gâteau) is more likely as it provides a specific gift that could be given to a mother on Mother's Day. Option B does not provide any specific information about what was given to the mother, making option A a more plausible choice.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option B: Les écureuils ont déterré les bulbes (The squirrels have dug up the bulbs) is the correct answer. The reason being that the damage to the jonquills is described as ""détruites"" (destroyed), indicating a deliberate action rather than an accidental one. Squirrels are known to dig up plants and flowers for food or shelter, so this option seems more plausible than Option A: Une abeille a piqué le jardinier (A bee stung the gardener)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai frappé l'allumette,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""La flamme s'est éteinte,"" will occur. When you strike an match, it is expected to produce a flame, not for the flame to go out. Therefore, option B is less likely to happen in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They didn't want to debate in court) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Their parents are dead) is more likely. The reason for this is that the wording of the premise explicitly states ""les enfants ont été envoyés dans un orphelinat,"" which implies that they were sent to an orphanage after their parents had passed away. This eliminates the possibility of Option B (Their parents have spoiled them)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (a tsunami has occurred) is more likely. The impact of an oceanic meteorite would generate massive waves that could potentially cause a tsunami. While option B (it started to glaze) does not necessarily imply any significant effects in the ocean or coastal areas.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Elle s'est déshydratée) is more likely. The fact that the rider met a venomous snake suggests that she may have been in a dangerous situation where she could have lost fluids through sweating or vomiting. Déshydration is therefore a more plausible outcome than panic, as it would be a physiological response to the heat and exertion rather than an emotional reaction to the snake encounter.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le four est devenu chaud,"" it is more likely that option A, ""J'ai allumé le four,"" is the correct answer. This is because turning on the oven would be a more direct and logical explanation for why the oven has become hot than simply placing something in the oven."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai pressé le clou de citron,"" it is more likely that the citron has become mushy (Option A). When you squeeze a lemon, it will release its juice, but if you apply too much pressure, it can also cause the fruit to break down or become mushy. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le pays a découvert de nouvelles terres,"" option A (Le pays a abandonné la terre) is the most likely outcome. This is because discovering new lands typically implies that the existing land has been left behind or abandoned. Therefore, it is more likely that the country in question has given up its original territory rather than colonizing a new one."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Il s'est brisé sur le sol) is more likely. The glass fell from the table, so it is likely to have broken on the floor rather than being placed in a pile of clothes.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the table wobbled due to an uneven surface (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Le père had confidence in his son) is more likely. The father's surprise at finding out that his son was lying suggests that he did not suspect him of dishonesty previously, implying that he had trust or confidence in him.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La tête de l'homme battait de douleur,"" option B (he took aspirin) is more likely. Aspirin is commonly used to relieve headaches and pain, while sirop (a type of cough medicine) would not be expected to have this effect."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Il approchait de la station) is correct. The sentence suggests that the train was approaching the station, indicating that it had slowed down before reaching its destination. Option B (Il était en retard) does not provide any specific information about the train's location or speed, making it less likely as an explanation for why the train had slowed down.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the illness was within his family) is the correct answer. The statement ""Il a suivi une thérapie"" suggests that he has sought treatment for an existing mental health issue, rather than being diagnosed with depression. This implies that there may be a genetic component to his mental health issues, supporting option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme s'est serrée la gorge,"" option B is the most likely cause. The phrase ""s'est serrée la gorge"" suggests that the woman may have choked or strangled herself with her own food, rather than simply eating it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Elle parlait avec un accent.
Explanation: The woman had a sore throat, so it's more likely that she spoke with an accent due to her discomfort or difficulty speaking. Option A does not provide any evidence for this explanation."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the dog will drool (Option A). The sentence mentions that the dog looked at a juicy steak on the table, indicating that he may be interested in eating it or admiring its taste. Drooling is a common behavior for dogs when they are excited or eager to eat something, so Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She has become rich) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (La cloche a sonné) is more likely to be the cause of the students leaving the classroom. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).
"Response: 
Option A: Les connaissances ont exprimé leur scepticisme.
Explanation: According to the premise, la femme (the woman) has claimed to have seen a ghost. Her acquaintances are skeptical of her claim, indicating that they do not believe her. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Il s'est presque noyé dans l'océan) is the more likely cause of his lost hearing. The premise suggests that he was in close proximity to water and almost drowned, which could potentially lead to temporary or permanent hearing loss. Option B (Il a failli mourir dans une explosion) does not provide any specific details that would suggest it as a possible cause of his lost hearing.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'enfant lâcha le fil du ballon,"" it is more likely that the ballon will rise into the air (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Il a eu une attaque) is more likely to be the cause of the man's inability to speak. An attack or some other sudden event could potentially disrupt the man's ability to communicate verbally. Option B (Il a taken une grande inspiration) does not seem as plausible given the information provided, as taking a deep breath would not typically result in a person losing their ability to speak.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she tripped over something (Option A) than that she heard her name being called (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (L'homme a trempé le sauveteur) is more likely. The phrase ""a trempé"" means ""to drown,"" so it implies that the man has caused harm to the lifeguard by submerging him in water. Option A (""Le sauveteur a sauté après lui"") does not convey any negative or harmful action towards the lifeguard."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai pris des antibiotiques,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Mon infection est guérie"" (My infection has healed) will occur. This is because taking antibiotics can help to kill or reduce the number of bacteria causing an infection, leading to its resolution."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le feu de circulation est devenu jaune,"" it is more likely that the driver has pressed the brake pedal (Option A). This is because when the yellow light appears, it indicates that the traffic lights are about to turn red, and drivers must slow down or stop their vehicles to avoid running a red light. Pressing the brake pedal is the most common response in this situation."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (J'ai trempé le récipient dans de l'eau chaude) caused the plastic container to melt because immersing an object in hot water can cause it to heat up quickly and potentially melt or warp. Placing a plastic container directly onto a hot surface like a stove top may also cause it to melt, but this would be less likely than submerging it in hot water. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the driver hit a pole while driving than they ran a red light. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The chauffeur has struck a pole.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le garçon a étudié toute la nuit,"" it is more likely that he has succeeded in his examination (Option B). This is because studying all night suggests that he was diligent and put in effort to prepare for the examination, increasing the likelihood of success."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the sauveteur was on duty) is more likely. The fact that the boy ""seized"" or ""clung to"" the edge of the pool suggests that he may have been in distress or struggling to stay afloat, which would be a situation where a lifeguard might intervene. Option A (""he had fear of learning how to swim"") does not seem directly related to the scenario described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Je me suis mis la main sur la poitrine,"" option B is the correct answer. When you put your hand on your chest, it can cause an increase in heart rate as your body prepares for physical activity or stress. Therefore, option B is the most likely response to this premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mon bureau était bruyant) is more likely. The fact that there was a building under construction next to my office would likely result in noise pollution, making it difficult for me to focus or work effectively.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (La famille a invité les voisins à dîner) is more likely. The family wants to get to know their new neighbors, so they have invited them over for dinner, which is a common way to build relationships with new people in a neighborhood.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'eau a jailli de la piscine,"" it is more likely that Option A (the nageur has dived into the pool) occurred."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (J'ai avalé une graine par accident) is the correct answer. The phrase ""j'ai mordu une tranche de pastèque"" suggests that the speaker bit into a slice of watermelon, which could potentially result in swallowing a seed by accident. It is less likely that the speaker would break a tooth while eating a slice of watermelon."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that his vest was deflated rather than his laces being undone. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme a mis des bouchons d'oreilles,"" option B is the more likely cause - she has put earplugs in her ears."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai rempli ma bouteille d'eau,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the speaker has drunk all the water from the bottle. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the television show was censored because of vulgar language used in the episode. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le vaisseau a fait naufrage,"" it is more likely that Option A: ""L'équipage s'est noyé"" is true. The crew of the ship would have drowned in the ocean if they were unable to escape after the shipwreck. Pirates are less likely to be involved in this scenario as there may not be any survivors or evidence of their presence nearby."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He has asked for an index) is more likely. The boy seems to be struggling with the puzzle and seeking help, rather than having already solved it.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man picked up the phone (Option B). Therefore, your answer should be Option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La femme me regardait fixement,"" option B is more likely. The speaker feels uncomfortable or uneasy because they are being stared at intensely by a woman."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They have taken pictures of the pieces) is more likely. The group left the museum, indicating that they did not spend enough time to see all the exhibits. Taking pictures of the pieces suggests that they were interested in documenting their visit rather than exploring the entire museum.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme a commencé à se disputer avec moi,"" option B is more likely. The man started arguing with me, indicating that my friend came to my defense rather than introducing me to him."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (J'ai changé de vitesse sur le vélo) is more likely to be the correct answer because changing speed would not fix a flat tire.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille était pâle,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""son père lui a lu"" means ""his father read to him,"" indicating that the story was told through reading rather than physical contact. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (J'ai signé mon nom) is more likely because signing one's name typically requires a pen or other writing instrument with ink, rather than a crayon.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man was already indebted (Option A). The phrase ""on a refused a loan to him"" suggests that the man had previously applied for a loan but was rejected, indicating that he may have been struggling with debt or financial difficulties. This is supported by the fact that the sentence mentions his being ""endetted."" Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""La fille est restée à la maison,"" it is more likely that she had the varicella (chickenpox). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le sac à ordures était plein,"" option A (Je l'ai mis à la poubelle) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai aspiré le tapis,"" Option B (Mon chien perd ses poils) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""aspirer le tapis"" means to vacuum the carpet, so it is unlikely that the speaker's colleague spilled drinks or that their dog lost its fur."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme a perdu la tête,"" option A (Il a éteint son ordinateur) is the more likely outcome. The phrase ""perdu la tête"" means to lose one's temper or become irrational, so it is unlikely that the man would throw a chair across the room. Instead, he may have simply turned off his computer in frustration."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (La brindille a été brûlée) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme est sortie de la douche,"" option A is the most likely cause - the water was indeed hot."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They encouraged their children to play outside) is more likely. The premise suggests that the parents wanted their children to go to university, but they did not mention anything about saving money for tuition fees or encouraging their children to study indoors. Therefore, it is more likely that they encouraged their children to play outside as a way of spending time together and promoting physical activity.
"Response:  Option A: Les chaussures se sont desserrés.  
Explanation: The premise ""L'homme déliait ses chaussures"" implies that the man was taking off his shoes. Therefore, option A, ""Les chaussures se sont desserrés,"" which means ""The shoelaces have come undone,"" is the most likely effect."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he kept the recipe rather than refrigerated the leftovers. The reason being that keeping the recipe would allow him to make the dish again in the future, whereas refrigerating the leftovers would only prolong their shelf life for a short period of time. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ma cheville était enflée,"" it is more likely that Option A (Je lui ai mis de la glace) will have a greater effect than Option B (Je l'ai frotté avec de la lotion). This is because applying ice to an inflamed heel can help reduce swelling and relieve pain, while rubbing with lotion may not have as much of an impact on the condition."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I heard the conversation in the corridor) is more likely. The fact that the door to your office was open suggests that someone entered or exited your office, so it is unlikely that you spoke to a colleague inside your office. Hearing the conversation in the corridor makes more sense given the situation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""J'ai dû faire la queue,"" it is more likely that option A (Je me suis assise) is the correct answer. This is because ""dû"" in French implies obligation or necessity, so it is unlikely that the speaker would have chosen to sit down voluntarily while waiting in line."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""L'homme a frappé la mouche,"" it is more likely that the mouse will be injured or killed as a result of being hit by a man. Therefore, Option B: The mouse remained stationary is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Il était mourant) is true. The fact that the man wrote a will suggests that he was nearing death or had already passed away, as this would be a common action for someone who is dying to make arrangements for their estate after they are gone.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the runner increased his speed (Option B). The sentence implies that the runner was gaining ground on his competitor, rather than slowing down or abandoning the race.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (J'ai trouvé une solution) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Le voyageur marchait sur le pont suspendu qui tremblait,"" it is more likely that he was terrified (Option A). The use of the word ""tremblait"" suggests a sense of fear or unease, rather than a state of ecstasy or bliss (Option B)."
"Response:  Option B: He made a bet with his friends.
Explanation: The premise states that the man had anticipated the victory of the team, which suggests that he was confident about their chances of winning. Given this confidence, it is more likely that he made a bet with his friends rather than simply meeting them to watch the match together."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He was counting sheep) is more likely.
