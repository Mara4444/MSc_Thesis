"Response: 

This is a classic example of a causal inference problem. Based on the premise ""The raccoon ransacked the garbage can,"" we need to determine which option is more likely to be the cause of the event.

Option A suggests that there was cardboard in the garbage can, which could have attracted the raccoon and led it to ransack the can. However, this does not necessarily mean that the presence of cardboard caused the raccoon to ransack the can.

Option B suggests that the lid was off the garbage can, which could have made it easier for the raccoon to access the contents of the can and ransack it. This option implies a direct causal relationship between the open lid and the raccoon's actions.

Based on the information provided, Option B seems more plausible as the cause of the event. The open lid may have given the raccoon an opportunity to enter the can and rummage through its contents. Therefore, the answer is (B) The lid was off the garbage can."

A) Pacifists staged a protest. 

Pretpostavka: Civilian deaths from the war surged.

Explanation: Protests and parades are both forms of public demonstrations that can draw attention to an issue. However, a protest is more likely to be effective in drawing attention to civilian deaths caused by a war than a parade. A protest typically involves a group of people gathering together to express their views or demand action on a particular issue, while a parade is a celebratory event that may not necessarily address any specific issues. Therefore, option A (pacifists staged a protest) is more likely to be the correct answer."
