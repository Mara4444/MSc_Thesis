"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ta stvar je bila u ambalaži od plastične folije,"" option A is more likely. The word ""krhki"" in Croatian means fragile or delicate, so it is likely that the thing was fragile and broke easily when it was in a package made of plastic film."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ispraznio sam džepove,"" Option A (Pronašao sam ulaznicu) is more likely. The word ""ispraznio"" means ""emptied"", so it's likely that the speaker found the entrance to the building they were looking for rather than a weapon."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that termites have destroyed the wood in the house (Option B).
"Response: 
Option B: Patrolni agent ih je optužio za krijumčarenje. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Putnici su stigli do granice,"" it is more likely that the patrol agent will accuse them of smuggling rather than checking their passports. Smuggling is a criminal offense that involves transporting goods or people illegally, and it is a common issue at borders. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Bio was a holiday) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Ured je bio zatvoren"" implies that something was closed or shut down, which could be due to a public holiday or other reason. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (She played chess) caused her to lose energy than Option B (She jumped into a canal). Playing chess can be mentally demanding and require focus and concentration, which could potentially lead to feelings of exhaustion or fatigue if played for an extended period of time. Jumping into a canal, on the other hand, would not typically result in such physical exertion or mental strain. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause of her lost energy.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (more people have entered the queue) is a more likely cause for the woman's loss of place in line.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Djevojka je uštamcala nos."", option A is more likely. The word ""ustamac"" means to cry or wail, so it's more likely that the girl cried than that she spat or rubbed her nose with something."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Publika je pljeskala uz glazbu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The girl brought her teacher a bouquet of flowers as a thank-you gift, not stayed after school for punishment.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that they were scared by a storyteller (Option A). The sentence ""Mladi kamperi su se uplašili"" implies that the young campers were frightened or intimidated by something, and the suggestion that their counselor told them a ghost story fits with this interpretation. There is no mention of slatkiše (a type of sweet pastry) being involved in the situation, so Option B is not supported by the given information."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he has suffered a head injury (Option B). The phrase ""udario glavu"" implies a sudden impact or trauma to the head, which could result in a concussion or other forms of brain damage. This would cause confusion and disorientation, making it difficult for him to find his way back home. In contrast, feeling lost in thought (Option A) does not necessarily involve any physical harm or injury to the brain."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Moj bankovni račun je bio prazan) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The author states that their check was not cashed, indicating that there may have been insufficient funds in their account to cover the check. This is supported by the fact that they mention that their bank account was empty. Therefore, it is more likely that the issue was caused by a lack of funds in their account rather than receiving a pay raise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Poslao je masovnu e-poštu) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the man sent a large number of emails, indicating that he may have been involved in mass emailing or spamming. Option A (Obriše spam) does not provide any information about the scale of his actions, so it cannot be inferred whether he deleted only a small amount of spam or a significant portion of it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mornar je bio u karanteni,"" it is more likely that he was exposed to a disease (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zaboravila je zapisati) is more likely. The girl forgot to write down the password, rather than recalling it from memory.
Response:  Option A - Voda mi je ugasilažeđ.
"Response: 
Option A: Htio je ponuditi prijatelju podršku."
Response:  Option A - Osjećao sam se krivim.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the tire was punctured (Option B). The phrase ""lanac se raspao"" suggests that the tire has been damaged, and the word ""raspao"" specifically implies a puncture or tear in the tire's rubber. Therefore, Option B is the most likely explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Umorili su se od svađe) is more likely. The passage states that the couple ""odlučio napraviti kompromis,"" indicating that they made an effort to resolve their disagreement. This suggests that they were motivated to find a solution rather than simply avoiding discussing the issue or giving up in frustration. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause of their ability to compromise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Unajmila je menadžera kampanje) is more likely. 
"Response: 
Option B: Putovao je s velikim koferom. 
Explanation: Given that the man expected cold weather during his trip, it is more likely that he packed warm clothing in a large suitcase rather than putting on too much warm clothing in a small bag."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Podigao je ruku) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Oči su mu se isplačile"", option A is more likely. The word ""isplatilo"" in Croatian means to get something stuck or into something, so it's more likely that something got into his eyes rather than him putting on glasses."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Njen protivnik ju je optužio za varanje) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Uhvatio je studenta kako vara) is more likely as the reason for the teacher's anger towards the student. The premise suggests that the teacher has caught the student cheating, which is a serious offense in academic settings. Option B (Odgovori studenta su bili pogrešni) does not align with the context provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pauza da prestanem pričati,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""izgubio sam glas"" means ""lost my voice."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Stavio sam ga u mikrovalnu) caused the frozen food to thaw. This is because microwaves are a common method of reheating or cooking food, and they can quickly heat up small portions of food. On the other hand, wrapping food in plastic wrap may not be effective at keeping it fresh for an extended period of time, especially if it is exposed to warm temperatures. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the frozen food thawing.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (imao je grčeva u trbuhu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""zaposlenik se pretvarao da je bolestan"" suggests that he was trying to fake being sick, which would not be a valid reason for taking a day off work without proper authorization. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the employee might have been acting as if he were sick."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Skočla je s litice za ronjenje) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for how the girl fell into the pool. The other option (Trčala je po palubi za bazen) does not provide a logical reason for why the girl would fall into the pool. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: Film je dobio loše kritike.  
Explanation: The sentence ""Ulaznice za film su rasprodane"" suggests that the movie has been well-received by audiences, as tickets have been sold out. On the other hand, ""Film je dobio loše kritike"" means that the movie has received negative reviews, which would explain why it has not performed well at the box office. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ljudi su ga izolirali) is more likely. The premise states that ""čovjek"" has lost weight, implying that he or she may have become less sociable or isolated as a result of this change. Therefore, option A, which suggests that people have isolated him, is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Djevojčice su ruke postale plikovi,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""popela se po užet"" means ""she climbed up a rope."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pubika is excitedly clapping) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izgubio sam strpljenje,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker has lost patience, which implies that they were waiting for someone or something but grew impatient while doing so. Therefore, option A is a better fit than option B, as it aligns with the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (they have developed nuclear weapons) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Ratne zemlje su željele mir,"" indicating a desire for peace, but also mentions that they have developed nuclear weapons. This suggests that their pursuit of peace may involve using military force as a last resort, rather than through diplomatic means alone. Therefore, it is more likely that option A is correct."
"Response: 
Option B: Imao je groznicu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the man took sleeping pills, which means he should have experienced drowsiness or sedation (groznica). Option A, ""Postao se pospan,"" does not align with this premise as it implies that the man became sleepy instead of experiencing groznica."
"Response:  Option B - Povrijedila je koljeno.  
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the woman hit her knee than for her feet to separate from the sofa. The word ""kauč"" in Croatian can refer to a kneecap or patella, which is located at the joint of the knee. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dječak je stisnuo balon"", it is more likely that the balloon will burst (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Raspakirali su svoje kofere) is more likely to happen because it aligns with the context of a group of travelers checking into a hotel after a long journey. It makes sense that they would want to unpack their luggage before entering their room. Option B (Otišli su na aerodrom) does not fit as well in this scenario since an airport is not typically associated with hotels or check-in procedures.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ugrizao sam breskvu"", option A is more likely. The word ""ugrizao"" means ""I ate"" in English, so it's likely that the speaker is referring to eating bread. Therefore, option A is correct: ""breskva je modrica""."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ruke su mi se zalijepile,"" Option A (Pojela sam krafnu) is the most likely cause. The word ""ruke"" means ""hands"" in Croatian, so it's possible that someone may have touched or held something while they were sleeping, leading to a vivid dream."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gurao sam vrata"", option A is more likely. The word ""gurao"" means to open or unlock, so it is more likely that the doors are open rather than closed."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Proizvodi su testirani na osiguravanje kvalitete) is more likely. The passage states that ""aktivisti su bojkotirali proizvode,"" indicating that there was a boycott of the products, which suggests that there were concerns about their quality or safety. Testing the products to ensure quality would be a common response to such concerns. Option B (Proizvodi su proizvedeni dječjim radom), on the other hand, does not align with this context as it implies that children are producing the products, which is unlikely in most cases."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izbušio sam rupu u zidu,"" option A is more likely. The word ""izbušio"" means to make a hole in something, so it's likely that the mouse made a hole in the wall rather than the dust or dirt making a hole."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Njena sestra se razvela) is more likely. The premise states that the woman has deceived her sister, indicating a negative relationship between them. Therefore, it is more likely that their relationship has deteriorated to the point of separation rather than remaining happy.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Prolio sam vino na košulju,"" option A (Stavio sam si pregaču) is more likely. The word ""pregaču"" means to spill or splash something, so it suggests that the speaker accidentally knocked over their wine while putting it in their coat pocket. Option B (Promijenio sam košulju) does not fit with this context as it means to change one's clothes, which has nothing to do with spilling wine."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kupac je pretražio novčanik) is more likely as it suggests that the customer searched for the wallet in a systematic manner, indicating a higher likelihood of finding it. Option B (Kasijer joj dao novac) does not provide any information about how or why the wallet was found.
"Response:  Option B: On je otjerao gomilu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, a large crowd of people has gathered around the street performer, indicating that they are interested in his performance. However, the word ""otjerao"" suggests that the performer took action to remove or chase away the crowd, rather than simply allowing them to gather around him. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for what happened based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option A: Nedostajali su mu roditelji.  
Explanation: The premise states that the boy was crying to his mother, indicating a close emotional bond between them. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the boy missed his parents, is the more likely cause of his tears."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Lists have become discolored) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Odlučio je da se šali sa svojom sestrom. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Dečko je bio u zlobном raspoloženju,"" it is more likely that he will try to make his sister laugh rather than play cards with her. People in a bad mood are often looking for ways to distract themselves or lift their spirits, and making someone else laugh can be an effective way to do so."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Otac mu je dao sok) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the fish swam towards the food (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ona je sudjelovala u prosvjedu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The text states that the toilet was clogged, indicating that water may have backed up into the sink. Therefore, it is more likely that the person tried to unclog the sink by pouring hot water down the drain, resulting in a messy situation. Option A is unlikely as there is no indication of the person opening a valve or sluice gate.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Putnici su sišli iz vlaka"", option A (Vlak je stigao na stanicu) is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option B: Zatvorio je kovertu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Čovjek je pritisnuo na vlažnu ploču koverte,"" it is more likely that he closed the umbrella rather than placing a stamp on it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Uživali su u međusobном društvu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she was otpüşena from her position as accountant. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I heard the clock striking) is a more likely cause than option B (I wanted to check the time). The sentence ""čuo sam kako sat otkucava"" means ""I heard the clock striking"", indicating that the speaker heard the sound of the clock rather than wanting to check the time. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Moja žena i ja smo se držali za ruke) is the more likely cause for why my right hand has gotten better at writing Greek letters. This suggests that the improvement in writing ability may be due to practice or training with someone else's help rather than solely through self-teaching as suggested by option A (Napisao sam esej ručno).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Šraf se zategnuo,"" option A (Zamijenio sam vijak) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Par se uselio u stan"". This means that Par signed a rental agreement for an apartment."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (HTJELA SHE DA GLEDAT ZALAZAK SUNCA) is more likely. The woman sat outside to watch the sunset, not to see a lightning storm.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nije znao plivati) is more likely to be the cause of the man's rescue from drowning. The premise states that the man was carrying a life jacket, indicating that he may not have known how to swim or may not have been comfortable in the water without proper flotation devices. Therefore, it is more likely that he did not know how to swim than that the water was shallow enough for him to stand in without difficulty.
"Response: 
Option B: She pressed the backspace key."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ima lošu ocjenu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The text states that the girl was proud of her friends, indicating a positive outcome, but also mentions that she had a bad grade, which suggests a negative consequence for her. Therefore, Option A is more likely to be true.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trak je bio blato"", option A (Kiša je padala preko noći) is a more likely cause for why the track was wet. It rains at night, so it's more probable that the track was wet due to rain than because of many carts passing by."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Prespavala je u hotelu) is more likely. The fact that she was sleeping suggests that it could have been due to a variety of reasons such as fatigue or a comfortable environment, but specifically being in a hotel implies that there may be other factors at play such as noise from outside or an unfamiliar bedroom. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the woman was snoring.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sjedila je u sjeni) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the person would be in the shade. Option B (Otišao je na plažu) does not provide any information about why the person went to the beach.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the researchers have withdrawn their theory (Option A). The passage states that ""the researchers have been unable to replicate"" their findings, indicating that they have not been able to confirm or verify their original results through further experiments or observations. This suggests that they may have re-evaluated their initial hypothesis and decided to withdraw or retract their theory. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Igra je krenula u produžetak) is more likely as it suggests that the game went into overtime due to a tie score at the end of regular time, rather than a referee mistake leading to an incorrect outcome.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Zatvorio sam brava) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the logical flow of events described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Grupa se pojačala"", option A is more likely. The word ""pojačala"" suggests that something has become stronger or more intense, so it's more likely that the father gave his son some money rather than physically grabbing him."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Skupio sam snijeg u snježnu kuglu) is more likely. The sentence ""Snijeg je blokirao prilaz"" implies that there is a blockage or obstruction caused by snow, making it difficult to approach. It's unlikely that you would be able to remove the snow yourself, so option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kajakeri su veslali vesla,"" option A is more likely. The word ""vesla"" means to row in Croatian, so it's unlikely that a kayak would have reached the shore without someone paddling it there. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Udarila se u ogradu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl lost control of her bike. Option B states that she hit a fence, which is a possible consequence of losing control of a bike. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Osjetio sam kako hladni zrak prolazi preko mene) is more likely to occur. The sentence ""Voda posuta po mojoj koži"" means ""Water is dripping onto my skin,"" which suggests that there is liquid present, but it does not convey a sense of coldness or chilliness. Therefore, option B is the better match for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They were wet) is more likely. The premise states that they returned to the beach, implying that they had been away from the beach for some time, and therefore would have gotten wet while at sea. Option B (They saw a shark) does not align with this reasoning as it implies that they were already near the shore when they saw the shark, which contradicts the idea of them having been away from the beach for some time.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Voda je ispuštena iz kade) is more likely to occur than option B (Voda je prskala po podu). This is because the premise mentions that water was removed from the tank, indicating that option A is more plausible.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will opt to accuse her of infidelity (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Čekao sam da se tinte osuše) is more likely to be the correct answer because it better fits the context of the situation described in the premise. The phrase ""čekao sam"" implies that the speaker has been waiting for something to happen, which aligns with the idea of tinta na plakatu being wet and needing time to dry. In contrast, option B (""Prolio sam vodo na poster"") does not make sense in this context as there is no reason why the speaker would spray water onto a poster. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dijete se probudilo vrišteći,"" option A is the most likely cause - it had a nightmare.  "
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegov otac sjedio za stolom) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Vikao sam njegovo ime) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Moj prijatelj okrenuo je glavu u mom smjeru"" implies that someone turned their head in the direction of the speaker, which could be interpreted as a physical action. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the speaker vikied their friend's name, is more plausible than option B, which suggests that the speaker waved their hands."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Građani su se pobunili) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he set up a tent (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Htjela je naučiti o drugim kulturama) is more likely. The woman traveled abroad to learn about other cultures, which suggests that she was interested in broadening her knowledge of the world beyond her own culture. This aligns with the idea of cultural curiosity and exploration, rather than a specific skill or activity like drawing.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his colleague got a promotion) is more likely to be the cause of his jealousy.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (he had hallucinations) is the correct answer. The phrase ""čovjek je vidio vanzemaljce"" implies that the man saw an alien, which could be a result of hallucination or other mental health issue rather than meditation."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Stavio je izbjeljivač u nju) is more likely as it implies that something has been put into the water to change its color, whereas Option B (Stavio je šampon u nju) does not make sense in this context.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Osjetila je udar inspiracije) is more likely. The artist created a new work because she felt inspired, rather than criticizing her previous work or experiencing an epiphany.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (On je otpušten iz vojske) is more likely as the reason for Sin's departure from home. The premise states that Sin ""odselio"" (left) his home, which implies a sudden or unexpected departure. Being fired or laid off from work can be a significant life change and may lead to someone leaving their home without much notice. In contrast, going to college typically involves making plans and preparations in advance, which may not align with the sudden nature implied in the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of Sin's departure from home."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Raftovi su bili prekriveni prašinom) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the books were covered in dust. The other option, option B (Zemljotres je potresao knjižaru), does not provide any logical explanation for how the books came to be covered in dust. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Upalila sam svjetlo) is more likely to cause the loss of power in the house. When a light bulb blows or fuse is tripped, it can cause a complete loss of electricity in the house. On the other hand, resetting the circuit breaker may only temporarily restore power until another issue arises. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vozili smo se uz daljinu,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""izgledala je zastrašujuće"" means ""it looked frightening."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (There has been a power outage in the neighborhood) is more likely. The statement ""Drvo je palo na strujnu vod"" implies that there was a tree fall on the power line, causing a power outage in the surrounding area. This is a more plausible explanation for why there would be no electricity than the prediction of strong winds. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Govornik has offended or upset the audience with his political incorrect comments rather than simply boring them. Therefore, option B (he has offended the public) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Znoj mi je kapljao s lica) is more likely to be true. The sentence suggests that something has been dripping or flowing onto Igor's face, which could indicate a liquid substance such as blood or water. Option B (Na mom prstu je pala kap krvi) does not provide any context for what might have caused the drops of blood to fall onto Igor's hand.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he drowned (Option B). The fact that his body was found at the bottom of the reservoir suggests that he may have fallen into the water accidentally or intentionally and then drowned.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muškarac je bio hrom."", Option A is the most likely cause - he had a fever."

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Lagao je roditeljima) is more likely as it implies that the child has run away from home, which could be a result of parental conflict or other issues at home. The fact that he ""iskrao"" himself suggests that he may have been feeling unsafe or uncomfortable in his own home, leading him to seek refuge elsewhere."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the WC was flooded) than Option B (-the water heater is broken). The fact that the toilet is flooded suggests that there may be a problem with the plumbing system or an overflow issue, rather than a problem with the water heater itself. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause of the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vlasnik je stavio ogrlicu na štene) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that something has been placed near or around the owner's neck, rather than being held by them directly. Therefore, it is more likely that an ogrlica was used to keep the owner close, rather than simply holding their hand.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Stayed beneath an enormous tree) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the man would not have seen his reflection in the water if he was standing above it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nazvao sam je natrag) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their pet dog has escaped from home (Option A).

Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vidio sam svoj dah kad sam izdahnuto,"" option A (It was cold) is a more likely cause of the symptoms described in the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Željeli su bolje radne uvjete) is more likely as it suggests that employees formed a union to demand better working conditions rather than their employer increasing their pay.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the smell of freshly baked bread (Option A) filled the kitchen than the warmth of the oven (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she wore high heels (Option A). The premise mentions ""hoda"" which is a Serbian word for ""walk"", so it's unlikely that she would have been able to walk comfortably in skinny shoes (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Voda je ključala) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""ključala"" in Croatian means ""to lock"". Therefore, it is more likely that the water locked the door rather than covering it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sve moje čarape su bile u praonici,"" it is more likely that option A (Nosila sam sandale) is correct. The use of the plural form ""čarape"" suggests that there were multiple pairs of shoes in question, which would be consistent with wearing sandals rather than boots or heavy footwear."
"Response: 
Option A: Izgubio je podršku birača."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Par je zadrudnilo) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Milioner je htio da se zgrada sruši) is more likely as it provides a clear motivation for why the millionaire would want the building to collapse.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The prodavač has accused the girl of stealing, indicating that he saw her taking something without permission. This suggests that the prodavač witnessed the girl putting an item in a bag, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the answer is (A) Prodavač je vidio djevojku kako stavlja robu u torbicu.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vojnici su bili poslani u borbu) is more likely. The fact that the country has declared war on its neighboring territory suggests that there will be a military conflict, rather than soldiers returning to their families.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Izbio je nered ispred sudnice) is more likely. The premise suggests that there was a disturbance in front of the judge, which could have caused chaos and disruption in the courtroom. This implies that option A is more plausible than option B (Par jedao zavjete ispred sudnice), as it is less likely for a person to give their word in front of a judge without any disturbances or interruptions.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Lift is no longer working. The reason for this is not specified in the premise, but given the context of an evacuation due to a fire alarm going off, it is possible that the lift has stopped functioning as a precautionary measure to prevent people from getting trapped inside the building during a fire emergency. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause.
"Response: 
Option B: Otac je izbacio sina iz kuće.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that Otac je bio ljut na sinovu alkoholizam, it is more likely that he would have thrown his son out of the house rather than buying him alcohol. This option better aligns with the emotions expressed in the premise."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sekretarica je otišla kući) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the premise that the lift was out of order or that any other obstacle prevented the secretary from reaching her destination. Therefore, it is most plausible that she simply went home after work.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Bila je paralizirana u nesreči) is more likely. The sentence implies that the woman was injured in an accident, which could result in paralysis.

The fact that citizens have raised their national flag in front of their homes suggests a celebratory atmosphere, indicating that the country has achieved independence.

Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why he failed the test than option B (Zaboravio je učiti), which implies that he simply forgot what he learned in class."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zemljotres je pogodio grad) is more likely as a cause for the building collapse in the center of town.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dijete je ostavalo mrvice na podu,"" option A is more likely. The reason being that ants are unlikely to be attracted to a pile of bread left on the floor, as they typically forage for food in their natural environment rather than scavenging from human sources.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Usne su mu bile raspršene) is more likely as it provides a physical explanation for why the man's face was distorted while he was talking to himself.

"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Okrenuo sam paljenje) is a more plausible explanation for why the car stopped working than option B (Motor se pregrijao). This is because ""sam paljenje"" means ""self-ignition,"" which suggests that the engine may have malfunctioned or caught fire, rather than overheating due to a mechanical issue with the motor itself. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option B: Ostao je u krevetu nekoliku dana. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the man was injured in his back, which can be a serious injury that requires rest and recovery time. It is therefore more likely that he will stay in bed for several days rather than going to see a psychiatrist."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nisam imao drva za vatru) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there was no fire in the stove.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she has pain in her back) is the correct answer.

Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kucao sam na susjedinu vrata,"" option A is more likely. The word ""susjeda"" in this context implies that the speaker is at their neighbor's doorstep, suggesting that they have been invited inside. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ženi su ponestalo jaja"" (Women have too many eggs), Option B is more likely.

Therefore, it is more likely that she went to the supermarket to buy eggs rather than going to a farm."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Otkrila sam mu tajnu) is more likely. The phrase ""otkrila sam mu tajnu"" suggests that the speaker has discovered a secret or hidden truth about their old friend, implying a sense of surprise or revelation. This aligns with the idea that the speaker may have uncovered something unexpected or surprising about their friend's past. Option B (Ja sam ga zagrilo), on the other hand, implies a more straightforward and less surprising explanation for the speaker's discovery, as it means ""I killed him."""
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Uhvatila je ribu) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman would not want to enter the lake. The other option does not provide any clear reason for her reluctance.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the student's bike was stolen than his umbrella broken. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Njegov bicikl je ukraden.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Korisnik je pomaknuo miš) is more likely as it directly states that the user moved the mouse. Option A (Korisnik je kliknuo mišem) does not specify how the user interacted with the computer. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Therefore, Option A better fits the context provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sunce je bilo sjajno) is more likely to be the cause of the woman putting on her sunglasses.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je gledao u noćno nebo,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""čovjek"" (man) suggests a personal perspective, and the verb ""gledao"" (looked) implies direct observation. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is expressing their own desire for warm weather rather than someone else's opinion of its beauty."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Otišao sam rano u krevet) is more likely. The fact that he felt exhausted suggests that he went to bed early, rather than staying up all night.
Response:  Option A - He left his hair to grow.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Želela sam čašu mlijeka,"" it is more likely that option A (Ja sam jeo kolače) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""čašu"" in Croatian means ""cup,"" so the speaker is indicating that they wanted a cup of milk, not bread or cake. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Počela je kiša,"" option A is more likely. When it starts raining, other drivers may slow down or stop to avoid hydroplaning, which could cause a car behind them to collide with their rear end. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the driver of the car in front of you suddenly stopped braking."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""parked over the path"" - is the correct answer. The reason for this is that if there was no parking space available near the entrance of the building, it would be more likely that someone would park their car over the path rather than closer to the entrance. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."

"Response:  Option B - Svi na fotografijama su se odbili nasmijati. 
Explanation: The premise states that the photographer forgot to use a flash on their camera. This means that the lighting in the photos will be poor, resulting in underexposed images with dark shadows. As a result, it's more likely that everyone in the photos will appear unsmiling or unhappy due to the harsh lighting conditions. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I was alone) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Osjećao sam se energično) is the correct answer. The use of the verb ""osjećao"" (felt) suggests a personal experience or feeling, rather than an external event such as being uplašen (nervous). Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker may have been practicing alone."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she drank water (Option A). The sentence ""Stisnuo sam vlažnu spužву"" means ""I sucked a wet sponge,"" indicating that something was absorbing or drinking water, rather than producing water. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Resort was reserved) caused the situation. The fact that they were able to book a room at an odmaralište suggests that there may have been limited availability or high demand for accommodations at the resort, leading them to seek alternative options. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Boiled) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Postao sam sumnjičav"". This is because the speaker has become suspicious of an unknown car parked in front of their house, which could be a potential threat or danger to them. It is natural for someone to feel concerned or uneasy when they notice something unusual near their home, especially if they are not sure what it is or who might be behind it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible response to the given situation."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Kriminal was framed (Option A). There are no details or evidence to suggest that there were no dokaza against him (Option B), so Option A is a better fit for the given scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prestao je sa slatким) is more likely. The man has stopped consuming sugar, which could be due to various reasons such as health concerns or dietary restrictions. This would result in a decrease in energy levels and fatigue, making him feel sleepier during the day. Option B (Izbjegavao je kofein) does not align with the premise as caffeine can actually increase alertness and energy levels, rather than causing drowsiness.
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Djevojka je stalo na led."", option A is the correct answer as it implies that she has slid or glided onto the ice rather than having felt dizzy or disoriented (option B)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (She was awake all night) caused her to have a headache rather than option B (She put her son in bed). This is because being awake for an extended period of time can lead to fatigue and stress, both of which are known causes of headaches.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vulkan je eruptirao) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for why lava is flowing out of the volcano. The other option does not provide any logical connection between the two statements.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Znala je sve na zabavi) is more likely. The premise suggests that the woman knew everything at the party, implying that she was actively participating and engaged in the events unfolding around her. This makes it less likely that she would want to leave the party without a good reason.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Let me pass through the toll) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prodao je dionice svoje tvrtke) is more likely as it suggests that the executive director sold shares of his company, indicating financial difficulties rather than excessive spending.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Doktor je bio na dopustu) is more likely. The premise states that ""čovjek je otišao kod doktora,"" indicating that the person went to see a doctor, which suggests that they were seeking medical attention. It is less likely that the person would go to see a doctor if the doctor was on vacation or feeling unwell themselves."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izašao sam iz spavaće sobe kroz prozor,"" it is more likely that option A (the house was on fire) is the correct answer. The fact that the speaker emerged from a sleeping room through a window suggests that there may have been an urgent situation or danger inside the house, such as a fire."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dugo se tuširao) is a more plausible explanation for why his hands are wet with soap. This is because it's unlikely that someone would accidentally get their hands wet with soap by simply sprinkling some soap onto them without any further action. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pljunila sam mlijeko"", it is more likely that option A - ""Mlijeko je bilo kiselo"" (The milk was sour) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""pljunila"" in Croatian means to spit or cough out, implying that something unpleasant happened while drinking the milk. The fact that the milk was sour makes sense given this context. Option B does not fit as well with the premise since having dry mouth after drinking milk would not necessarily imply that the milk was sour."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (I arrived late to work) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Propustio sam autobus"" implies that the speaker missed the bus, which would result in them arriving late to work. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kamion se sudario s autom,"" option A is more likely. The word ""se"" in Croatian means ""is"", so the sentence can be translated to English as ""The truck collided with the car."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they have won (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Boca sode je sištala"", it is more likely that option A - ""Okrenuo sam bok"" (I turned over my book) caused the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."

"Response:  Option A - Pasta for teeth has spilled out of the tube. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Djevojka je stisnula cijev od paste za zube,"" which means that she squeezed the tube of toothpaste. However, the next sentence states that ""pasta za zube isprskala iz cijevi,"" indicating that the toothpaste spilled out of the tube. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that pacifists organized a protest rather than holding a parade. The premise suggests that civilians were dying in war, which could be a reason for pacifists to take action by organizing a protest to raise awareness about the issue and advocate for peaceful solutions. Holding a parade may not have been as effective in this context, as it might not have directly addressed the root cause of the problem. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ona je vezala vrpcu) is more likely. The premise states that the girl pulled a thread from her hair, indicating that she tied or knotted it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option B: Izgledao je mlađe. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the man had a plastic surgery operation. This means that he has changed his appearance in some way, possibly by removing or altering features that made him look older. Therefore, it is more likely that he will appear younger after the surgery than before it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iz jaja je izašla kokoš"", option A is the most likely answer - ""Jaje se izleglo""."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zatvorenik je gladio"", it is more likely that he died. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Pa o je sa ljestve) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""izgubio ravnotežu na ljestvi"" implies that the person has lost balance on a ladder, which could lead to them falling off the ladder. Therefore, it is more likely that they will fall off the ladder than to climb up the ladder again."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Popio je gutljaj sode) is more likely. The premise states that ""Dijete je erkotirao,"" indicating that the child has vomited. Vomiting typically occurs after consuming something harmful or toxic, such as spoiled food. Therefore, it is more likely that the child ate something bad and vomited than that they opened a can of soda and drank it."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ja sam se opustila) is a more likely explanation for why the hot air balloon has entered through the window. This is because the word ""opustila"" in Croatian means ""to escape"", which implies that something or someone has left or escaped from somewhere, rather than entering through a window. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njeni su školski drugovi poštovali je) is more likely to be the cause of Studentica receiving a scholarship. The passage states that ""Studentica je dobila stipendiju,"" indicating that she received a scholarship, and then goes on to explain why this might be the case by mentioning her schoolmates' respect for her. This suggests that it was Studentica's positive relationships with her classmates that led to her receiving the scholarship, rather than her academic performance (which is not mentioned in the passage). Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They lived in the same neighborhood) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (On je izazivao sažaljenje) is more likely as it suggests that the person's hunger was caused by their own actions or behavior, rather than a lack of money.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Htjela sam privatnost) is more likely the cause of feeling lonely. The premise suggests that the speaker wanted to be alone, which could indicate a desire for privacy or personal space rather than a sense of isolation or disconnection from others.
"Response: 
Option B: Udarila sam ga.
Explanation: The premise ""Čovjek mi je pružio ruku"" implies that a man has given the speaker his hand. Option B provides a logical explanation for this situation by stating that the speaker has hit the man. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the Frisbee (option B) flew towards my head than the volcano started shooting into the air (option A). The reason for this is that there are no geographical features or natural phenomena in the vicinity of the speaker to suggest that a volcano would start erupting nearby. On the other hand, a Frisbee flying through the air is a common occurrence and could potentially fly towards someone's head if thrown in their direction. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response: 
Option A: Bila je zabrinuta.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Djevojka je ugrizla nokte,"" it is more likely that she was feeling anxious or worried about something rather than being surprised or amazed. The word ""ugrizla"" implies a sense of urgency or concern, which aligns better with Option A than Option B."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Označio sam sastanak na kalendaru) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker opened that page in their calendar than option B (Bio was to begin of new month). The speaker explicitly states that they ""opened that page"" in their calendar, implying that they had previously scheduled an appointment or event there. There is no mention of a new month beginning, which suggests that this is not the reason for opening that particular page in the calendar. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option B: Podnio je zahtjev za razvod."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the girl kicked the ball (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she obrisala her answer (Option B). The premise states that she made a mistake on the exam, implying that she may have answered incorrectly or not at all. Therefore, option B is the most plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Njegov protivnik je uhvatio) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pokupila sam rajčice sa vinove loze"" (I picked grapes from a vine), option B is more likely. The sentence implies that the speaker directly interacted with the grapes, making it less likely that they were already ripe when found."
"Response: 
Option A: Sreo je svoju bivšu djevojku na ručku.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will see his ex-girlfriend at a bar than buy her chocolate. The scene suggests that they have not been in contact since their breakup and are unlikely to be friends or even civil towards each other. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the thermometer has risen (Option A). The phrase ""Gvožđa u termometru je porasla"" implies that the temperature inside the thermometer has increased, rather than the outside temperature becoming warmer (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Krov sudnice je odletjela) is more likely.
"Response: 
A) His grades have improved."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Osjećao sam se ugodno"", option A (Kleknuo sam na zemlju) is a more likely cause than option B (Zavila sam se u deku). This is because the word ""ugodno"" in the premise suggests a feeling of comfort or relaxation, which could be caused by lying down or sitting on something soft, but not necessarily by being inside someone's mouth."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Polirao sam kamen"", Option A: Postao je klizavi (He became slippery) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the coffee tasted sweet (Option B). The premise states ""Dodao sam šećer u kavu,"" which means ""I added sugar to the coffee."" This implies that the coffee was initially unsweetened, and therefore more likely to have a mild or neutral flavor rather than a strong or unpleasant one."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je pomišao novine"", it is more likely that he has destroyed the papers (Option B). The premise implies that he has thought about creating new newspapers, which suggests that he had access to existing ones and could potentially damage them."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Udario sam čavao u čavao,"" option B is more likely. The word ""zarđao"" means ""to be angry."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker was angry rather than boasting about their strength."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ribe su ugrizle konopac,"" option A (Ribar je uzeo ribu) is the most likely outcome. The verb ""ugriz"" means to gnaw or chew, indicating that something has been taken away from the fish by someone or something else. Option B (""Ribar prebacuje lanac"") does not make sense in this context as it means ""The angler pulls out a line."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ima pršljen) is more likely as it suggests that there is a problem with the child's shoes rather than an issue with the toaster.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izraz mog lica se osvijetlio,"" it is more likely that option A (Dobio sam dobre vijesti) is the correct answer. The phrase ""se osvijetlio"" means ""lit up"", which could refer to a smile or other positive expression on one's face. Therefore, it is more likely that the person received good news rather than lost their patience."
"Response:  Option A: Ručnik je bio mokar.  
Explanation: The sentence ""Obrišeta sam ruke ručniku"" implies that the speaker has washed their hands with soap and water. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it suggests that the ručnik (the person who received the handwashing) was dirty or wet. Option B does not make sense in this context as the speaker's hands are being described as clean, rather than wet."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Stolica se tresala ispod njega) is a more likely cause for the man losing his balance than option B (Prolio je boju na stolici). This is because the movement of the chair beneath him would be more disruptive to his balance than a battle taking place on the chair.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Izgubili su igru) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Kolege su krivili jedni drugima,"" indicating that they are blaming each other for something. This suggests that there was a failure or loss of some kind, such as losing a game, rather than simply having their training session cancelled by their coach. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Žalio sam zbog svoje greške) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Tražio sam oprost"" implies that the speaker made a mistake or did something wrong, and therefore it is more likely that they will feel regretful about their actions rather than proud of achieving their goal."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (On je neprestano pričao o sebi) is more likely to be the cause of her becoming bored with him. The passage states that he has been talking about himself nonstop, which suggests that he may not have been giving her enough attention or allowing her to participate in the conversation. This could lead to feelings of boredom or disinterest towards him.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njene obraze crvene) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Neprijateljski brod je eksplodirao."", option A (Prošao je preko rudnika) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ušao je u lokvu) is a more plausible explanation for why the man has broken legs than option B (On je stao na razbijeno staklo). This is because the premise explicitly states that the man ""probo noge,"" indicating that he has been injured in some way, rather than simply standing on broken glass. Therefore, it is more likely that he was attacked or fell into something dangerous, leading to his broken legs, rather than simply standing on broken glass."
"Response: 
Option A: Otkrili su identitet ubojice. "
Response:  Option B: Tražio sam prijevoz.
"Response:  Option B: Mnogi su bili bez posla.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the economy has failed, leading to unemployment among many people. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dobila je pozivnicu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Maja mu je izmjerila temperaturu) will occur because if the child's temperature was high, his mother would be more likely to measure it rather than taking him to the park.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (he wanted to impress his follower) is more likely the cause of why he shaved his chest.  
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Tražio sam svjetiljku) is the correct answer. The fact that ""struga"" (the word used in the premise) has disappeared suggests that something or someone has taken it away, rather than simply misplacing it. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker was looking for a specific item, such as a flashlight, rather than using a tool like a wrench to fix the problem."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Sin je diplomirao u srednjoj školi) is more likely to be the cause of the family's move to a larger house. The premise does not provide any information that would suggest the birth of twins as a reason for the move. Therefore, Option B is less likely to be the cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She wanted to save energy) is more likely the cause of why the marathon runner slowed down gradually.  
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (the machine has broken down) is a more plausible explanation for why the child hit the automatic door than option B (the book of chips is stuck). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Option A: Okrenuo sam oči prema njemu. 
Explanation: The premise ""Moj prijatelj je umro"" implies that the speaker's friend has passed away. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will turn their eyes towards him in grief rather than harming him physically with option B."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (Napisao je dug) is true. The fact that the business owner's credit card application was rejected suggests that they may have a poor credit history or other financial issues, which could indicate that they owe money to other creditors. This is consistent with the idea of ""dug"" or debt. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek proklet,"" option A is more likely. The word ""obrijao"" means to scratch or rub, so it's likely that the person was scratched by something rather than hit with a finger."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his brother got into a fight with their parents) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the man's pride in his brother. The other option (Option B) does not provide any logical connection to the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Gleda u zvijezde) is more likely. The girl wants to learn about the solar system, so looking at stars would be a better option than going to a library.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Postavio sam plakatu izнад vrat) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Plakat je zalijepio za zid"" implies that someone placed a poster on a wall, and therefore Option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the architect modified their plans (Option B). The sentence states that the client approved the architect's plans for a building, indicating that the architect had already designed a proposal or blueprint for the structure. Modifying those plans to meet the client's requirements would be a common practice in the design process before construction begins. Therefore, Option B is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je ispustio žlicu"", option A (Ruka mu se tresala) is a more likely cause than option B (Lizao je žlicu). This is because the word ""ispustio"" implies that something was released or thrown out of someone's hand, which could potentially cause the person to flinch or react in surprise. The phrase ""lizao je"" does not convey the same sense of sudden movement or reaction as ""ispustio""."
"Response: 
Option B: Upravni odbor je našao Zamjenu."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kasnio sam na predavanje,"" option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegova obitelj je platila jamčevinu) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the man was released from prison early. The other option, Option B (Napali su drugoga zatvorenika), does not provide any clear reason for his release.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Prodali su kuću) is the correct answer. The fact that obitelj has lost everything suggests that they may have sold their house to cope with financial difficulties or other challenges.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the container will be recycled (Option A). The sentence ""Stalom sam na aluminijску limenku"" implies that the speaker has found an aluminum can on the ground, which suggests that the container was previously used for food or drink and is now empty. Recycling is a common practice in many countries, so it is likely that the container will be collected and processed for reuse rather than being broken. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Naučila je komunikacijske vještine."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Slušao sam glazbu) caused the improvement in my mood. Listening to music can have a positive impact on one's mood and emotional state, so this option is the better choice.
"Response: 
Option A: Hranili su beskućne. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the organization collected money to feed the homeless rather than hosting an auction. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bio sam bijesan,"" option A is more likely. When you are angry, it's more likely that you would check your mailbox than lock the door when you leave the house."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he got up early (Option B). The reason being that getting up early to watch the sunrise is a common activity for people who want to enjoy this natural phenomenon. On the other hand, traveling north to see the sunrise may not be as practical or feasible for most people. Therefore, Option B is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the paper has been recycled (Option A). The premise states that the paper has been used before, indicating that it has already undergone the process of recycling. Therefore, it is less likely that the paper has simply disappeared or changed its shape without any external influence (Option B).

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Odjeća dječaka je bila mokra,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Izašao je iz bazena,"" is the correct answer. This is because being in a bathtub or pool would explain why the boy's clothes are wet."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Trebao je biti vraćen u knjižnicu) is more likely. The student has lost his book, so it's most likely that he left it somewhere or forgot to bring it back after using it. It's less likely that a friend would lend him their book without permission.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zločinac je pogubljen,"" option A (he was sentenced to death) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Otvorio sam zavjese) caused the sunlight to enter the room, rather than option B (Otklučao sam vrata). This is because opening the blinds would allow sunlight to enter the room directly from outside, while locking the doors might not have any effect on the amount of light entering the room. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam ga povukao za kosu"", it is more likely that option A is correct, i.e. ""Paruka joj je pala"". This is because the sentence structure and verb tenses suggest a causal relationship between the speaker's action of pulling the cat (povukli) and the result of the cat falling (parula)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Rukopis mu je bio zanimljiv) is more likely. The fact that the editor found the manuscript interesting suggests that he was intrigued by its content, rather than simply finding it unclear or ambiguous.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Shvatila je da nedostaje kreditna kartica) is a more likely cause than option B (Shvatila je da je kartica istekla). This is because the premise explicitly states that the woman has cancelled her credit card, indicating that she no longer has access to it. It does not mention anything about the card expiring, which would be a less likely reason for her to cancel it. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Oni su pohađali fakultet) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Ja sam pojačao glasnost.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""glazba je bila preslaba"", indicating that the music was too soft to be heard. Option A, ""Ja sam pojačao glasnost,"" suggests that the speaker increased the volume of the music, making it louder and more audible. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why people could hear the music clearly."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kosa je dečaka bio u stilu,"" option A is more likely. The word ""kosa"" in this context most likely means ""hair,"" so it is unlikely that a girl would have broken or pulled a boy's hair. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prskao sam se sa repelentom za insekte) is more likely. The premise suggests that something unexpected happened to the speaker, causing them to fly into the air. This could be due to a sudden movement or shock, but it's unlikely that they would intentionally jump onto a balloon. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otvorio sam oči"", option A (Probudio sam se) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zamolio sam ga da ga smanji) is more likely. The speaker has asked the neighbor to turn down the music, indicating that they want it to be quieter.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He was stingy with his earnings) is more likely as it suggests that he was frugal with his money rather than earning below minimum wage.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Student graduated from university) suggests that he has completed his education and is now seeking employment. Therefore, option A is more likely.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Otmičar je zaprijetio da će povrijediti taoca) is a more likely cause than option B (Otmičar je ostavio taoca samog). This is because the threat of violence from the thief is a more plausible reason for why the old man would be afraid than simply leaving him alone.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Na pozornici se odjeknulo uzdisanje,"" option A (Glazbenik je kucao nogom) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dijete se probudilo vrišteći iz noćne mreže) is more likely. The premise suggests that something unexpected happened to the child during the night, such as waking up suddenly or feeling scared, rather than simply being afraid of looking under the bed.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she was born too early) is the cause of her ability to communicate through sign language. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Voda je postala zagađena) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mačka je progonila pticu"", it is more likely that option B will occur - ""Ptica je uhvatila crva"". This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the cat chased the bird, implying a level of aggression and pursuit from the cat towards the bird. As such, it is more likely that the bird would be caught by the cat rather than simply flying away (option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the school is free for the summer) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Zaposleni su štrajkovali. 
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the employees will go on strike rather than the owner appointing a new manager. Strikes are a common form of protest among workers who feel undervalued or mistreated by their employers, and in this case, the vlasnik's refusal to increase wages could be seen as a betrayal or insensitivity towards his employees. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A: Ekstremisti su ga utjecali is correct. The premise states that the leader has caused conflict among extremists in his country, suggesting that he may have influenced or persuaded them to adopt certain views or actions. It does not imply that they would go so far as to kill him. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hodao sam bos na plaži,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Pijesak mi se zalijepio za noge"" (Sand has stuck to my feet) will occur. This is because walking on a beach can cause sand to accumulate in one's shoes or on their skin. Option B, ""Valovi su se udarili uz obalu"" (Waves have hit the shore), does not necessarily imply that there would be an issue with sand sticking to one's feet."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Stavio sam trenirke) caused the feeling of coldness. This is because wearing warm clothing or layers can help to keep a person warm during cold weather, whereas drinking water may not have as much of an impact on one's body temperature.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sin joj se nasmijao) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zaključao sam hlače) is a more plausible explanation for why Rana is in my trapper. The sentence suggests that Rana put on his trousers, indicating that he entered the trapper voluntarily. Option B (Spušio sam se na pločnik), on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as it implies that Rana fell or was pushed onto the plateau, which is unlikely given the information provided. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Option A - On je dobio šupljinu (He got a hollow tooth).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Danausam se probudio s bolovima u mišićima) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker woke up with muscle pains, rather than a sore throat or headache.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The other students felt left out because they were not invited to join the girl at her table for lunch.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Odlučila je pokušati da napravi flip) is more likely. The premise states that she jumped onto a trampoline, indicating that she was already in mid-air before attempting to perform a flip. This makes it less likely that she would simply bounce back up into the air without any additional movement or action. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the given information.
"Response:  Option A - Pošta je dostavljala pismo.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the letter was left in a post office box, indicating that it was delivered by the postal service. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that vjetrovi (wind) were becoming stronger, so option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Maja ga je poslala u sobu) is more likely. The premise states that the child's leg was injured, which suggests that he may have been in a situation where he needed to be taken care of or treated for his injury. Sending him to a room would be a logical place to do this, rather than putting a bandage on the wound directly. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that he signed a will (Option A). The reason being that signing a will is a common action taken by people when they are nearing death or in critical condition, as it allows them to dispose of their assets according to their wishes after passing away. On the other hand, receiving an organ transplant is less likely, especially since the man has already passed away.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Popio sam gutljaj vruće kave,"" it is more likely that Option A (Ugrizao sam jezik) is correct. The word ""popiti"" in Serbian means to bite or chew, so it is likely that the speaker bit their tongue rather than spilling hot coffee."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pisac je izbjegavao pristrasnost u svojim pričama) is more likely. The premise states that the writer was fired, implying that their work did not meet expectations or standards. It is unlikely that they would have missed a deadline without any explanation. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Spavao sam cijeli dan) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker felt tired and slept for a long time, whereas option B (Učio sam cijeli dan) does not provide any information about how the speaker spent their day.
"Response:  Option A - She identified symptoms of the patient. 
Explanation: The passage states that ""Liječnik je postavio dijagnozu pacijentu,"" which means ""The doctor diagnosed the patient."" This implies that the doctor identified or recognized the symptoms of the patient, rather than simply prescribing medication without understanding the underlying condition. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Počešljao sam kožu,"" option A is more likely. The word ""znojan"" means to itch or scratch oneself, so this is a more plausible explanation for why someone might be scratching their skin. Option B, ""Osjećala sam svrbež,"" means ""I felt tired,"" and does not make sense in this context."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (izgubio ježivce) is more likely to be the cause of the man's condition. The premise states that the man has been subjected to an emergency operation, which suggests that he had a serious medical issue that required immediate attention. Losing consciousness or fainting (option B) may not necessarily require such urgent intervention, although it could still be a symptom of a larger underlying health problem.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Muški mišići ruke izbočeni"", option A is more likely. The word ""izbočeni"" means ""extended"" or ""protruded"", so it is more likely that he extended his hand rather than squeezing it."
"Response: 
Option A: Bio je iznenađen. "
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vjerovala sam da su njegove namjere dobre) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker believed their colleague's intentions were good, rather than implying that they knew better themselves.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Počeo je više vježbato) is more likely. The premise states that ""čovjek je prestao pušiti,"" indicating that he has stopped smoking, which suggests a change in his behavior. Therefore, it is more likely that he has started exercising regularly as a way to replace smoking than that he woke up earlier."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The fact that the woman hit the attacker in the nose suggests that there may be bleeding involved, making Option B the most plausible outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (čovjek je imao pogrešan cilj) is more likely as it suggests that the man misjudged or misunderstood his target, rather than simply losing the game.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the owner of the house was keeping a secret mice farm in his basement rather than staking rats for fur farming in his living room. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I was too tired to prepare anything) is more likely the cause of not being able to go out for dinner.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she started hiding her diary (Option A). The fact that she caught her brother reading her diary suggests that she values her privacy and personal space, and may feel uncomfortable if someone else reads her diary without her permission. Therefore, it makes sense that she would start hiding her diary to protect her privacy.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dala je otkaz) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dječji je ruka brzo povukla,"" option A is the most likely cause. The child's hand quickly pulled away suggests that they were burned by something hot."
Response:  Option B: They shared a survey with customers.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dečko je bacio jastuke s kauča) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there are holes in the floor. Option B (Dječak je vuče stolicu po podu) does not provide any logical explanation for this phenomenon. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zaštitio sam lice,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ismijavao"" means to mock or make fun of someone, so it is more likely that the speaker's enemy was making fun of them rather than raising a fist."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Udario ga je grom) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for the destruction of the famous statue. The other option does not provide any plausible reason for the statue's destruction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ostavio sam voće na stolu,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Plod se osiva,"" will occur. The word ""osiva"" means to sprout or grow, indicating that the fruit left on the table will begin to grow and produce new plants. Option B, ""Muhe su se napunile voćem,"" does not make sense in this context as it means ""Flies are filled with fruit,"" which is not a plausible outcome given the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pokazala je prstima) is the more likely cause of balerina's injury. The phrase ""pukla ligament"" suggests that there was a tear or stretching of the ligament in her knee, which can be caused by sudden twisting or bending movements. This could have happened if she accidentally hit her knee against something while dancing, such as a hard floor or another dancer's foot. Option B (Izvratila je gležanj) means ""She threw out her ankle,"" which does not fit with the information provided about the location of the injury (knee). Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of balerina's injury based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otkopčao sam vezice"", option A is more likely. The word ""ot kopcao"" means to untie or undo something, so it's likely that the speaker learned how to tie knots themselves rather than tramping around a playground."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vratio sam knjegu) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has returned the book to its original location or owner, rather than losing track of time.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Njegovi roditelji su ga utjecali) is the more likely cause for his beliefs. The passage states that he had similar beliefs as his parents, indicating that he was influenced by them. This suggests that his beliefs were shaped by their teachings and values rather than him independently coming to those conclusions. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (the car ran out of fuel) caused the driver to slow down. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the sladoled lost its flavor (Option A). The reason being that the sun's heat would not cause a sladoled to melt or lose its shape, but rather it would affect its taste and texture.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A is more likely to be the cause of the artist's dissatisfaction with their work. The fact that the painting looked grimy suggests that it may have been damaged or deteriorated over time, which could be a source of frustration for an artist who put effort into creating it. Option B does not provide any specific details about the state of the walls, making it less likely as the cause of the artist's discontent.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otišao sam ranije s posla,"" it is more likely that option A (Boli me glava) is the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the speaker left work earlier than expected, which could be causing them headache or discomfort. Option B (""Moj šef je imao sastanak"") does not provide any information about why the speaker left work early and seems unrelated to the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the owner (vlasnik) of the house has shaved the roof (štene). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prijatelj mi je oprostio) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Nosio je ruksak.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""čovjek se istaknuo u gomili,"" which means ""a man stood out in a crowd."" The word ""ruksak"" (backpack) does not fit this context as it would be unusual for someone to carry a backpack while standing out in a crowd. On the other hand, a neon sign might be visible from a distance and could potentially stand out in a crowd, making Option B a better fit for the given premise."
"Response: 
Option B: Optužen je za krivokletstvo. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Svjedok je lagao pod zakletvom,"" which means ""The witness lied under oath."" This implies that the witness has been caught in a lie, which could lead to consequences such as being charged with perjury or subornation of perjury (krivokletstvo). Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Htjela je novi izgled) is more likely. The woman wanted a new look.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B: Deported are more likely to happen. The premise states that immigrants are living illegally in a country, indicating that they do not have legal status or documentation to be in the country. This means that they are at risk of being deported if caught by authorities. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Publika se smijala) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pogledao sam u sunce"", option A is more likely. The word ""oslijepilo"" means ""scorched"" or ""burnt"", indicating that the speaker's skin was damaged by exposure to direct sunlight. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ja sam šmrkao) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""šmrkao"" means ""I felt sick"", so it aligns better with the given premise than option B (""Ja sam zijevljao""), which means ""I have a headache""."
"Response:  Option B: Biftek je bio sirov.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Biftek je bio teško rezati,"" it is unlikely that the knife was dull, as a sharp knife would have made it easier to cut through the meat. Therefore, option B, ""Biftek je bio sirov,"" or ""The steak was raw"" is the most likely cause of difficulty in cutting it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Napravila je ogromne dugove) is more likely as it implies that she has accumulated a large amount of debt, which could lead to financial difficulties and eventually bankruptcy. Option A (Dobila je alimentaciju) does not provide any information about her financial situation or the reason for her bankruptcy.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Odlučio sam ga posjetiti) is more likely. 
Response:  Option A - Petlje su se odvojile od cvijeta. 
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Naletjela je na prijatelja iz djetinjstva) is more likely as it provides a concrete example of something that can trigger nostalgia in a person's life.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (On je podnio papir ranije) is correct. The fact that the student has been delayed in submitting their work suggests that they may have submitted it earlier than expected, rather than not completing it at all.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kriminal je spustio pištolj) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the criminal fired the gun at their victim. Option B (Žrtva je podigla ruke) does not provide any information about what happened after the criminal fired the gun.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Planirao sam prisustvovati ujakovom pogrebu) is more likely. The sentence ""Veselio sam se vikendu"" suggests that the speaker had a good time during the weekend, while the mention of an uncle's funeral implies a somber occasion. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker planned to attend his uncle's funeral than a friend's wedding."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izgubio sam pojam o vremenu,"" option A (Sanjao sam) is a more likely cause than option B (Bilo mi je mučno). This is because the phrase ""izgubio sam pojam"" means ""lost my sense of time,"" which suggests that the speaker has been in a state of disorientation or confusion for an extended period of time, rather than experiencing a brief moment of difficulty as suggested by option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dokument je bio nečitljiv,"" it is more likely that there is no ink left (Option A)."
Response:  Option A - Fanovi su se okrenuli prema zastavi.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dip je bio bezukusan,"" it is more likely that Option B (Stavio sam sol u nju) is correct. The word ""bezukusan"" means ""without salt,"" so it is unlikely that the speaker added salt to the dip."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Izlivanje je ostavilo ljepljivi trag) is more likely. The fact that the substance left a sticky trail suggests that it has a high adhesive property, which is consistent with the idea of the substance being a glue or adhesive. Option A (Ručnik je apsorbirao tekućinu) does not provide any information about the properties of the substance and cannot be used to determine its likelihood based on the given premise.
"Response:  Option B: Ponovno je pročitala knjigu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman was interrupted while reading her book. Therefore, it is more likely that she will pick up where she left off rather than marking her page."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Čovjek je pogledao kroz prozor) is more likely because it suggests that the person was able to see something outside of the plane despite being in turbulence. Option A (Čovjek je zaširio pojas) does not provide any context for why the person would be able to see anything outside of the plane during turbulence.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dječak se usrdmao,"" it is more likely that option B (the girl pushed him) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (amputated her legs) is the correct answer. The premise states that doctors gave the patient an artificial leg, which suggests that they had to amputate one or both of her natural legs. This is a common procedure for patients who have suffered severe injuries or illnesses that cannot be treated otherwise. Option B (monitoring vital signs) does not provide any indication that the patient's legs were affected.
"Response: 
Option B: Odvuče ruku od njega. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Dečko je uštedio djevojčino lakto,"" it is more likely that she will withdraw her hand from him rather than pull his arm with her hair. This is because the action of pulling someone's arm with one's hair is not a common or natural response to being hit by a child, especially if the person is an adult. It is more likely that the person would instinctively withdraw their hand from the child's blow rather than using their body weight to counteract the attack."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Cijenio sam njegovo mišljenje) is more likely. The speaker seems to be seeking validation or confirmation from their friend rather than simply asserting that they are in the right.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dečko je stalo u blato"", it is more likely that option A - ""Blata je zalijepila na njegove cipele"" - is correct. The word ""zalijepila"" means to stick or glue something, which suggests that the bladder has stuck onto his shoes rather than hitting him in the face. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that schools are closed (Option A). The reason for this is that snowfall of a few centimeters is not typically enough to warrant people hiding underground. While some people may choose to stay indoors or avoid traveling during heavy snowfall, it is unlikely that schools would be completely shut down due to such a small amount of snow.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Otišao je kući) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Drvo je palo na krov) is a more likely cause of damage to the house than option B (Drvo je zasjenilo dvorište). This is because falling trees can potentially hit the roof or other parts of the house, causing significant damage, while shading the courtyard may not have as much impact. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drvo se raspolovilo,"" option A is more likely. The word ""raspolovilo"" means ""split"" or ""broke apart,"" so it's likely that the speaker cut the wood with a saw rather than winding it with a sword."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Par je objavio da se razvode) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She liked him) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bila sam zbunjena) is more likely. The speaker seems to be expressing confusion or disbelief at their friend's statement, indicating that they are not in agreement with them.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They wanted to find a compromise) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man took a pizza from the oven (Option B). The phrase ""Tajmer u kuhinji"" suggests that something has been cooked in the kitchen, and since a pizza is typically baked in an oven, it is more probable that the man took a hot pizza out of the oven rather than delivering food to the fridge (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ona je naporno radila) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegov sin je upleo u pravne probleme) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Žena je stajala na plamen"", it is more likely that the woman was burned by the flame rather than a new fire breaking out from the flame. Therefore, Option A (Plamen je ugasen) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that her driver's license was suspended (Option A). There is no mention of a traffic accident in the premise, and there is no indication that she had a driving violation or received a ticket. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why her car was in the repair shop.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Spavao sam kroz moj alarm,"" it is more likely that option A (Napravila sam doručak) is correct. The use of the first person singular (""sam"") and the past tense of the verb ""spavati"" (""spavalos"") suggest that the speaker overslept their own alarm clock. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker woke up late than option B (Propustio sam doručak), which implies that the speaker simply forgot to set their alarm clock."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kamere su treptali u njegovim smjeru) is more likely. The fact that a person has stepped out of a luxury car suggests that they are someone important or wealthy, and therefore it is more likely that cameras would be filming them for attention or to capture their every move.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that water in the bucket became wet (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (pridružio se bratstvu) is more likely. The sentence ""htjela upoznati druge studente na kampusu"" suggests that Studentica wants to meet new people at school, which aligns with joining a fraternity or sorority as a way to socialize and connect with others. On the other hand, graduating with a degree in engineering does not necessarily involve meeting new people or expanding one's social circle. Therefore, option A is more likely given the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Tražio sam sitni novac) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Podigla sam jastuke"" suggests that the speaker has been struggling financially, which aligns with Option A. In contrast, Option B (""Preuređivala sam dnevnu sobu"") does not provide any indication of financial difficulties. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for why the speaker was feeling down."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dječak je pobjegao) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Bila je osuđena na smrt) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Šećer se rastopio.
Explanation: According to the premise, ""pomiješao sam šećer u vrući čaj,"" which means ""I mixed sugar in hot tea."" Since sugar melts at a relatively low temperature (around 100-120°C), it is more likely that the sugar has melted than the tea has caught fire. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Veteran je šepao,"" it is more likely that he was called to war (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Policija je prisustvovala žrtvi) is more likely. The fact that the criminal has escaped from the police suggests that the police were not successful in apprehending him or her, and therefore it is unlikely that they would have been present at the scene of the crime.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A - ""Ispao mi je"" (It has failed me) is the correct answer. This is because the sentence mentions that the laptop has not been turned on, indicating that it may have malfunctioned or broken down."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she cleared out her closet (Option A). The phrase ""ostala bez prostora"" means ""left without space,"" implying that there was previously some amount of space available in the apartment for her belongings. It would not make sense for her to have accumulated so much rubbish (Option B) that she had no space left in her apartment. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je bio slomljenog srca"", option B (Žena ga je ostavila) is more likely as it suggests that the man's heart was broken due to his wife leaving him."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Njegava ponuda za posao je poništena) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Glas mu se jasno projicirao po cijeloj dvorani) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence suggests that he spoke clearly throughout the entire hall, indicating that he was using a microphone or some other form of amplification. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for how he addressed the audience.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Novčić je potonuo na dno) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Lopta je ušla u rupu) is more likely to occur because when a player hits the ball towards a gap, it is more likely that the ball will go through the gap than come back towards the player.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Imam štucajuću) is correct. The sentence ""Dišala sam prašinu na tavanu"" implies that something was blown or scattered onto a surface, which could be interpreted as a sign of movement or agitation. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B (Kihnuo sam), which means ""I have spilled."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kupac je koristio lažni novac) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the kasir would call the police. Using counterfeit money to pay for goods or services is illegal and can lead to serious consequences, including criminal charges. It is less likely that the kasir would call the police if the customer simply left burning lights behind, as this could be an accident or a simple oversight.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Od smeća u kuhinji je bilo gadno) is the more likely cause of the mess in the kitchen. The sentence structure and vocabulary suggest that a large amount of trash or food waste has accumulated in the kitchen due to carelessness or neglect. Option B (Slučajno sam bacio listu za kupovinu) means ""I accidentally threw away the shopping list,"" which does not fit with the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (the children were delighted by the animals) is correct. The phrase ""otišli u zoološki vrt"" implies a positive experience for the family, and the fact that they are described as being ""divlja"" suggests that they were excited and fascinated by what they saw. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that bubrezi ( Option A) are failing him rather than pluće (Option B) being closed off. This is because the premise states that he is breathing loudly, indicating that his lungs are functioning properly but his diaphragm or respiratory muscles may be weakened, leading to inefficient breathing. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why he is experiencing difficulty breathing.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (asking a friend if they want to go) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Izvukao sam pokrivače) will cause the temperature in the house to decrease than Option B (Otvorio sam prozore). This is because opening windows can allow warm air from outside to enter the house, potentially increasing the temperature inside rather than decreasing it. On the other hand, covering windows with blankets or curtains can help keep the cold air out and reduce the temperature inside the house. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for how the protagonist might have caused the temperature in their home to decrease.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegov ruksak je bio otvoren) is more likely to be the cause of his back pain. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kupio sam mami poklon,"" it is more likely that option A is correct - ""Ispekla sam joj tortu."" This means ""I bought a cake for her birthday."""
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Pčela je ubola baštovana) is the more likely cause of the destruction in the garden. The premise suggests that a bee has been causing trouble in the garden by digging holes, which could potentially damage or destroy plants. While Option B (Vjeverice su iskopale žarulje) does not provide any specific information about the nature of the destruction in the garden, it simply states that mice have dug up candles, which is unlikely to cause significant damage to a garden. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the flame was blown out (Option A). The phrase ""ja sam pogodila šibicu"" means ""I hit a spark,"" implying that there was already an existing flame present before the speaker struck it with their hand. Therefore, it is unlikely that the flame would have been produced by the upalica ( Option B) as there is no mention of any external source of heat or ignition."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They did not want to discuss their differences in court) is more likely the correct answer. The fact that they were able to reach an agreement without going to trial suggests that they may have been motivated by a desire to avoid further conflict or legal proceedings rather than a desire to repair their personal relationship.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (roditelji su im umrli) is the correct answer. The fact that the children were sent to an orphanage suggests that their parents are no longer alive, rather than the alternative of them being abandoned by their parents (option B).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Meteorit je pao u ocean,"" option A (Došlo je do cunamija) is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was dehydrated (Option A). The reason for this is that dehydration can cause symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, and fatigue, which are consistent with what the premise describes. On the other hand, panic attacks do not typically cause these specific symptoms. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pećnica je postala vruća,"" option A is the more likely cause. The word ""pećnica"" refers to a stove or oven in Serbian, so it is possible that someone may have accidentally left the stove on or turned up the heat too high while cooking, causing the house to become hot. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of a tank or any other object being placed in a hole."
Response:  Option A - Limun je postao plesniv.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Država je kolonizovala zemlju) is more likely. The text states that ""Zemlja je otkrila nove zemlje,"" indicating that a new land has been discovered or colonized by a state. This suggests that the state has played an active role in exploring and settling new lands, rather than simply leaving Earth behind. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Raspršilo se po cijelom podu) is more likely. The word ""raspršilo"" means to scatter or spread something, so it's likely that the water from the broken cup scattered across the floor rather than accumulating in a single location like a pile of rubbish."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Stol se tresao,"" it is more likely that pod was clumsy (option B)."
"Response: 
Option A: Njegov sin je priznao istinu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Otac has caught his son lying. Therefore, it is more likely that the son will admit the truth rather than the father believing him without evidence."
"Response: 
Option B: Uzeo je aspirin.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man's head was throbbing from a headache, indicating that he may have taken an analgesic such as aspirin to relieve the pain. Sirup for coughs (option A) would not be effective in treating a headache."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vlak je usporio,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Približavao se stanici"" (The train was approaching the station) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man has been through therapy for a psychological disorder such as depression. This is supported by the fact that he has undergone therapy, which suggests that he has sought professional help to address his mental health issues. Option A, that the man's psychological disorder was caused by his family history, is less likely because there is no direct evidence presented in the premise to support this claim.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she ate food (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option A - Progutala je hranu.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that her voice was hoarse (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Slinilo se) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Pas je gledalo sočan odrezak na stoli"" implies that something has been seen as uneven or lopsided, which could cause it to slide off the table. Therefore, option A is a more plausible response."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Otpustila je svoje zaposlenike) is more likely to be the cause of her success.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zvonilo je) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the students have left their classroom. The other option, option B (Učitelj je dao domaći zadatak), does not provide any explanation for why the students are no longer in their classroom. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njeni poznanici su izrazili sumnju) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je izgubio sluh,"" it is more likely that he was involved in an explosion (Option B) than that he drowned in the ocean (Option A). The reason for this is that losing one's hearing does not typically result from drowning, but rather from exposure to loud noises or other traumatic events."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the balloon will rise into the air (Option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (imao je moždani udar) is more likely as a cause for the man's loss of speech. The premise suggests that the man has lost his ability to speak without any external stimulus or reason, which could be caused by a neurological injury such as a brain hemorrhage or stroke. This is more plausible than Option B (duboko je udahnuo), which implies that the man simply held his breath for an extended period of time, which would not result in a permanent loss of speech.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Bila je pukotina u cementu) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman was spotted on the sidewalk. The other option, Čula je kako je zovu (She heard someone calling her), does not provide any context or reason as to why the woman would be on the sidewalk in the first place. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Spasitelj je skočio za njem) is more likely to occur because it implies that the rescuer jumped into the water after the person who threw the stone, indicating a sense of urgency and concern for their safety. Option B (Čovjek je natopio spasioca) does not align with this interpretation as it suggests that the person threw the stone themselves, rather than requiring rescue.
Response:  Option A: My infection has passed.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the driver pressed the brake (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B (Staved sam posudu na vruću pećnicu) caused the plastic cup to melt. This is because exposure to high temperatures can cause plastic to soften or melt, whereas immersing a cold plastic cup in hot water may not have the same effect. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of the melting plastic cup.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Auto je uboda,"" it is more likely that option A (the driver was hit by a phone stub) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Preskočio je ispit. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Dječak has been learning for a whole night, indicating that he studied hard and passed the exam with ease. Therefore, option A is more likely."

Response:  Option A - I felt a jolt in my chest.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Moj ured je bio pun"" (My office was full) is true. This is because if there were construction workers in the building next to your office, it is likely that they would be working during regular business hours and not causing a disturbance. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Obitelj je pozvala susjede na večeru) is more likely. The obitelj wants to get to know their new neighbors better, so they invite them over for a dinner party. This approach allows them to build a positive relationship with their neighbors from the start.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the plivač (swimmer) jumped into the pool (option A). Therefore, the answer is option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ugrizao sam komad lubenice,"" option A (Slučajno sam progutao sjeme) is more likely. The word ""ugrizao"" implies a deliberate action of biting into something, whereas ""slučajno"" suggests an accidental or unintentional act. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker accidentally bit into a seed than intentionally bit their tooth."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dječak se spotaknuo,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jakna mu je bila otvorena,"" is the correct answer. This is because the word ""spotaknuo"" implies a sudden or unexpected fall, which would be consistent with the scenario of a jacket being open. It is less likely that the child simply didn't tie their shoes, as this would not explain why they suddenly fell to the ground."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Žena je stavila uši,"" it is more likely that she pierced her ears (Option B). The premise suggests that something has been done to her ears, implying a deliberate action such as piercing. Option A does not provide any context or evidence to support the idea that she was omened by the noise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Napunio sam boku vode"", option A is more likely. The word ""napuni"" means to fill or pour something, so it's likely that the speaker poured water into the bottle rather than storing it in a fridge."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (there were vulgar words) is more likely to be the reason for the censorship of the television show.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Brod je propao,"" it is more likely that Option A: Posada se utopila (Posada sank) than Option B: Posada je naišla na gusare (Posada was attacked by pirates)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (On je riješio zagonetku) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zvuče telefon,"" option A is more likely. The man has turned on his headphones, indicating that he is listening to something through them. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of the man purchasing a phone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Žena je buljila u mene."", option A (Ja sam je zagrlio) is the most likely answer. This is because the word ""buljila"" in Croatian means to hit or punch someone, so it implies that the speaker was physically harmed by a woman. Therefore, option A is the best fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They painted the exhibition) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Prijatelj me je podržao.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Čovjek je počeo raspravljati sa mnom,"" it is more likely that the friend will support the man in his conversation with the moon rather than introduce him to it."

"Response: 
Option B: Otac joj je pipnuo čelo."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Koristio sam olovku) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He was in debt) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why he would be rejected from a job.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Imala je boginje) is more likely to be the cause of the girl staying at home. The premise suggests that the girl had a goddess who was taking care of her, indicating that she did not need to go out or attend school. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vreća za smeће је била пuna"", option A is more likely. The word ""vreća"" means a container or a trash can in Serbian, so it's likely that the speaker threw the garbage into the trash can rather than burying it underground or throwing it away somewhere else. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Moj cimer prolio punch) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Usisao sam tepih"" suggests that something has been used or applied to a specific area, and the word ""prolio"" in Option A implies that something has been poured or dripped onto the surface. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to pouring water onto the ground rather than losing weight."
"Response: 
Option B: Bacio je stolicu preko sobe.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""čovjek je izgubio živce,"" which means he has lost his job. Option B suggests that he has banged his head against the wall, which is an unlikely action for someone who has just lost their job. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Djevojka je bacila grančicu u logorsku vatru,"" it is more likely that the grančica will burn (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je izašao iz tuša"", option A is more likely. The reason being that a person coming out of a trance is an unusual occurrence, while hot water disappearing or someone not being able to find their keys are common everyday events. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ohrabrivali su svoju djecu da se igraju vani) is more likely to be the effect. The parents are encouraged their children to play outside instead of saving money for tuition, indicating that they prioritize their children's education over financial savings.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je otkopčao vezice,"" it is more likely that option A - ""Cipele su se otvorile"" - will occur."
"Response:  Option A - On je hladio ostatke.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Čovjek je pojeo pola glavnog jela,"" which means that he ate half of the main course. Therefore, it is more likely that he would have eaten the rest of the meal rather than saving the remains for later."
Response:  Option B: Otrljao sam ga losionom.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Čuo sam razgovor u hodniku) is more likely because it suggests that the speaker was not present in the room where the meeting was held, but rather heard the conversation from somewhere else, such as a hallway or corridor outside of the room.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sjedila sam) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je zagledao mušku"", it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Muha je odletjela"". This is because the word ""zagledao"" implies a sudden and intense gaze, which could cause the fly to become startled or frightened, leading it to flee."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je napisao oporusku"", it is more likely that he died (Option A). The fact that he wrote a will suggests that he had completed his life's work and was ready to move on to the afterlife."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The text states that Trkač ""ubrzao je svoj korak,"" indicating that he accelerated his step in response to feeling overtaken by his rival."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (smislio sam rješenje) is more likely. The text states that the speaker ""smislio sam rješenje,"" indicating that they came up with their own solution. This suggests that the speaker was able to think creatively and come up with a solution without relying solely on advice from others. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he was in ecstasy (Option B). The phrase ""putnik je hodao po drhtljivom visećem mostu"" suggests a sense of wonder or excitement, rather than fear or anxiety."
"Response: 
Option B: He made a bet with his friends that he would win the game."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he set his alarm clock (Option A). The sentence ""Dječak nije mogao zaspati"" implies that he was unable to sleep, so setting an alarm clock would be a logical solution to wake him up at a specific time. On the other hand, option B does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of counting sheep or any other activity related to falling asleep. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
