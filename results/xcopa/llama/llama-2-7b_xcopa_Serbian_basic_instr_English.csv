Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Патрулни агент је проверио њихове пасоше) is more likely. The patrol agent checking their passports suggests that they are being thoroughly checked and questioned about their identity and purpose of travel, which could be a sign of suspicion or scrutiny. Option B (Патрулни агент их је оптужио за шверц) implies that the patrol agent has accused them of smuggling something, but it does not provide any context or evidence to support this claim.

"Response:  Option A (Their counselor from the camp told them a story about ghosts.) 
Explanation: The premise states that the young campers were afraid, which suggests that they are in a vulnerable state and may be more susceptible to supernatural beliefs or stories.

"Response: 
Option B: Имао је потрес мозга.

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Мој банковни рачун је био празан) is the correct cause for why the check I wrote was not paid. This is because if the writer's bank account had no money in it, then there would be nothing to pay the check with, even if they had enough funds in their account to cover the amount of the check. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation than option B (Заслужио сам повећања плате), as it takes into account the fact that the writer's bank account had no money in it at the time the check was written.

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Прашина му је ушла у очи) is more likely. The phrase ""Очи човека су се изливале"" suggests that something has entered his eyes, and the image of a fly or other insect entering one's eye is more commonly associated with discomfort than wearing protective glasses."
"Response: 
Option A: Њен противник је оптужио за варање.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that the player has won five matches in a row, it is more likely that their opponent will accuse them of cheating rather than crying foul. This is because winning five matches consecutively without any losses can be seen as an impressive feat, and it may raise suspicions among other players or spectators. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Scochala je sa plosce za rojenje) is more likely as it mentions ""плоче за роњење"" which means a diving board in English. Therefore, the girl may have accidentally fallen off the diving board into the pool.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Био је то дан отварања филма) is more likely to be the reason for sold-out tickets. The passage states that ""BILETES FOR THE FILM ARE SOLD OUT,"" indicating a high demand for tickets due to the film's opening day. This suggests that people are eagerly anticipating the release of the movie and are buying up tickets in advance, rather than the film receiving poor reviews."
"Response: 
Option B: Људи су му хвалили.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the person has lost weight, which suggests that they have made changes to their lifestyle in order to achieve this goal. Therefore, it is more likely that people would be praising them for their success rather than isolating them."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Написала је писмо) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the girl's hands are covered in mud. Writing a letter would require using one's hands to hold a pen or pencil, which could result in getting them dirty. On the other hand, option B (Полезела је на јам) does not provide a clear reason for why the girl's hands are covered in mud, as climbing a mountain might not necessarily involve getting one's hands dirty. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Public was in awe, raised their voices) is more likely. The use of the word ""узвигунати"" (raised their voices) suggests that the public's reaction was one of amazement or excitement, rather than simply clapping or cheering.

"Response:  Option B: Имао самсладак зуб.  
Explanation: The premise ""Моје руке су постале лепкаве"" suggests that something unexpected and unusual has happened to the speaker's hands. Option B, ""Имао сам sladek зуб,"" better fits this context as it implies a sudden and unpleasant change in the speaker's mouth, which could potentially affect their ability to perform tasks with their hands.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Produkti su testirani na osiguranju kvaliteta) is a more plausible explanation for why activists are boycotting products.

Therefore, it is more likely that the activists are protesting against the lack of quality control measures rather than the use of child labor in production.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (људи су му дали новчиће) is more likely.

"Response:  Option B: Лишће се накупљало на zemlji.  
Reasoning: According to the premise, ""Дрво је срушило листове"", it means that something has fallen from the tree. Since leaves are not known to turn colors or accumulate on the ground, option B is a more plausible explanation for what happened."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Његов отац му је дао сода да пије) is more likely. The reason for this is that giving a child soda to drink in this situation is not a common or appropriate solution to help them feel better after using the restroom. It is more likely that the father would stop at a gas station or rest area to allow his son to use a real bathroom facility with proper facilities such as a toilet and sink.

The fact that he was ""запљен"" suggests that there was something stuck in his hair or ears, which could only be removed by using earwax removal drops or a cotton swab. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for how he got rid of the wax. Option A (Отворио сам чешму) does not make sense in this context as it implies that he opened a bathroom sink, which would not help remove earwax."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Путници су сишли из воза"", option A (Воз је стигао на станицу) is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option B: Запључио је коверту.  
Explanation: According to the premise, a person has pressed down on a wet coverlet. This suggests that the person may have spilled something on the coverlet, such as water or other liquid, which would cause it to become wet and soggy. It is less likely that the person would use a seal stamp on a wet coverlet, as this would not achieve any practical purpose. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."

"Response: 
Option B: Моја жена и ја смо се држали за руке.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Моја рука је затегнута"", indicating that something has caused tension in one's hand.

Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of the tension in the speaker's hand."
"Response: 
Option A: Заменио сам вијку.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Болт се затегао (Bolt got tangled). Option A suggests that he replaced his wrench, which makes sense given this situation. Option B does not provide a logical explanation for how Bolt's problem was solved."

"Response:  Option B: Вода је била плитка.

The premise mentions feeling a cold breeze passing over one's body, which suggests that the person is experiencing a cooling sensation due to the ventilator. Option A (Вода је прскала по мојој кожи) does not align with this interpretation as it implies that water is being sprayed onto the person's skin, which would not cause a cooling sensation. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They were wet) is more likely. The surfers returning to the beach implies that they have been in the water, and therefore are likely to be wet.

The premise states that he became ""ружичаст"" (pinkish), indicating a change in his appearance, which could be caused by adding something to his body.

This is supported by the fact that the word ""огрлица"" (collar) is used in the sentence. Therefore, Option A is the most likely explanation for why the dog remains near its owner."

This supports option A as the most likely cause for the formation of the syndicate.
"Response: 
Option B: Топла мириса је испунила кухињу. 
Explanation: According to the premise, there is a strong smell of rotten eggs in the kitchen. This suggests that something has gone wrong with food preparation or storage, leading to spoilage and an unpleasant odor. Therefore, option B is more likely - the warmth of the milk has filled the kitchen with a sour smell."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Носила је високе петаке) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why the woman might have difficulty walking. Wearing high heels can make it difficult to walk comfortably or balance properly, especially if one is not used to wearing them. On the other hand, Option B (Скупила је ципеле) does not provide any logical explanation for why the woman would struggle with walking.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вода је закипала) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why water from the pitcher started boiling.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Све моје чарапе су биле у прању"", it is more likely that Option B - ""Носила сам чизме"" - is correct. The use of the word ""субе"" (sube) in Serbian implies that something was submerged or immersed in water, which fits better with the idea of washing clothes than wearing sandals. Therefore, Option B is the more likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he lost support of voters) is more likely. The argument presented in the premise suggests that the politician's actions were absurd or illogical, which could have led to a loss of trust and support from their constituents.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the couple has become pregnant (Option A). The statement ""They are not satisfied with their verbal communication"" suggests that there may be a lack of effective communication in their relationship, but it does not provide any indication that they have run away from each other. Pregnancy, on the other hand, is a common outcome when two people are sexually active and fulfilled in their relationship."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Милионер је желео да зграду сруши) is more likely. The premise states that the building was dedicated to a millionaire, implying that they had some sort of connection or ownership interest in it. It's unlikely that the millionaire would have given money for its construction if they wanted to see it destroyed.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Продавац је видео како је девојка ставила робу у своju торбу) is more likely. The passage states that the salesman saw the girl putting something in her bag, indicating that he witnessed the action of placing the item in her own luggage. This suggests that the girl may have indeed taken the item without permission.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Војници су били послати на борбу) is more likely. The fact that Earth has declared war on a neighboring territory suggests that there will be military involvement, rather than the soldiers reuniting with their families.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Пресуда је потврђена) is a more likely outcome than option B (Извиђен бун). This is because the premise mentions that the court has confirmed a controversial verdict, indicating that there may have been some disagreement or debate surrounding the decision. It is less likely that a couple would exchange vows before a judge in an impromptu manner without any prior legal proceedings taking place.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Оstaла је колачиће у пећи) is more likely because it implies that she left the cookies in the oven to burn, rather than taking them out of a container as suggested by Option A (Извукла је колачиће из те теглице).
Response:  Option A: Бurja se pohoršala (The storm worsened).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (lift stopped functioning) caused the evacuation of the building. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Option B: Отац је избацио сина из куће.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the father was disappointed in his son's alcoholism, which suggests that he may have taken drastic measures to address the situation. option B implies that the father has kicked his son out of the house as a consequence of his behavior, which is a more severe reaction than buying him beer (option A)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: Lift was in non-operation. The reason being that the premise states that the lawyer went upstairs to his office, but if the lift were in operation, he would have taken it instead of going upstairs. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the secretary did not go home.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (his friend cut him off) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Касиjer је девојци дао преокрет) is more likely. The fact that the girl gave her money to a cashier suggests that she expected some kind of return or benefit in exchange for her money. Therefore, it is more likely that the cashier would give her something in return, such as a discount or a free item, rather than simply forgetting to give her a receipt.
Response:  Based on the given information, Option A (Била је парализована у несрећи) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman was in invalid scooter than Option B (Ушла је у болницу на носилцу). The fact that she was in an invalid scooter suggests that she has suffered some form of spinal cord injury or paralysis, which could have occurred as a result of a sudden accident such as a car crash or fall from height. On the other hand, entering the hospital on a stretcher does not necessarily imply that she was unable to walk beforehand, it could be due to various reasons such as surgery, illness, or even just being transported there for observation. Therefore, option A seems more likely based on the provided information.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Земља се суочила са економским тешкоћама) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why citizens would hang their national flag outside their homes. Economic difficulties can lead to feelings of patriotism and pride in one's country, causing people to display symbols of their nation more prominently. In contrast, Option A (Земља је обележавала своju незавичност) does not provide a clear reason why citizens would hang flags outside their homes.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The fact that Tim lost the tournament may have inspired his fans to work harder and improve their own skills, rather than becoming disheartened or losing interest in the sport altogether.
"Response: 
Option B: Почувла сам се поносно. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker's friend noticed that they had food stuck in their teeth. This could potentially make the speaker feel embarrassed or ashamed, so option B is the more likely response."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Он је био пажљив на предавању) is more likely. The premise states that the boy passed the test in history, indicating that he was attentive during the lesson. Option B (Заборавио је да учи) does not align with this information as it implies that the boy forgot to study for the test, rather than being attentive during class.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Земљотрес је погодио град) is more likely as a cause for the building to have collapsed in the center of town. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially if they occur close to populated areas. While an increase in crime rate may also be a concern for public safety, it is less likely to result in the collapse of a large building like this one.
"Response: 
Option B: Она га јеpresented him to her parents."
"Response: 
Option A: Мјеч се одвијао.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the characters will experience a dream sequence where they are in a different world than for their heads to collide with each other. The idea of them being in a fantasy world where they can play with a magic ball is a common trope in children's media, and it aligns better with the given premise than the alternative option."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (there was cardboard in the trash) is more likely. The fact that Rakun searched through the garbage suggests that he was looking for something specific, and finding cardboard in the trash would be a common occurrence. On the other hand, option B (the cap was on the trash can) does not provide any insight into what might have been inside the trash can.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Било јејефтино) is more likely as it provides a reason for why the boy was able to sharpen the pencil easily.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (lost confirmation) is more likely. The fact that Kasier refused to return her money suggests that there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication about the order, rather than the clothing not fitting her. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why she lost the receipt.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Брzo je zaoceleo) is more likely. The use of the word ""брзо"" (""fast"") suggests that the wound healed quickly, which aligns with the idea that the burn was shallow. Option B (Оstao je ожиљком), on the other hand, implies a deeper injury that left a scar, which does not fit with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Гледао је у zemlju) is more likely. The phrase ""чудно су га гледали"" implies that people were looking at him in a strange or unusual way, suggesting that they may have been curious about him. It's unlikely that he was talking to himself while people were looking at him in this way. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Мрави су се попловили до крошка) is more likely. The fact that there are kroshkes on the floor suggests that something has moved them, and mice are a common pest that can move small objects like kroshkes. Therefore, it is more likely that mice have been through the hole than that the child simply delayed putting away the hleib.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Сестра жена је савијала руке) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman's husband would be angry with her. The other option (Сестра жена је почела да плаче) does not provide any clear reason for the husband's anger.
"Response: 
Option A: His lips were curled up in a sly smile as he munched away at his mint."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They predicted traffic around the theatre) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Шеф је хвалио.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the wife has been left at home without a job. This means that she is not receiving any income or financial support from her husband, which could lead to financial difficulties for the family. It is unlikely that the boss would praise this situation, as it could negatively impact the employee's productivity and morale. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A is more likely. The person signed a petition in support of an activist group's goal, indicating that they agree with their cause. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A: Имао је страх од сцене.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Срце глумца је трепетало пред његовом представом"", which means that his heart was beating rapidly before his performance. This suggests that he had a fear or anxiety about performing in front of an audience, which is option A. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for his heart racing."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Precounted my money) is more likely. The text states that the speaker ""био"" or was lost, indicating a past event. Additionally, the phrase ""пребројао"" or precounted suggests a deliberate action taken in preparation for something. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker counted their money before being lost rather than creating a map afterward."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Сврло воће је ostalo na сунцу"", it is more likely that option A - ""Једено je"" (It has been eaten) - is correct. The word ""ostalo"" in Serbian means ""remained,"" so it implies that something was left behind or untouched, rather than being consumed. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Мотор се прегрео) is more likely. The premise states that the car broke down, which suggests a mechanical issue with the engine or transmission rather than an electrical problem caused by a short circuit. Additionally, the mention of smoke coming from the hood further supports this conclusion. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the car to break down.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will stay in bed for a few days (Option B).
"Response:  Option B: Било је хладно у кући.  
Explanation: The premise states that there was no firewood for the stove, indicating that it was not being used. Since the room was cold, it is more likely that the heating system was not working properly rather than lacking wood for the stove."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Има грчева у страни) is more likely as a cause for the woman's inability to run. The phrase ""prestao da taciti"" suggests that there is an obstacle or hindrance preventing her from running, rather than any physical limitation or change within herself. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Сусед ме је позвао да уђем) is more likely. The phrase ""сусед ме је позвао да уђем"" suggests that the neighbor has invited the speaker to enter their home, implying a friendly or welcoming attitude. This is in contrast to option B (""Моја суседа је напустила кућу""), which implies that the neighbor has left their home without notice or explanation. Therefore, option A is more likely based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option A: Њен муж је погрешно схватио њене забринутосе. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the wife has been feeling frustrated due to her husband's inability to understand her concerns. Option A best fits this scenario as it suggests that the husband misunderstood his wife's feelings, leading to further frustration for both parties involved."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Учитељ је похвалио ученика) is more likely to be the cause of the situation described in the passage. This is because the passage states that the teacher praised the student for their answer, indicating that the student's response was correct or impressive enough to warrant such recognition from the teacher. Therefore, it is more likely that the student actually answered the question correctly rather than simply being hesitant to do so.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she went to the supermarket (Option B). The reason being that a woman who has lost her eggs would not typically go to a farm for assistance but rather to a place where she can purchase replacement products such as groceries or household items.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Открила сам му тајну) is more likely. The phrase ""открила сам му тајну"" means ""I discovered his secret"", indicating that the speaker has uncovered something unexpected or surprising about their old friend. This aligns with the idea of a hidden truth being revealed, which is consistent with the theme of suspense and intrigue in the prompt. Option B (Прегрлила сам ga), on the other hand, does not fit as well with this interpretation, as it implies a violent or aggressive act towards the friend, which goes against the tone of the prompt."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ухватила је рибу) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman did not enter the lake.
"Response: 
Option B: His bike was stolen.
Explanation: The premise states that the student came to class wet, indicating that he had been in contact with water. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as taking a shower or getting caught in the rain. However, the option that is more likely based on the premise is Option B: his bike was stolen because it provides a specific reason for why the student would come to class wet. It is unlikely that the student's bicycle would be damaged or broken, especially if it were not in use at the time. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the user clicked the mouse (Option A). The premise states that the cursor has moved to the screen of the computer, indicating that an action was taken with the mouse. Moving the mouse without clicking would not result in the cursor moving to the screen. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (На главној улици је дошло до несреће) is more likely as it provides a specific location for the accident to occur, whereas Option B (Она је пратила камион испред ње) does not provide any context or details about where the accident occurred.
"Response:  Option B: Белизна је оцрњена.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Sam has hung a wet blanket on the line of clothes. This means that the blanket will be exposed to rain or moisture, which can cause it to become discolored or stained. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Сунчева светлост је била светла) is the more likely cause. 
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Желео је да је лето) is more likely as it better fits the context of the sentence. The man wanted to see summer night sky, not that he thought it was beautiful.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Оstao сам будан целу ноћ) is more likely. The speaker feels exhausted, indicating that they did not get enough sleep. Therefore, it is more likely that they stayed awake throughout the night rather than successfully falling asleep.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Коса му је расла) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The boy did not like his new school friend.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Желео сам чашу млека"" (I drank a cup of milk), option A is more likely. Therefore, the correct answer is: Option A: Jeo sam kolaciće (I ate cookies)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Пчела је киша"", option A is more likely. The driver has indeed turned on their headlights."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Паркирао сам преко улице) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (писац је пропустил рок за донос нацрта) is more likely as it directly relates to the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Тражио сам да razgovačem sa nadgleadnikom) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker has tried to contact a supervisor or manager to report the situation. This aligns with the context of being locked out of an account and needing help from someone in authority. In contrast, Option B (Дао смо своj идентификациони број) does not provide any insight into the speaker's actions or motivations beyond simply giving their identification number, which may not be relevant to resolving the issue at hand.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Zvonele (the wind) has blown through the open window. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Одвајао сам лампу) caused the power outage in the house. The reason for this is that turning off a light switch does not require physical force or damage to the electrical system, unlike Option B (Пробио сми га осигурач), which implies breaking into the electrical panel or circuit breaker box, which could potentially cause a power outage. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Тежак је хркао"", option A is more likely. The word ""хркао"" means ""to grumble"" or ""to mutter to oneself"", so it's unlikely that he stood on his head or raised a ship above his head while grumbling to himself. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he mixed himself up (Option B). The student may have been trying to measure something in his head, but since he didn't specify what or how, it's possible that he got confused or disoriented while attempting to do so.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Отац је променио бебину пелене) is the correct answer. The premise states that БЕБА has fallen asleep, implying that she was previously awake and alert. Changing her hair would not have caused her to fall asleep, but rather a gentle rocking motion or other soothing action might have helped her relax and drift off to sleep. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why БЕБА fell asleep.
Response:  Option A - Dečak je dobil požet moždanog mračaja. (The boy got a headache.) 
"Response:  Option B: Сви на фотографијама су одбијали да се насмеју.  
Explanation: Since the photographer forgot to use a flash, it's unlikely that the pictures would be clear (Option A). Therefore, option B is more likely, as people in the photos are unlikely to smile if they are not aware of being taken."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Био сам усамљен) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for not attending the birthday party.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Осећао сам се енергично) is more likely as it aligns with the context of feeling energized after a workout.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he drank water (Option A). The sentence ""Смазио сам влажну губљицу"" means ""I wiped away the wet cloth"", indicating that the person was cleaning something with a wet cloth. It does not make sense for him to have drunk water in this context."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (курорт је био резервиран) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Празници су се одвезали фериботом до odмаралишта"" implies that the group of people traveled to a vacation spot by ferry, but there is no mention of any specific island or location where the resort might be located. Therefore, it is more likely that the resort was reserved and not located on an island."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Бојала се игла) is more likely. The tweenager was afraid of getting a tattoo, indicating that they were hesitant or scared about the idea of permanently marking their body with an image. This choice better aligns with the emotions expressed in the premise than option B (Желила је да се побуни), which implies a desire to rebel against societal norms rather than being fearful of something as personal as a tattoo.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Постао сам сумњичав"". This is because the person's car has been parked outside their house without their knowledge or consent, leading them to become suspicious of someone else's presence in their neighborhood. It is natural for a person to feel uneasy or even fearful when they notice something unusual happening near their home, especially if they are not sure who might be responsible. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the provided information."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Докази су га упуштали) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Избегавао је кофеин.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the person has decided to lose weight. This implies that they have been consuming excessive amounts of sugar-rich foods and drinks, including sweets. Therefore, option A (usurped sugary snacks) is less likely as it goes against the premise. Option B (avoided caffeine) is a plausible explanation for why the person might be losing weight since caffeine can increase metabolism and suppress appetite, leading to weight loss."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The girl has ""trepeljala"" (shivered) which means she is trembling or shaking. This is a common reaction when someone is cold or in danger. Option A, ""поскользнула"", means to slip or fall, but it doesn't fit with the context of the sentence as the girl is already described as being cold and shivering."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Оstaла је била будна целу ноћ) is the most likely cause. The wife was awake all night because she had rings under her eyes, indicating that she didn't sleep well or at all. This is a common symptom of lack of sleep or fatigue, and it's unlikely that she would have been able to put her son in bed if she wasn't feeling rested herself.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Вулкан је еруптовао) is more likely. The passage states that lava was flowing out of a volcano, indicating an eruption had occurred. This suggests that the volcano was active and experiencing magmatic activity, making option A the more likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Познавала је све на забави) is more likely. The wife knew everything at the party, indicating that she was aware of her surroundings and had a good understanding of what was happening around her. This suggests that she may have been able to notice something unusual or suspicious about her husband's behavior, such as him putting on her shoes without her knowledge or consent. Therefore, Option A is more plausible than Option B (Желила је да напусти забаву), which implies that the wife wanted to leave the party but did not know anything unusual was happening with her husband.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Пустила ме је кроз погонску кабрину"" (Put me through to the central station) - will occur. This is because the phrase ""на путничкој кабини"" (on the passenger cabin) suggests a location within the train, while ""погонска кабрина"" (central station) refers to a different location outside of the train. Therefore, the speaker is more likely to be taken to the central station rather than being held at the passenger cabin."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Продао је акциију своje компаније) is more likely as it suggests that the executive director sold shares of their company to raise funds, rather than having simply lost all their money.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Доктор је био на одсуству) is more likely. The fact that the person went to see a doctor suggests that they have a medical issue or concern that needs attention, which would be more likely if the doctor was away rather than simply feeling unwell.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (кућа је била у пламену) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the speaker would have left their bed to look outside. The fact that the house was on fire could be a reason for the speaker's urgency in leaving their bed. Option B (кућа је била праzna) does not provide any such explanation and seems unlikely based on the given information.
"Response:  Option A: Dušovao se дуго (He thought about it long).
Explanation: The premise states that ""дечаци су постали прсти"" which means ""boys have become fingers"". This is a common idiomatic expression used to describe someone who has been thinking or worrying about something for a long time. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer as it suggests that the person has been thinking about the problem for an extended period of time."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Пљуо сам млеко"", it is more likely that option A is correct - ""Млеко је било кисело"". This is because the word ""пљуо"" (pliuo) in Serbian means ""spat/splattered"", implying that milk was spilled or splattered somewhere. The phrase ""млеко је било кисело"" (milk was sour) makes sense in this context, as the act of spilling milk could potentially result in it becoming sour or spoiled. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Рано sam otišao na posao) - ""I missed the bus."""
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the car was damaged in the collision (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they won the competition (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Преврнула сам боцу) is more likely as it better fits the given information. The word ""боца"" in Serbian means ""bottle"", so the sentence ""Боца соде је сичала"" can be translated to ""The bottle has been emptied"". Therefore, the most likely cause for this situation is that someone has drunk all the liquid from the bottle, rather than a cap being screwed off."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he climbed through an open window (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Звонело је на врата"", option A (Посетилац јестукао наврата) is more likely. "
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (У суво-чишћењу је) is correct. The phrase ""Човек је прљао своje одело"" implies that the person has dirty clothes, and therefore would need to wash them in a laundry machine or by hand. It is less likely that they would be hanging in their closet as there is no indication of that in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the girl sprayed toothpaste out of the tube (Option A). The premise states that she ""извукла тубу пасте за зубе,"" which means she pulled out the tube of toothpaste, indicating that she was trying to get something out of it. It is unlikely that she would have intentionally spilled or thrown away the toothpaste without pulling it out first. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Пацифисти су одржали параду.  
Explanation: According to the premise, civilian deaths in war have increased. This suggests that there has been an escalation of violence and a greater presence of military forces in the area. The protest or parade organized by pacifists would not necessarily address this issue, as it would not directly impact the number of civilian deaths. Therefore, option B, where pacifists hold a parade, is less likely to be effective in reducing the number of civilian deaths compared to option A, where they organize a protest."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Оna je везала траку) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for how the girl managed to pull out a track from her hair without any additional objects or entities involved.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Изгледао је млађe) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A: Јаjeто се izaшло. 
Explanation: According to the premise, a chicken hatched from the egg. This means that option A, ""Јаjeто се izaшло,"" is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option A: Умрло је.  
Explanation: According to the premise ""Затворник је гладовао"", it is more likely that he died of starvation than that he escaped. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he fell down from the steps (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Узео је гутљак соде) is more likely as it directly implies that the detective took a bite of the salt sandwich without realizing it was salty. Option B (Отворио је консерву соде) does not provide any direct evidence to support this conclusion.
"Response:  Option A - Опуштао сам се.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Хладни проток је ушаo кроз прозор,"" which means that a cold draft has entered through the window. This suggests that the door or window was not properly closed, leading to a cool breeze entering the room. Therefore, option A, ""Опуштао сам се,"" which means ""I relaxed,"" is the most likely answer as it implies that the speaker did not take any action to close the door or window after feeling the cold draft enter the room."
"Response: 
Option A: Њене школске колеги су јој поштовале.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the student received a scholarship for college. This suggests that they have excelled academically or shown potential in their field of study. Therefore, option A is more likely as it implies that the student's schoolmates respected them due to their academic achievements."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Жiveла је поред њега) is more likely. The fact that she laughed at him suggests a friendly or familiar relationship, rather than romantic feelings.
"Response:  Option A: Он је подстицао на жалост.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the hungry fox stole food, indicating that he was motivated by hunger rather than sadness. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Желео сам приватности) is more likely as the speaker wants to talk to their friends in private.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Udarišem ga) is more likely. The phrase ""Човек ми је пружио руку"" implies that someone has offered a hand to help, so it's unlikely that the speaker would have struck the person. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Фјејейероверк је пуштен у ваздух) is more likely as it does not require any supernatural or absurd elements to occur in a real-world setting. The other option, Option B (Фризби је летео према мојој глави), is highly unlikely and defies the laws of physics and reality.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Била је забрињена) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Уписао сам састанак у календар) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Преврнула сам страницу календара"" suggests that the protagonist has turned to a new page in their calendar, indicating that they have scheduled a new appointment or event. This is supported by the phrase ""био је то почетак новог месеца"", which means ""it was the beginning of a new month"". Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Оставио је свог адвокату) will occur.

"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he watered them (Option B). The sentence ""Ја сам скупио парадајз са лозе"" means ""I picked grapes from the vine,"" indicating that the speaker harvested the grapes themselves. The mention of ""поливао"" (watered) in Option B suggests that the speaker may have been responsible for irrigating the vineyard where the grapes were grown, rather than simply picking them when they were ripe."
"Response: 
Option A: Упознао је своju бившу девојку на ручку.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the man will run into his ex-girlfriend at a dinner date than buy her chocolates. The mention of a ""ручку"" (dinner date) suggests a social setting where people are expected to interact with each other in person, increasing the likelihood of an encounter with someone from one's past. Buying chocolates as a romantic gesture may be seen as a more private and personal act, less likely to occur in a public setting like a restaurant."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Времето је постало топлије) is the most likely cause for the thermometer to have risen. Therefore, the answer is (B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The tornado has passed through a city, which means it could have caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Рибар је увукао рибу) is a more likely outcome than option B (Риbar поново улази у линију). This is because the premise states that the fish bit the line, indicating that it has already interacted with the line and is unlikely to simply return to its original position without any external influence.
"Response:  Option A: Има бубуљицу.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Tinejger ""stuckied"" himself to go to school, implying that he was unable to move due to some obstacle or hindrance.

"Response:  Option B: Моје руке су биле мокра. (My hands were wet.)

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Столица се под њим трепала) is the correct answer. The phrase ""изгубио равнотежу"" suggests that the person's balance has been disrupted, which could cause them to lean back or forward unintentionally, resulting in their chair rocking or tilting underneath them. This is a more plausible explanation than Option B (Пролио је боју на столицу), as there is no indication in the premise that the person spilled something on the chair."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the team lost their game due to internal conflicts (Option A) rather than the coach canceling practice sessions (Option B). The statement ""Коamanда је кривила једни друге"" suggests that there are issues within the team itself, such as disagreements or conflicts among players, which could have affected their performance in the game. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the team lost its game."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Жалио сам због своje greške) is more likely. The sentence ""Молио сам за опроштаj"" implies that Molio is expressing regret or sorrow for something he has done wrong, rather than having achieved a goal. Therefore, option A is the better fit."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he asked about himself) is the correct answer. The premise states that the husband was doleful and bored with his meeting, indicating that he may have been preoccupied with his own thoughts rather than paying attention to what the other person was saying. Therefore, it is more likely that he would ask questions about himself rather than monopolizing the conversation with talk of himself.
"Response: 
Option B: Показале су се њене јаме.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Девојка је осмехнула"", it is more likely that her eyes will be shown as they are a key feature of facial expression and laughter. Option B correctly states that the girl's eyes will be shown, whereas option A incorrectly suggests that her face will turn red."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Прошао је преко рудника) is the correct answer. The explosion of an enemy ship suggests that it may have sunk or been damaged beyond repair, but there is no indication that it has entered a port or harbor. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened to the enemy ship.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Ушао је у лужину) is a more plausible explanation for why a person might have prodded their foot than Option B (Стакао је на скршено стакло). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that something has happened to the person's foot, rather than an external object being near their foot. Therefore, it is more likely that they would have poked or prodded their own foot in error than accidentally hit it against something else.
"Response: 
Option A: Открили су идентитет убице.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that detectives will discover the identity of the killer rather than find the weapon at the crime scene. The phrase ""in search of fingerprints"" suggests that the detectives are actively looking for evidence to identify the perpetrator, rather than simply finding a weapon associated with the crime. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ja sam tražio da me odveze) is more likely. The speaker is indicating that they were actively seeking transportation rather than taking a detour.
"Response:  Option B: Многи су били без посла.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the economy has been declining, leading to job losses. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They wanted to enter a market that was coming from the opposite direction) is more likely. The sentence ""Стража на прелазу свиркала је на децу"" implies that the guard at the crossing saw children coming from the other direction, not recognizing them from her neighborhood. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the guard stopped the children."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Рекао mi je истина) is a more likely cause for why the speaker turned towards his friend. The phrase ""истина"" means ""truth"", so it suggests that the speaker's friend told him something true or honest, which made the speaker turn towards him. Option B (""Направио је саркастичну примедбу"") means ""He made a sarcastic remark"", which doesn't fit with the context of the premise as there is no indication of sarcasm in the sentence. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the driver has run out of gasoline (Option A). The statement ""У аутомобилу је остало мало бензина"" implies that there is not enough fuel left in the car to continue driving, which would prevent the driver from stopping at a gas station or hitchhiking (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Беба је рођена) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Спустио је шешир) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the hat has flown away. The other option (На улици је било ветро) does not provide any specific reason for why the hat would fly away.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Добила јепозив) is more likely because it implies that she received an invitation to a birthday party, which is a common way for people to celebrate their friends' birthdays. Option B (Купила јепоклон) does not align with this implication as buying a gift is not typically associated with attending a roommate's birthday party. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information.
"Response: 
Option A: Његова мајка му је измерила температуру.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Момчино чело was hot. This suggests that his mother may have measured his temperature, rather than taking him to a park. Therefore, Option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he wanted to impress his date) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Тражио сам фенер) is the correct answer. This is because a fan is an electrical appliance that requires electricity to function, so if the power in the house is out, it is unlikely that the fan would be working. On the other hand, a lopper (Option B) is a tool used for cutting things, and it does not require electricity to work. Therefore, it is more plausible that the speaker is looking for a fan rather than a lopper.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Син је завршио средњу школу) is more likely. The premise does not provide any information about мајка giving birth to twins or Semenja moving into a larger house, but it does mention that син has finished high school. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Видела је финишна линија) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for why the marathon runner continued to move slowly after passing the finish line. The other option (Желила је да штеди енергију) does not provide a logical reason for the runner's behavior based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the machine has jammed (Option B). The reason being that hitting a child with an automatic door is unlikely to result in the machine spinning around or getting stuck in a loop.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Куц ми је умро"", option A is more likely. The phrase ""Очиsam mu vrtelo"" means ""I turned his eyes towards him,"" indicating that the speaker caused the person to look at something or someone else, rather than physically harming them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he wrote a check (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Осекао је нокте) is more likely as it suggests that the person has lost their nails due to some unfortunate event or condition, whereas option B (Ударио је прст) does not make sense in this context.
"Response: 
Option A: His brother got into a fight with their parents.
Explanation: The premise states that the man was proud of his brother, indicating a positive relationship between them. However, the fact that his brother ""got into a fight"" with their parents suggests that there may be tension or conflict in their family dynamics, which could have contributed to the man's pride in his brother. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option B: Погледала је звезде.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the girl will look at stars rather than go to a library because she wants to learn about the Sun's system. Looking at stars can provide her with information about the position of the planets in the solar system, including Earth, which is where the Sun is located."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (На задњу страну платка сам ставио траку) is more likely as it provides a clearer explanation for how the poster ended up being stuck to the wall than option A (Поставио сам плакат изнад врата).
"Response: 
Option B: Architect has modified plans."
"Response: 
Option B: Лисао је кашику.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the person lost his hat. Option A suggests that his hand was trembling, but this does not explain why he lost his hat. Option B states that he ate the hat, which is a more plausible explanation for why someone might lose their hat."

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their house was burned down (Option B). The family has lost everything they had, indicating a catastrophic event such as a fire. Selling their house would not result in them losing everything they had.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the can was recycled (Option A). The fact that the lid is loose suggests that the can has been opened and closed multiple times, indicating that it has been reused or recycled rather than being broken.
"Response: 
Option B: Naučila je koмуникаcijske veštine. (She learned communication skills.)
Explanation: Based on the premise, it's more likely that she learned communication skills rather than computer skills because the premise mentions ""дебојка се придружила дебатном тиму"" (a girl joined a debating team), indicating that her new skill is related to public speaking and communication rather than technology."
"Response:  Option A: Слушао сам музыку.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Моје расположење се побољшало"", which means ""My mood has improved"". This suggests that something positive happened to improve the speaker's mood, such as listening to music. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Проверила сам поштански сандар када сам излазила из куће) is more likely. The sentence suggests that she checked her mailbox when she left the house, indicating that she was aware of her surroundings and able to perform an action while outside. Option B (Замрзнула Samuel doors when I exit the house) does not provide any context or indication of awareness, making it less likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he woke up early (Option B). The reason being that the sunrise occurs in the east, so if he wanted to see the sun rise, he would need to be facing east. Since Option A mentions him traveling north, it is less likely that he would be facing east and able to see the sun rise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Папир се свукао) is more likely. The sentence implies that the paper has been used before and has become worn out or torn, rather than being recycled or thrown away.
"Response: 
Option B: Вође других земаља послале су хитну помоћ. 
Explanation: Given that the nation has experienced a natural catastrophe, it is more likely that other nations will send immediate aid rather than forming a union to address the crisis. This option better aligns with the scenario presented in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he emerged from the basin) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Требало је да севрати у библиотеку) is more likely. The student has to return the book to the library because he/she has overdue books or needs to renew his/her library card.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Сунчева светлост је ушла у собу"", it is more likely that option A - ""Отворио сам завесе"" - caused the sunlight to enter the room, as opening curtains or blinds would allow natural light to enter a room. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."

Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Схватила је да је карта истекла) is a more likely cause than Option A (Схватила је да недостаје картица). This is because if the wife has lost her credit card or it has expired, she would not be able to use it to make purchases, but she might still have access to other payment methods such as cash or another credit card. On the other hand, if the wife's credit card has expired, she will not be able to use it at all until she gets a new one. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the husband received an email about his wife's purchase.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they got married (option B).
"Response:  Option B: Komponovao sam svoju pesmu (Composed my song).
Explanation: The premise states that music was too soft to be heard, indicating that it needed to be louder or stronger. Therefore, option B, ""Composed my song,"" is more likely as it implies creating something with more volume or intensity, rather than simply raising the volume."

"Response:  Option A: Пробудио сам очи.  
Explanation: The correct answer is option A because it better fits the context of the sentence. ""Отворио"" means to open or uncover something, so in this case, it would make sense for the speaker to have opened their own eyes. On the other hand, ""Опуштао"" means to lower or reduce something, which doesn't fit as well with the idea of opening one's eyes."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Молио сам ga да га смањи) is more likely. The speaker has asked their neighbor to turn down the music because it's too loud, indicating that they find it annoying or disruptive.
"Response:

Explanation: According to the premise, his family lived in poverty. Therefore, it is more likely that he was paid below minimum wage, as this would have contributed to their financial struggles."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will be searching for a job (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Боја је свуда распрскана) is more likely. The artist has mixed yellow with blue, resulting in a scattered appearance of both colors throughout the painting. This means that there will be no green color produced as a result of mixing these two colors together. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the conversation has become intense) is a more likely cause for the change in topic than option A (we've finished talking about something). The passage does not provide any information to suggest that the conversation has ended or that there is no longer anything to talk about. Instead, it implies that the tone of the conversation has shifted towards intensity, which could be due to various reasons such as disagreement, passionate debate, or excitement. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for the change in topic.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Musician stepped on a note) is more likely. The premise mentions that ""бум"" has echoed through the scene, indicating that there was an audible sound. It also states that the musician ""ступао ногом,"" which means he stepped on something with his foot. Therefore, it is more likely that the musician accidentally stepped on a note while playing than him hitting his head or another part of his body."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Дете се пробудило од кошмара и вицало) is more likely. The fact that parents are in a hurry to get their child to sleep suggests that they may have been in a rush or under pressure, which could lead to them accidentally waking up the child from a nap. It's less likely that the child would be afraid of looking under the bed, as this is not an inherently frightening or dangerous situation for a young child.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Рођена је прерано) is more likely as a cause for the woman's inability to speak. Being born too early can result in developmental delays or disabilities that affect communication skills.

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the bird will fly away (Option A).

"Response: 
Option B: Пословници су ступили у штрајк.  
Explanation: Since the owner of the factory has refused to increase the wages of employees, it is likely that they will go on strike as a form of protest. This option better reflects the situation described in the premise. Option A does not make sense in this context, as there is no indication that the owner would appoint a new manager."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A - ""Еkстремисти су на њега утицали"" (Extremists have influenced him) - is correct. The premise suggests that the leader has been influenced by extremist groups in his country, rather than being killed by them."

Option A: Њен син је усмишљао.  
Explanation: According to the premise, мајка (mother) has been mum (silent) about her son's misbehavior. This implies that the son has been lying or making excuses for his behavior, rather than admitting to it. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option A: Има кариес.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Дечак је носио брецете"", it is more likely that he has tooth decay (кариес) rather than his teeth becoming straight again (зуби су му постали исправни)."

Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker woke up with sore muscles yesterday, so it is more likely that they will experience a headache today. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response: 
Option A: Његова мајка га је послала у njegovu sobu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the child has grown up and left home, indicating that it is unlikely for his mother to have sent him back to his room. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Preodobio je transplantaciju organa) is more likely. The man has survived a fatal disease, which means that he must have received an organ transplant to save his life. This is supported by the fact that the premise mentions ""smrtonosnu bolest"" (fatal disease), indicating that the man's condition was critical enough to require such drastic measures. Option A (Он је потписао своју вољу) does not align with this scenario as it implies that the man simply signed his will without any medical intervention."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Угризао сам се у језик) is more likely. The phrase ""узео сам гутљак"" means ""ate a hot cookie,"" so it's unlikely that the person would have burned their tongue on their own language."
"Response:  Option A: Писац је избегавао пристрасност у својим причама.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the editor fired the writer because he was not biased in his stories.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Био је потни) is more likely as it better fits the context of the sentence. The word ""потњи"" means ""to steal"", so the phrase ""Пограбио сам кожу"" can be translated to ""I stole my own skin"". This makes sense in the context of a person feeling embarrassed or ashamed about something they did themselves, rather than someone else's actions causing them discomfort. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (lost self-confidence) is the correct answer. The statement ""had a sudden heart attack"" does not align with the given context, as a heart attack is typically associated with older adults or those who have preexisting cardiovascular conditions. Additionally, there is no mention of any other symptoms or circumstances that would suggest a heart attack occurred. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the person was rushed to the hospital."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Верујем да суње његove намере биле добре) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Био сам превише уморен да нешто припремим) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the host might not have prepared anything for dinner. It suggests that the host was too tired to prepare something, which could be a valid reason for not having anything ready. Option B (Моја гостница је предржала своje добродошлице) does not provide any specific reasoning or evidence to support the claim that the guesthouse did not have anything ready for dinner.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Girl will begin to hide her diary (Option A). The reason for this is that the girl has caught her brother reading her diary without permission, which suggests that she values her privacy and personal space.

The company wants to assess customer satisfaction, so conducting a survey is the most appropriate method. Offering discounts to new customers may not be directly related to measuring customer satisfaction.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (дечак је бацио јастуке са кауча) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the tree stump was broken. The other option, Option B (дечак је по теренувукао столицу), does not provide any logical explanation for how the tree stump got broken. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Мој непријатељ ме је исмејавао) is a more likely cause for why the speaker's face was covered. It is unlikely that their enemy would have raised a paw to cover their face. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ударила га је муња) is more likely as a cause for the statue to be burned down. The mention of ""муња"" specifically implies a natural disaster or act of God rather than human intervention."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that a seed was left on the table (Option A). The reason for this is that the phrase ""Оставио сам воће на столу"" means ""I left an apple on the table,"" indicating that something solid and tangible was left behind, rather than something intangible like a swarm of flies. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (she has burst her eyeball) is a more likely cause than option A (she has shown her fingers). This is because the premise mentions that she has ""raluki"" (Russian for ""burst"") her eyelid, which suggests that there was some kind of injury or trauma to the eye. Showing one's fingers would not typically result in such an injury."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The fact that there were no strings attached suggests that the child learned how to tie them himself, rather than simply running around a playground where he would not have had access to any strings.
"Response: 
Option B: Изгубио си осећаj времена."
"Response: 
Option A: Његови родитељи су на њега утицали.

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the car slowed down due to running out of gas (Option A). The statement ""the car was slowing down"" implies a gradual decrease in speed over time, which could be caused by a lack of fuel rather than the driver falling asleep."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Мој пријатељ mi je oprostio) is more likely. The use of the past tense in ""мој пријатељ mi je oprostio"" indicates that the friend has already forgiven the speaker, whereas the present tense in ""мој пријатељ mi je postao besen"" suggests that the friend is still upset with the speaker. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Носио је ранец) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why the person stood out from the crowd. The other option, Option B (Носио је неонски прст), does not provide any logical reasoning to explain why the person would stand out in such a way. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Питао сам се да ли је изашао) is more likely. The use of the first person pronoun ""сам"" (""I"") and the question ""да ли је изашао"" (""if he has come out"") suggests that the speaker is unsure about whether their friend has left or not, which aligns with the idea that they are still in the same place as them. Option B does not convey this sense of uncertainty and implies a more deliberate decision to visit the friend, which is less consistent with the given premise."
"Response:  Option B - Ухватио сам мирис цвећа.
Explanation: According to the premise, we know that the speaker smelled something under their nose. This suggests that they are experiencing a sensory perception of some kind, specifically the scent of flowers. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for what happened next."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Успела је да се сретне са пријатељем из детињства) is more likely as it provides a more plausible explanation for the wife's nostalgia.

This is because if the garage was open, it would be easier to park the car outside rather than trying to navigate through a full garage. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Криминалник је спустио пиштољ) is more likely. The phrase ""спустио пиштољ"" implies that the criminal lowered their weapon, indicating a more deliberate action than simply raising one's hands. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Планирао сам да присуствујем учијеj сахрани) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the sentence better than option B (Планирао сам да присуствујем венчању свог пријатеља). The word ""учије"" in Serbian means ""funeral"", so it makes sense that the speaker would want to attend a funeral rather than a wedding."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (сањао сам) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of losing one's sense of time. Dreaming can make a person feel disconnected from reality, including their sense of time. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker lost their sense of time.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B - Izlyvaoje je ostavilo lepkaivo remained.  The passage states that ""папирни пешкир на проливање"" was placed in water, indicating that some of the paper absorbed the liquid. However, since the word for ""leakage"" (изливање) is used to describe what happened afterward, it suggests that most of the paper did not absorb much liquid and instead formed a sticky residue. Therefore, Option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Option A: Она је означила своju страницу.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman's reading was interrupted while she was in the middle of a book. Therefore, it is more likely that she marked her place rather than starting over from the beginning."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cause: Considered my friend's opinion) is more likely. The sentence ""Питао сам пријатеља за савет"" implies that the speaker sought their friend's opinion, indicating a willingness to consider others' views. This aligns with Option A, where the speaker values their friend's input and takes their advice into account. In contrast, Option B suggests that the speaker was already convinced of their own position and didn't need anyone else's input, which doesn't fit with the language used in the premise."
"Response:  Option B: Блата га је ударила у лице.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the boy stumbled into the mud. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the mud hit him in the face."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that schools will be closed (Option A).

"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he has left his job (Option A). The sentence ""Смена запосленого је завршена"" implies that a change in employment has occurred, and since he has not been fired or threatened with termination, it is most likely that he has quit or retired from his job."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Дрво је пало на кров) is the correct answer. The fact that the house has been damaged suggests that something heavy or large has fallen onto the roof, rather than simply shading the backyard.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Желели су да доносу праведну одлуку) is more likely. The friends were not interested in finding a compromise but rather in reaching a fair decision.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the person removed food from the fridge (Option A). The phrase ""тајмер у кухињи"" suggests that a timer has been turned off in the kitchen, indicating that someone may have stopped cooking or heating food for a while. Since most people keep their perishable items like fruits, vegetables, and leftovers in the fridge to prevent spoilage, it makes sense that they would be the first thing to be checked and possibly removed when preparing to start cooking again. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Трудила се."
"Response: 
Option B: Његов син је наследио његово богатство.

Option B does not make sense as there is no indication of water escaping from the bathtub.

"Response: 
Option A: His wife gave birth to a child.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""He was crushed,"" it is more likely that his wife gave birth to a child rather than her leaving him.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the coin has sunk to the bottom of the fountain (Option A).

"Response:  Option A: Имао сам хек (He had a fit).
Explanation: The premise ""Дисао сам прашину на таavanу"" implies that something unexpected or unusual happened to him, causing him to have a fit or become agitated. Option A better fits this context as it means he had an epileptic seizure, which could be triggered by various factors such as stress, fatigue, or even just suddenly feeling overwhelmed. Therefore, option A is more likely than option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (купац je користио лажни новац) is more likely. The fact that the customer left a burning car without stopping to see if anyone was injured suggests that they may have been trying to cover their tracks or avoid responsibility for any damage caused by the fire.

Option B: Њени познаници су јој били у рођењу.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman's husband was skeptical of her claim that she had seen a ghost.

Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."

The fact that the person has lost their hearing suggests that they have been exposed to loud noises for an extended period of time, which could be caused by being in close proximity to a loud explosion or other sudden noise event. However, drowning in the ocean would not typically result in immediate loss of hearing.

"Response:  Option A (мождани удар)
Explanation: According to the premise, the person has lost their ability to speak. This could be caused by a variety of factors, including a stroke or brain injury, as suggested in option A.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (there was a pothole in the concrete) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman's heel got stuck in the trottoir. The other option, that someone called her name, does not provide any obvious reason for why she would get stuck.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Мојаканцеларија је била препуна) is true. The fact that a building next to her office was under construction suggests that there may have been some disruption or inconvenience in the area, but it does not necessarily mean that her own office was particularly busy. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why she might be feeling stressed.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the family invited their new neighbors to a dinner (Option A). This is because the premise states that the family wanted to get to know their new neighbors, and inviting them over for dinner is a common way to do so.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пливач јескочио у базен) is more likely because it directly follows from the fact that ""из базена је пљуснула вода"". If a person jumps into a pool of water, it is more likely to splash water than if they are swimming in the pool."

The wife putting a plug in her ears suggests that she may be trying to block out noise, which could lead to earaches or discomfort. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Пио сам сву воду изње) is more likely. The sentence ""Поновно сам напунио бочицу за воду"" implies that the speaker has already filled a water bottle with water, so it's unlikely that they would need to fetch water from somewhere else. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker needs to use the bathroom again."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (На њему је било vulgarnih reči) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that there were offensive or inappropriate words used during the television show, which could have led to censorship.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the crew has sunk (Option A). The premise states ""the number has failed,"" implying a catastrophic event such as a shipwreck. While pirates could potentially attack a ship, it is less likely to result in the entire crew sinking."
"Response:  Option A: Решио је загадку.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the boy solved the mystery rather than searching for a clue. The word ""решио"" in option A implies that he found a solution to the problem, whereas ""тражио"" in option B suggests that he was looking for something. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Човек је подигао телефон) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pregrli sam je) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Оni су преgleдали све експонате.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the group left the museum, which means they did not take any exhibits with them. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that they simply looked at all of the exhibits before leaving."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Мој пријатељ се за Хронологија нас) is more likely. The fact that the person has taken sides with you suggests that they are supporting you in some way, which could lead to them helping you resolve the conflict with the man who has wronged you.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Пумпао сам ваздух у гуму) caused the puncture than Option B (пребацио саm брзину на бициклу). This is because pumping air into the tire can cause a puncture if there is already a weakness in the tire or if the pressure is too high. However, increasing speed on a bike would not directly cause a puncture without any underlying issues with the tire itself.
"Response: 
Option B: Њен отац је осетиоњечело.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Девојка је изгледала бледо"", it is more likely that the girl's father felt her cheek than read her a story. The phrase ""изгледала бледо"" suggests that the girl was pale or had a weak complexion, which could be due to illness or fatigue. It is less likely that she would have been reading a story at this time, as she may have been feeling unwell or resting. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for why the father felt her cheek."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Коistiо сам оловку) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Био је у дугу) is more likely as the reason for why a person refused a loan. Being in debt can make it difficult to qualify for a loan or may lead an individual to be declined for credit.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Имала је кокошије сипанице) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the girl did not go to school. Having chicken pox can be a common illness that keeps children home from school for several days or even weeks, depending on the severity of the symptoms. Therefore, it is more plausible that the girl did not go to school because she was sick with chicken pox rather than enjoying math lessons.
"Response: 
Option B: Спустио сам га у миску.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the cat was full of mice, so it's more likely that the speaker took him down into a bucket rather than sending him away in a canter."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Мој цимер је пролио пунч) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the speaker's t-shirt is clean. The other option, Option B (Мој пас губи косу), does not provide any logical explanation for why the speaker's t-shirt is clean. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he has lost confidence in himself (Option A). The idea of throwing a chair across the room is not something someone would do if they were feeling confident or self-assured. It suggests that the person is experiencing some level of emotional distress or instability, which aligns with the concept of losing confidence in oneself.
"Response:  Option B: Огањ је угашен.  
Explanation: According to the premise, a girl threw a granola bar into the fire. Since the fire was already burning, it is unlikely that the flame would be extinguished by throwing something into it. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Топла вода је нестала) is more likely as a cause for the man's situation than Option B (Није могао да пронађе пешкир). The fact that he has been walking in the woods without any food or water suggests that he may have become disoriented and lost his way, leading to his current predicament. It is less likely that he simply couldn't find his sandwich given the context of the scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they delayed their retirement savings for their children's education (Option A). The passage states that ""their parents wanted them to go to college,"" indicating that they had a financial goal in mind for their children's education. It does not mention anything about encouraging their children to play outside, which is the focus of Option B. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Оbuća je олакшала) is correct. The word ""олакшала"" means ""easier"", so it suggests that the person's life has become easier after they removed their shoes."
"Response: 
Option A: Он је ostali od hrane staviо u hladnicu. (He put the remaining food in the fridge.)
Explanation: According to the premise, half of a meal has been eaten, indicating that there is still food left over after the first person has finished their portion. It is more likely that the second person will save the leftovers rather than putting them in the fridge, as they would want to consume them later. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Намазио сам ga lošijom.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker's glasses were stolen, which suggests that someone took them without permission. Option B better fits this scenario as it implies that the thief used a lock of hair (lošija) to take the glasses."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Разговарао сам са своим колегом на свом столу) is the correct answer. The fact that the door to the office was open suggests that there are other people in the area who could potentially be overheard in conversation. It is less likely that a private conversation would take place in a public hallway where others might be able to listen in.
"Response:  Option A: Сео сам. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker had to wait for someone else to finish their shift before they could go home. This implies that the speaker did not read the magazine themselves, as they were waiting for someone else to finish their shift first. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the muha has flown away (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Умире) is more likely. The person who wrote the will has died.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Tracer will speed up (Option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Намислио сам решење) is more likely. The speaker has already thought about the problem and come up with a solution, indicating that they have taken action to address it. Option A (Питао сам за савет) suggests that the speaker may not have yet taken any action or sought outside help, implying less proactivity in solving the problem.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Осећао се уплашено) is more likely. The fact that the traveler has passed through a hanging bridge three times suggests that he may have experienced some fear or discomfort while crossing it, rather than feeling exhilarated or ecstatic.
"Response: 
Option B: Ставио се са својим пријатељима. 
Explanation: Based on the premise that a person has predicted his team's victory, it is more likely that he will be excited and want to celebrate with his friends rather than just meeting them to watch the game together."
"Response: 
Option A: Наставио је будилник.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the boy couldn't sleep, so he continued to play with his alarm clock. Option B does not fit the given information as it mentions counting sheep, which has nothing to do with an alarm clock. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
