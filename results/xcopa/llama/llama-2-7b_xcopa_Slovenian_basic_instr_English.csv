"Response:  Based on the premise ""The object was packed in a box,"" it is more likely that option A (the object was fragile) is the correct answer. The fact that the object was packed in a box suggests that it may have been handled or transported carefully, which would be less likely to occur if the object were fragile."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izpraznila sem žepe,"" Option A (Našel sem vstopnicu) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that termites have eaten away at the wood in the house (option B). This is because termites are known to feed on cellulose-based materials like wood, and they can cause significant damage if left unchecked. The fact that they have ""popped out"" of the wall suggests that they may have been living inside the wall and have recently emerged. Option A, on the other hand, implies that the termites have disappeared from the house without any explanation, which seems less plausible based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (patrol agent has accused them of smuggling) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Urad je bio zatrten,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Bil je praznik"" (It was a holiday) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""zatrti"" in Croatian means ""to be closed"", so if something is closed during a holiday, it would make sense for someone to say ""Urad je bio zatrten""."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she skipped a meal ( Option B). Therefore, the answer is option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely to be the cause of the woman losing her place in line. The premise states that ""she has lost her place in the queue,"" indicating that she was previously in a queue or line but has since fallen behind or been pushed back. This suggests that there may have been some disruption or interference that caused her to lose her position, such as someone else cutting in front of her or an unexpected event occurring that caused the line to move forward without her. Option A, on the other hand, does not provide any specific details about what might have happened to cause the woman to fall further behind in the line."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dojenček je slinila na njen brisač) is more likely. The premise suggests that the baby spit up on her nose, which is a common occurrence in babies as they learn to feed themselves. Option B (Dojenček ji je umazal pleničko) means ""The baby hit her with a toy,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Občinstvo je skupaj z glasbo ploskalo) is more likely. The passage states that ""Skupina je predvajala svojo pesem,"" indicating that they were performing their song together with the audience. This suggests that the audience was actively participating in the performance by singing along or dancing to the music, rather than simply listening passively in silence. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Dekle je prineslo učitlu jabolko) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (their spiritual advisor had told them a story about spirits) is more likely to be the cause of the young hikers' excitement. The passage states that their spiritual advisor had told them stories about spirits, which suggests that he may have influenced their beliefs and emotions. In contrast, option B (they were eating sweets by the fire) does not provide any direct evidence or clues to suggest it as the cause of their excitement. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for the young hikers' enthusiasm.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Človek se je udaril v glavo,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""zgubil se je v mislih"" means ""lost in thought."" Therefore, it is more likely that the person has lost their train of thought or become distracted rather than having suffered a physical injury to their brain."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Moj bančni račun je bil prazen) is more likely to be the correct answer. The author states that their bank account was empty when they wrote the check, indicating that they did not have enough money in their account to cover the check. This suggests that the check was not paid because there were insufficient funds in the author's account, rather than because they had earned a raise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Izbrisal je spam) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mornar je bio u karnenti"" (Morning was in quarantine), option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that Morning had been exposed to an illness or disease, making it more probable that he contracted a sickness rather than recovering from one. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sama si jo je recitirala) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Voda mi je ugasnila žejo) is a more likely explanation for why the baby is crying. This is because the phrase ""voda sem nalila v kozarec"" means that someone has poured water into the bottle, which could have caused the milk to spoil or go bad, leading to an unpleasant taste and smell that would upset the baby's stomach. Therefore, it is more likely that the baby is crying due to an upset stomach rather than the bottle being full."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Razmišljal je o besedah svojega prijatelja) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the person has been thinking about his friend's words, indicating that he is reflecting on them rather than actively seeking support from the hotel staff.
Response:  Option A: Počutil sem se krivega.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the bicycle chain broke (Option B). The phrase ""Verige je bila zlomljena"" suggests a sudden breakage of the chain, rather than a gradual wear and tear over time. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Utrujen sta bili od prepirov) is more likely as it suggests that they were tired from work.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Najela je vodjo kampaje) is more likely to lead to her being elected as a public official.  
Response:  Based on the premise, option A is more likely. The man packed some warm clothes in his bag, indicating that he expected cold weather during his trip. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 

Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the student raised his hand (Option A). The premise states that the student knew the answer to the question, indicating that he was prepared and confident in his response. Raising one's hand is a common gesture used to indicate readiness or willingness to respond, so it aligns better with the context provided in the premise. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moški je imel solzne oči."", option A is more likely. The word ""solzne"" means ""tearful"", so it's more likely that he had teary eyes due to emotional reasons rather than something physical like dust getting into his eyes."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Njena nasprotnica jo je obtožila goljufanja) is more likely. The word ""obtožila"" in this context implies that her opponent has accused her of cheating or dishonest behavior, which could be a reason for losing five consecutive games. Option B (""Njena nasprotnica jo je obžalovala"") means that her opponent is regretful or sorry about something, but it doesn't necessarily imply that she lost the games due to cheating."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ujel je študenta, ko je goljufal) is more likely as it implies that the teacher intentionally hurt or punished a student for cheating, which aligns with the tone of the premise. Option B (Odgovori učenca so bili napačni) does not provide any insight into why the students failed their exams and could be due to various reasons unrelated to the teacher's actions.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Izgubil sem glas) is a more plausible explanation for why he stopped talking. Losing one's voice or speech can be caused by various factors such as overuse, strain, infection, or injury to the vocal cords. Therefore, it is more likely that he lost his voice rather than his breath.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dal sem ga v mikrovalovno pečico) is more likely to be the correct answer because freezing food can cause it to become watery or soft, but it does not typically make it disappear completely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Imel had a stomachache) is the correct answer. The phrase ""se je pretvarjal, da je bolan"" suggests that Delavec was trying to act like he was sick, which could be due to a stomachache or other minor illness rather than simply being free one day."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Skočila je s skakalice) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for how she fell into the pool. Option A (Teče na palubi bazena) does not provide any logical reasoning for why she would be running on top of the pool. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (There were sold-out screenings of the movie) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Človek je shujšal,"" Option A (Ljudje so ga izolirali) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Splezala se je po vrvi) is a more plausible explanation for why her hands are covered in bruises than option A (Napisala je pismo). This is because it is unlikely that she would injure herself while writing a letter, but it is possible that she could slip or fall while climbing a rope.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the audience was surprised) is more likely. The premise suggests that the juggler's performance was unexpected and impressive, which would likely result in a positive reaction from the audience. Option B (the acrobat fell off the trapeze) does not align with this interpretation of the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izgubil sem potrpljenje,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""pustil čakati"" suggests that someone or something has caused the speaker to wait for a long time without any explanation as to why they are waiting. This implies that the friend may have forgotten about their plans with the speaker or failed to show up at the agreed-upon time, leading to feelings of frustration and wasted time. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer based on the given premise."
"Response: 
Option B: Dogovorili so se o pogodbi. 
Explanation: The premise states that military countries want peace, which suggests that they are willing to negotiate and find a peaceful solution rather than resorting to nuclear weapons. Option B best reflects this idea as it implies that the countries have reached an agreement or treaty, indicating a peaceful resolution to their conflicts."
Response:  Option A - Zaspal je.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ženska se je zaletela v kavč,"" it is more likely that she injured her knee (Option B). The word ""zaletela"" implies a sudden impact or collision, which could cause injury to the knee joint."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fant je stisnil balon"", it is more likely that option A - ""Balon je počil"" (The balloon burst) is correct."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Razpakirali so kovčke) is more likely to happen. The reason being that if people have checked into a hotel room, it is unlikely that they would be packing their bags and leaving for an airport immediately after checking in. Therefore, option A is the more plausible choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ugriznil sem breskev,"" option A is more likely. The word ""breskev"" means ""soup,"" so it's unlikely that you would have gone out for a walk after eating soup. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Jedla sem krofe) is a more plausible cause for why I am not getting any mail. This is because ""krofe"" means ""mail"" in Slovenian, and it makes sense that if you are not receiving any mail, it could be due to the fact that you are eating all of your mail instead of letting it pass through the postal system. Option B (""-Sladko sem jedel"") does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no clear connection between eating something sweet and not receiving mail."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Potisnil sem vrata"", it is more likely that option A: ""Odprla se je"" (The door has opened). This is because the sentence ""Potisnil sem vrata"" implies that the speaker has tried to open the door but was unable to do so, suggesting that the door may have been locked or blocked in some way. Option B, ""Vrata so zaklenjena"" (The doors are closed), does not provide any additional information about the state of the door and is therefore less likely to be true based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The text states that ""aktivisti so jih [proizvodi] bojkotirali,"" indicating that there was a boycott of the products. This suggests that there were concerns about the quality or ethical implications of the products, rather than simply their testing for quality. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vdrl sem luknjo v steno,"" option A is more likely. The word ""luknjo"" means a hole or an opening in Serbian, so it's unlikely that prah (dust) would have flown out of it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njena sestra je bila srečna) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she put on a blouse (Option A). The sentence ""Na srajco sem si polila vino"" means ""I poured wine into my shirt,"" which suggests that something liquid was spilled onto her shirt. Since a blouse is typically made of fabric that can absorb liquids without staining, it is more likely that she put on a blouse to protect herself from getting stained than to change into a different article of clothing."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Stranka je preiskovala denarnico) is a more plausible explanation for why Kasir opened his savings account than option B (Stranka ji je dala denar). This is because it makes sense that someone might open a savings account to save money they have already earned or inherited, rather than receiving money directly from another person or entity.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Odpustil je množico) is more likely. The premise states that the musician has attracted a crowd, which suggests that he has gained popularity or attention from others. Therefore, it is more likely that he would be forgiven by the crowd rather than given drugs.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mali fantek je jokal do varuške,"" Option A (he made a mistake) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pilotov radar je zaznal nevihtu,"" it is more likely that Option B - Pilot je letel skozi nevihto - is true. The pilot must have flown through the storm to be detected by the radar."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Listi so sespremenili v barve) is more likely. The idea that lists have changed color does not make sense in this context, as it would imply a change in their physical properties rather than their location or appearance. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (odločil se je, da se bo šalil svojino sestro) is more likely. The premise suggests that the protagonist is in a bad mood, which could lead to him wanting to tease or play pranks on his sister rather than actually playing with her.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Njegov oče je ustalav avto na bencinskem črpalki) is more likely to happen because it provides a logical explanation for why Otrok would have to go to the gas station. Option A (Njegov oče mu je dal sok) does not provide any obvious reason for why Otrok would need to go to the gas station.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Ribe so skočile iz rezervoarja"" (The fish jumped out of the reservoir) is correct. The premise states that the fish were fed in an aquarium, but does not mention anything about them jumping out of a reservoir. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome based on the information provided."
"Response:  Option A: Spremenila je stranko.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman's political views have changed party affiliations. This suggests that she has switched her allegiance from one political party to another, rather than protesting or taking any other action. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Potniki so izstopili iz vlaka"", option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Moski pressed wet wool to a kuvert (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Na kuverto je dal žig.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that they lost touch with each other rather than moving to different cities. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she was fired (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Slišal sem, da tičeta ura) is a more likely cause than option B (Hotel sem preveriti čas). This is because the word ""tičeta"" in Slovenian means ""to tick"", so it implies that the speaker heard something ticking, rather than checking the time. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moja roka se je stisnula,"" option B is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the speaker's wife held onto their hand (roka) tightly, rather than the speaker writing an essay by hand."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zaprto je,"" Option A is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""zamojcil"" in Slovenian means ""I locked."" Therefore, the speaker is unlikely to have replaced a key but rather locked the door."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Par se je preselil v stanovanje) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hotela je gledali sončni zahod) is more likely. The woman was sitting outside, indicating that she had a clear view of the sunset. It's unlikely that she would be thinking about her roof while watching the sunset.
"Response:  Option B: Voda je bila plitva. 
Explanation: The premise states that a person was able to swim with a life jacket in water, implying that the water was shallow enough for them to stand or float in without drowning. Therefore, option B, ""Voda je bila plitva,"" or ""The water was shallow"" is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option A: Izbrisala je dokument.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman wrote a mistake in the word processor document. This means that she accidentally deleted the document instead of pressing the backspace key. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Slaba ocena je dobila) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trava je bila blata,"" option A is more likely. The sentence implies that it was raining all night, which would make the ground wet and muddy. Option B does not provide any information to support the idea of a full moon."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she overslept (Option B). The fact that she spent the night in a hotel suggests that she may have been too tired to set her alarm clock properly, leading to her oversleeping.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sedel was in the shade) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Raziskovalci so teorijo umaknili) is correct. The passage states that ""raziskovalci so dokazali teorijo,"" indicating that they have proven or supported a theory, but then goes on to say that ""raziskovalci so teorijo umaknili,"" suggesting that they have since retracted or reversed their earlier findings. This implies that the original theory was not entirely accurate or reliable, and therefore it is more likely that the researchers have revised or rejected their initial hypothesis rather than having it accepted by individuals."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the game went into overtime) is more likely as the reason for the fans' disappointment.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Zaprla sem ključavnice) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the given premise that ""Vstopil sem kombinacijo na ključavnicu"". Therefore, when he tried to open the lock using a combination, he was able to successfully unlock it."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Oče je sinu dal nekaj denarja) is more likely to be the cause of the increase in množica. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Snež sem odrinil s poti) is a more likely explanation for why the car cannot pass through the snowy road. The word ""odrinil"" means to push or drive something away, which aligns with the idea of how snow can block a path. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kajakarji so veslali vesla,"" option A is more likely. The word ""vesla"" means to row in Slovenian, so it's likely that the kayaker reached the shore rather than being thrown into the water by a wave."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (ODPUSTILA JE ROČAJ) is more likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Voda, ki se je posipala po moji koži) is more likely. The sentence suggests that water has been pouring onto the speaker's skin, which would cause discomfort or irritation rather than a cooling sensation as suggested in option B (Čutil sem, kako hladni zrak prehaja čez mene).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They were both sunburned) is more likely. The premise states that ""Surferji so se vrnili na plažo,"" indicating that they returned to the beach after surfing. Sunburn is a common occurrence for people who spend extended periods of time in the sun, especially those involved in water sports like surfing. Therefore, it is more likely that they were both sunburned rather than having seen a sea monster."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that water has come out of the pot (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Priznal ji je svojo nezvestobo) is more likely. The fact that he feels guilty about cheating suggests that he has done something wrong, and admitting it to his wife would be a way for him to take responsibility for his actions. Option A (Obtožil jo je nevere) does not align with this interpretation as accusing someone of never being faithful without any evidence is unlikely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Počakal sem, da se črnilo posuši) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the ink has been smudged. The other option, Option B (Na plakat sem polila vodo), does not provide any logical explanation for how the ink got smudged. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otrok se je zbujal v krik,"" it is more likely that he woke up in a cry (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fant je položil noge na mizo"", option A (Njegov oče je sedel za mizo) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Prijatelj je obrnil glavo v mojo smer,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""vpil sem njegovo ime"" means ""I turned my head towards him."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Državljani so se uprli) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he set up a shelter (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Želela se je naučiti o drugih kulturah) is more likely as it aligns with the reason for traveling given in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his colleague has advanced) is more likely to be the cause of his sadness. The passage states that he was ""saddened by the success of a colleague,"" implying that his colleague's advancement or progress has caused him discontent. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person hallucinated (option A). The phrase ""človek je videl vesoljce"" suggests a visual experience of seeing stars or celestial bodies, which could be interpreted as a hallucination rather than a meditation-induced vision. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Z beljenjem je) is more likely as it implies that becoming blonde was a result of something internal or inherent to Možak himself, rather than an external action like using shampoo (option B).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Criticized her previous work than that she felt a sudden inspiration. Therefore, the answer is Option A: Criticized her previous work.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sin was discharged from the army) is the correct answer. The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it can be inferred that if Sin had been discharged from the army, he would have left his home for a different location rather than simply disappearing without any explanation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ravens were covered in ash) is more likely. The sentence ""Knjige so padle iz knjižnice"" implies that something heavy has fallen from the library, and given the context of the sentence, it is more likely that ravens or other birds have dropped books rather than a earthquake causing them to fall."
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (I turned off the light) caused the darkness in the house rather than Option B (I flipped the switch). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vozili smo se na valovski nizki,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something dangerous or frightening happened during the ride, rather than something enjoyable."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I microwaved it) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Napovedala je močan veter) is more likely. The falling tree branch has caused a power line to break, resulting in a loss of electricity in the neighborhood.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Iz obraza mi je kapjlala pot) is a more likely explanation for why there is water on my hand than option B (Na prst sem dobil kapljočo krvo). This is because the phrase ""iz obraza"" means ""from the wound,"" indicating that the water came from a source other than blood."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he drowned (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prehlajen je bil) is more likely as a cause for having a hoarse voice. When the body is exposed to cold temperatures, it can cause inflammation in the vocal cords, leading to a hoarse voice. This is why many people experience a sore or hoarse throat after exposure to cold weather. On the other hand, option B (Ne kadi več) does not provide any logical explanation for how a person's voice could become hoarse due to no longer crying. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Dvigalo je prispelo na določeno nadstropje) is the most likely cause. The text states that the elevator arrived at a designated floor, indicating that it reached its destination. Option B (Dvigalo je obtičalo med dvorišči) does not provide any context or information to support this conclusion. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Lagal je staršem) is more likely. The word ""lagal"" in Slovenian means ""to scold"", so it's likely that the child was scolded by their parents rather than being punished."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Toaleta je preplavila) is the cause of the flood. The use of the word ""poplavila"" suggests that water has overflowed or flooded an area, which is consistent with a toilet being clogged and causing water to back up into the bathroom. It is less likely that Option B (Vročič vode je pokvarjen) would be the cause of the flood, as this phrase does not provide any specific details about how the water became flooded."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Lastnik je naval ovratnicu na kužak) is a more plausible explanation for why the dog has stayed close to its owner. The fact that the dog has remained near its owner suggests that it may have been feeling secure or comfortable with its surroundings, which could be due to the presence of its owner. On the other hand, option B (Lastnik je imel kužaka na vrvi) does not provide any logical explanation as to why the dog would stay close to its owner. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Človek je zaznal njegov odsev,"" it is more likely that the person heard his own reflection in Option A - under a big tree. This is because the word ""odsev"" (reflection) implies something that can be seen or heard from a distance, and a big tree would provide sufficient coverage for a person's voice to carry far enough for someone else to hear it. In contrast, Option B - above a calm lake - does not provide as much coverage for sound waves to travel long distances, making it less likely that the person would hear their own reflection."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I called her back) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their dog has run away from home (Option A). The fact that their house is empty of valuable items suggests that nothing was stolen or missing, which reduces the likelihood of Option B. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vreme je bilo hladno) is more likely as a cause for feeling tired than option B (Občutek sem imela, da mi je prsni koš stisnil). This is because cold weather can make people feel tired and sluggish due to its effects on the body's metabolism and circulation.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the employees wanted better working conditions) is the correct cause for why they formed a union. The passage states that the employees were dissatisfied with their working conditions, which suggests that they were not happy with their current situation and wanted change. This aligns with option A, as wanting better working conditions is a common reason for forming a union. In contrast, option B does not provide any evidence to support the idea that the employer increased pay, which is not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for why the employees formed a union.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pečal sem jabolčno pito,"" it is more likely that there is a strong smell of garlic in the kitchen (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Slekla je čevlje) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why a woman might struggle to walk. On the other hand, Option A (Nosila je visoke pete) does not provide any logical explanation for why a woman would have difficulty walking.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iz lonca z vodo se je dvignila para,"" option A is the most likely cause - ""Voda je vrela."" This is because the phrase ""iz lonca z vodo"" means ""from a bucket of water,"" implying that the water has risen from a container rather than being poured into it. Therefore, the most likely explanation for why the water rose is that it began to boil or vaporize, resulting in steam rising from the container."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vse nogavice so bile v pralnici,"" it is more likely that Option B - ""Nosil sem škornje"" (I have worn a skirt) will occur. This is because the sentence suggests that all shoes were in the closet, implying that other clothing items may also be present. The mention of a skirt as an alternative possibility further supports this conclusion."
Response:  Based on the premise that the politician's argument was absurd, it is more likely that he lost support from voters (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that par je pobegnil (Par has fled). This is because the premise states that ""vsi niso bili zadovoljni s Zaroko,"" indicating that there was dissatisfaction with the wedding, which could lead to a desire to escape or flee rather than simply being unhappy about it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Milijonar je hotel, da zgraja zraste) is more likely as it implies that the millionaire has a personal interest in the building's growth. Option B (Milijonar je prispeval sredstva za gradnjo) simply states that he provided financial resources for the construction without any implication of his involvement or motivation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prodajalka je videla dekle, kako je dala blago v torbico) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the trgovalec would be angry with the girl. The other option does not provide any clear reason for the trgovalec's anger. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that soldiers were sent to battle (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pred sodiščem je izbruhnil nemir) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dekle je začutilo nekaj, čegar gori,"" option B is the most likely cause - she probably spilled something hot on herself."

"Response:  Option B: Oče je izgnal sina iz hiše.  
Explanation: According to the premise, oče is angry at his son's alcoholism. Given that he has taken steps to punish him by kicking him out of the house, option B is the most likely outcome."

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that kasir has forgotten to give the cashier their money (Option B). The reason for this is that forgetting something like giving money to a cashier is a common mistake that people make, especially when they are busy or distracted. On the other hand, deliberately stealing from someone is less likely as it goes against moral values and could lead to legal consequences. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible answer based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Po nesreči je bila paralizirana) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the speaker is describing a sudden and unexpected event that resulted in the woman's paralysis, rather than her being taken to the hospital on a stretcher.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The fact that citizens are hanging their national flag outside their homes suggests a sense of pride and celebration, indicating that the country has achieved something significant, such as gaining independence. This is more likely than option B, which implies economic difficulties, as it does not align with the tone of the premise.
"Response: 
Option B: Navdihnili so svoje oboževalce. 
Explanation: The passage states that ""Ekipa je izgubila turnir,"" indicating that they lost a tournament. This implies that their fans are disappointed or disillusioned with their performance. Option B better captures this sentiment as it suggests that the team inspired their fans rather than disappointing them."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sram me je bilo) is a more likely response. This is because ""sram"" means ""itch"" in Serbian, so the speaker would be expressing that they felt an itch in their mouth after being told they had food in their teeth. Option B (""Počutil sem se ponosnega"") does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (V razredu je bil pozoren) is more likely. The text states that he ""did not pass his exam from history,"" indicating that he did not perform well in the subject. This suggests that he was not paying attention or engaged in class during history lessons, making option A a more plausible explanation for why he failed the exam."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zemljotres je zadel mesto) is more likely as a cause for the building to have collapsed in the center of town. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially if they occur close to populated areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that an earthquake was responsible for the collapse of the building rather than an increase in crime rate.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Prosil jo je, naj ga sprejme nazaj) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Žoga se je odvrgla) is more likely. The premise states that the other kid took the ball, implying that the first child did not have possession of it when it was taken. Therefore, option A is the most logical choice as it implies that the ball flew away from the first child rather than their head colliding with something.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (V smetnjaku je bil karton) is more likely. The word ""pretresel"" in the premise suggests that something was placed or put into the smetnjak, which fits better with Option A than Option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Bil je poceni) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Fant je oštril svinčnik,"" which means ""He had a sharp knife."" This implies that the person in question had a high-quality knife, which would be expensive. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Izgubila je račun) is more likely. The premise states that she was charged for an item but did not receive it, indicating that there may have been a mistake with her order or payment. It is less likely that the oversized clothing did not fit her as the premise does not provide any information to suggest otherwise. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poškodba na moji koži je bila globoka,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the injury was deep, which would require a longer time to heal. Option B does not align with this idea of a deep injury."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Potniki v vlaku so ga čudno gledali,"" option A is more likely. The passengers were looking at him strangely, indicating that they found his behavior unusual or interesting. Therefore, he was probably talking to himself rather than looking at the floor."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that mice have climbed onto the bread (Option A). The word ""drobtinice"" in Croatian refers to small pieces of bread or rolls, and the phrase ""na tleh"" means ""on the ground"". Therefore, the sentence suggests that something has happened to the bread, such as mice climbing onto it. Option B does not make sense in this context, as there is no mention of an otrok (child) putting aside a loaf of bread."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ženska sestra je sklenila roke) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman gave her sister a handkerchief.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegove ustnice so brile razpokane) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the person's mouth was in pain. The other option, Option B (Skrbelo ga je zaradi zadah), does not provide any clear reasoning or evidence to support its claim. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Šef jo je pohvalil) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Podpiral je njihov cilj) is more likely. The sentence implies that Moski signed a petition in support of activists' goals, rather than announcing them to others as his own idea.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A ( Bil je prestrašen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Prešel sem denar) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (pojedli so ga) is more likely. The word ""zdržale"" in the premise means ""stayed,"" indicating that the fruit juice remained on the sun for a period of time. This suggests that it may have been exposed to heat or radiation from the sun, which could cause it to ferment or spoil. Option B (""Zmačala se je"") implies that something has happened to the fruit juice after it was already on the ground, which does not fit with the premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Vklopil sem vžig) is the correct answer. The phrase ""se je pokvaril"" suggests that something has gone wrong with the car's engine, and ""vklopil sem vžig"" means that the driver has turned off the ignition. Therefore, it is more likely that the car's engine stopped working due to a mechanical issue rather than overheating."
"Response: 
Option B: Več dnev je ležal v posteli."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Prižgal sem ogenj v kaminu,"" option A is more likely. The fact that there was no wood for the fire suggests that the speaker did not have enough fuel to keep the fire going, rather than the house being cold."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Krč ima v boku) is more likely to be the cause of the woman's inability to menstruate. This is because the phrase ""nehalatekati"" suggests that something is blocking or preventing her from menstruating, rather than suggesting that she has gained a new spirit or power. Additionally, the context of the sentence implies that the speaker believes there is something physically wrong with the woman, as they say ""krč ima v boku,"" which means ""there is something stuck inside her."" Therefore, it is more likely that the woman's inability to menstruate is caused by an physical obstruction or illness rather than gaining a new spirit or power."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Klopal sem na sosedova vrata,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that someone has knocked on the neighbor's door, indicating that they are trying to reach them or communicate with them. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njen mož je napačno razumel njeno skrb) is more likely as it suggests that her husband misunderstood her concern rather than simply kissing her for no reason.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the student answered correctly) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She went to the farm) is more likely. 
Explanation: The premise states that there are not enough eggs for women, indicating a shortage or scarcity of eggs. Going to the farm would be a logical solution to this problem, as it would allow her to obtain eggs directly from the source. On the other hand, going to the store would not necessarily solve the problem of egg scarcity, especially if the store does not have an adequate supply of eggs either. Therefore, Option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Odkril sem mu skrivnost) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ujela je ribu) is more likely. The premise states that the woman avoided sleeping in the lake, but it does not provide any information about the water being contaminated.

"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Uporabnik je premaknil miško) is the more likely cause because it aligns with the statement ""Na računalniku se je premaknil kazalec."" The user moving the mouse cursor is a more plausible explanation for why the pointer moved than the user clicking the mouse button. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Na glavni cesti je bila nesreča) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that a car accident occurred on the main road, which aligns with Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (the plate has dried out) is correct. The phrase ""Mokro perilo sem obesila na zunanjo opralnico"" suggests that something wet or moist has been placed on a dry surface, which would cause the plate to dry out rather than become stained or discolored as suggested by option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sunlight was bright) is more likely to be the cause of the woman putting on her sunglasses. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Človek je buljil v nočno nebo,"" option A is more likely. The word ""buljil"" means to dream or imagine something, so it's likely that the person wanted to experience a beautiful sky at night, rather than simply thinking it was beautiful."

Response:  Option A - Lasje so mu rasli.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Fant has not welcomed his new classmate) is more likely. The premise states that Fant is playing pranks on his new classmate, indicating that he may not be very friendly towards him.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Jedel sem piškote) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Želel sem kozarec mleka"" implies that the speaker wants to drink milk from a bottle, but there is no indication in the premise that the speaker has any intention of making cheese or bread. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker might want to eat cheese."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Voznik je prižgal luči) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (parked across the street) is correct. The sentence ""The parking lot was empty"" implies that there were no cars parked in the designated area, so it would be unlikely for someone to have parked their car across the street from the building. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the writer had a creative block) is the correct answer. The fact that the writer did not come up with an outline suggests that she may have been experiencing a mental block or lack of inspiration, rather than simply having forgotten how to write an outline.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Prosil sem za pogovor z nadzorniku) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of the situation. The speaker has been delayed by their colleague, and they are seeking a way to resolve the issue. Asking for a meeting with the supervisor seems like an appropriate step towards resolving the problem. Option B (Dal sem jim svojo identifikacijsko številko) does not fit well with the context as there is no indication that providing one's identification number would help resolve the issue.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the bell rang than that the birds flew away. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: The bell rang.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Odklopil sem svetilko) is the correct answer. The sentence ""V moji hiši je zmanjkalo elektrike"" implies that there is a lack of electricity in the speaker's house, which could be caused by turning off a light switch. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zgrabil je mišice pred ogledalom) is the more likely cause of the problem. The premise suggests that something has grabbed or pulled the muscles in front of the mirror, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as sudden movement or injury. Option B (Dvignil je palico nad glavo) does not provide any context or explanation for why the muscles would be affected, making it less likely as a cause.

"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Zdrla sem vlažno spužvo,"" it is more likely that option A - ""Vzel je vodo"" (He took water) is correct. The word ""vlažno"" in the premise suggests that something wet or damp was involved, which fits better with the idea of someone taking water than water flying away from a sponge."
"Response:  Option A: -V hotelu je bilo polno.  
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there were many passengers on the ferry because the hotel was full. This implies that a large number of people had arrived at the resort by other means, such as car or bus, and were now checking into their hotels. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Strah jo je bilo igel) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in this premise suggest that it is a more common or everyday situation, whereas option B (Hotela se je upreti) seems less plausible in this context.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Postala sem sumljiva"". This is because the speaker has already become suspicious of the car's presence and is now feeling uneasy about it, rather than immediately calling the police."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Celo noč je bila budna) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman had an eye mask under her eyes than Option B (Sojoga je dala spat). This is because the phrase ""under her eyes"" suggests that the object was placed there deliberately or accidentally while she was awake, rather than being put there by someone else while she was asleep."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vulkan je izbruhnil) is more likely. The sentence implies that lava was flowing out of a volcano, indicating an eruption had occurred. This is supported by the fact that volcanic eruptions are known to produce molten rock, or lava. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Knew everything at the party) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that the subject had a good understanding of what was happening at the party, implying that they were familiar with all aspects of it.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izpljunil sem mleko,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mleko je bilo kislo"" (The milk was sour) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""izpljunil"" in Slovenian means to spit out or vomit, implying that something unpleasant has happened to the speaker's mouth after consuming milk. The fact that the speaker spat out the milk suggests that it may have had an unpleasant taste or texture, such as being sour. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Zamudila sem v službo) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker missed the bus while going to work.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tovornjak se je zbil z avtom,"" option B is more likely. The word ""razbit"" means ""broken"" in English, so it's likely that the car was damaged in the collision with the toad."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zmagali so) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Obrnila sem steklenico) is a more plausible explanation for why Vodnik's spell didn't work. The phrase ""zašepetal"" suggests that something was covering or blocking the spell, rather than simply turning it off. It makes more sense that the obstruction would be a physical object like a glass, rather than an abstract concept like a ""pokrovček."" Therefore, option A is the better choice."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zvonilo je zvonilo,"" option A (the visitor knocked on the door) is more likely."

"Response:  Option B - Dekle je izpljunilo zobno pasto.
Explanation: According to the premise, dekle (the girl) has been feeling a strain in her cheek due to sucking on a toothbrush. This suggests that she may have been using too much force while brushing her teeth, leading to discomfort or pain in her cheek. It is less likely that the toothpaste itself would be ""squirted"" out of the tube, as this would require some kind of pressure or force from within the tube. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Option A: Pacifists are organizing a protest. 
Explanation: The passage states that civil deaths due to war have increased, indicating a negative impact of war on civilians. Given this context, it is more likely that pacifists would organize a protest to raise awareness about the issue rather than having a parade."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dekle je iztrglo trak iz las."", option A is more likely. The word ""iztrglo"" in Slovene means ""to pull out"", so it's more likely that the girl pulled the thread out of her hair rather than the thread being a child."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Stara se je) is more likely.

"Response:  Option B: Padel je s lestve. 
Explanation: According to the premise, človek (man) has lost balance on the scale. This means that he has fallen off the scale, rather than simply wobbling or leaning unsteadily on it. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otrok je bruhal,"" it is more likely that he vomited ( Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Vzel ježolček sode."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Hladni zrak je prišel skozi okno."", option A is the correct answer as it implies that something has entered through a window, which is more likely to be cold air than hot air."
"Response:

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Živel je zraven njega) is more likely. The phrase ""norčevalo iz fanta"" suggests that something or someone has been living near him, implying a close proximity. Option B (Zaljubljena je bila vanj) implies infatuation from afar, which does not fit with the context of the sentence. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for what happened to his fantasy."
"Response:  Option A: Povzdignil je sočutje.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the thief stole food from a poor man's basket. This act of stealing has increased the poor man's sympathy for the thief, as he understands that the thief may have been driven to desperation due to hunger. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I felt lonely) is more likely. The speaker mentions that they were alone with their thoughts, implying a sense of loneliness or isolation. This aligns better with the theme of feeling disconnected from others than the idea of seeking privacy in a hotel room.
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Moški mi je podal roko"", it is more likely that option A is correct, i.e., ""Roko sem mu dal"". This is because the sentence structure and word order in Slovenian are consistent with this interpretation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Umaknil sem se,"" it is more likely that option A (The fire was in the air) caused the pain. The phrase ""umaknil sem se"" suggests a sudden and intense sensation, which aligns better with the idea of an explosion or fire nearby rather than a flying Frisbee. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the pain described in the premise."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iz vinograda sem pobral paradižnik,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker picked a ripe cherry from a vineyard, implying that they were in a location where grapes are grown. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker was referring to Option A, ""Bila sta zrela."""
Response:  Option A (Svojo bivšo punco je šel na kosilo).
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Vreme se je segrelo) is a more plausible explanation for why the thermometer has risen than option A (Izpustil sem termometer). This is because the temperature outside is expected to rise during summer months, causing the thermometer to increase in temperature as well. In contrast, there is no logical reason why someone would suddenly remove their thermometer from inside. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Streha sodišča je odletela) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Njegove ocene so se izboljšale."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I knelt down on the floor) is a more likely cause than option B (I got dressed). The premise mentions feeling comfortable, which suggests that the action of kneeling down may have contributed to this feeling. In contrast, getting dressed does not necessarily lead to feelings of comfort. Therefore, option A is the better choice as the most likely cause based on the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Njena koža se je postrala obrisalom"", it is more likely that she became pale (bleached) rather than dry (dry skin). Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: Postala je bleščeča."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kavi sem dodal sladkor,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Kava je bila sladka,"" is correct. The addition of sugar to kava would make it sweeter, not stronger or more potent. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."

The sentence ""Moški je brskal po časopisih"" implies that he was browsing through magazines, which could involve flipping through pages or tearing them.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Riba je ugriznila vrv,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ribič je vlekel ribo,"" is correct. The premise suggests that the fish has bitten the line, indicating that the fisherman is trying to catch the fish, which would require the fisherman to pull in the line. Option B, ""Ribič preoblikuje vrv,"" does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the fisherman needs to change the line."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A is more likely. The fact that he was embarrassed to go to school suggests that he did not want to go there in the first place, which means that he probably didn't have an apparatus to remove. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dober novica) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Izraz mojega obraza se je razsvetlil"" can be translated as ""My face has lit up,"" indicating a positive emotion such as excitement or joy. Therefore, option A, which translates to ""Good news,"" is the most appropriate response."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Obrisal sem si roke s brisačo,"" option A is more likely. The sentence implies that the speaker wiped their hands with a towel, which would make them moist. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Stolica se je pod njem Zamahnila) is a more plausible explanation for why človeku je izgubil ravnotežje na stolici than option B (Prelil je barvo na stol). This is because the premise suggests that something external to the person has caused them to lose balance, rather than an internal factor such as painting the chair. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's balance was disrupted by the chair moving underneath them than by any external factors related to the chair itself.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Izgubili so igro) is more likely to be the correct answer. The team has blamed each other for their loss, indicating that they are not working together effectively. This suggests that they have lost the game due to internal conflicts rather than external factors such as a bad coach.

"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Vstopil je v lok) is a more plausible explanation for why the person has bled from their foot than option B (Stopil je na razbito steklo). This is because the phrase ""prebodel nego"" suggests that the injury occurred suddenly or unexpectedly, rather than as a result of a gradual process like breaking glass. Therefore, it is more likely that the person's foot was stepped on or hit something hard, causing the bleeding, rather than them accidentally cutting themselves on broken glass."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Odkrili so identiteto morilca) is more likely. The detectives have found the fingerprints of a known criminal at the crime scene, indicating that they have identified the murderer.
"Response:  Option B: Prosil sem za prevoz. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Na avtocesti je bilo veliko prometa"" implies that there was a lot of traffic on the highway, making it difficult to drive through. Therefore, option B, ""Prosil sem za prevoz,"" which means ""I asked for transportation,"" is more likely as the speaker would want to find an alternative way to travel due to the heavy traffic."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Veliko ljudi je bilo brezposelnih) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Skoraj sta se spravila v nasproti prihajajoče promet) is more likely. The premise suggests that the car almost collided with children who were crossing the street from the opposite sidewalk, indicating a high risk of accident. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for how the situation unfolded.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Resnica mi je povedal) is more likely as it provides a straightforward explanation for why the speaker turned to their friend. The use of the word ""resnica"" also implies that the friend was being truthful or reliable in their statement, which supports this answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Avtu je zmanjkalo bencina,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Voznik je ostal na cesti,"" occurred. This is because if there was no fuel left in the car, it would not be able to move or drive away from its current location. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the premise provided."
"Response: 
Option B: Ženska je imela jutranjo slabost.  
Explanation: The premise ""Ženska je počela roditi"" implies that a woman has started to give birth, which means she is experiencing labor pains. Option B better fits this context as it suggests that the woman is experiencing morning sickness, which is a common symptom during pregnancy. Option A does not make sense in this scenario as there is no indication of a baby being born."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moški klobuk je odletel."", option A (Slekel je klobuk) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prejela je povabilo) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegova mama mu je merila temperaturo) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A (Hotel has made an impression).
Explanation: The sentence ""Človek se je pospršal z kolonjsko vodo"" means ""The man got wet from colon water"". This implies that the person was in a situation where they were exposed to water, possibly through no fault of their own. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the hotel has left an impression on someone, rather than the person having done something to themselves like using gel in their hair."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Iskala sem svetilko) is a more plausible explanation for why there is no electricity in the house than option B (Vzela sem lopato). This is because turning off a light switch or flipping a circuit breaker is a common solution to address power outages, while using a shovel to dig up underground cables may not be practical or effective in this situation. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Sin je diplomiral) is the cause of the family moving into a larger house. The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it can be inferred from the context that the family's move may have been motivated by the son's graduation and the need for a larger living space to accommodate him.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hotel was stingy with energy) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the marathon runner's pace slowed down significantly during the race.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the machine burst into flames) is more likely to be the cause of the problem. The phrase ""fant je brcnil avtomatsko napravo"" suggests that there was an explosion or fire caused by a malfunction in the automatic device. Option B (""Vreča čipsa je bila obtičala"") does not provide any information about the cause of the problem and seems unrelated to the context. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Z očmi sem ga gledal) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (Napisal je dolg) is the correct answer. This is because the narrative states that the applicant's credit card was rejected, indicating that they may have accumulated debt or had difficulty paying their bills in the past. It is unlikely that they would have paid cash for the purchase if they did not have enough money in their account.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Človek je preklet,"" option A is more likely. The word ""preklet"" means cursed or damned in English, so it suggests that something supernatural or unfortunate has happened to the person. Option B does not fit with this meaning as it implies that the person has simply fallen asleep, which is a mundane and natural occurrence. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegov brat se je sprl z njihovimi starši) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the pride of the speaker's brother.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Gledal je zvezd) is more likely. The premise mentions wanting to learn more about the sun's system, which suggests that the character is interested in astronomy and stargazing. Therefore, it is more likely that the character will choose option B, which involves gazing at stars.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Postavil sem plakat nad vrata) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker attached the poster to a door rather than applying adhesive to its back.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Arhitekt je prilagodil načrte) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Roka mu je trčala) is a more plausible explanation for why človek has lost his glasses than option B (Polizal je žlico). The phrase ""trčala roka"" means ""slapped wrist,"" but it can also be used to describe an accident or mishap that causes something to fall off or break. Therefore, it's possible that človek may have accidentally slapped his wrist while holding onto his glasses, causing them to fall off and get lost."
"Response: 
Option B: Upravni odbor je našel zmenjavo."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sedel sem v zadnji vrsti) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Napadel je sodkajšnjega zapornika) is more likely. The premise states that the man was released from prison, implying that he may have taken violent action to secure his release. Option A (His family paid the fine) does not align with this interpretation of the premise.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kontejner je bil recikliran) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Naučila se je komunicirati) is more likely. The premise states that she has joined a team for discussions, indicating that communication skills are important for her role.

"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they had a garage sale (Option B). The phrase ""si je postavila cilj"" implies that the organization set a goal for itself, which suggests that they are actively working towards raising money rather than simply providing shelter to homeless people without any intention of fundraising. Additionally, the mention of a ""dražba"" specifically refers to an auction or sale, which further supports Option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Potniki so kričali) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ko sem odhajal, sem preveril nabiralnik) is more likely to be the correct answer as it implies that the speaker left their house to check the fridge, which is a common household appliance used for storing food. Option B (Ko sem zapustila hišo, sem zaklenila vrata) does not provide any context or reason why the speaker would leave their house, making it less likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moški je hotel gledati vzhod sonca"", it is more likely that he went towards the east (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zložil sem papir,"" option A (Reciklirala sem papir) is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Voditelji drugih držav so poslali nujno pomoč."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fantova oblačila so bila mokra"", option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something wet (oblačila) was present in a location (bazen), which implies that someone or something entered the pool from outside. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the pool water is dirty."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (V knjižnico so ga morali vrniti) is more likely. The student has to return the book to the library, indicating that he borrowed it from there in the first place.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Obsojen je bil umora) is more likely. The premise states that the criminal was executed, which implies that he committed a serious crime such as murder. Option A (V ječo so ga vrgli) does not provide any information about the nature of the crime committed by the individual.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (I opened the curtains) is a more likely cause than option B (I unlocked the door). This is because the passage states that ""sončna svetloba"" (sunlight) has entered the room, indicating that the windows were open or had been recently openened. It does not mention anything about unlocking the door. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for how sunlight entered the room."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vlekel sem ga za lase,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Paruka je padla"" (The umbrella has fallen) is correct. The sentence suggests that something has fallen or been lost, which aligns better with Option A than Option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Roko pismo mu je bilo zanimivo) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why the editor changed the text in the manuscript.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ugotovila je, da je kartica izginila) is more likely. The premise states that the woman cancelled her credit card, indicating that she no longer has access to it. It is unlikely that she would have lost or misplaced the card without realizing it, especially since she had just cancelled it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the woman cannot use her credit card anymore.
"Response: 
Option B: Poročila sta se. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the two individuals got married rather than attending college together."
Response:  Option A: Zvečala sem glasnost. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fantovi lasje so se mu dvignuli,"" it is more likely that option A (Dekle ga je razburkalo) is correct. The word ""razburkalo"" means to make someone angry or upset, which aligns with the context of the sentence. Option B (""Dekle ga je potegnilo"") means to push something away, which does not fit well with the given premise. Therefore, option A is a better match for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I sprayed myself with insect repellent) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Napadalca so razbili,"" which means ""The mosquitoes were attacked."" This implies that something was done to repel or deter the mosquitoes, rather than attracting them. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker did not get bitten by mosquitoes."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Odprl sem oči"", option A is more likely. The correct answer is (A) He woke up."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prosil sem ga, naj jo izklopi) is more likely to be the correct response. This is because the speaker is asking the neighbor to turn down the music, indicating that they are being disrupted by it. Option B (Prosil sem ga, da mi posodi CD) does not fit with the context of the premise as it implies that the speaker wants the neighbor to give them a CD, rather than turning down the music.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zaslužil je manj than minimal pay) is more likely as it suggests that he did not earn enough to support his family, implying poverty.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Iščel je službo) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker has graduated from university and is now seeking a job, which aligns with the typical progression of events after completing higher education.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Barva je razpršena povsod) is more likely. When you mix red and blue paint together, it will create a brown color, not green or any other color. Therefore, the most likely outcome of mixing these two colors is that they will become muddied and spread throughout the surface.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Spremenil sem temo pogovora,"" option A is more likely. The speaker has changed the topic of conversation without warning or explanation, indicating a sudden shift in focus. This is consistent with the idea that the speaker no longer wants to talk about something."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The speaker seems to be rejecting the idea of bringing their brother back home from the hospital, indicating a negative response.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zavesa na odru se je dvignila,"" option A (The introduction scene of the play has started) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ugrabitelj je grozil, da bo storil kaj talcu) is more likely. The premise states that the thief was threatened with punishment if he didn't pay the fine, indicating that the thief had no choice but to comply. Option B (Ugrabitelj je zapustil talca samega) means that the thief simply left the fine without doing anything else, which doesn't align with the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Na odru se je slišalo grozno razstrelitev,"" option A is more likely. The word ""razstrelitev"" suggests a loud, explosive sound, which could be caused by someone kicking or stomping their foot. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The fact that the child woke up crying suggests that he or she was distressed or uncomfortable in some way, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as a nightmare or discomfort in their sleeping environment. It is less likely that the child would be afraid of looking under the bed if they are already feeling scared or upset for another reason.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prematurely was born) is a more plausible explanation for why she can speak sign language than option B (Was born deaf). This is because prematurity has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive delays and developmental disabilities, including speech and language difficulties. Therefore, it is more likely that the woman's ability to communicate through sign language may be due to her premature birth rather than being born deaf.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Voda je postala kontaminirana) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mačka je lovila ptico"", it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Ptica je odletela"". This is because cats are predators of birds, so if a cat is chasing a bird, it is likely that the bird will fly away to escape."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the school has moved to summer) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Zaposleni so began stavkating) is more likely. The reason for this is that the word ""stavki"" implies a form of protest or dissatisfaction among the employees, which aligns with their decision to go on strike. In contrast, ""imenovan novega upravitelja"" simply means ""named a new manager,"" which does not necessarily indicate any negative reaction from the employees. Therefore, option B better fits the context provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the extremists have influenced Vodja rather than killed him. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Na plaži sem hodil bos,"" option A is more likely. The word ""pešček"" means sand, and it's unlikely that waves would attach themselves to someone's legs while they are walking on a beach. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Nosila sem telovnike) is correct. The premise states that the speaker woke up feeling cold, so they probably put on warm clothes to keep themselves warm.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njen sin se je nasmehnal) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zaklenil sem hlače) is a more plausible cause than option B (-Skočila sem se na pločnik). The sentence ""Luknjo v mojih kavbojkach"" suggests that something has happened to my boots, and the word ""zaklenil"" means ""to close"". Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's boots have closed or tightened for some reason rather than the speaker having jumped onto a bench."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he drilled a hole) is more likely. The sentence structure and vocabulary suggest that the speaker is describing an action that resulted in a physical change to the surface of something, rather than a supernatural or magical transformation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zbudila sem se z bolečimi mišicami) is more likely. The sentence ""Včeraj sem vadil v telovadnici"" implies that the speaker has been exercising or engaging in physical activity, which can cause muscle soreness or fatigue. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will experience muscle pain than a sore throat."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The other students are likely to feel left out or excluded when they are not included in a group activity like kosiling. This could lead to feelings of isolation or disconnection from their peers, which would be detrimental to their social development and well-being. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otrok je pristal na trampolini,"" option A is more likely. The word ""spet"" in Slovenian means ""again"", so it's likely that the child landed safely on the trampoline after previously attempting a jump. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the child was planning to perform a flip."
"Response:  Option B: Pošta je pospešila pismo.  
Explanation: The premise states that the letter was delivered to the post office box without a stamp. This implies that the letter was sent by mail, rather than hand-delivered or emailed. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer, as it suggests that the post office processed and delivered the letter, rather than option A, which would imply that the letter was simply handed over to the post office without being processed."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Stavil je ves svoj denar) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gozdni požar se je razširil,"" option A (Veter je postal močnejši) is the most likely cause of the fire spreading. Therefore, the answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otrok si je odril koleno,"" it is more likely that Option B (Njegova mama je zavila rano) occurred. The phrase ""odril koleno"" suggests that something sudden and unexpected happened to the child's leg, which could be caused by a fall or injury. It is less likely that his mother would send him to his room as punishment for breaking his collarbone."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (podpisal je oporoko) is more likely as a cause for why Moski has survived his terminal illness. The premise does not provide any information to suggest that he received an organ transplant. Therefore, it is more plausible that he created a will before his death.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vzel sem požirek vroče kave,"" it is more likely that I (the speaker) have burned my tongue on hot coffee than that I have cut off my own tongue. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: Zažgal sem si jezik."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Pisatelj je Zamudil pomemben rok) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the editor fired the writer without giving him another chance to prove himself.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the speaker felt exhausted due to Option A - ""Ves dan sem spal."" This is because the phrase ""počutil sem se izčrpan"" suggests a general feeling of exhaustion or fatigue, which could be caused by not getting enough sleep. The second option, ""Ves dan sem se učila,"" does not provide any specific evidence for why the speaker might feel exhausted, and therefore seems less plausible as the cause of their feelings."
Response:  Based on the given information in the passage, option A (Ona je prepoznala pacientove simptome) is more likely the correct answer because it states that the doctor recognized the patient's symptoms, indicating that she was able to diagnose the problem. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Poškrabala sem si kožo,"" option A (Bila jeprepotena) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (lost his pulse) is the correct answer. The statement ""Moški je bil nujno operiran"" implies that he was in a critical condition and needed immediate surgery to save his life. Losing one's pulse (izgubil ježivce) can be a sign of cardiac arrest or other serious medical conditions, making this option more plausible than option B (had a heart attack)."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zgrabil je roke) is the more likely cause of the absence of fingers from the left hand. This is because the premise states that the fingers were ""izpuščenih,"" which implies a deliberate action of grabbing or taking something away, rather than simply losing them due to an accident or natural occurrence. Therefore, it is more likely that someone intentionally took the fingers away rather than they being lost through some other means."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mož je dvignil obrvi,"" it is more likely that he was surprised (option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Oprostite za napako mojeg kolega,"" option A is more likely. The speaker believes their colleague had good intentions, indicating a genuine mistake rather than malice."
"Response: 
Option B: Zjutraj se je začel zbujati."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The woman struck the attacker in the nose, which could cause him to bleed heavily. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ni ciljal) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""ciljal"" means ""target"", so it is unlikely that Šipka missed her target intentionally. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (V svoji sobi je imel mravlje) is more likely. The phrase ""v svoji sobi"" suggests that the speaker is referring to something inside their own home, rather than outside in a garden or field. Additionally, the mention of ""mravlje"" specifically refers to insects that are commonly found indoors, such as ants or termites, rather than outdoor pests like rodents. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker found ants or other small insects inside their house rather than rodents."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Preveč sem bila utrujena, da bi kaj pripravila) is more likely as it better fits with the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Začela je skrivati dnevnik) is more likely. The protagonist's reaction to finding her brother reading her diary suggests that she values privacy and personal space in relation to her diary entries. Therefore, it is more likely that she would resort to hiding her diary rather than starting a new one.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that she worked overtime (Option A). This is because there was a shortage of money for rent, indicating that she may have been working extra hours to earn more income.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otrokova roka se je hitro umaknila,"" option A is more likely. The fact that her hand has quickly withdrawn suggests that she may have touched something hot, such as a stove or oven, which would be consistent with Option A."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Nove stranke so ponudili popust) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the idea of trying to increase customer satisfaction by offering a discount. This approach is more practical and feasible for a company looking to improve its reputation through customer feedback.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Fant jevrgl blazine s kavča) is a more plausible explanation for why there are cracks in the floor than option B (Fant je potegnil stol čez tla). The word ""kavč"" means ""crack"" or ""fissure"", while ""stol"" means ""table"". Therefore, it is more likely that the floor cracked due to some external force, such as the table being pushed too hard against it, rather than the table itself moving across the floor."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zaščitil sem se obraz,"" it is more likely that option A (Moj Sovražnik me je zasmehoval) is the correct answer. The phrase ""zasmehoval"" means to laugh at or mock someone, which aligns with the context of being hit in the face. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker's face was protected."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Slavni kip je zgorel,"" it is more likely that he was hit by a stray bullet (Option A). The phrase ""zgorel"" suggests a sudden and unexpected event, which aligns better with the idea of a stray bullet than people coming to pay their respects (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""muhe so sepreplavile"" means ""moths have covered"" or ""moths are covering,"" indicating that the moths are laying eggs on the plants. This suggests that the effect of the moths' presence is more likely to be a greater number of eggs being laid on the plants, rather than the seed falling off the plant. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kazala je z prsti) is more likely. The sentence implies that Balerina's hair was torn apart by her own fingers, which suggests a deliberate action rather than an accidental one. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Naučil se jih je vezati) is more likely. The premise states that the girl has learned how to tie her shoes, indicating that she has acquired a new skill or ability. This suggests that she has put in effort and time to learn this task, making it unlikely that she simply ""tekel"" (ran) around the playground without any deliberate action. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Knjigo sem vrnil) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Mož's beliefs were influenced by his parents than that they left him. The passage states that Mož had similar beliefs to his parents, indicating that he was raised with their beliefs and values. This suggests that he was heavily influenced by them and adopted their views as his own. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there was a problem with the fuel (Option A). The phrase ""Avto je postopoma upočasnil"" suggests that the car slowed down gradually, indicating that the driver may have noticed something wrong with the vehicle's performance. Additionally, the fact that the car eventually came to a stop implies that the issue was not just a temporary lack of attention from the driver but rather a persistent problem. Option B, ""Voznik je zaspal,"" does not fit this scenario as it would result in a sudden loss of power instead of a gradual decrease in speed."
"Response:  Option B: Led je kapil iz stožca.  
Explanation: According to the premise, človek (man) ate ice cream in the sun. This is unlikely as eating ice cream in direct sunlight would cause it to melt quickly. Therefore, option B, ""Led je kapil iz stožca"" (The ice cream has melted out of the cone), is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""V sobi sem obesil umetnine,"" option A (Preproga je bila umazana) is the more likely cause. The word ""umetnine"" in this context suggests that something was taken or removed from someone's body, which aligns with the idea of pregnancy being lost or aborted. Option B (""Zidovi so bili goli"") does not fit as well with the given premise, as it means ""The walls were bare."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zgodaj sem odšel,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something happened to the speaker's head, which could be a physical injury or illness. Option B does not provide any context that would suggest why the speaker's boss had a meeting."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that lastnik (the owner) gave the kužek (a piece of bread) to a stray cat (lastnik). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Prijatelj je postal besen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nosil je nahrbtnik) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Obtožen je bil krive priče."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ženska si je pobarvala lase,"" it is more likely that Option A (Hotela je nov videz) is correct. The word ""pobarvala"" means to wash or bathe in English, so it is possible that she has changed her appearance by washing or bathing herself. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the woman looks different than before."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they were deported (Option B). The phrase ""ulovljeni v državi"" suggests that they were caught or arrested by the authorities in the country, which would imply that they were subject to deportation proceedings rather than finding employment."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that občinstvo will vstal (Option B). The phrase ""javni govornik je naredil šalo"" suggests that something unexpected or humorous has happened, which could cause a reaction of surprise or amusement from the audience. It is less likely that they would simply smile or laugh, as this would not be enough to make them stand up. Therefore, Option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sonce me je oslepila) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker's vision has been impaired by the sun, rather than their skin being burned.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that I felt bored (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nož je bil neumen) is more likely. The word ""neumen"" means ""dull"", so it's possible that the knife was dull and unable to cut through the zrezek easily."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zbralo se ji je ogromno dolgov) is more likely as it suggests that she has accumulated a large debt, which could lead to financial difficulties and eventually bankruptcy.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zanima me, če je zunaj) is more likely to be the correct response. The speaker is expressing curiosity about whether or not their friend's lights are burning outside, indicating that they are interested in knowing if anything unusual is happening outside of their own home. Option B (Odločila sem se, da ga obiščem) does not fit with this context as it implies that the speaker has already decided to visit their friend's house, which is not supported by the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cvet sem si dal pod nos"" (The flower has fallen from its stem), option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something has happened to the flower, such as it falling off its stem, rather than a scent being emitted by the flower. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Naletela je na prijatelja iz otroštva) is more likely as it suggests that the woman has a personal connection with her childhood friend, which could be the source of her nostalgia.
Response:  Option A: Predčasno je poslal članek.
Response:  Option B: Poklical sem mehanika.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (it was anonymous) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Vznesla se je navzgor.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Ptica je Zamahnil krili"", it is more likely that she will fly upwards rather than lay eggs."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Garaža je bila odprta) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there are no cars in the garage. Option B (Garaža je bila polna) does not provide any logical explanation for this situation. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Žrtev je dvignila roke) is more likely. The fact that the victim has raised their hands suggests that they are trying to protect themselves or defend against the attacker, rather than simply standing still as a target. Option A (Zločinec je odložil pištolo) does not provide any information about the actions of the perpetrator and therefore cannot be used to determine the likelihood of the outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Načrtoval sem obiskati stričev pogreb) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence suggests that the speaker had planned to attend a funeral of their grandfather, which implies a sense of obligation or responsibility towards the event. On the other hand, option B (Na poroku prijatelja sem se nameravala udeležiti) does not convey the same level of commitment or importance as attending a funeral. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sanjal sem) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of the past tense in ""Izgubil sem občutek za čas"" suggests that the speaker has lost their sense of time at some point in the past, rather than it being a current state for them. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given context."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the tray of toner cartridges was empty (option B) rather than the printer running out of black ink (option A). This is because the passage states that ""the print quality had deteriorated significantly"" and ""the documents were barely legible,"" indicating that there was a problem with the printing process itself rather than just a lack of ink or toner."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Obozevalci so se obrnili k zastavi) is more likely. The text states that the fans sang their national anthem at the stadium, indicating that they turned towards the flag to sing it. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jaz sem ga postregla) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Brisača je absorbirala tekočino) is more likely. The premise states that a piece of paper has been soaked in water, indicating that some amount of liquid has been absorbed by the paper. This suggests that the paper has taken in some amount of water, rather than leaving behind sticky residue as Option B implies. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: Knjogo je prebrala znova.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it's more likely that she read the book again than someone interrupted her while reading it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (človek je pogledal skozi okno) is more likely because it does not require any physical action or movement from the man to cause the turbulence in the plane. The other option, Option A (moški je zategnil pas), would require some kind of intentional action from the man to create a disturbance in the airplane.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fant se je zatreskal,"" option A (Decka him ignored) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Amputated her leg) is the more likely cause. The text states that the doctors gave the patient an artificial leg, indicating that they had to amputate one of her legs for some reason. This supports Option A as the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fant je stisnil dekle v komolček,"" it is more likely that she grabbed him (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cenil sem njegovo mnenje) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker seems to disagree with their friend's opinion, indicating that they do not share the same viewpoint. Therefore, option A best fits the context of the sentence.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fant je stopil v blato,"" option A is more likely. The word ""blato"" typically refers to a wet or muddy area, so it's unlikely that someone would get stuck in their own feet. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""V mestu je padlo nekaj centimetrov snoga,"" it is more likely that option A (šole so zaprte) will occur. The snowfall is a natural occurrence that can disrupt daily activities, including school schedules. Therefore, it is plausible that schools would be closed due to the weather conditions. Option B (ludje so se skrivali pod zemljo) is less likely as there is no indication in the premise that people are hiding underground."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Grozil je, da bo dal odpoved) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Drevo je padlo na streho) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Drevo je poškodovalo hišo"" implies that something has fallen onto or hit the house, and since a tree falling on the roof would likely cause significant damage to the structure of the house, this option seems more plausible than option B (Drevo je senčilo dvorišče), which simply means that the tree casts a shadow over the courtyard."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Les se je razpolovil,"" option A is more likely. The word ""razpolovil"" means to scatter or spread something, so it's unlikely that the speaker hit a tree with a hammer (option B). Instead, it's more likely that the speaker scattered something (such as firewood) in the direction of the tree."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Par je napovedal, da se ločuje) is the correct answer. The fact that the family is celebrating a couple suggests that they are happy together, and therefore it is unlikely that the husband has announced his intention to divorce his wife.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Všeč mu je bil) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was not attracted to him (Option A). The sentence ""Zmedena sem bila"" means ""I wasn't interested in him"", indicating that she did not find him appealing or attractive. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They wanted to find a compromise) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mož je odložil hrano v hladilnik) is more likely. The phrase ""Časovnik v kuhinji je ugasnil"" implies that something has happened to stop or pause time in the kitchen, rather than indicating that food has been removed from a hot surface. Therefore, it is more likely that the man has put the food in the fridge rather than taking it out of the oven."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (pomirila se) is a more likely outcome than option B (trdo dela). This is because the phrase ""postavila ambiciozen cilj"" suggests that she has set a challenging goal for herself, but then ""pomirila se"" means to calm or soothe oneself, indicating that she may be feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about achieving her goal. Therefore, it is more likely that she will feel discouraged or doubtful about her ability to reach her target rather than working hard to achieve it."
"Response:  Option B: Njegov sin je podedoval njegovo bogastvo.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Bogataš has died due to old age. This means that his son has inherited his wealth, making option B the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the flames have been extinguished (Option A). The phrase ""stopila na plamene"" implies that something has been placed on or near the flames, which could potentially smother them and cause them to go out. There is no indication in the premise that the flames would rise upwards or produce smoke, which suggests that Option B is less likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vozniško dovoljenje so ji odvzeli) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman's car was in the service.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (prepared breakfast) is correct. The sentence ""Prebudil sem se"" means ""I prepared breakfast for myself"", so the speaker has indeed prepared something to eat in the morning. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that cameras were filming him (Option A). The fact that he ""stopped out of a limousine"" suggests that he was in a public setting where there may have been security cameras or other observers nearby. It is less likely that his family would be at a press conference for no apparent reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ženska je ostala v kadi"", it is more likely that she has become wet in the bath (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (pridružil se je bratstva) is more likely. The premise mentions that the student wants to get to know other students on campus, which suggests that he may be interested in socializing or joining a group of some kind. Joining a fraternity could provide an opportunity for him to meet new people and make friends. Option B (diplomiral je inženirstvo) does not necessarily relate to meeting new people or socializing, so it is less likely as an outcome from the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (I am looking for a new job) is more likely to be the correct answer as it aligns with the context of the conversation. The speaker mentions that they are looking for a new job, which suggests that they may have left their previous one recently or are planning to do so soon. This is supported by the phrase ""Dvignila sem blazine,"" which means ""I'm feeling restless."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Oša je letela proti fantu,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Fant je pobegnil,"" will occur. The word ""letela"" in Slovenian implies movement towards something or someone, so it is likely that the bird flew towards the fairy, who then fled. Option B, ""Fant je pobral rožo,"" does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of the fairy taking a rose."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Postavili so ji smrtno celo) is more likely to happen because it implies a severe punishment for the woman who has been convicted of a crime. The phrase ""smrtna celi"" specifically refers to a prison cell where prisoners are held before their execution, implying that the woman's sentence will result in her death. In contrast, Option A (""Obsojena je na delo v korist skupnosti"") suggests that she may be sentenced to work for the benefit of society, but does not imply any form of capital punishment."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zmešala sem sladkor v vroče čaj"", it is more likely that option B: Sladkor se je raztopil. This is because adding sugar to hot tea will cause it to dissolve or melt into the liquid, rather than boiling away or evaporating."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he was drafted into the military (Option A). The phrase ""v veteranskem je šepaval"" suggests that he has been talking about his experiences in the war for a long time, implying that he served in the military for some period of time. Additionally, the fact that he was injured in battle ( Option B) does not necessarily mean that he was drafted into the military, as he could have enlisted voluntarily or joined the military through other means. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Policía está buscando al delincuente) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Ne bi se vklopil,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Izgubil sem ga"" (He lost him) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Zgrabila si je obsežno garderobo) is a more plausible explanation for why there is no space left in the wardrobe because buying a large quantity of clothes would require more storage space than simply skimming off excess fat (option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Človek je bil zlomljen,"" option B is more likely. The fact that he was broken suggests that something has happened to him, and the most likely explanation for this is that his wife left him, rather than that she gave birth to a child."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Njegova ponudba za službo je bila preklicana) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A ( Pozdravil je občinstvo) is more likely. The sentence implies that his voice was clearly heard throughout the hall, indicating that he spoke loudly enough for everyone to hear him. It's unlikely that he would have spoken into a microphone if his voice could be heard so clearly by everyone in the room.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the denar (kovanec) sank to the bottom of the well rather than breaking apart. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Žoga ješla v luknjo) is more likely to occur. The wording of the premise suggests that the ball hit the hole directly, so it is unlikely for the ball to return to the player. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A: Imam škak. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Na podstrešju sem vdihnil prah"" means ""I have sneezed dust on the roof."" This implies that there is a lot of dust present, which could cause irritation or discomfort. Therefore, option A, ""Imam škak,"" which means ""I have a tickle in my nose,"" is more likely to occur as a result of exposure to the dust."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the party used forged money) is the correct answer. The fact that the police were called suggests that there may have been some illegal activity involved in the transaction, such as forgery or counterfeiting, rather than a simple mistake with the lights.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zaradi smeti je kuhinja slabo dihala) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the kitchen is not functioning well. The other option does not provide any clear reason for the issue with the kitchen. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Otroci so občudovali živali) is more likely. The sentence ""Družina ješla v živalski vrt"" implies that the family went to a zoo for entertainment or educational purposes, rather than hunting animals. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: Njegove ledvice so odpovedale.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Moški je dihalo glasno,"" indicating that he has a loud cough. This suggests that his lungs are not functioning properly, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as respiratory infection or damage to the lungs. However, it does not necessarily imply that his airways are blocked, which would be indicated by ""Pljuča so bila zaprta."" Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Prijatelja sem vprašal, če bi šel) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the logical flow of conversation. The speaker would typically ask their friend if they want to go to a concert before inquiring about where the concert will take place. Therefore, option B is the more plausible response given the context provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option B: Odprl sem okna will cause a change in temperature inside the house than Option A: Prinesla sem odeje. This is because opening windows can allow cooler air to enter the house, while bringing clothes into the house will not have any direct impact on the temperature inside. Therefore, Option B is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fant ima boleče hrbtenice,"" option A is more likely. The word ""boleče"" means ""painful,"" so it's unlikely that his backpack was open ( Option B). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: His backpack was heavy."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kupil sem mami darilo,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker gave their mother a gift, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pčela je zabodla vrtnarja) is more likely. The premise states that ""Narcis v vrtu je uničen,"" indicating that something has caused damage to Narcissus' garden. Since pčelica (bee) is a common insect that can sting and cause damage, it is more likely that she was responsible for the destruction of Narcissus' garden rather than vervice (mole), who are not typically known for their ability to dig tunnels or cause significant damage."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the fire was extinguished (Option A). The phrase ""prižgal sem vžigalico"" implies that someone tried to light a match but failed, suggesting that there was no flame present. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They are not going to discuss the issue in court) is more likely. The fact that they have stopped communicating suggests that they are not interested in resolving their differences through dialogue or negotiation. Instead, they may be preparing for a legal battle.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otroke so poslali v sirotišnico,"" it is more likely that option A (starši so umrli) is the correct answer. The phrase ""so poslali"" implies a past action, suggesting that the children were sent to the orphanage after their parents had passed away."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Came a tsunami) is more likely. The meteorite falling into the ocean would cause a massive wave to form, known as a tsunami. This is a more plausible explanation than the meteorite starting to fall from the sky, as meteors do not typically enter Earth's atmosphere before impacting the surface.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she was in a state of dehydration (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Vklopil sem pečico) is a more plausible explanation for why the oven became hotter than option B (V pečico sem dal posodo). This is because the former implies direct contact with the oven's surface, while the latter only involves placing something inside the oven without directly interacting with it. Therefore, option A is the better choice to explain how the oven became hotter.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iztisnil sem kljun limone,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Limona je postala plesniva"" (Lemon has become slippery) is correct. The word ""iztisnil"" in Slovenian means ""slipped"", so it makes sense that the lemon would have become slippery rather than having been covered in a sticky substance like honey."
"Response: 
Option B: Država je kolonizirala deželo. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Država je odkrila novu zeland,"" it is more likely that Država has colonized a new land rather than leaving it. The term ""odkriti"" in Croatian means to discover or explore something new, indicating that Država has found a previously unknown territory. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Raztrgal se je po tleh) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""se je podrl s mize"" suggests that something has fallen or collapsed, which could result in debris scattered across the floor. This is consistent with Option A, which implies that Kozarček has fallen onto the ground. On the other hand, Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of how Kozarček ended up on a washing machine."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Miza se je Zamahnila,"" option A (Tla so bile neenakomerna) is a more likely cause for her to have gotten lost. The word ""neenakomerna"" means uneven or unbalanced, suggesting that something in her surroundings may have caused her to lose her balance and become disoriented. Option B (Tla so bile drsna), on the other hand, means that she was sleepy, which does not seem to be a plausible reason for getting lost in a forest. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Oče je ujel sina, ko je lagal,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""lagal"" implies that the son was lying, so it's unlikely that he would have confessed to his father. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Vzel je aspirin. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Možakova glava was suffering from pain. Aspirin is a common medication used to relieve headaches and other types of pain, making it the more likely option. Sirup proti kašlju (syrup for cough) would not be effective in treating pain."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vlak je upočasnil,"" it is more likely that Option A: Približala se je postaji (The train slowed down) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Moski has a psychiatric disorder due to his family history of mental illness (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ženska se je zgrabila za vrat,"" it is more likely that she grabbed onto something (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Pojele je hrano."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njen glas je bil razburjen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Slinilo se je) is more likely to be correct. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that something has been spilled or poured onto a table, rather than someone having stood up.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (ODPUSTILA JE SVOJE ZAPOSLENE) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zvonilo je zvonilo) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the students to have left class without permission.
"Response: 
Option B: Njeni znanci so povezani z njo.  
Explanation: The passage states that ""njeni znanci so bili skeptični,"" indicating that they were not convinced by her claim of seeing a ghost. This suggests that she did not have many supporters or people who believed her story, which makes option B (her friends are connected to her) less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Človek je izgubil sluh,"" it is more likely that he almost drowned in the sea (Option A). The phrase ""izgubil sluh"" suggests a loss of hearing, which could be caused by exposure to water or other liquids. It is less likely that he would have been injured from an explosion (Option B) given the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otrok je spustil vrv za balon,"" it is more likely that option B will occur - the balloon will rise into the air. This is because the act of releasing a rope attached to a balloon would cause the balloon to lift off the ground. Option A (the balloon will deflate) does not align with the given premise as there is no mention of the balloon losing air."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Imel had a cap) is more likely as it provides an explanation for why the person lost their ability to speak. The other option, Option B (Globoko was deeply inhaled), does not provide any logical reasoning or evidence to support the claim that the person's speech loss is caused by this action. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (V betonu byla razpoka) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker saw something in the concrete (beton). Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened to the woman who stopped at the pedestrian crossing.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Moški je namočil reševalca) is more likely to occur. The reason being that a person throwing a rubber ring into a pool would likely cause splashes or ripples in the water, but it's unlikely for the rescuer to jump after them without any noticeable reaction from the water. Therefore, option B better fits the given scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Antibiotika sem jemala,"" it is more likely that option A (My infection has disappeared) is correct."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Voznik has pressed the switch) is more likely. The premise states that ""Prometna luč je postala rumena,"" indicating that something has caused the traffic light to turn red. Pressing the switch would be a more plausible explanation for this than simply turning off the power. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (V posodu sem namočil toplo vodo) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the plastic container might have melted. Option B (Posodo sem postavil na vroči štedilnik) does not provide any obvious reason for why the container would melt.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Avto je bil vdolben,"" option A is the most likely cause - the driver hit a phone pole."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fant je študiral vso noč,"" it is more likely that he skipped the exam (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Bal se je naučil plavati) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the boy was able to hold his breath underwater.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Čutila sem utrip srca) is more likely. The sentence ""Roko sem prijela na prsi"" implies that something has happened to Roko's heart, causing her to feel a rapid or strong beating sensation. This suggests that the effect of the situation on Roko's heart rate is more likely to be an increase in heart rate rather than a slowing down of it. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Moja pisarna je bila glasna) is more likely. The fact that there were many people in the building near my office suggests that it was noisy, as there would be a lot of foot traffic and conversation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Družina je povabila sosede na večerjo) is more likely. The family wants to get to know their new neighbors better by inviting them over for dinner. This suggests that they are interested in building a positive relationship with them. Option B (Družina je na dvorišču pomahala sosedom) does not align with this goal as it implies that the family is simply bothering or annoying their neighbors without any clear intention of getting to know them better.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Voda je šprickala iz bazena"", it is more likely that option A (the swimmer jumped into the pool) caused the water to splash out of the pool. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ugriznil sem v kos lubenice,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ugriznil"" means to bite or chew, so it's likely that the speaker accidentally bit into a piece of bread or something else edible rather than injuring themselves with a tool."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Jacket's jacket was removed (Option A). The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it suggests that something external to Jacket caused his removal from the tree, rather than any internal factor such as him being blown away by the wind (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zamudila jo je hrup) is more likely as a cause for the woman's ears to be plugged. The premise suggests that there was a loud noise that caused her ears to become clogged, rather than any physical damage to her ears.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Vso vodo sem spil) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Napolnil sem steklenico"" implies that he filled a glass with water, while ""V hladilniku sem ga imel"" means that he had him in the fridge. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the man could have caused the water to freeze."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (V njem je bilo vulgarnih besed) is more likely to be the reason for the censorship of the television show. The mention of ""vulgar words"" suggests that the content was inappropriate or offensive, rather than having a complex plot."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ladja je strmoglavljena,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Posadka se je utopila,"" is correct. The wording of the premise suggests that something has gone wrong with the ship, leading to a catastrophic outcome for those on board. Drowning or other accidents at sea are more plausible than encountering pirates in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Odkril je uganko) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has discovered a puzzle or riddle rather than simply asking for an explanation.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Можак has picked up the phone (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Objel sem jo) is the correct answer. The use of the verb ""buljila"" in the premise suggests a negative emotion or feeling, which aligns with the meaning of option A. Option B (""Neprijetno mi je bilo"") does not convey the same level of negativity as option A. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 🔍 Option B: Pregledali so vse eksponate. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Skupina je zapustila muzej,"" it is more likely that they viewed all of the exhibits rather than just taking photographs of them."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (prijatelj me je podprl) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A - V pnevmatiko sem napumpal zrak. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Gume na mojem kolesu so bile prazne"" implies that the speaker's tires were empty. Since air is not a substance that can be poured into a tire, it is more likely that the speaker replaced the tire with an inflated one using compressed air from a compressor. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dekle je bilo videti bledo,"" option A is more likely. The word ""bral"" means to read in Slovenian, so it's likely that the father read a story to his daughter rather than helping her with something else."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Uporabila sem svinčnik) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""zmanjkalo"" in Slovenian means ""ran out of"", so it's possible that the speaker used a pencil instead of black ink."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He was in debt) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Imela had ovine osipe) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why she stayed home instead of going to school.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (V umivalnik sem gavrgel) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker threw the garbage into a dumpster or trash can, rather than taking it to a landfill site.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Moj sostanovalec je polil punč) is a more plausible explanation for why my car's windshield wiper doesn't work properly than option B (Moj pes se je prepuščal). This is because the former suggests that there may be an issue with the fluid level or functionality of the wipers themselves, while the latter does not provide any logical explanation for the problem. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two provided options.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Vrgel je stol čez sobo) is more likely to occur as it does not require any technical knowledge or expertise, whereas option A (Izklopil je računalnik) would require a certain level of technological proficiency.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the fire was extinguished (option B). The phrase ""vejica v ogenju"" means ""a spark in the fire,"" so if a spark had been thrown into the fire, it would be expected to continue burning rather than being extinguished. Therefore, option B is the better answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Možak je prišel iz prha,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Vroče vode ni bilo več,"" is the correct answer. This is because the premise suggests that something has come out of nothing (prho), which implies a lack of water or heat. Option B does not fit with this idea as there is no mention of finding a brisoaca in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Otroke so spodbujali, naj se igrajo zunaj) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the idea of encouraging children to engage in outdoor activities rather than saving money for school tuition.
Response:  Option A - Čevlji so se sprostili.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ostanke je Zamrznil) is more likely. The word ""pojedel"" in this context means to eat half of something, so it's unlikely that he would save the rest for later. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Option B: -Naredil sem ga z losjonom. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Moj gleženj je bil oteklen"" implies that something has happened to the speaker's glossy surface, possibly making it dull or damaged. Option B provides a plausible reason for this change by suggesting that the speaker applied a layer of varnish to the surface, which could have caused it to become dull or opaque. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I was talking to a colleague) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Usedel sem se) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""moralo sem čakati"" implies that something was expected or anticipated, but it did not happen. Therefore, the speaker may have felt disappointed or frustrated about it, leading them to say ""usedel sem se"". Option B (""Prebrskal sem revijo"") does not fit well with this context as it means ""I read a review"", which has nothing to do with the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Človek je strmel v muho,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Muha je odletela."" This is because the word ""strmel"" implies a strong force or impact, which could cause something to move or fly away. The idea of the flea staying in one place (option B) does not fit with the tone and meaning of the premise as well."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he was ill ( Option A) than that he was a widower (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Izstopil je iz tekmovanja) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given text, option B (Našel sem rešitev) is more likely. The speaker has found a solution to the problem, indicating that they have successfully overcome the difficulty. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Bil bil navdušen) is more likely. The fact that he went to see the suspension bridge suggests that he was interested in it, and therefore more likely to be excited or enthusiastic about it rather than frightened.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Z prijateljem je stavil) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has placed a bet with their friend, rather than going to watch the game together.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fant ni mogel zaspati,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""mogel"" means ""dream"" in Serbian, so it's unlikely that he woke up a sheep."
