Explanation: The phrase ""Küçük çocuk bakıcısına ağladı"" implies that the speaker is feeling sad or upset about something related to their child.

Explanation: According to the premise, Ergen was taken away from his home by a group of people who were not his family members or close friends. This suggests that he was forcibly removed from his home without any consent or agreement, which aligns with option B. Therefore, it is more likely that Ergen was taken away against his will by a group of people who wanted to keep him from returning home."
"Response:  Option A: Tuvalet taştı. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Banyoyu su bastı,"" we know that water poured onto a certain surface (banyoyu). Since there is no information about how much water was used or where it came from, it's unlikely that the water caused any significant damage like breaking something (su ısıtıcısı kırıldı) or draining completely (su çekiştirildi). Therefore, option A - ""Tuvalet taştı"" (the toilet bowl cracked) is the most likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option A (Sahibi köpeğe tasmasi) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the given premise better than option B (Sahibi köpeği tasmasından tuttu). The phrase ""yavru köpek sahibini yanında kaldı"" suggests that someone's dog has been left behind or forgotten somewhere, which could lead to the dog being hungry or thirsty. Therefore, the most likely explanation for why the dog would be whining is that it is hungry or thirsty, which aligns with option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Adam hid under a wide tree) is more likely. The phrase ""yakaladı"" suggests that Adam was hiding or seeking shelter somewhere, and a wide tree would provide adequate cover for him to hide from danger. Option B (Adam hid beneath a still pond) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of a body of water nearby. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Option B: Onunlar akşam yemeğinde buluştuk. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Onunlar akşam yemeğinde buluştuk"" suggests that they met at dinner time, implying that it was after dark when they found each other again. This makes option B the more likely choice as it implies a longer period of separation between them."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the dogs have run away (Option A). The phrase ""aradı"" in Turkish implies a search or investigation, suggesting that something has happened to prompt the search. Given the context of dogs running away, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why there is an investigation underway."
"Response:  Option B: Göğsüm sıkışmış hissettim. 
Explanation: The premise ""Nefes verirken nefesimi gördüm"" suggests that the speaker saw their breath while inhaling. This implies that the air was cold enough to produce condensation, or fog-like substance, around their nose and mouth. Therefore, option B, ""Göğsüm sıkışmış hissettim,"" which means ""My throat got stuck,"" is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's breath appeared as if it were fogging up around their face."
"Response:  Option B: İş verenleri onların maaşlarını yükseltti. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the reason why workers formed a union was because their employers increased their wages. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option B: O ayakkabılarını çıkarmıştı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman was struggling to walk due to her high heels. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that she had removed her shoes, making it easier for her to walk."
"Response:  Option B: Kabı kapamıştım. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""su kabından buhar yükseldi."" This implies that something heavy (buhar) came out of a container filled with water (su). Since the word ""kabı"" means ""container,"" it is more likely that the container burst or broke open rather than the water inside the container becoming heavier. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Botumu giydim.
Explanation: The word ""botum"" in Turkish means ""bottom"". Based on the premise, it is more likely that the speaker will say ""I put my bottom on all of them"", which corresponds to option B."
"Response:  Option B: O yolsuzlukla suçlandı. 
Explanation: The premise states that the politician's argument was absurd, implying that it lacked logical coherence or validity. Therefore, option B, ""O yolsuzlukla suçlandı,"" which means ""The politician was accused of being reckless"" is a more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Çift gizlice kaçtı. 
Explanation: The premise states that he has lost his wife's trust, implying that she no longer believes in him or values their relationship. This suggests that he may have done something to hurt her or betray her trust, such as cheating or lying. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it implies that he has lost his wife's love and respect due to his actions."
Response:  Option B (Milyoner binanın yapımı için katkı yaptı) is the correct answer because it aligns with the given premise better than option A (Milyoner binayı yımak istedi). The premise states that a millionaire donated money to build a school, indicating that they contributed positively towards its construction rather than simply wanting to own one.
"Response:  Option B: Satış görevlisi kıza istediği el çantasını bulmasında yardım etti. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the sales representative helped the girl find her lost purse by providing assistance in finding it. This suggests that the sales representative was actively trying to help the girl rather than simply watching as she searched for her purse. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A - Askerler savaşa gönderilindi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, there was a war between two countries, and soldiers were sent from one country to fight in the other country's territory. This implies that the soldiers were deployed as part of a military operation, rather than being evacuated or taken hostage. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Option A - Mahmeke binası önünde isyan çıktı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Mehmet has been given a deadline by his boss to finalize the project. This implies that he may be feeling pressure and stress due to the looming deadline, which could lead him to become irritable or short-tempered with his colleagues. Therefore, option A is more likely."

"Response:  Option A: Fırtına daha kötü oldu. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Yağmur yağıyordu,"" it is more likely that a storm has worsened rather than improved. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Asansör çalımayı durdurdu) is a more plausible explanation for why the fire alarm went off in the building. The fact that the elevator stopped functioning suggests that there may have been an issue with the elevator's electrical system or machinery, which could have triggered the fire alarm. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Option B: Baba oğlunu evden kovdu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Baba oğlunun alkolikliğine sinirlendi. This implies that he is experiencing negative effects of alcohol consumption, such as drunkenness or intoxication. As a result, it is more likely that his father will scold him rather than giving him a drink. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Adam's friend listened to his words) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Kasiyer kıza para üstünü verdi) is correct. The phrase ""kız parayı kasiyere verdi"" implies that someone gave money to a girl, so it makes sense that they would give her more money as a reward. Option B (""Kasiyer kıza fiş vermeyi unuttu"") does not make logical sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (O kazada felç kaldı) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""kadın tekerlekli sandalyeye"" suggests that a woman is wearing high heels, which could potentially lead to her falling or tripping if she doesn't take proper care while walking. Therefore, it is more likely that she fell due to her own clumsiness rather than someone else pushing her."
"Response:  Option B: Ülke economik zorluklarla yüzleşiyordu. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""millions of people in cities are struggling to make ends meet."" This suggests that the country is facing economic difficulties, rather than political independence. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Onlar taraftarlarına ilham oldu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Takım lost a tournament. Therefore, it is more likely that they received inspiration from their teammates rather than feeling frustrated or angry towards them."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Utanç duydum) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A (Oderse dikkati verdi)
Explanation: According to the premise, the boy was removed from the history exam because he had a high score. This implies that he performed well in the exam, indicating that option A (oderse dikkati verdi) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Suç oranları arttı. 
Explanation: The premise states that the city center has been destroyed. This could be caused by a natural disaster such as an earthquake (option A), but it is more likely that the destruction was caused by criminal activity, such as bombing or terrorism (option B). Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A (O onu geri alması için yalvardı)
Explanation: According to the premise, Adam's girlfriend left him, so it is more likely that she will try to get her back by criticizing or insulting her, rather than simply introducing her to her family. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Başları birbirine çarptı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, two children are holding hands and one of them let go. This means that both children are now separated from each other, making option B (Başları birbirine çarptı) the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Çöp kutusunun kapağı açıktı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, there was something inside the trash can that caused it to tip over. Since the lid of the trash can was open, it is more likely that something heavy or unstable inside the can caused it to tip rather than the lid being opened by an external force. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Kalem ucuzdu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""sivriltti"" implies a sudden or unexpected movement, which could potentially result in the pencil being dropped or lost. Therefore, it is more plausible that the pencil was simply dropped due to an accident rather than intentionally thrown away."
"Response:  Option B: Kıyafet uymamıştı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Kasiyer kıyafetin iadesini reddetti,"" which means that the person in question has denied the accusations made against them. This implies that they have a solid alibi or evidence to prove their innocence. Therefore, option B, ""Kıyafet uymamıştı,"" is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hızlıca iyileşti) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Derimdeki çizgi derindi"" suggests that something has been drawn or traced quickly, implying a hasty or urgent action. Option B (""O yara izi bıraktı"") implies a more deliberate and controlled action, such as covering up an existing mark or stain, which may not be as feasible in this context given the time constraint suggested by the premise. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome based on the information provided."
"Response:  Option B: O kendi kendine konuşuyordu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Adam was surprised by the strange looks he received from people. This suggests that he was not expecting such reactions from them, which implies that he was lost in thought or preoccupied with his own thoughts. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that Adam was talking to himself rather than looking at something else."
"Response:  Option B (Çocuk ekmeği bir kenara koydu).
Explanation: According to the premise, children threw stones at a dog. This implies that they were throwing objects at it, which could potentially harm or injure the animal. Therefore, option B, where the child throws an egg behind the dog, is more likely as it suggests a less violent action compared to throwing stones."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Kadının kardeşiellerini büktü) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""peçete uzattı"" suggests that something was placed or tied around the woman's sister's fingers, which could potentially cause her discomfort or pain. It is less likely that the woman's sister would start crying without any obvious reason. Therefore, option A is the better choice."

"Response:  Option B: Meslektaşı onun için örtbas edildi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman left her job to stay at home. This implies that she may have had a career or profession before, but chose to leave it to focus on domestic duties. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that she was pressured by her husband or in-laws to quit her job and prioritize household chores."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Onları deli olmakla eleştirdi) is more likely. The activists were trying to make a point by pretending to be mentally ill, rather than supporting them as suggested in option A (Onların amacını destekliyordu).
"Response:  Option B: Kendi repliğini hatırladı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Adam's heart performance was better than before. This suggests that he had practiced his response in advance, rather than simply remembering it on the spot.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Paramı saydım) is true. The sentence ""Kaybolmuştum"" implies that something has been lost or hidden, and using the word ""parami"" to indicate that you said something suggests that what was lost or hidden was a statement or idea. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."

"Response:  Option B: Motor fazla ısındı.

The phrase ""sırtını incitti"" suggests that something has happened to Adam's stomach, leading him to spend a few days in bed.

"Response:  Option B: Evin içi soğuktu (The fire inside the barrel was extinguished.)
Explanation: According to the premise, the fire in the barrel died out. This could happen if the barrel was not properly sealed or if there was an obstruction that prevented oxygen from reaching the flame. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Kadın soluklanıp enerjisini tekrar topladı. 
Explanation: The premise states that the woman stopped running after feeling dizzy. This suggests that she may have lost her balance or felt lightheaded due to a lack of energy, rather than being pushed by someone from behind. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option A: Kocası onun endişelerini yanlış anladı.

The phrase ""I had a run-in with an old friend"" implies that there was some kind of confrontation or conflict between the speaker and their old friend, which is consistent with the meaning of option B.

"Response:  Option B: O Kirlenmiş Görünüyordu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman was not seen after she went out to buy bread. This implies that she may have been abducted or kidnapped, as suggested in option B. It is less likely that she would have turned into a fish (option A) without any explanation or context provided in the premise."

"Response:  Option A: Kullanıcı fareye tıkladı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the mouse cursor moved on the screen without any input from the user. This suggests that the user did not intentionally move the cursor, but rather it moved due to some external factor such as a bug or malfunction in the computer's software. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option A (Ana yolda bir kaza olmuştu). 
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker has gone missing from a camping trip in the mountains. This implies that they were part of a group or party that was camping together.

"Response:  Option B: O taksi çağırdı. 
Explanation: The premise states that the woman opened her umbrella, indicating that it was raining or overcast outside. Option B, ""O taksi çağırdı,"" means ""She hailed a taxi,"" which further supports the idea that it was raining or overcast outside, as she would not have needed an umbrella if it were sunny. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Güzel olduğunu düşündü. 
Explanation: The premise states that Adam looked up at the sky. This implies that he was in a position to observe the beauty of the sky, suggesting that he found it pleasing or beautiful. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Bütün gece ayakta kaldım. 
Explanation: The premise ""Yorgunluktan tükenmiş hissettim"" suggests that the speaker has been feeling tired for a long time. Therefore, option B, ""Bütün gece ayakta kaldım,"" which means ""I stayed in bed all night,"" is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Adam berbere gitti,"" it is more likely that option A, ""O saçlarını uzatıyordu"" (He combed his beard) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""berbere gitti"" implies that something was done to the beard, rather than the beard simply growing or changing on its own. Therefore, the action of combing the beard is a more plausible explanation for why the beard grew long."
"Response:  Option A: Çocuk yeni sınıf arkadışını hoş karşıladı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the child was assigned a bad number in the new class, which suggests that they may have had a negative reaction to it. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Canım bir bardak süt çekti,"" it is more likely that option A (Kurabiye yiyordum) is the correct answer. This is because ""süt"" in Turkish means milk, so it is unlikely that the speaker would have eaten bread (ekmek). Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Sürücü arabayı geriye vitese aldı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Yağmur has started to walk towards the sea. This means that she will be moving away from her starting point, not towards it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Sokağın karşısına park etti) is correct. The sentence implies that there was no park in the area before, so it makes sense that the person would have created one by building a wall around an empty space. Option B (Girişin yanına park etti) does not make as much sense in this context, as it implies that the person built the park next to the entrance, which may not be practical or feasible.
"Response:  Option B: O taslağı düzenledi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the author wrote a book in prison. This means that they had access to writing materials and were able to write a book despite being imprisoned. It is unlikely that they would have been able to do so if they did not have access to these basic necessities. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B (Kimlik numarası vermedi)
Explanation: According to the premise, ""İş arkadaşım bana kafayı taktı,"" which means that my colleague took money from me without permission. This suggests that theft or fraud may have occurred, rather than a simple mistake or misunderstanding. Therefore, option B (Kimlik numarası vermedi), which implies that I did not provide my identity number, is the more likely cause of the problem."
"Response:  Option B: Perdeler titredi. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""Rüzgar açık pencereden içeri esti."" (There is a strong wind coming from outside.) This implies that there is a significant force acting upon the window, causing it to shake or tremble. As a result, it is more likely that the windows will rattle or vibrate rather than the doors opening. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I lambasted him) is a more plausible cause than option B (I sigorted him). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ayna karşısında kaslarını esnetti) is a more plausible cause for why Halter's hat fell off his head. As he was walking in front of her, it is possible that he accidentally knocked his hat against her face, causing it to fall off. Option B (Barı kafasının üzerine kaldırdı) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that Halter had any intention of removing his hat from Barı's face.
"Response:  Option B: Onun kafası karıştı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the student tried to escape from the teacher's wrath by hiding in a trash can. Therefore, it is more likely that the student's head got stuck inside the trash can rather than the teacher's anger subsiding."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bebek uykuya daldı,"" it is more likely that option A (Bbası bebeğin bezini değiştirdi) occurred. This is because the word ""uykuya"" in Turkish means ""fell asleep,"" so it suggests that the baby fell asleep due to some reason. Option B (""Babası bebeği yavaşça salladı"") does not fit with this context as it implies that the father gently placed the baby on something soft, which doesn't make sense given the premise of the baby falling asleep. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the information provided."
"Response:  Option A: Oğlan sarsıldı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl threw a ball at the boy, who then got angry (sarsıldı). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Fotoğraftaki herkes gülmeyi reddetti.

"Response:  Option B: Şehir dışındaydım. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker went back in time to their birthday party. This means that they were not present at the party originally, but rather traveled back in time to attend it. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause - the speaker was not present at the party originally, but rather traveled back in time to attend it."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Egzersiz yaptım) caused the outcome. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A - Enerjik hissettim.
"Response:  Option B: İçinden su sıztı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Islak süngeri sıktım,"" which means ""I put a hot iron in water."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer because it implies that the hot iron was submerged in water, resulting in steam rising from the surface of the water."
"Response:  Option B: Tatil yeri adadaydı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the travelers used a boat to reach their destination, implying that they traveled by sea.

"Response:  Option B: Asilik yapmak istedi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the person was afraid of being caught, which suggests that they wanted to keep their actions secretive or discreet (asilik). Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B - Polisi aradım (The police searched for him)
Explanation: The premise states that the man disappeared without a trace, which suggests that he may have been in trouble or in danger. Therefore, it is more likely that the police would be involved in searching for him rather than simply shrugging their shoulders and assuming he has gone off to find himself."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Deliller onu işaret ediyordu) is the correct cause. The phrase ""Suçlu teslim oldu"" implies that something has gone wrong or illegal has occurred, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that someone has been accused of a crime. The fact that the person's name was marked with an X suggests that they are being singled out for punishment or investigation, which aligns with the idea of Deliller marking them as guilty. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Kafeğinden kaçındı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Iri and heavy man decided to compete in weight lifting. Therefore, option B, ""Kafeğinden kaçındı,"" which means ""He disappeared from the cafe"" is the most likely outcome as it implies that the heavy man has left the cafe after their competition."
"Response:  Option A: O kaydı (She fainted).
Explanation: The premise ""Kız buza bastı"" implies that a girl fell onto something soft, such as a bed or couch. This could cause her to faint due to the sudden change in position or because she was already feeling weak or lightheaded. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B: O oğlunu yatağa koydu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, there are things in a woman's eyes that cannot be seen. This implies that the woman has something hidden or secretive in her eyes, which could refer to anything from a romantic interest to a deep emotional pain. The phrase ""O oğlunu yatağa koydu"" means ""She put her child in the bed,"" which suggests that the woman may have been hiding something important or sensitive in her eyes. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lav volkandan aktı,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Volkan patladı"" (The volcano erupted) is the correct answer. The word ""aktı"" in Turkish means ""eruption."" Therefore, the sentence implies that a volcanic eruption occurred, which supports Option A.  "
"Response:  Option B: O partiden erken ayrıldı. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Kadın ayakkabılarını giydi"" implies that the subject (the woman) took off her shoes. However, the phrase ""O partiden erken ayrıldı"" suggests that she left the party early, which is unlikely given the context of taking off one's shoes. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (O beni gişede tuttu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""gişe görevlisine ödedim"" implies that someone has assigned a task or duty to you, so it's unlikely that they would give you permission to escape from it. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the company's CEO fired him) is more likely to be the cause of the employee's termination. The phrase ""iflas etti"" suggests that the employee was let go or terminated from their job, which aligns with Option A. Therefore, the answer is (A) O şirket hissesini sattı."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Adam doktoru gitmiştir,"" option A (Doktor izinden) is the more likely cause of Adam's illness."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ev yanıyordu) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Yatak odamı pencereden terk etti"" implies that something fell from the ceiling or sky into the bedroom, which suggests that there was an object in the room at some point. Therefore, it is unlikely that the room was completely empty (option B)."
"Response:  Option B: Ellerini sabunla köpürttü. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the child's ears are plugged with wax. This can occur when earwax accumulates in the ears and blocks the Eustachian tubes, causing hearing difficulties or discomfort. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the child's symptoms."
"Response:  Option A: Süt tadı ekşiydi. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Sütü tükürdüm,"" it is more likely that süt (milk) was spilled rather than agzım (my mouth). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Option A - Kamyon hızlandı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Kamyon arabayla çarpıştı,"" which means that a car crashed into a wall. As a result of this collision, the car's speed increased (hızlandı). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: Onlar kazandı.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the group organized their own race. This means that they were in control of the event and could have potentially won or lost depending on their efforts. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Option B: Kapağı çevirip açtım. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Soda şişesi tısladı,"" which means that someone knocked over a soda can. The word ""çevirme"" in Turkish means ""to open."" Therefore, option B is the most likely answer because it implies that the person opened the can after it was knocked over, rather than simply removing its lid."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (O açık pencereden sürünerek ilerledi) is more likely. The phrase ""açık pencerede"" means ""from an open window,"" indicating that Oglan left from an open window, which suggests that he may have climbed out of the window to escape. Option B (O çatıya çıktı) does not provide any information about how Ogan escaped and seems less plausible in this context."

Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Option A - Çocuk çığlık içinde kabusundan uyandı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the children ran into their grandparents' room.

"Response:  Option A (Çocuk sırıttı) is more likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise. The word ""susturdu"" in Turkish means ""sucked,"" so it implies that something was sucked into someone's mouth. In this case, the sentence suggests that a child sucked something, which is more likely to be a pacifier than a mirror. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (I pulled the pantaloons's suspenders) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""pull"" implies a sudden and forceful action, which aligns with the idea of removing something quickly and unexpectedly. In contrast, option B (I kicked my feet against the wall) does not convey the same sense of urgency or suddenness.

Explanation: According to the premise, the other students in the dining hall got up from their tables. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Tekrar havaya uçtu) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""havada takla atmayı denemeye"" suggests that the child has fallen off a swing and is unable to get back up, indicating a negative outcome.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A - ""Postacı mektubu teslim etti."" (The sender's letter was delivered.) "
"Response:  Option B: Eve meteliksiz döndü.

"Response:  Option A - Rüzgar güçlendi. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Orman yangını yayıldı,"" there was a forest fire in the forest. This suggests that there was an increase in wind speed (rüzgar) in the area, which could have caused the fire to spread rapidly. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option A - Hastanın hastalık belirtilerini tanımladı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Doktor hastaya tanı koydu,"" which means ""The doctor told him his illness.""

Explanation: The speaker's reaction to their colleague's mistake suggests that they were not surprised or impressed by it. Instead, they seem to have expected their colleague to make mistakes like this, implying that they may have a negative view of them. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Daha erken uyanmaya başladı) is more likely. The fact that Adam woke up earlier suggests that he may have had difficulty sleeping or experienced a change in his sleep schedule, rather than simply quitting smoking cold turkey.
"Response:  Option B: Saldırgan kanamaya başladı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman's finger was pressed against the man's chest, indicating that she applied pressure or force onto his body. This could potentially cause pain or discomfort in the area, leading to swelling or redness around the wound. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dart tam isabet edemedi,"" it is more likely that option A (Adam did not get a good grade) is the correct answer. The phrase ""tam"" means ""good"" or ""well"" in Turkish, so if Adam did not get a good grade, he must have done poorly. Option B does not make sense in this context because playing a game does not directly affect one's grades."
"Response:  Option B: Odasında karınca çiftliği tutuyordu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker's wife wanted them to take care of her mother who was bedridden at home. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause as it suggests that the speaker's wife was taking care of her mother at home."

The phrase ""Kadın kirayı denk getiremedi"" suggests that the woman has been unable to forget or shake off something, which could be a traumatic event or experience.

"Response:  Option B: Köpeğin başını okşadı. 
Explanation: The premise states that the child was thrown into a hot oven. This could only happen if someone or something picked up the child and placed them in the oven, such as a person's hand or another animal like a dog. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
Response:  Option A (Yeni müşterilerine indirim teklif ettiler) is more likely to increase customer satisfaction. Explaination: Offering discounts or promotions to new customers can be a powerful way to boost their satisfaction with the company. It shows that the company values their business and is willing to offer them special deals to make them feel valued. This can lead to increased loyalty and repeat business in the future. On the other hand, sending surveys to existing customers may not have as much of an impact on their satisfaction levels, as they may already be familiar with the company's products or services and may not see the value in providing feedback.
"Response:  Option B: Genç, bir sandalyeyi zeminde sürükledi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Tahta zemin çizilmeye başladı,"" which means that something was drawn or painted on the ground.

The phrase ""Suratımı korudum"" implies that someone has written something down or taken notes about you, which suggests a more personal and intentional action compared to option B (""Rakibim bir yumruk salladı""), which simply means that someone made a salad with your name on it. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct cause of why Rakibim wrote something about you."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Üzerine yıldırım düştü) is more likely to be the cause of the famous painting being destroyed. The phrase ""Ünlü heykel yandı"" suggests that a well-known or famous painting has been damaged or destroyed, and the word ""yıldırım"" implies a sudden and violent act, such as an explosion or crash. Option B (İnsanlar ona saygı göldermek için geldiler) does not fit with this context and would imply that people gathered to show respect for the painting rather than causing its destruction."
"Response:  Option B - Meyvenin etrafını sinekler sardı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the bees have been buzzing around the tree for a while now. This means that they have had time to gather nectar from the tree's flowers, which are most likely located at its base or in its vicinity.

"Response:  Option A - Benzini bitmişti (The bus driver fell asleep)
Explanation: The premise states that Araba yavaşça durdu, indicating that the car slowed down. This suggests that the driver was tired or drowsy, which is more likely to be caused by benzini bitmişti (the bus driver fell asleep) than şoför uyuya kaldı (the taxi driver went blind). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Dondurma külahtan erindi. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Adam güneş altında dondurmasını yedi. This means that he ate something under the sun. As a result of eating this thing, his dondurma (hangover) has disappeared. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it suggests that the hangover has been eliminated."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Odaya sanat eserleri astım,"" it is more likely that option A (Halı pis duruyordu) is the correct answer.

This suggests that the person who wrote the message is responsible for painting the walls white, which supports option A.  "
"Response:  Option B: Patron toplantı düzenledi. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""I got out early."" This implies that something unexpected happened, such as being called away or finishing work earlier than expected. Option B, ""Patron toplantı düzenledi,"" suggests that someone else (the patron) organized an event, which could have caused the speaker to leave early. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A - Sahibi köpeğini azarladı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the owner of the house has become rich overnight, implying that they have inherited a large sum of money or come into a significant amount of wealth suddenly. This is more likely to happen if the owner has been struggling financially beforehand, as it would be an unexpected and sudden change in their fortunes. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response: 
Option B: Arkadaşım öfkelendi. 
Explanation: The word ""öfkeldi"" in Turkish means to be offended or hurt. Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the friend was offended by the speaker's words rather than being affected by them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Adam neon bir ceket giyiyordu. 
Explanation: The premise states that Adam was very tall, which suggests that he had a slender build and was not particularly muscular or imposing. This contradicts option A, as it implies that Adam was carrying heavy weights around in his cantina, which would be physically demanding and require significant strength. Instead, option B provides a more plausible explanation for why Adam was able to carry so many objects without any difficulty - he was wearing a brightly colored jumpsuit that made him stand out."
"Response:  Option B: Yalancı şahitlikle suçlandı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the person lied under oath, which means they gave false testimony. This is a serious offense in legal proceedings, and it's more likely that the person will be accused of perjury rather than completing their task. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

"Response:  Option A: Dinleyicilers güldü. 
Explanation: According to the premise, an ESP (extrasensory perception) speaker has been invited to speak at a conference. The audience is skeptical of his claims, so they are unlikely to take him seriously or be impressed by his performance. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice, as the audience would probably laugh at the speaker's claims rather than being impressed."
"Response:  Option B: Güneş beni bronzlaştirdı. 
Explanation: The premise ""Güneşe baktım"" (I looked at the sun) implies that the speaker was looking directly at the sun, which can cause burns or discoloration of the skin due to exposure to harmful ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome than option A, as it suggests that the speaker's skin has been darkened by the sun's rays."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker has felt (Option A) horrified rather than (Option B) embarrassed. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Horradım.
"Response:  Option A - Bıçak körelmişti (The knife was blunt)
Explanation: The sentence ""Bifteği kesmesi zordu"" means ""The death of the pigeon was unexpected"". In this context, the word ""kesmesi"" implies that something happened to the pigeon suddenly or unexpectedly. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the pigeon died, as it suggests that the knife used to kill it was blunt and unable to penetrate deeply enough to cause a quick death."
"Response:  Option A - Nafaka almaya başladı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Kadın iflasını açıkladı. This implies that she has taken out a loan or mortgage to buy something expensive, such as a house or car. Therefore, option A - Nafaka almada başladı is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Onu ziyaret etmeye karar verdim. 
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker's friends are turning on their lights at home, indicating that they are inside. Therefore, option B, ""Onu ziyaret etmeye karar verdim"" (I decided to visit them) is the most likely response as it implies that the speaker plans to go to their friends' house to see why the lights are on."
"Response:  Option B: Çiçeğin kokusunu aldım.
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker has placed a seed underground. The effect of this action is that they have absorbed the scent of the seed, not that the seed's leaves have been moved or that the seed itself has grown. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A (Çocukluk arkadaşıyla karşılaştı) is more likely as it aligns with the emotional tone of the prompt. The use of the word ""nostalgic"" suggests a longing for something from the past, and the mention of a childhood friend adds to this sense of wistfulness. It is unlikely that the speaker would suddenly start yelling at children without any prior context or build-up. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option A (Kağıdını erken gönderdi)
Explanation: According to the premise, the student did not complete their homework assignment before submitting it. Therefore, option A is more likely as the student submitted the work early without finishing it."

"Response:  Option B: Yükselmeye başladı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the bird's wings were clipped, making it impossible for it to fly. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the bird will start to climb (yükselmeye başladı) rather than hatched from an egg (yumurtladı)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Yol kenarına park ettim,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Garaj açıktı"" is the correct answer. This is because the word ""park"" in Turkish implies that the car was parked outside, rather than inside the garage. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Option B: Mağdurellerini kaldırdı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the person who was accused of a crime has been acquitted. This means that they have been proven innocent and therefore cannot be held responsible for the crime. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it states that the person ""kaldırdı"" (meaning he/she got rid of) the accusations, implying that they were found not guilty."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Amcamın cenazesine katılma planım vardı) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that there was a plan to join the army, which implies that the speaker had been considering this as a possibility for some time. Option B (Arkadaşımın düğününe katılma planım vardı) does not provide any information about joining the army and seems unrelated to the context of the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (I had a dream) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Zaman nasıl geçti bilemedim"" can be translated to ""Time passed strangely,"" which suggests that something unusual or unexpected happened. Dreams are often seen as an unpredictable and mysterious experience, so it's possible that the speaker had a vivid dream that felt like time was passing differently. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how time passed."

Explanation: According to the premise, ""Aldığım çıktı okunaklı değildi,"" which means that the writer's pen ran out of ink. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sos hafif gelindi,"" option A (Onu servisettim) is more likely to happen because it implies that something has been done or will be done in response to the situation described by the premise. Option B (""Tuz ekledim"") does not imply any action being taken in response to the situation."
"Response:  Option B - Sıvı yapışkan bir iz bıraktı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, you have wrapped a thread around something. This implies that there is an object or substance being held by the thread, and it is not just air or nothingness. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that there is a tangible object or substance that has been wrapped with the thread."
"Response:  Option B: Kitabı baştan okudu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman read the book from cover to cover. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Adam looked out of the window) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Uçak türbilansa girdi"" suggests that Adam was inside a plane, and looking out of the window would be the most logical thing for him to do in this situation. Option A (""Adam emniyet kemerini sıktı"") does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that Adam has any connection to the pilot or flight attendants."
"Response:  Option B: Kız onu dürttü. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""çocuk ürktü,"" which means that a child cried. This implies that something upset or distressed the child, leading to tears. Option B suggests that the child was hurt by someone (dürttü), making it the more likely cause of the crying."
"Response:  Option A (Bacagını ampute ettiler) is the most likely cause based on the premise provided.

"Response:  Option B: Kız kolunu ondan uzağa çekti. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl's hair was pulled away from her ear. This means that option B, ""Kız kolunu ondan uzağa çekti,"" is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Haklı olduğunu biliyordum. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Arkadaşımdan tavsiye istedim"" implies that the speaker has asked for a recommendation from their friend. Therefore, option B, ""Haklı olduğunu biliyordum,"" which means ""I knew he would be reliable,"" is the most likely cause as it suggests that the speaker had faith in their friend's ability to provide a good recommendation."
"Response:  Option B: Çamur suratına sıçradı.
Explanation: The premise states that the child put camomile in his shoe, indicating that he placed it inside his shoe rather than on top of it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it suggests that the child put something inside his shoe, which aligns with the given information."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that people buried underground (Option B) rather than schools going on a trip (Option A).
"Response:  Option B: İstifa etmekle tehdit etti. 
Explanation: According to the premise, workers' wages have been cut off. This implies that they are facing financial difficulties and may be under pressure to quit their jobs. Therefore, option B (threatening to resign) is more likely to occur than option A (returned home)."
"Response:  Option A: Ağaç evin çatısına düştü. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Ağaç eve Zarar verdi,"" it is more likely that the tree fell onto the house rather than casting a shadow over the garden. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Response:  Option A (Aile çifti tebrik etti) is more likely to be the cause of the baby's crying because it implies that the mother is happy or content with something, which could potentially calm the baby down. On the other hand, option B (Çift bebekleri olacağını duyurdu) does not provide any context or explanation for why the baby might be crying, making it less plausible as a cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kız ondan hoşlanıyordu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""bir aşk mektubu gönderdi"" implies that the girl wrote a love letter, which suggests that she has feelings for someone. Option B (Kız onu öptü) does not align with this interpretation as it means ""the girl hugged him,"" which does not convey the same emotional intensity as writing a love letter. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information given in the premise."
"Response:  Option B: Onunla aynı fikirdeydim. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker claims to have pretended to be angry with their friend in order to make them think that they had the same idea. This implies that the speaker was not actually angry, but rather trying to manipulate their friend's perception of their emotions. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option B: Adam fırından pizzayı çıkardı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Adam has entered a bakery. This means that he is likely to have taken something from the bakery, such as bread or pastries, rather than food from a restaurant like pizza. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."

Explanation: According to the premise, Zengin (the old man) has passed away. This means that his property, including his mirror, will now belong to his heirs or successors.

"Response:  Option B: Alevden duman çıktı. 
Explanation: The premise states that Kadın alevin üzerine bastı, implying that she placed her hand on his chest. This action would cause a sound to come out of him, as he is an entity with a physical body. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Option B: Bir kazaya karışmıştı. 
Explanation: The phrase ""Kadının arabası tamirdedi"" suggests that a woman's car has been involved in an accident. Therefore, option B, ""Bir kazaya karışmıştı,"" is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Kahvaltıyı kaçırdım. 
Explanation: The premise states that I woke up to an alarm, but did not hear it. This implies that I was in a deep sleep or unconscious state, making it less likely that I would have gotten out of bed to make breakfast (Option A). Instead, it's more likely that I simply ignored the alarm and continued sleeping (Option B)."
"Response:  Option B: Ailesi basın toplantısına katıldı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the famous actor left his luxury car and joined his family's business.

Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Option A: Küvet suyu ılıklaştı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Kadın küvette oyalandı,"" which means that a woman was buried alive in a coffin.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Mühendislik okudu. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the protagonist wants to meet other students at a university campus.

"Response:  Option B: Çocuk bir çiçek kopardı. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Arı çocuğa doğru uçtu,"" the child flew away. This implies that the child was lifted off the ground and moved through the air, which could potentially result in the child landing somewhere else.

Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kuyuya bozuk para attım,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Bozuk para dibe battı"" (The broken egg cracked) will occur. This is because the word ""bozuk"" in Turkish means ""broken."" Therefore, it makes sense that a broken egg would crack open.

Therefore, option B - ""Akciğerleri sıkışmıştı"" (his chest was tight) is a more likely cause for the man's heavy breathing."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I asked my friend if he wanted to come with us) is more likely.

Response:  Option A (Çantası açıktı). The pain in the child's back was caused by lifting something heavy, which led to strain on their back muscles. This is more likely than option B (Çantası ağırdı), as it does not provide a clear explanation for how the child's back became injured.

The phrase ""a meteor fell"" suggests a sudden and dramatic event occurring in the sky, while the mention of a ""tsunami"" implies a massive wave caused by an underwater disturbance.

"Response:  Option B: Yemeği fırına koydum. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Fırın ısındı,"" the oven was hot. Therefore, it is more likely that food was put into the oven (option B) rather than turning on the oven (option A)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Limon küflendi) occurred. The reason being that the word ""dilimini"" in Turkish means ""squeezed"" or ""crushed"", which implies that something has been compressed or compacted. This suggests that limon may have been subjected to some kind of pressure or force, leading to its shape changing. Option B (""Limonun suyu çıktı"") means ""Lemon juice came out"", which does not align with the given premise as there is no mention of any liquid coming out of limon. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given scenario."

"Response:  Option B: Bir kıyafet yığını üzerine düştü. 
Explanation: The premise states that Bardak masadan düştü, implying that he fell from a height.

Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Zemin kaygandı. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Masa was not asleep, but he was in a state of deep thought or meditation (yalpalıyordu).

"Response:  Option B - Aspirin içti.
Explanation: The premise states that Adam's headache has become unbearable, indicating a severe level of pain. Taking aspirin would be a common solution to alleviate such a headache, as it is a popular over-the-counter medication used to treat mild to moderate headaches caused by tension or migraines. On the other hand, Öksürük şurubu (a Turkish delicacy) is not known for its ability to relieve headaches, and in fact, might even exacerbate them due to its spicy and oily nature. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice."

Explanation: According to the premise, the woman claimed that she saw a ghost. This implies that the event occurred nearby, rather than at a distant location where the woman may not have recognized any familiar faces. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Okyanusta neredeyse boğuluyordu) is a more plausible explanation for why Yeti disappeared from sight. This is because ""duyma"" in Turkish means ""to disappear,"" and ""yedekindi"" means ""to be lost.""

The sentence ""Plastik kap eridi"" suggests that something has been broken or damaged, and option A provides a plausible explanation for how this might have happened.
