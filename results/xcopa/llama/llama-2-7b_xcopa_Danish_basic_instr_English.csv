"Response:  Based on the premise ""Varerne var pakket i boblefolie,"" option A (Det var skrøbeligt) is the most likely cause. The word ""skrøbeligt"" suggests that something was fragile or delicate, which aligns with the idea of packaging food in bubble wrap to protect it during transportation. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg tømte mine lommer,"" it is more likely that Option A: ""Jeg fonden en billetstopp"" (I found a billfold) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the termites ate through the tree in the house (Option B). The phrase ""invaded the house"" implies that the termites entered the home from outside, rather than disappearing or flying away. Additionally, the mention of a ""tree"" suggests that the termites may have been attracted to wood in the house, which they could potentially eat through if given enough time."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Patruljen anklagede dem for smugling) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It was a holy day) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she played dams (Option A). The premise states that she was tired of energy, which could be interpreted as a physical or mental fatigue. Playing dams is an indoor game that requires concentration and focus, but does not require much physical exertion. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Flere mennesker trådte ind i køen) is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that barnet drakt på hendes babyshower (Option A). The phrase ""pigen klemte sig i næsen"" suggests that something has caused discomfort or pain for a young girl, and the mention of a baby shower implies that this event occurred recently. It is unlikely that the child has accidentally gotten into her mother's breast without any prior indication of this happening in the text. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Publikum klappede sammen med musikken) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the girl brought her teacher an apple) is more likely. The premise states that the girl ""took her math teacher,"" implying a positive action towards the teacher, such as bringing them something they appreciate. Bringing a teacher an apple is a thoughtful gesture, whereas being after school for syn is unlikely to be a positive outcome. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Deres lejrleder fortalte dem en spøgelseshistorie) is more likely to have caused their fear of camping. This is because a spooky story told by a leader can create an atmosphere of fear and unease among campers, especially if it involves supernatural elements or unknown dangers lurking in the woods. The act of breaking marshmallows over a campfire may not necessarily evoke fear, but rather excitement and enjoyment for many children.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Han fik en hjernerystelse) is more likely. The phrase ""Manden slog hovedet"" suggests that he experienced a sudden and severe impact to his head, which could potentially cause a herniated brain stem or other neurological damage. This would be consistent with the effects of a hjernerystelse. In contrast, option A (Han gik tabt i tanker) does not provide any specific information about the nature of the man's mental state, making it less plausible as an explanation for the observed symptoms."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (Min bankkonto var tom) is the correct cause for why the check was not paid. This is because there is no indication in the scenario that the employee has earned a pay raise or increase in salary. Therefore, it is more plausible that the employee's bank account did not have enough funds to cover the check.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Manden deleted the spam from his email inbox rather than sending a mass email. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Han var i karantæne,"" it is more likely that he was exposed to the disease (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: He was exposed to the disease."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Hun reciterede den for sig selv) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""pigen huskede koden,"" indicating that she remembered or recalled the code rather than forgetting to write it down. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the girl was able to recall the code."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg hældte vandet i glasset,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Vandet slukkede min tørst,"" will occur."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han ville støtte sin ven) is more likely. The fact that the man remained silent suggests that he was trying to support his friend rather than simply thinking about what had been said.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ulykken var min skyld,"" option A is more likely. The correct answer is (A) I felt guilty."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there was a break in the chain (Option B). The phrase ""Kæden gik fra hinanden"" suggests that something happened to cause the chain to break or come undone, rather than becoming tangled around something else."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De became tired of arguing) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She testified in court) is more likely. The premise states that she decided to run for a public office, which implies that she may have had legal issues or disputes related to her candidacy. Testifying in court could be one possible outcome of such legal proceedings. Option A (hiring a campaign manager) does not seem directly related to running for a public office.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han pakkede varmt tøj i sin kuffert) is more likely. The fact that Manden forventede koldt vejr suggests that he packed warm clothing in his suitcase to prepare for cold weather during his journey.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He reached out) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden fik tårer i øjnene,"" option A (støv kom i hans øjne) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hendes modstander havde ondt af hende) is more likely. The fact that she won five matches in a row suggests that her opponent was not able to overcome their discomfort or pain, rather than accusing her of cheating.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han fangede den studerende i at snyde) is more likely as it implies that the teacher caught the student cheating, rather than the student's answer being incorrect.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg mistede min stemme) is more likely as a cause for not being able to talk. Losing one's voice or speech can be caused by various factors such as vocal cord injury, laryngitis, or even psychological reasons like anxiety or stress. On the other hand, being completely without words or language (option B) may be more related to cognitive or neurological issues like aphasia or autism spectrum disorder.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den frosne mad er blevet aftavet,"" option A (I laid it in the microwave) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han havde mave kramper) is the correct answer. The phrase ""han havde mave kramper"" suggests that he had abdominal cramps, which could be a symptom of various medical conditions such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for his absence from work."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun løb på pooldækket) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the tickets were sold out) is more likely as it suggests that there was high demand for the movie's premiere, which could be due to various factors such as positive word of mouth or hype surrounding the film. On the other hand, Option B (the movie received bad reviews) does not necessarily explain why the tickets were sold out, as people may still choose to watch a movie despite negative reviews.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden har tabt sig,"" it is more likely that people isolated him rather than complimented him. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen fik blærer i hænderne,"" option A (Hun skrev et brev) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""fik blærer"" means ""got a splinter"" or ""got hurt,"" so it's unlikely that the girl climbed up a rope with injured hands. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Publikum jublede i forbløffelse) is more likely. The premise mentions that the clown was juggling while riding a unicycle, which suggests that he was performing acrobatics or circus tricks. This would likely elicit a positive reaction from the audience, such as cheering or applause. Option B (Akrobaten svingede fra en trapez) does not fit with this context, as it refers to an aerialist swinging from a trapeze, which may be part of a different type of performance.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg mistede tålmodigheden,"" option A is the most likely cause. The word ""mistede"" means ""lost"" in English, so it suggests that something was lost or misplaced, such as patience. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) My friend waited for me."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They forhandled a treaty) is more likely. The premise states that the countries wanted peace, so they would be more likely to negotiate a treaty rather than develop atomic weapons.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden tog sovepiller,"" it is more likely that he became drowsy (Option A). Taking sleeping pills would make someone feel drowsy or tired, rather than having a fever (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Hun har fået blå mærker på knæet) is the most likely outcome as it provides a specific detail about the woman's injury that is consistent with the situation described in the premise. Option A (""Sofas ben slap løs"") does not provide any additional details or clues to help determine the likelihood of the chosen response."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen klemte ballonen,"" option A (the balloon burst) is more likely to occur."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (De took to lufthavnen) is more likely. The passage states that the travelers have checked into their hotel room, indicating that they are at their destination and ready to begin their trip. It is unlikely that they would be packing their bags again after already checking in.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg bed i fersken,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Fersken er blå,"" will occur. The word ""fersken"" means ""ferns"" in Danish, but it can also mean ""bladet"" or ""leaf."" Therefore, the sentence could be interpreted as either ""I am biting a leaf"" or ""I am biting a blue thing,"" with the latter being more likely given the context of the sentence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mine hænder blev klæbrige,"" option A is the more likely cause - ""Jeg spiste en doughnut."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg skubbede døren,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Døren åbnede sig."" This is because the verb ""skubbe"" implies a forceful action, which could potentially open the door rather than locking it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The activists are protesting against the use of child labor in the production process, indicating that the products were made using unethical means.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg borede et hul i væggen,"" it is more likely that Option A (En mus kravlede ud of hullet) will occur. The act of boring a hole in the wall suggests that there may be an opening or gap created, which provides an opportunity for something to pass through, such as a mouse crawling out of the hole."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (her sister was happy) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg spildte vin på min skjorte,"" option B (I changed my shirt) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kunden gennemsøgte sit tegnebog) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the customer would be searching through his sketchbook.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Han sendte folkene væk) is more likely. The premise states that Gadespilleren tiltrak en skare, which means he attracted a crowd, but then it says han sendte folkene væk, which means he sent the people away. This implies that Gadespilleren had some kind of power or influence over the people, but rather than using it to help them, he used it to send them away. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den lille dreng græd til sin babysitter,"" option A (Han savnede sine forældre) is the more likely cause of his crying."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Pilot flew through the storm) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Træet har mistet sit blad,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Bladene skiftede farver,"" occurred. The loss of leaves from a tree would not cause them to change color."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he decided to play a practical joke on his sister) is more likely. The fact that he was in a bad mood suggests that he might be looking for ways to distract himself or make himself feel better, which could involve playing a prank on someone close to him like his sister.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Hans far stoppede bilen ved en tankstation) is more likely. The reason being that it's unlikely for someone to give a child a soda to drink while they are already in the process of using the restroom.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet strøede fiskemat i tanken,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Fisken sprang ud of tanken,"" is correct. The premise suggests that something unexpected happened to the fish in the tank, leading it to escape. Option B, ""Fisken svømmede mod maden,"" does not align with the given premise as there is no indication that the fish was attracted to food."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She changed her political views) is more likely. The text does not mention any specific action or event that would lead to a change in political views, but rather states that she ""changed her mind."" This suggests that there may have been an internal shift in her perspective, rather than a dramatic external event like participating in a protest."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Jeg tændte for vandet) caused the water to overflow in the bathroom. Turning on the tap would increase the flow of water into the bathtub or shower, potentially causing an overflow if the water level becomes too high. Option B (Jeg hældte afløbsrensning i den) does not directly cause an overflow, but rather drains excess water from the bathtub or shower.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Passagers steg af toget,"" option A (Taget ankom til stationen) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He lukkede konvolutten) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De nød hinandens selskab) is more likely. The passage states that the friends lost contact with each other, suggesting that they were no longer in close proximity to one another. This makes it less likely that they would have moved to different cities without keeping in touch.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she was fired from her position as accountant. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg kiggede på uret,"" option A is more likely. The sentence implies that the speaker looked at the clock, so they heard it ticking rather than seeing it ticking."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min hånd kramper,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the writer wrote the essay with their own hand rather than holding hands with someone else. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Jeg skrev essayet for hånd."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (I have replaced the bolt) is a more plausible explanation for why the door won't open than option B (I turned the wrong key). The fact that the person has to ""udskift"" the bolt suggests that it may be broken or damaged, making it unlikely that they would simply turn the wrong key. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Parret flyttede ind i lejligheden) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun ville see sunset) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for her being outside during dusk. Option B (She thought she saw a lightning) does not provide any logical explanation for why she would be standing outside at that time of day.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Han kunne ikke svømme) is more likely. The fact that he had a life jacket on suggests that he was attempting to swim but could not, indicating that he may have been unable to swim.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she pressed the backspace key (Option B). The text editor's auto-correct feature may have automatically corrected the spelling mistake instead of deleting the entire document.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen pralede for sine venner,"" option A (Hun fik en dårlig karakter) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""praled"" suggests that something negative happened to her, such as receiving a bad grade, rather than winning a competition."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Græsset var mudret,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Det regnede i nat,"" is the correct answer. The word ""mudret"" in Danish means ""wet"" or ""moist."" Therefore, it is more likely that it rained recently rather than being filled with weeds."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she forgot to set her alarm clock than that she stayed at a hotel. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden tog solcreme på,"" it is more likely that he took sunscreen to the beach (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Forskeren trak teorien tilbage) is more likely. The forskere did not provide any evidence to support their theory, so it is unlikely that they would retract it without sufficient evidence.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the game went into overtime) is more likely as fans booing does not necessarily indicate a bad call by the referee.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg skrev min kombination på låsen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jeg lukkede låsen,"" occurred. This is because writing one's combination on a lock implies that one has access to the lock and can open or close it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Father took his son's hand) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jeg skovlede sneen væk) is more likely. The premise states that the entrance was blocked by snow, so it's unlikely that you would gather the snow into a snowball. Instead, you would need to remove the snow to clear the entrance.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kajakken nåede kysten) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hun kørte ind i et hegn) is more likely. The premise implies that the cyclist lost control of her bike, which could lead to a collision with an obstacle such as a tree or a wall. Option A (Hun slap styret) does not provide any information about what happened to the cyclist after she lost control of her bike.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg tændte for viften,"" it is more likely that option A (Vand sprøjtet på min hud) is the correct answer. The premise suggests that something was ignited or lit, which would not be possible if the person were feeling a cool breeze. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice given the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De var gennemblødte) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why surfers would return to shore. Option B (De saw a shark) does not provide a clear reason for their actions.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vandet er gået ud af badekarret) is more likely. The premise states that ""Jeg trak afløbsproppen i badekarret,"" which means that someone pulled the drain plug in the bathtub. This would cause the water to go down the drain, rather than sprinkling it on the floor. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He tillested his infidelity) is more likely. The fact that he feels guilty about cheating suggests that he has done something wrong, and therefore it is more likely that he will admit to it rather than accuse his wife of being unfaithful.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Tintet på plakatet smuldrede,"" option A (Jeg ventede på at blækken tørrede) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Barnet had a nightmare (Option A). The reason for this is that having a nightmare is a common occurrence during sleep, especially among children, and can often result in loud screaming or crying. On the other hand, urinating in bed is less common and may not necessarily cause such a strong reaction as to wake up someone else in the room. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for why Barnet was screaming.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen satte sine fødder op på bordet,"" option A (Hans far satte sig ved bordet) is the most likely outcome. This is because the sentence focuses on Dringen's actions rather than his father's actions or words. Therefore, it is more likely that Dringen placed his feet on the table himself rather than his father doing so."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min ven vendte hovedet i min retning,"" option A (Jeg råbte hans navn) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Borgerne gjorde oprør) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen var faret vild i skoven,"" it is more likely that he built a tent. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hans collogae got a promotion) is more likely as it provides a clear reason why the man would be jealous of his colleague.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had hallucinations) is the correct answer. The text states that the man was a witness to extraterrestrial beings, which could potentially be interpreted as a hallucination or delusion rather than actual observation of aliens. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the man's experience.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden blev blond,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""bleg"" in Danish means ""blonde,"" so it's likely that the man has applied bleach or another lightening product to his hair rather than shampoo."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She criticized her earlier work) is more likely as it suggests that she was reflecting on her past work rather than feeling inspired by something new.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (He was drafted into military service) is the correct answer. The text states that he ""flyttede hjemmefra,"" which means he moved back home, suggesting that he had been away from home for some time. Additionally, the mention of him being ""udskrevet"" from the military suggests that he served in the military, which is consistent with Option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Regale was covered in dust) is more likely. The premise states that ""bøger faldt ud af bogreolen,"" indicating that books fell out of the bookshelf, which could be caused by something like dust accumulating on the shelf and causing the books to become unstable. An earthquake would not typically cause books to fall out of a bookshelf."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Jeg tændte for lyset) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Strømmen i mit hus gik"" implies that there was a power outage in the speaker's house, which would cause all lights to go off. Therefore, turning on the light would be the most likely explanation for why the power went back on. Option B (Jeg nulstiller afbryder) does not make sense in this context as it means ""I turned off the interrupter"", which is an uncommon phrase with no clear meaning in English."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vi kørte på bjergbanen,"" option A (Det saw skræmmende ud) is the most likely cause. The sentence suggests that something frightening or unsettling happened while driving on a mountain road, which aligns with Option A's meaning of being scared or intimidated."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I heated it in the microwave) is more likely to be the cause of the popcorn breaking apart. The premise mentions that the popcorn started to break apart as soon as I poured it into the bowl, suggesting that it was already damaged or weakened beforehand. Heating the popcorn in the microwave could have further compromised its structure and led to it breaking apart more easily.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Der var ventet kraftige vinde) is more likely. The falling tree would have caused a power outage due to damage to the electrical lines or transformers, rather than simply disrupting the flow of electricity in the neighborhood.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (He kedede publikum) is the correct answer. The premise states that Taleren ""fremsatte politisk ukorrekte bemærkninger,"" which implies that he made statements that were not in line with political correctness or societal norms. This could potentially offend or upset the audience, leading them to feel uncomfortable or annoyed. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation of how the audience reacted to Taleren's performance."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (a drop of blood formed on my finger) is more likely to occur. The premise mentions that I poked myself with a needle, which could potentially cause injury or bleeding. Therefore, it is more plausible that a drop of blood would form on my finger rather than a droplet of sweat dripping from my face.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fisken flød på tankens overflade,"" it is more likely that the fish was dead (Option B). The phrase ""flød på"" in Danish means ""washed up on,"" indicating that the fish's body was found floating on the surface of the water, suggesting death rather than hunger or thirst as a possible cause for its presence there."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden lød hæs,"" option A (Han var forkølet) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Elevatoren became stuck between floors) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: His parents gave him house arrest. This is because the premise states that the teenager ""snagged himself out of the house,"" implying that he took some sort of action to leave without his parents' permission. It is unlikely that he would have been able to do this if his parents had not given him house arrest in the first place. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option A (Toilettet var overfyldt) is the correct answer. The phrase ""badeværelset er oversvømmet"" suggests that there is an excessive amount of water in the bathroom, which could be caused by a clogged toilet or other plumbing issue. It is less likely that the water heater would suddenly stop working and flood the bathroom."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hvalpen blev ved sin ejer,"" option A is more likely. The word ""krave"" in Danish means a leash or chain used to restrain an animal, so it's possible that the owner put a leash on the whale. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden fangede sit spejlbillede,"" option A (Han stod under det store træ) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg ringede tilbage) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their dog ran away (Option A). There is no mention of any valuable items being missing from their home, which suggests that the family's concern about being ""gennemsøgte"" (meaning they were searched) is related to their dog's disappearance rather than anything else."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg saw my breath when I exhaled,"" option A (The weather was cold) is a more likely cause than option B (My chest felt tight). This is because seeing one's breath in the air typically indicates that the temperature is low enough for the breath to condense into visible vapor."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De ønskede bedre arbejdsvilkår) is more likely as the reason for forming a union. The text states that the employees formed a union to improve their working conditions, indicating that they were not satisfied with their current job terms. Option B (Derir arbejdsgiver hævede deres løn) does not align with this reasoning as it suggests that the employer increased the employees' wages, which would not be a motivating factor for forming a union.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg har bagt en æbletårte,"" it is more likely that a warm, comforting smell will fill the kitchen (Option B). This is because the word ""æble"" in Danish means both ""apple"" and ""cake,"" suggesting that something sweet and baked may be cooking in the oven."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun bar høye hæle) is more likely as it provides a physical explanation for why she struggled to walk. Option B (Hun tog skoene af) does not provide any logical reasoning or evidence to support the claim that taking off her shoes would help her walk better. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Damp steg op fra vandet i gryden,"" option A (Vandet kogte) is the most likely cause. The word ""kogte"" means ""boiled"" in Danish, indicating that the water in the saucepan boiled, causing the steam to rise from the water. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg havde sandaler på) is more likely. The fact that all my socks were in the washing machine suggests that I had shoes on at some point during the process of doing laundry, making it less likely that I had støvlers on.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he lost support from voters.  
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Parret blev gravid) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Millionæren ville have bygningen revet ned) is more likely to be the correct cause. The passage states that ""the building was dedicated to a wealthy businessman,"" but does not mention anything about him contributing to its construction or wanting it preserved. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would want the building torn down rather than preserved."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Salgsassistenten saw the girl stealing) is more likely. The premise states that the sales assistant accused the girl of stealing, indicating that they observed her taking something without permission. Therefore, it is more likely that the sales assistant witnessed the girl actually stealing rather than helping her find a specific taske she liked.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Soldaters were sent out to fight) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Et oprør brød ud foran retsbygningen) is more likely to occur. The premise suggests that there is a controversial decision to be made, and an uprising or protest breaking out in front of the courthouse would be a natural response to such a decision. Option B (Et par afgav løfter foran retsbygningen) could also be possible, but it seems less likely given the context provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen lugtede noget brændende,"" option B (Hun glemte kagerne i ovnen) is the more likely cause. The word ""lugtede"" in Danish means to smell something burning, indicating that there may have been a fire or smoke somewhere nearby. Given this context, it's more plausible that the girl forgot about the cakes in the oven rather than taking them out of the kitchen."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Det regnede i skyggeslag,"" option A (Stormen blev værre) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that Option B: Brandlarmen gik i gang was the cause of the building being evacuated. The fact that the elevator stopped functioning (Option A) does not necessarily explain why the building was evacuated, as there could be other reasons for this action. However, the presence of a fire alarm going off (Option B) would likely prompt an immediate evacuation to ensure the safety of everyone inside the building. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Faderen smed sin søn ud of huset) is more likely. The premise suggests that Faren is angry with his son's alcoholism, which could lead to him wanting to distance himself from the problem rather than trying to help or enable it further by buying him another drink.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Elevatoren var i stykker) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why the lawyer's office was not accessible.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden blev irriteret på sin ven,"" option A (Hans ven afbrød ham) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Kassereren glemte at give pigen en kvittering) is more likely. The fact that the kasserer ""glemte"" to give the girl a receipt suggests that he may have intentionally forgotten or overlooked giving her one, which could be an indication of dishonesty or negligence."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (She was paralyzed in an accident) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Kvinden blev sat i kørestol"" implies that she became unable to walk due to some event or injury, which supports Option A. In contrast, Option B suggests that she died and was brought into the hospital after death, which does not align with the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (landet stod over for økonomiske vanskeligheder) is more likely as a cause of the people's frustration with their government. The fact that they hung the national flag outside their homes suggests that they are expressing dissatisfaction or protest against something, and economic difficulties could be a possible reason for this sentiment. It is less likely that they would be frustrated with their government solely because of the country's independence.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The text states that ""Holdet tabte turneringen,"" indicating that they lost the tournament, which could potentially inspire their fans rather than disappoint them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg følte mig flov) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He was not focused during class) is a more likely cause for why he did not do well in his history exam than option B (He forgot to study). This is because being distracted or unfocused during class can affect one's ability to retain information and perform well on an exam, whereas simply forgetting to study may be easier to overcome with adequate preparation and effort.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (an earthquake) is more likely to be the cause of the building's collapse than option B (increase in crime). Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially those located near fault lines or in areas prone to seismic activity.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bolden rullede væk) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vaskebjørnen ransagede skraldespanden,"" option A is more likely. The word ""ransagede"" implies that something was searched through or examined thoroughly, which suggests that there may have been an object of interest in the trash can. Therefore, it is more likely that there was paper in the trash can than that the lid was made of plastic."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen skårped blyanten,"" it is more likely that option A (It was cheap) is the correct answer. The word ""skårped"" in Danish means ""cheap"", so the sentence implies that the pencil was affordable or inexpensive."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Hun har mistet kvitteringen) is the correct cause. The fact that the woman refused a refund suggests that she did not have the receipt or proof of purchase, which would be necessary to receive a refund. Therefore, it is more likely that she lost the receipt rather than the clothing not fitting her.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Skrabningen i min hud var dyb,"" option A (Det hele hurtigt) is more likely. The word ""hurtigt"" implies a quick or sudden movement, which aligns with the idea of something scraping across one's skin quickly. Option B (""Det efterlod et ar"") suggests that something was left behind after the scratching, which may not be as immediate or direct as the implied action in option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden fik mærkelige blik fra passagerne på toget,"" option A is more likely. The man stared at the ground, indicating that he was not talking to himself or looking at anything else around him."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden gav sin søster et lommetørklæde,"" option B is the most likely cause: Kvindens søster began to cry."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hendes chef roste hende) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han støttede deres sag) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (He had stage fright) is more likely. The phrase ""Skuespilleren's heart flew before his performance"" suggests that he was nervous or anxious about performing, which is a common symptom of stage fright. It does not suggest that he forgot his lines, which would be more consistent with option B (He remembered his replies)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg var fortabt,"" option A is more likely. The word ""forstabt"" means ""astonished"" or ""surprised,"" so it's unlikely that the person would have talked their money or unfolded a card in response to being surprised. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den modne frugt blev liggende i solen,"" it is more likely that the fruit will become rotten (Option A). The sun's heat can cause the fruit to spoil or rot, rather than shrinking (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""The car broke down,"" option A (Jeg tændte tændingen) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han har været hos en psykiater) is more likely. The statement ""Manden har ondt i ryggen"" suggests that he has been experiencing back pain, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as muscle strain or injury, herniated discs, or other underlying medical conditions. It is less likely that he would have been in bed for several days without seeking medical attention for his back pain. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg startede en ild i pejset,"" option A is more likely. The fact that there was no more fuel suggests that the fire may have been extinguished or not started by the speaker themselves."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden holdt op med at løbe,"" it is more likely that she has cramps ( Option A). The reason for this is that cramps are a common symptom experienced by runners during or after exercise, particularly in the legs and abdomen. It could be due to dehydration, overexertion, or other factors related to running. On the other hand, getting a new spirit is not a plausible explanation for stopping to run, as spirits do not exist in reality. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Min nabo forlod sit hus) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden sukkede af frustration,"" it is more likely that her husband misunderstood her concerns (Option A). The phrase ""sukker af"" in Danish can be translated to ""sinks into"" or ""suffers from,"" indicating a deep-seated emotion such as frustration or sadness. It is unlikely that her husband would kiss her goodbye without noticing her distress, so Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Studenten besvarede spørgsmålet korrekt) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden løb tør for æg,"" it is more likely that she went to the grocery store (option B). The phrase ""løb tør for"" means ""ran out of,"" so it makes sense that she would go to a place where she can buy more eggs rather than running to a farm or garden."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Jeg afslørede en hemmelighed for ham) is more likely. The fact that I met an old friend suggests a positive interaction, and revealing a secret implies a level of trust or intimacy in the relationship. Giving someone a hug may be a friendly gesture, but it does not necessarily imply a deeper emotional connection.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden undgik at gå i søen,"" it is more likely that she avoided going into the sea because she saw something dirty or unpleasant there rather than catching a fish. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hans paraply var i stykker) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why he would be late to class. It is unlikely that his bike was stolen without any indication of this in the passage.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Brugeren klikkede på musen) is a more likely cause for the cursor moving on the computer screen than option B (Brugeren flyttede musen). This is because clicking on the mouse button is a common action that users perform to interact with their computer, whereas moving the mouse itself may not be as deliberate or intentional an action.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (a u-turn) caused the accident. The sentence ""Chaufføren tog en omvej"" translates to ""The driver took a detour,"" indicating that the driver made an unexpected turn or change of direction, which could have led to the accident. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (linen tørrede) is more likely. The sentence ""Jeg hængte det våde sengetøj på vaskebåndet udenfor"" implies that the towel was hung outside to dry, rather than being damaged or infested with pests. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden tog sine solbriller på,"" it is more likely that Option A (Solen skinnede) is the correct answer. The phrase ""tog sine solbriller på"" implies that the woman put on her sun glasses, which suggests that she was preparing for or anticipating bright light. This makes Option A (Solen skinnede) a more plausible explanation than Option B (Hun ringede after a taxi), as there is no indication in the premise that the woman needed to call for a taxi."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden stirrede på nattehimlen,"" it is more likely that he was thinking about wishing for summer (Option A). The phrase ""stirred at the night sky"" suggests a sense of longing or yearning, which is often associated with wishes or desires. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg følte mig udmattet,"" option B is more likely. The premise suggests that the person felt tired, which means they were probably awake for a long time and didn't go to bed early. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Drengen kunne ikke lide sin nye klassekammerat) is more likely. The fact that the boy played ""onde tricks"" on his new classmate suggests that he may not have been very friendly or welcoming towards him, indicating a lack of liking for the newcomer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg havde lyst til et glas mælk,"" option A (Jeg spiste smørrebrød) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Det begyndte at regne,"" it is more likely that option A (Chaufføren tændte forlygtern) occurred because when it starts raining, the driver would turn on their headlights to improve visibility. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg parkerede på den anden side af gaden) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Forfatteren had a writer's block) is more likely. The author went ""glip"" of their deadline, indicating that they were unable to write due to a creative block or lack of inspiration, rather than simply needing to edit their work."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vinden blæste gennem det åbne vindue,"" it is more likely that dørklokken (doorbell) rangede (rang). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jeg har taget strømmen fra lampen) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the premise of any external factor that could have caused a power surge or electrical shock, such as a lightning strike or faulty wiring. Therefore, it is more plausible that the power went out due to a simple issue with the lamp itself, rather than an external factor.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vægtløfteren gryntet,"" option A is more likely. The verb ""gryntet"" suggests that the weightlifter was grimacing or making a face while lifting weights, which is more consistent with Option A than Option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han tog en lommeregner) is more likely. The premise suggests that Eleven tried to count in his head, which implies a level of cognitive ability beyond simply becoming confused. Taking a calculator would be a more logical solution if he were struggling with mental arithmetic.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet faldt i søvn,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something happened to make the baby fall asleep unexpectedly, and it's unlikely that the father would change his baby's bed while they were sleeping. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Drungen became wet) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the girl threw water at the boy, implying a liquid substance was involved. As water is a liquid, it is more likely to cause the boy to become wet rather than experience a herniated brain stem.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The photographer forgot to use the camera's flash, so all of the pictures were underexposed and everyone in them refused to smile because they thought it looked ridiculous.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg var ensom) is more likely as it provides a straightforward explanation for why the speaker did not attend the party. Option B (Jeg var ude af byen) does not provide any information about why the speaker was absent from the party.

The other option, Option B (We lived on an island), goes against the premise as there are no islands near the ferry route mentioned in the premise. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hun ville gøre oprør) is more likely. The fact that she was scared of the needle suggests that she may have been anxious about getting the tattoo, but her desire to rebel against her parents' rules could be a stronger motivator for her actions.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Jeg blev mistænksom"" (I became suspicious). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that something unusual or unexpected has happened, such as a car parked outside one's house without permission, which could arouse suspicion and curiosity in most people. Option B, ""Jeg ringede til politiet,"" (I called the police) is less likely to happen as it implies taking a more proactive approach to dealing with the situation, which may not be immediately necessary based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Forbryderen har overgivet sig selv,"" option A (Beviserne implicerede ham) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""overgav sig selv"" implies that the criminal has given up or surrendered themselves, suggesting that they have been caught red-handed with evidence against them. Therefore, it is more likely that there were indeed beviser that implicated him in the crime."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Han undgik koffein) is more likely. The premise states that the man decided to give up coffee, which suggests that he may have been consuming it regularly and wants to stop. It's less likely that he would cut his own tongue as a way of giving up coffee.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen trådte på isen,"" it is more likely that she glided ( Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden havde ring under øjnene,"" option A is more likely. The woman was awake all night, indicating that she may have been experiencing difficulty sleeping or discomfort due to a physical condition such as eye strain or pain. This is supported by the phrase ""ring under øjnene,"" which suggests that there is something irritating or uncomfortable in her eyes. Therefore, it is more plausible that she was unable to fall asleep due to this issue rather than putting her son to bed."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Vulkanen brød ud) is the more likely cause of lava flowing from the volcano. The premise states that ""lava flød fra vulkanen,"" indicating that lava was flowing from the volcano, which suggests that an eruption occurred. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden tog skoene på,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct - she knew all to the festival. The phrase ""tog skoene på"" means ""took off her shoes,"" which suggests that she was prepared or ready for something, such as a party or celebration. Therefore, it is more likely that she knew everyone at the festival rather than wanting to leave it."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hun holdt mig inde ved tolden) is more likely. The phrase ""Jeg betalte vejafgiftspigen"" implies that the speaker paid a bribe to get through customs quickly, suggesting that they were in a hurry to leave the country. Given this context, it's more likely that the official held them back at the border rather than letting them pass through without any issues."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han sold his shares) is more likely as a cause of the leader's financial difficulties.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden gik til lægen,"" it is more likely that Option A: ""Lægen var på orlov"" is the correct answer. The fact that the man went to see a doctor implies that he had a specific reason for doing so, such as needing medical attention. If the doctor was on leave, this would not be the most likely explanation for why the man went to see him. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg gik ud af mit soveværelse gennom vinduet,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Huset var i brand,"" is the correct answer. The phrase ""gik ud af mit soveværelse"" suggests that something unusual or unexpected has happened, such as a fire breaking out in the house. This is supported by the fact that people typically do not go through windows when they are sleeping unless there is an emergency situation. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drengens fingre blev afprutte,"" option A (Han tog et langt bad) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""afprutte"" means ""washed off"" in Danish, so it's likely that the boy took a long bath to wash off his fingers."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg spyttede mælken ud,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mælken smagte sur,"" is the correct answer. This is because when someone spits out milk, it is likely that they did not like its taste or texture, which would make the milk taste sour."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg nåede ikke bussen,"" it is more likely that option B is true, as not reaching the bus implies arriving late at work."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the car was smashed) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sodavandskoppen synger,"" option A (Jeg vendte flasken om) is the most likely cause. The word ""synger"" in Danish means ""to sing,"" so it's unlikely that turning off the bottle would make a singing sound. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Han kravlede ind gennem et åbent vindue) is more likely. The fact that the boy was locked out of his house suggests that there may not be an easy way to climb up to the roof or enter through a window without proper authorization. Therefore, it is more plausible that he would find another means of entering the house, such as through an open window.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dørklokken ringede,"" option A (the visitor knocked on the door) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden har plaget sit jakkesæt,"" it is more likely that he has gotten his jacket dry (Option A). The phrase ""plagede"" in Danish means to wash or clean something thoroughly, so it implies that the man's jacket has been through a thorough cleaning process, such as being washed. Therefore, Option A is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tandpastaen sprøjter ud af røret) is more likely. The premise states that the toothpaste ""sprøjter"" out of the pipe, implying a sudden and forceful release of pressure. This suggests that the toothpaste may have been under high pressure inside the pipe before it bursts out, which is consistent with Option A. On the other hand, Option B (Pigen spyttede tandpastaen ud) implies that the girl spat out the toothpaste intentionally or accidentally, which seems less plausible given the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Civilians died in the war) is more likely. The passage states that ""the number of civilian deaths in the war increased,"" indicating a negative outcome for civilians. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen trak båndet ud af sit hår,"" option A (Hun bandt båndet) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""trak båndet"" implies that something was pulled or tugged on the hair, causing it to come loose or break. Therefore, option A is the best fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Han blev ældre) is the correct answer. The passage states that Han has had plastic surgery, but does not mention anything about him looking younger. Therefore, it is more likely that he has aged as a result of the surgery.
"Response:  Option A: Ægget klokkede.  
Explanation: The premise states that a chicken hatched from an egg. This means that the egg cracked or broke open to allow the chicken to emerge, rather than the chicken itself producing a sound like ""klokkede"". Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fangen sultede,"" it is more likely that Option A (Han døde) is correct. The phrase ""fangen sultede"" implies a severe lack of food or sustenance, which could lead to death if left untreated. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden mistede sin balance på stigen,"" it is more likely that he fell down from the staircase (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet burkede,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Han tog en slurk sodavand"" (He took a drink of soda) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""En kold luftstrøm kom ind gennem vinduet,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Jeg slapper af."" This is because a cold air current entering through the window would cause a sudden drop in temperature, leading to feelings of fatigue or weakness (slapping off)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (her classmates respected her) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen gjorde nar af drengen,"" option B (She was in love with him) is more likely. The phrase ""gjorde nar"" means to play a trick or prank on someone, so it suggests that the girl may have been teasing or flirting with the boy in some way. This could be interpreted as evidence that she had romantic feelings for him."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den sultne vagabond stjal mad,"" option A is more likely. The word ""stjal"" implies a deliberate action taken by the vagabond to obtain food, suggesting that he actively sought out and took something without permission. This aligns with the idea of provoking sympathy or empathy from others through one's actions. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I felt lonely) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (I gave him a slap) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Fyrværkeriet became airborne) is more likely than option B (the frisbee flew towards my head).

Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen bed sine negle,"" it is more likely that she was surprised (option B). The phrase ""bed sine negle"" means ""to be surprised."" Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he has sought for a divorce) is more likely. The husband discovered his wife's infidelity, which led him to seek a divorce rather than firing his lawyer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen tabte gummikugler,"" it is more likely that she ate them (Option A). The verb ""tabte"" means ""ate"" in Danish, so the sentence implies that the girl actually consumed the gummy bears. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hun gættede svaret) is correct. The premise states that Pigen made a mistake on her exam, which could be interpreted as guessing the answer instead of actually knowing it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hans modstander fangede passet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg plukkede tomaterne fra vinstokken,"" it is more likely that option A, ""De var modne,"" is the correct answer. The sentence implies that the tomatoes were already ripe when picked from the vine, rather than being watered by someone."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Han mødte sin ekskæreste til frokost) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jeg tabte termometeret) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Kviksølvet i termometret steg"" implies that something unexpected happened to the thermometer, rather than a change in weather being the cause of the increase in mercury level. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the mercury level increased."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Retsbygningen's tags sprang af) is more likely. The phrase ""tornado kom gennem byen"" suggests that a powerful storm with rotating columns of air (i.e., a tornado) passed through the city, which could potentially cause damage to buildings and infrastructure. It is less likely that the road would become dangerous due to ice, as tornados typically occur in warm weather and are not associated with frozen precipitation."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hans karakterer blev bedre) is true. The passage states that the student received guidance, which suggests that he may have improved his character. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the student's grades improved compared to option B (Han snydte på eksamen), which implies that he cheated on the exam.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg følte mig tryg,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tryg"" means safe or secure in Danish, so it's likely that the person felt comfortable and relaxed rather than nervous or anxious. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg har poleret stenen,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Det blev glat,"" occurred. This is because ""polere"" means to smooth or polish in Danish, so it is logical that the stone became smoother after being polished."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kaffen lugtede stærkt) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden blandede sig gennem papirerne,"" it is more likely that he mixed himself through the papers (Option A). This is because the phrase suggests a physical action of mixing or blending something together, rather than simply tearing them into pieces (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg slog sømmet med hammeren,"" option A is more likely. The word ""slog"" implies a forceful impact, which would cause the spike to penetrate deeper into the wood rather than getting stuck in it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fisken bed i snoret,"" option A is more likely. The word ""bed"" in Danish means to swallow or digest, so it's unlikely that the fisherman caught the fish in his net. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun har fået en bumse) is more likely as a cause for the young boy's reluctance to go to school. The phrase ""flov over"" suggests that he may be feeling anxious or uneasy about something, and having a stomachache (bumse in Danish) could certainly contribute to those feelings. Option B (Hun har fjernet tandbøjlen) does not make sense in this context, as removing a retainer would not have any impact on the boy's mood or ability to attend school."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mit ansigt blev lysere,"" option A (Jeg have gotten good news) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg tørredemine hænder med et håndklæde,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Mine hænder var våde,"" is the correct answer. This is because if you were drying your hands with a towel, it would be unlikely for them to still be wet."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden mistede sin balance på afkroget,"" option A (Stolen vaklede under ham) is the more likely cause. The word ""afkroget"" in Danish means ""sidewalk"" or ""pavement,"" so it's possible that the man lost his balance while walking on a slippery surface. Option B (Han spilde maling på afføringen) does not make sense in this context as there is no mention of painting or any other substance being involved."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that their trainer cancelled the training session rather than them losing their game. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Deres træner aflyste træningen.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg bad om tilgivelse,"" option A (Jeg fortrød min fejl) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Han stillede hende spørgsmål om hende selv) is more likely as it suggests that he asked her questions about herself, indicating an interest in getting to know her better.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that her children reddened (Option A). The word ""rødmede"" in Danish means ""reddened""."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the ship went over a mine) caused the explosion than option B (the ship sailed into the harbor). This is because mines are typically placed underwater to explode when a ship passes overhead, rather than near the shore where a ship would be sailing at a lower height. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the ship exploded.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden punkterede sin fod,"" option A (Han gik ind i en pøl) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (De opdagede mordernes identitet) is more likely. The fact that the police have discovered the murderer's identity suggests that they have found a lead in their investigation, which could potentially point them towards the perpetrator of the crime. Option B (De fandt våbnet på gerningsstedet) does not provide as much insight into the progress of the investigation, and it may be less likely that the police would find a weapon at the crime scene without knowing who committed the murder.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der var meget trafik på motorvejen,"" option B (I asked for a lift) is more likely. The premise suggests that there was heavy traffic on the highway, making it difficult to drive. Asking for a lift would be a practical solution in this situation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (many people were unemployed) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Overgangsvagten blæste i fløjten på børnene,"" option A (De var ved at gå ind i modkørende trafik) is the most likely cause. The vagueness of the phrase ""blæste i fløjten"" suggests that something unexpected or dangerous was happening to the children, rather than a simple recognition from afar."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg vendte øjnene mod min ven,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""vendte øjnene"" means to turn one's eyes towards someone or something, so it suggests that the speaker is looking at their friend. Therefore, option A is a more straightforward interpretation of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Chaufføren var stranded on the road) is more likely. The phrase ""bilen løb tør for benzin"" suggests that the car ran out of gasoline, which could cause the driver to be stranded on the side of the road. It is less likely that the driver would go to find a lift from someone else in this situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden gik i fødsel,"" option A is more likely. The correct answer is (A) Barnet blev født."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mandens hat blev blæst væk,"" it is more likely that option A (Han tog hatten af) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""blæst væk"" implies a sudden and unexpected movement of something away from its original position, which could be caused by someone taking their hat off rather than the wind blowing it away. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why Mandens hat became lost."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She got an invitation) is more likely. The premise states that she was invited to her classmate's birthday party, indicating that someone else took the initiative to extend an invitation rather than her purchasing a gift.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drengens pande var varm,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct, as taking one's temperature is a common medical procedure to measure body temperature. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He wanted to impress his date) is more likely. The fact that he sprayed himself with cologne suggests that he was trying to make a good impression on someone, rather than just having gel in his hair.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I took a shovel) is more likely. The reason being that taking a shovel would be a more practical solution to investigate why the current in the house went out than looking for a flashlight.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (son finished with high school) is more likely to be the cause of the family moving into a larger house.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She saw the finish line) is more likely. The premise states that the runner held a slow pace, indicating that she was conserving energy for the end of the race. Seeing the finish line would be a strong motivator to pick up the pace and sprint towards the end goal, rather than maintaining a steady pace throughout the race.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Machine spit out coins) is more likely. The premise states that ""the machine spewed out coins,"" implying a sudden and uncontrolled release of money from the machine. This is more consistent with a mechanical failure or malfunction than a deliberate action by someone to steal the coins. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Jeg vendte øjnene mod ham) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the context of a person looking at their dead dog.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han skrev en gældsbrev) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden forbandede,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""forbandede"" means cursed or damned in Danish, so it's likely that the man cut his nails rather than stubbed his toe."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden var stolt af sin bror,"" option A (Hans bror kom i skænderi med deres forældre) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She looked at the stars) is more likely. The premise mentions ""pigen"" (the girl), so it's unlikely that she would go to a library to learn about the solar system. Instead, looking up at the stars in the night sky would be a more common way for her to observe and learn about the universe."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg placerede plakaten over døren) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for why the plaque was hung on the wall. Option B (Jeg lagde tape på bagsiden af plakaten) does not provide any logical reason for why the plaque would be placed on the wall. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Arkitekten konstruerede bygningen) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden tabte sin ske,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Hans hånd rystede"" (Hans shook his hand) is the correct answer. This is because the phrase ""tabte sin ske"" suggests that something unexpected or unfortunate happened to the man's hand, which could potentially cause him to shake it in surprise or discomfort."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Bestyrelsen opløste selskabet) is more likely. The reason for this is that the administrering director has resigned, indicating a lack of confidence in the company's leadership or direction. This could lead to a decision by the board of directors to dissolve the company rather than finding a new leader.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jeg gik hen til podiet) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hans family paid his bail) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their house burned down (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg trådte på aluminiumsdåsen,"" it is more likely that option B will occur, as stepping on an aluminum can cause it to break or become crushed. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She learned to communicate) is more likely. The premise states that she joined a debate team, indicating that she became involved in public speaking and communication. While learning to use a computer may be a useful skill for a member of a debate team, it is not directly related to improving her ability to communicate. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the given information.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg lyttede til musik) is more likely to improve one's mood than option B (Jeg vaskede op). Listening to music has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health by reducing stress and anxiety levels, improving mood, and promoting relaxation. On the other hand, washing up may not necessarily have an immediate effect on one's mood, as it is a chore that can be time-consuming and tiring. Therefore, option A is the better choice for improving one's mood based on the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (De gave the homeless food) will result in a higher amount of money being raised than option B (They held an auction). This is because providing food to those in need can evoke strong emotions and create a sense of empathy among donors, leading them to be more willing to contribute financially. In contrast, an auction may not have the same emotional resonance and could potentially attract fewer donations.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Passagerene skreg) is more likely. The phrase ""styrtede ned"" implies a sudden and violent descent, which would likely cause passengers to scream in terror rather than laugh."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg var rasende,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker was angry when they left the house, so it's more likely that they checked their mailbox rather than slammed the door."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden ville se solopgangen,"" it is more likely that he went north (Option A). The phrase ""solopgangen"" refers to the sunrise or dawn, which occurs in the east. Therefore, if the man wanted to see the sunrise, he would need to go north towards the rising sun."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg faldt papiret,"" option B is more likely. The word ""krøllede"" means ""to roll up,"" so it suggests that the paper may have been rolled up after falling. Option A does not provide any information about what happened to the paper after it fell."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ledere from other countries sent nødhjælp) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drengens tøj blev vådt,"" it is more likely that he fell into the pool (Option B). The phrase ""became wet"" suggests that something was immersed in water, which fits better with Option B than Option A."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (the book should be returned to the library) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""Studenten skyndte sig at læse bogen færdig,"" indicating that they wanted to finish reading the book quickly. This suggests that they were interested in completing their task of reading the book, rather than simply borrowing it for a short time and then returning it to someone else. Therefore, it is more likely that they would want to return the book to the library once they had finished reading it."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Forbryderen blev henrettet,"" option A (Han blev smidt i fængsel) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg åbnede gardinerne) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for how the light entered the room. Option B (Jeg låste døren op) does not provide any explanation for why the light would enter the room through the door.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg trak den falske mands hår,"" it is more likely that her wig came off than she was balded. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han found the manuscript convincing) is more likely. The use of ""omformulerede"" in the premise suggests that the editor was able to understand and interpret the manuscript's message effectively, indicating that they found it convincing."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hun indså, at kortet var udløbet) is more likely. The woman realized that her credit card had expired, leading to its cancellation.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden og kvinden forelskede sig,"" it is more likely that they went on a date (Option A). The phrase ""forelskede sig"" means to fall in love or become enamored with someone, which suggests that there was some kind of romantic encounter between the two people mentioned. Going on a date is a common way for people to get to know each other and potentially develop feelings for one another, so this option seems more plausible given the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I composed my own song) is more likely. The author wants to create music that can be heard, so they will compose their own song rather than just turning up the volume.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (The girl has made it stand up) is a more likely cause for why the dog's hair stood up than Option B (The girl pulled it out). This is because the phrase ""Drengens hår stod op"" specifically refers to the hair standing up, implying that it was not pulled or forced in any way. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that the girl did something to make the hair stand up, rather than pulling it out."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Jeg have sprøjet mig med insektmiddel) is the most likely cause for the insect's head being crushed. This is because the use of insecticide can effectively kill an insect by poisoning it, rather than simply stepping on it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg åbnede øjnene,"" option A (Jeg vågnede) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min nabos musik var højt,"" option A is more likely. The speaker is asking their neighbor to turn down the music, indicating that they are being disrupted by it. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no reason for the speaker to ask their neighbor to borrow a CD when they are already bothered by the noise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han var sparsom med sine indtægter) is more likely as it suggests that he was thrifty or stingy with his income, rather than earning a low wage.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han søgte arbejde) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Malingen sprøjkede overalt) is more likely. The premise states that the artist mixed yellow paint with blue paint, which would result in a uniform coverage of both colors rather than creating a green color. Therefore, option A is the most logical choice.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Jeg skiftede samtaleemne) is a more plausible explanation for why the conversation became strained. This means that the speaker changed the subject, rather than the conversation becoming awkward or tense due to external factors. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (gave him a cold shoulder) is more likely. The brother has just been discharged from the hospital, and the speaker may be feeling annoyed or frustrated with their brother's return, leading them to give them a cold reception.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the game's opening scene began) is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Kidnapperen truede med at skade gidslen) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""underkastede sig kidnapperens befalinger"" suggests that the person was compliant with the kidnapper's demands, implying a level of fear or intimidation. Given this context, it is more likely that the kidnapper made threats against the person to gain control over them rather than simply leaving them alone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Et bomm genlød på scenen,"" option A is more likely. The word ""bomm"" in Danish means a drum or percussion instrument, so it's likely that the musician hit his drum rather than tapped his foot."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Barnet vågnede skrigende fra et mareridt) is more likely as a cause of why the parents rushed into their child's room. Mareridts are nightmares that can cause a person to wake up in distress, and it is possible that the child had a particularly intense or disturbing dream that led to their parents entering their room.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (She was born too early) is the correct answer. The premise states that the woman communicated with sign language, indicating that she may have been born with a developmental disability or impairment that affects her ability to speak or hear. Being born too early can increase the risk of developing such impairments. Therefore, option A is more plausible than option B.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der var tørke i området,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Vandet blev forurenet,"" will occur. The premise suggests a lack of water in the area, which could lead to pollution of the remaining water sources. This is a more plausible outcome than Option B, ""Afgrøderne døde,"" as plants are generally more resilient to drought conditions than water sources."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Katten jagede fuglen,"" it is more likely that Option A (Fuglen fløj væk) is correct. The wording of the premise suggests that the cat was chasing the bird, implying a sense of urgency and movement towards the bird's flight. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen skiftede skole,"" it is more likely that she changed schools rather than moving to a new town. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Skolen er fri i sommer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ansatte gik i strejke) is more likely. The premise states that the employees are unwilling to accept a pay raise, which suggests that they may be dissatisfied with their current compensation and could potentially take action such as going on strike to protest. This is in line with Option B, where the employees go on strike. Option A does not align with this scenario as it introduces a new manager without providing any context for why the employees would be unhappy with them.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (He was murdered by extremists) is more likely. The premise suggests that the leader was seen as an enemy by extremist groups in his country, which could lead to violent actions against him. Option A (He was influenced by extremists) does not necessarily imply a negative outcome for the leader.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Waves crashed along the coast) is more likely. The sentence ""Jeg gik barfodet på stranden"" implies that the speaker walked barefoot on the beach, which suggests a sandy surface. Waves crashing along the coast would be more likely to cause discomfort or pain for someone walking barefoot than sand sticking to their feet."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (drank a glass of water) is more likely to have occurred as a result of waking up in the middle of the night and feeling cold. Drinking water would be a common response to this situation. Option A (putting on sweatpants) may also be possible, but it's less directly related to the cause of waking up cold.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Moderen stillede sin søn,"" it is more likely that her son smiled (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Et hul i mine jeans,"" option A is more likely. The word ""lukket"" (closed) suggests that the hole was already there when you put on your pants, rather than something you did while walking outside."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han har fundet et hulrum) is more likely. The premise states that ""Drengen havde tandbøjler,"" which means he had toothaches. This implies that there was a problem with his teeth, which could be caused by a cavity or other dental issue. It's less likely that his teeth simply became straight without any underlying cause. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg trænede i gymnastiksalen i går,"" it is more likely that option A will occur, as training in a gym yesterday would result in sore muscles today. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The pigeon's constant chatter may have made the other students feel ignored or disregarded, leading to a negative impact on their dining experience.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun sprang op i luften igen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Postkontoret leverede brevet) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He satsede alle sine penge) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the wind became stronger) is more likely to have caused the fire to spread. The text states that ""Skovbranden spredte sig,"" indicating that the fire spread, which suggests that there was a factor that allowed it to do so. While brandmændene being arrested could potentially be a factor in the fire's spread, the text does not provide any information to suggest this as a possible cause. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet flåede hans knæ"", it is more likely that his mother sent him to his room rather than bandaging the wound. This is because a child's reaction of sending their parent to their room is more plausible than a parent's action of bandaging a wound inflicted by their child. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he wrote under on his testament) is the correct answer. The premise states that he survived a deadly disease, but does not mention anything about an organ transplantation. Therefore, it is more plausible that he made arrangements for his assets after death through his will rather than receiving an organ transplant.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg tog en slurk af den brændende kaffe,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jeg bed mig i tungen,"" will occur because taking a sip of burning coffee will not directly harm or burn one's tongue, but rather cause discomfort or pain in the mouth due to the heat. On the other hand, biting oneself in the tongue can potentially result in physical injury or harm."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Forfatteren undgik at være partisk i sine historier) is more likely as it suggests that the author was not biased in their stories, which could be seen as a positive trait for a writer. Option B (Forfatteren overså en vigtig deadline) does not necessarily imply anything negative about the author's work or abilities.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg følte mig udmattet,"" it is more likely that option A (Jeg sov hele dagen) is the correct answer. This is because feeling exhausted can be caused by a lack of sleep or rest, which is consistent with Option A. In contrast, studying all day may not necessarily lead to feelings of exhaustion."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun identificerede patientens symptomer) is more likely the correct answer. The premise states that the doctor made a diagnosis, which implies that she identified the patient's symptoms in order to make an informed decision about their health. Option B (Hun ordinerede piller til patienten) does not align with this interpretation of the premise as it suggests that the doctor prescribed medication without first identifying the patient's symptoms.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg klør mig,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Det var svedigt,"" is the correct answer. The word ""klør"" in Danish means to sweat or perspire, so it is likely that the speaker was feeling hot or uncomfortable rather than experiencing pain from a cut."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he lost his passion) is the correct answer. The premise states that the man was operated on, but does not mention any medical conditions or symptoms that would suggest he had a heart attack. Therefore, it is more plausible that the operation affected his emotional state and caused him to lose interest in things he used to enjoy.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mandens armmuskler er udbukket,"" option A (Han bøjde sine arme) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden løftede øjenbrynet,"" option A (Han blev overrasket) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg troede, hans hensigter var gode) is more likely. The speaker assumes that their colleague's intentions are good, rather than assuming they know better. This suggests a positive interpretation of their colleague's actions.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he started exercising more (Option A). The premise states that he stopped smoking, which could potentially lead to an increase in physical activity as a result of feeling healthier or having more energy. Exercising more would be a more plausible explanation for this change than waking up earlier (Option B), as there is no obvious reason why stopping smoking would directly affect his sleep schedule.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Angriberens krop blev livløs) is more likely to occur as a result of being slapped in the nose. The nose is a sensitive area with many nerve endings, and a violent blow to this area can cause serious injury or even death. Therefore, it is unlikely that the person would simply start bleeding without any other injuries.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dart missed the target,"" option A is more likely. The man aimed incorrectly, rather than being drunk or tired."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He discovered rats in his cellar) is more likely. The mention of a ""myrekultur"" suggests that there may be mice or other small rodents present, but it does not necessarily imply the presence of larger animals like rats. Additionally, the fact that Husserl is asking for an exterminator implies that he has noticed a significant infestation, which is more likely to involve rats than mice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Jeg var for træt til at forberunge noget) is the correct answer. The premise states that Jeg foreslog min gæst, at vi sollte ud at spise, indicating that Jeg had proposed or suggested going out to eat. However, since Jeg was too tired to prepare anything, it suggests that Jeg did not have the energy or motivation to plan or organize a meal. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she began to hide her diary (Option A). The fact that her brother caught her reading her diary suggests that she values her privacy and personal space, and may be hesitant to share her thoughts and feelings with others. Therefore, it makes sense that she would take steps to protect her diary from being discovered by her brother or anyone else.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She said up) is more likely. 
Explanation: The premise states that the woman did not have enough money for her rent, indicating that she may have had to find a new place to live. Option B suggests that she decided to leave her current job rather than continue paying for housing she could no longer afford, while option A implies that she worked extra hours without being able to make ends meet."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He rubbed against the warm stove) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for how Barnet got burned. Option B (He petted the horse's head) does not provide any obvious connection to why Barnet would get burned.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (De uddelt en undersøgelse til kunderne) is more likely to be the chosen effect. The company wants to measure customers' satisfaction, so conducting a survey is the most appropriate action. Option A (Offering discounts to new customers) may not directly address the goal of measuring customer satisfaction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trægulvet blev rivet,"" option A is the most likely cause. The word ""rivet"" implies that something was torn or broken apart, which aligns with Option A's description of the boy throwing a pillow from the couch. Therefore, it is more likely that the boy threw the pillow than sliding a chair across the floor (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg beskyttede mit ansigt,"" option A is more likely. The word ""beskyttede"" means to protect or defend something, so it suggests that the speaker was trying to shield their face from an attack. Option B does not fit with this meaning as it refers to a person reaching out to punch someone, which would not be consistent with the idea of defending one's face."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the statue was struck by lightning) is more likely. The idea that a large crowd gathered to worship the statue and it caught fire as a result seems less plausible given the context of the premise. Lightning strikes are a common occurrence in many parts of the world and can easily damage or destroy structures made of stone or other materials.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg glemte frugten på bordet,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Frugten udskyder frø,"" occurred. The word ""glemte"" in Danish means ""forgot,"" so it is unlikely that a fly would have swum over the fruit (option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun pegede på sine tæer) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why the woman's toes were swollen. Pegging one's toes can cause them to become inflamed or bruised, leading to swelling. On the other hand, option B (Hun fik en ankelforvrængning) does not provide a clear explanation for why the woman's toes would be swollen. An ankle sprain may cause pain but not necessarily swelling in the toes. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He learned to tie them) is more likely. The premise states that Barnet had loosened his snow pants, indicating that he was not able to properly fasten them beforehand. Therefore, it is more likely that he did not know how to tie them correctly rather than him running around on the playground.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jeg mistede tidsfornemmelsen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hans forældre påvirkede ham) is more likely. The premise states that Hans had the same beliefs as his parents, indicating that he was influenced by them. This suggests that he was shaped by their views and values, rather than being rejected or neglected by them. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why Hans held the beliefs he did.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the car ran out of gas) caused the bus to slow down. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden spiste is i solen,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""manden spiste"" means ""the man ate,"" and ""isen"" refers to ice cream or frozen yogurt. Therefore, it is unlikely that the man lost his taste buds, as he would not be able to enjoy his frozen treat. Option B, ""Isen drypper fra keglen,"" means ""The ice cream melted from the bucket,"" which does not align with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tæppet saw beskidt out) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg had headache) is more likely as a reason for leaving work early. The premise does not provide any information that would suggest the possibility of a meeting with the boss being the cause. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Hvalpen har snavset tæppet,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - the owner scolded the dog. This is because the word ""snavset"" in Danish implies a negative action or consequence, such as getting into trouble or causing damage, which aligns with the idea of the owner being upset with the dog for making a mess."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg undskyldte mig over for min ven,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Min ven har tilgivet mig,"" is correct. This is because ""undskyldte"" means to apologize or ask forgiveness in Danish, so it is logical that the response would be an expression of forgiveness rather than anger."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden stod ud i mængden,"" it is more likely that he had a neon vest on. The premise suggests that he stood out in a crowd, which could be due to his clothing or appearance. Aryan vest would likely make him stand out more than a backpack."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vidnet løj under ed,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""løj under ed"" implies that Vidnet lied under oath, which could result in him being accused of perjury or contempt of court. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden farvede sit hår,"" option B (Hun ville blande sig ind) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""farvede sit hår"" means ""dyed her hair,"" indicating that the woman made a deliberate change to her appearance. Therefore, it is more likely that she wanted to express herself or stand out in some way rather than simply blending in with others."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (De found work) is more likely. The premise states that the undocumented immigrants were caught ""u..."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that publikum (the audience) laughed at the joke. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg saw into the sun,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""saw into"" implies a direct gaze or look, which could potentially cause damage to one's eyes if they stare at something bright and intense like the sun for too long. Therefore, it is more likely that the person has become temporarily or permanently blinded due to looking directly at the sun rather than being burned by its heat."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg keder mig,"" option A (Jeg snorede) is more likely. The word ""keder"" in Danish means to feel sad or depressed, so it's unlikely that the speaker gave something away. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the knife was dull) caused the steak to be difficult to cut. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hun modtog underholdningsbidrag) is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Lyset i min vens lejlighed var tændt,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jeg tænkte på, om han var ude,"" is correct. This is because the fact that the light in your friend's apartment was turned on suggests that someone may be home, rather than away."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg lagde blomsten under min næse,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Blomsterne faldt af blomsten,"" will occur. The phrase ""under min næse"" implies that the flower was placed close to the speaker's nose, which could cause the flowers to fall off due to gravity or other external factors. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden følte sig nostalgisk,"" option A is more likely. The word ""nostalgisk"" suggests a feeling of longing or wistfulness for something from the past, which could be triggered by running into an old childhood friend. Therefore, option A is the most plausible cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He indsendte papiret tidligt) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min bil gik i stykker,"" option A (Jeg gik i indkøbscenteret) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something unexpected happened to the speaker's car, which would not be related to going to a shopping center."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg smed sedlen væk,"" option A (It was anonymous) is more likely as it suggests that the person who threw away the letter did not want to be identified or held accountable for their actions."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fuglen slog med vingerne,"" option A (Den lagde æg) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Garagen var åben) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Offeret rakte hænderne op) is more likely. The fact that the perpetrator aimed their weapon at its target suggests that they were prepared to use it, and the offer reaching for their hands implies a defensive action in response to the perceived threat.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg saw forward to the weekend,"" option A is more likely. The speaker had planned to attend their uncle's funeral, which suggests that they were looking forward to the weekend for a somber reason rather than a joyful one like a friend's wedding."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg mistede tidsfornemmelsen,"" it is more likely that option A (Jeg var dagdrømmer) is the correct answer. This is because ""mistede"" in Danish can also mean ""lost,"" and ""tidsfornemmelsen"" specifically refers to the ability to remember things from the past. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker lost their memory for the past, rather than feeling queasy or nauseous."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (the printer ran out of ink) caused the document to be printed incorrectly. This is because the document was not printed correctly, indicating a problem with the printing process rather than a lack of paper.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Fansene vendte sig mod flaget) is more likely. The fans turning against the flag suggests a negative reaction to the playing of the national anthem, rather than storming onto the field.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dippen smagte bland,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jeg serverede den,"" is correct. The word ""dipping"" implies a food item being dipped into something else, such as sauce or dressing, rather than having salt added to it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Håndklædet absorbed the liquid) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she bookmarked her place (Option A). The phrase ""afbrudt midt i sin bog"" implies that she was in the middle of reading a book when something interrupted her, so it is unlikely that she would have to start over from the beginning again. Bookmarking her place would be a more practical solution if she needed to stop reading abruptly."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Flyet ramte turbulensen,"" option A (the man strapped his seatbelt) is more likely. The premise suggests that the flight encountered turbulence, which could cause discomfort or even injury to passengers if they are not properly secured. Therefore, it is more likely that the man would have taken precautions such as fastening his seatbelt to ensure his safety during the turbulent flight."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drengen rystede,"" option B is more likely. The word ""rystede"" means to push or shove, so it's likely that the girl pushed or shoved the boy in response to his touching her. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De amputerede hendes ben) is more likely. The premise states that ""Lægerne gav patienten et kunstigt lem,"" which means that they gave her an artificial limb. Amputation of a limb would be a common reason for giving someone an artificial one. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen klemt pigen's albue,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""klemt"" means ""squeezed"" or ""pressed,"" so it is likely that the girl was squeezed by something or someone. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of her arm being pulled away from him."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I knew I was right) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drengen trådte i mudder,"" it is more likely that mudderet klistrede sig fast i hans sko (Mudder stuck to his shoes). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the boy stepped into mud, which would cause mud to splatter onto his shoes rather than hitting him in the face. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Folk gemte sig under jorden) is more likely. The idea of people hiding underground to escape the snow is a common trope in fiction, particularly in winter-themed stories or films set in cold climates. It's less likely that schools would be closed due to a few centimeters of snow, as this is not an uncommon occurrence in many parts of the world where snowfall is frequent.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Arbejderens vagt er slut,"" option A (Han tog hjem for dagen) is more likely. The phrase ""arbejderens vagt"" typically refers to a worker's shift or workday, so it suggests that the person in question has finished their work and gone home for the day. Option B (""Han truede med at sige op"") means ""He threatened to quit,"" which does not align with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Træet beskadigede huset,"" option A is more likely. The word ""beskadigede"" implies damage to the house, which could be caused by a falling tree. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg stak brænde i pejset) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for how the tree was divided into two parts. Option B (Jeg svingede øksen ned til træet) does not provide any clear reason for why the tree would be divided in half.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Parret meddelte, at de var ved at skille) is more likely to be the correct answer. The fact that the couple is ""lykønsket"" suggests that they are happy together, and there is no indication in the premise that they are considering separation or divorce. Therefore, it is more likely that they will continue their relationship rather than breaking up."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun kunne lide ham) is more likely. The use of the verb ""kunne"" in this context implies a possibility or potential for affection, rather than an actual display of affection through kissing. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg nikkede med hovedet over min vens udtalelse,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jeg var forvirret,"" is the correct cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De ville finde et kompromis) is more likely. The premise states that ""Vennerne kastede en mønt,"" which implies a random or unplanned event. Finding a compromise would require deliberation and negotiation, which are not necessarily immediate responses to an unexpected event like throwing a coin. Therefore, option A is more likely given the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Manden losser købmandsprodukter i køleskabet) is more likely. The man is in the kitchen, and he is unpacking groceries from the store, which suggests that he is preparing food or cooking something. Option B (Manden tog pizzaen ud af ovnen) does not fit with the premise as it implies that the man took a pizza out of the oven, which is unlikely given the context provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The woman worked hard to achieve her goal.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Den rige mand døde af alderdom,"" it is more likely that Option A (Hans søn fik lovlige problemer) is correct. The phrase ""døde af alderdom"" suggests that the rich man died of old age, implying that he was already wealthy and successful in life. Therefore, his son inheriting legal problems would be less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden trådte på flammerne,"" it is more likely that Option A: Flammerne gik ud will occur. The phrase ""trådte på"" implies a direct action of stepping onto something, which suggests that the woman's body made contact with the flames. As a result, it is unlikely that Option B: Røg steg op from the flames will occur, as there is no indication in the premise that the smoke rose from the flames. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Flammerne gik ud (The flames went out)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvindens bil var i værkstedet,"" option A (Hendes kørekort blev inddraget) is the more likely cause. This is because the fact that her car was at the garage suggests that she may have had a problem with it, such as needing repairs or maintenance, which could result in her losing her driver's license. Option B (Hun var ude for en bilulykke) does not provide any information about why her car was at the garage, so it is less likely to be the cause of her lost driver's license."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg svøv igennem min alarm,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Jeg gik glip af morgenmaden,"" occurred. The use of the verb ""svøv"" suggests a lack of attention or focus, which could lead to forgetting or skipping breakfast."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kameraene blinkede i hans retning) is more likely. The fact that the public figure has stepped out of the limousine suggests that they are in a position to be photographed or filmed, and the camera crews would likely be focused on them rather than their family members.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden blev i badekarret,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Badet blev lunkent,"" occurred. This is because the phrase ""Kvinden blev i badekarret"" implies that a person was submerged in water, which could cause them to become disoriented or unconscious. It is less likely that they would be able to empty the bathtub of water themselves. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han gik med i et broderskab) is more likely. The premise mentions that the student wants to meet other students on campus, which suggests that he may be looking for social opportunities or a sense of community. Joining a fraternity could provide him with this opportunity, as it often involves networking and socializing with other members. Option B (Han har en ingeniøruddannelse) does not necessarily relate to meeting other students on campus, so it is less likely to be the correct answer based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg løftede sofaen op,"" option A (Jeg ledte after small change) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vespen fløj mod drgen"", it is more likely that option A will occur - the boy ran away."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was sentenced to community service (Option A). The sentence of death (Option B) is unlikely as it is not a common punishment in most legal systems.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Teen dampede) is more likely. When sugar dissolves in hot tea, it can cause the tea to become cloudy or opaque due to the formation of a gel-like substance called ""tea jelly."" This phenomenon is known as ""tea blooming"" or ""tea settling,"" and it occurs when the soluble solids in the tea, including sugars, are unable to dissolve completely in the hot liquid. As a result, the tea may appear cloudy or milky, rather than clear. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (He was called to war) is more likely as a cause for his veteran status.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Politiet jagtede forbryderen) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Laptop didn't turn on,"" option A (Jeg tabte den) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hun skabte sig en omfattende garderobe) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman ran out of space in her closet. Creating a comprehensive wardrobe would require purchasing or organizing multiple items of clothing, shoes, accessories, etc., which could result in running out of space in one's closet. On the other hand, option B (Han har lagt sit vasketøj sammen) does not provide a clear reason for why the woman ran out of space in her closet, as laundry is typically washed and folded before being put away, rather than accumulating in a closet.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden var knust i hjertet,"" option B (Hans kone forlod ham) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""var knust i hjertet"" suggests that something has caused a deep emotional hurt or trauma to the man, which could be the reason why his wife left him."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hans jobtilbud blev trukket tilbage) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hans stemme kunne tydeligt høres i hele salen) suggests that Hans' voice was audible throughout the entire hall. Therefore, it is more likely that he greeted the audience rather than spoke into the microphone. So, the correct answer is Option A: He greeted the audience.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg kastede en mønt i vandfontenen,"" it is more likely that the coin will sink to the bottom of the fountain rather than break into two pieces. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Spilleren slår bolden mod hullet,"" option A is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that the ball was hit towards the hole, so it's more likely that the ball went in than that the player retreated back to the speaker."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg åndede støvet op på loftet,"" option A (Jeg hikkede) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (Kunden brugte falske penge) is the correct answer. The fact that the customer's money was not found in their possession suggests that they may have used counterfeit money to pay for the items.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pølset fik køkkenet til at lugte danny) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the kitchen would start to smell bad after taking out the trash.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Børnene jagtede dyrene) is more likely. The premise suggests that the children were actively engaged in hunting or chasing animals at the zoo, which implies a sense of aggression or competition rather than simply admiring them.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Hans's newers swigted) is the correct answer. The word ""åndede"" in Danish means to feel or sense something, so it suggests that Hans was experiencing some kind of sensation or feeling that caused him to cry out. It does not necessarily imply that his lungs were blocked or that he had difficulty breathing, which would be the implication of option B. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why Hans cried out."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I asked my friend if he was interested in going) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Jeg åbnede vinduerne) is more likely to be the correct answer as it provides a logical explanation for how the problem was solved. Option A (Jeg tog tæpper med) does not provide any clear solution to the problem of the air conditioning breaking down in the house.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drengen har ondt i ryggen,"" option B is more likely. The fact that he has back pain suggests that his rygsæk was heavy, rather than being open."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (It was her birthday) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a bumblebee stung the gardener) is more likely to be the cause of the destruction of the narcisse and hyacinth bulbs in the garden. This is because a bumblebee's sting can potentially harm or kill plants, while an eagle's digging would not have the same effect. Therefore, it is more plausible that a bumblebee stung the gardener rather than an eagle dug up the bulbs.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg slog tændstikken,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Flammen gik ud,"" will occur. The act of striking a match creates friction, which can cause the match to go out rather than create a flame."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De ville ikke diskutere det i retten) is more likely. The fact that the couple reached a settlement suggests that they were willing to compromise and find a resolution outside of court, rather than continuing to fight in legal proceedings.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Their parents died) is more likely to be the cause of why the children were sent to boarding school. This is because the death of one or both parents is a common reason why children are placed in foster care or other forms of out-of-home care. On the other hand, Option B (Their parents kicked them out) may not be as plausible given that it is less common for parents to abandon their children without any external factors contributing to their decision.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that a tsunami occurred (Option A). The phrase ""en meteor faldt i hav"" suggests that an object fell into the sea, which could potentially cause a tsunami if it was large enough. It does not necessarily imply that there was a storm or rough seas."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hun gik i panik) is more likely. The premise states that the woman was ""stødte"" upon a poisonous snake, which implies sudden surprise or shock. In this situation, it is more likely that she would experience fear and panic rather than becoming dehydrated."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Oven became warm,"" option A is more likely. The premise suggests that something caused the oven to heat up, and option A states that the speaker turned it on, making it a more plausible explanation for why the oven became warm."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg klemte citronen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Citronen blev skummet"" (The lemon was squeezed) is correct."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Landet koloniserede landet) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Den gik i stykker over hele gulvet) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bordet vaklede,"" option A (Gulvet var ujævnt) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hans søn tilstod sandhiden) is more likely. The father caught his son lying, so it's likely that the son admitted to telling a lie.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mandens hoved bankede af smerte,"" it is more likely that he took aspirin (Option B) to relieve his headache rather than taking hostesaft (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Toget sænkede hastigheden,"" option A is more likely. The train is approaching the station, which means its speed has decreased as it prepares to stop at the platform. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Han had a family history of mental illness) is the correct answer. The mention of ""terapy"" suggests that Han may have been seeking help for a psychological issue, and a family history of mental illness can increase the risk of developing mental health problems. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Kvinden greb om halsen,"" it is more likely that she grabbed her throat than that she swallowed her food. Therefore, option A (Hun slugte sin mad) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Hun talte med accent) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the dog looked at the juicy steak on the table. Therefore, option A (the dog dragged) is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvindens forretning lykkedes,"" it is more likely that she fired her employees rather than becoming rich. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eleverne forlod klasseværelset,"" option A (Klokken ringede) is more likely as a cause of the event."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (her acquaintances expressed doubt) is more likely. The fact that her acquaintances did not believe her claim suggests that they found it hard to accept that she had seen a ghost. This is in line with human psychology, where people tend to be skeptical of claims that are difficult to explain or are outside their worldview.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden mistede hørelsen,"" option A (he nearly drowned in the sea) is a more plausible explanation for why he lost his hearing than option B (he was nearly killed in an explosion). Therefore, I would choose Option A as the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Barnet lod balloonstregen gå"", it is more likely that option A, ""Ballonen er tømt,"" is correct. The word ""tømt"" means ""emptied"" in Danish, so if the balloon has been emptied, it would not be able to fly. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he got a stroke) caused him to lose his ability to speak. The premise states that he suddenly lost the ability to talk, which suggests a sudden and unexpected event such as a stroke. Taking a deep breath or experiencing an emotional shock may not be sufficient to cause permanent loss of speech.
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (there was a crack in the concrete) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Kvinden snublede på fortovet"" suggests that the woman tripped or stumbled on the sidewalk, which could potentially result in a crack in the concrete. Option B (""Hun hørte sit navn blive kaldt"") means ""She heard her name being called,"" which does not provide any contextual clues related to the scenario described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Manden has gennemblødt redningsmanden) is more likely. The word ""kastede"" in the premise implies a forceful action, and the phrase ""gennemblødt"" suggests that something liquid-like (such as water or blood) has passed through or surrounded something else. Therefore, it is more likely that the man's body would be submerged in water rather than him simply jumping into the pool after the cannonball."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg tog antibiotika,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Min infektion er væk,"" is correct. Taking antibiotics can help to eliminate or reduce an infection, so this outcome is consistent with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that chaufføren trykkede på bremsen (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I have submerged the beaker in hot water) is more likely to melt the plastic holder. When a material is exposed to high temperatures, it can undergo thermal degradation or melting. In this case, if the beaker was placed in hot water, the temperature inside the beaker would increase, causing the plastic holder to soften and potentially melt. On the other hand, Option B (I laid the beaker on the hot stove) may not result in sufficient heat transfer to melt the plastic holder, as the heat from the stove may not penetrate deeply enough into the beaker to affect the plastic holder.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bilen fik buer,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""fik buer"" means ""got a flat tire,"" indicating that the driver had a mechanical failure while driving. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the driver crashed into a telephone pole."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen studerede hele natten,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Han sprang eksamen,"" is correct. The word ""sprang"" in Danish means to pass or to succeed, so it would make sense that if someone studied all night, they might have passed their examination. Option B, ""Han bestod eksamen,"" also means ""He passed his examination,"" but it does not convey the same sense of sudden success as option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He was afraid to learn how to swim) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the young boy was hesitant or scared to get close to the edge of the bathtub, implying a fear of water or learning how to swim. This is more plausible than Option B (The lifeguard was on duty), as there is no indication in the premise that a lifeguard was present.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg kunne mærke mit hjerte) is more likely. The premise mentions that the speaker's hand was placed on their chest, indicating that they could feel their heartbeat. Option B (Mit hjerte slog hurtigere) does not align with this physical sensation and is therefore less likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mit kontor var støjende) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (familien inviterede naboerne over til middag) is more likely. The family wants to get to know their new neighbors, so they are likely to extend an invitation for a meal or other social gathering. This would allow them to build rapport and establish a positive relationship with their neighbors from the start.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vand sprøjtede op fra poolen,"" option A is more likely. The water was sprayed up from the pool, indicating that someone or something had entered the pool. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg bed i et stykke vandmelon,"" option A (Jeg slugte et frø) is the most likely outcome. This is because biting into a piece of watermelon would not typically result in losing a tooth, but rather chewing or consuming something else could potentially cause dental damage."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dringen snublede,"" option A is more likely. The word ""snublede"" means to make a mistake or to do something wrong, so it suggests that there was an error in the way the dog's collar was fastened, rather than the dog simply getting its jacket caught on something. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (she was distracted by noise) is more likely. The premise states that she has put earplugs in, indicating that she is trying to block out noise. This suggests that she may have been distracted or bothered by something else, rather than having gotten piercings in her ears.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg har fyldt min vandflaske op,"" it is more likely that option A (Jeg drak alt vandet i den) is the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker has filled their water bottle up, implying that there was already water in the bottle to begin with. Therefore, it is unlikely that the speaker would have drained all of the water from the bottle, making option B (Jeg gemte den i køleskabet) less plausible."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the show contained vulgar language) is the correct answer. The mention of ""censorship"" suggests that the content of the show was not suitable for all audiences due to its language or tone, rather than a complex plot."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the crew drowned) is more likely. The premise states that ""Skibet er blevet ødelagt,"" which implies that the ship sank, resulting in the death of the crew by drowning. Pirates are not mentioned in the premise, making option B less likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Han bad om et hint) is more likely. The use of the word ""forvirret"" suggests that the character is confused or perplexed by the riddle, rather than having solved it. Asking for a hint implies that the character does not yet have the solution and needs additional guidance to progress."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Telefonen ringede"", option A (Manden lagde på) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kvinden stirrede på mig,"" option A is more likely. The woman's gaze implies a sense of intimacy or attention towards the speaker, which could lead to feeling uncomfortable or self-conscious (option B). Therefore, option A is the most appropriate response."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They took pictures of the exhibitions) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden begyndte at skændes med mig,"" option B (Min ven stod op for mig) is more likely."
"Response:  Option A (Jeg pumpede luft i dækket).
Explanation: The premise ""Dækket på min cykel var plat"" implies that there was a flat tire. Pumping air into the tire would be the most likely solution to this problem, making option A the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen så bleg ud,"" it is more likely that her father touched her face than read a story to her. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pennen løb tør for blæk,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Jeg brugte en blyant,"" occurred. This is because a pen running out of ink would be a logical consequence of using it to write something."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He was in debt) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen blev hjemme fra skolen,"" it is more likely that she had a headache (Option A). The premise does not provide any information about her needing to learn mathematics (Option B), so this option is less plausible given the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Jeg smed dennedown in the sink) is more likely to be the correct answer as it aligns with the context of the situation. The character would not take something they found in a dumpster into their own trash can, but rather dispose of it immediately by throwing it away.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg støvsugede tæppet,"" it is more likely that Option A (Min bofælle spildte punch) is the correct answer. The phrase ""støvsugede tæppet"" suggests that something was messy or dirty, which aligns with the idea of someone spilling punch. It does not make sense for a person's hair to fall off due to cleaning the carpet."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Han smed en stol over i værelset) is more likely. The premise states that ""Manden mistede sin temperament,"" which implies a sudden and unexpected loss of emotional control, rather than a deliberate action like turning off a computer. Smeding a chair across the room would be a more violent and impulsive act, consistent with the idea of losing one's temper."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pigen kastede en gren i lejrbålet,"" option A (Kvisten brændte) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden kom ud af badet,"" option A is the most likely cause - warm water was gone. "
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (De have opsparet penge til skolepenge) will occur. The parents want their children to go to university, so they have saved money for tuition fees. This suggests that they are financially prepared to support their children's education.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden løste sit sko,"" option A (Skoene slap af) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han kølede resten) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Min ankel var hævet,"" it is more likely that option A (Jeg lagde is på den) occurred, as ice can help reduce swelling."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Jeg talte med min kollega ved mitt skrivebord) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jeg måtte stå i kø,"" option A (Jeg satte mig) is more likely. The phrase ""måtte"" implies that something was necessary or unavoidable, so it's unlikely that Jeg would have chosen to sit down instead of standing in line."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Manden slog på flugen,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Fuglen gik"" (The bird flew away) is correct."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Han var døden) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He accelerated his tempo) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I found a solution) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He was begejstret) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He has set a wager with his friends) is more likely. The fact that he has placed a bet suggests that he is invested in the outcome of the game and wants to see his team win. This motivation aligns better with the idea of someone wanting their favorite team to succeed than simply meeting up with friends to watch the game together.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He set his alarm clock) is more likely. The premise states that the boy could not fall asleep, so it is unlikely that he would have talked to a sheep or set an alarm clock if he was unable to sleep.
