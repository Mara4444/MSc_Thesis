Option B is also not possible as it goes against the given information that their parents do not approve of their marriage. Hence, neither of these options can occur based on the given information."
"Response: 
解釋:  According to the passage, ""this building was donated to this billionaire."" Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the billionaire wants to tear down the building."
"Response:

"Response: 
解釋:  According to the passage, there was a ""controversial decision"" made by the court, which suggests that there is disagreement or debate about the ruling. Therefore, option A, ""法庭前爆发了一场骚乱,"" is less likely to occur because it implies a violent reaction to the decision, whereas the passage only mentions a ""controversial decision."" Similarly, option B, ""一对夫妻在法院门前交换了誓言,"" does not align with the information provided in the passage, as it describes a romantic moment rather than any reaction to the court's decision."
"Response: 
解釋:  According to the passage, ""she heard something was burning"", which implies that there is a smell of smoke or fire coming from somewhere. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that she took the bread out of the can to investigate the source of the smell.

解釋: 因為這是一句中文句子，不能直接使用英文評估技術來分析。在中文句子中，“预设”和“选择”都可以表示“predict”或“choose”，但是它们的意思不同。“预设”通常指的是根据已知情报或经验预测未来发生的事件或情况，而“选择”则指的是根据已知情报或经验选择某个方法、solution等。因此，在这句话中，“预设”和“选择”都不太合適。"
"Response: 
解釋:  According to the passage, there are two possible reasons why people in the building were evacuated: either the elevator stopped operating or a fire alarm sounded. However, since the passage does not provide any information about which of these events occurred first, it is impossible to determine which reason is more likely. Therefore, both options (A and B) are equally plausible and cannot be ruled out based on the given information."
"Response: 
解釋:  According to the premise, the father hates his son's drinking habit and wants him to stop. Therefore, option A is more likely to occur, as the father buying his son a beer would encourage or enable his son's behavior rather than helping him stop.

這是一個錯誤的選擇題，因為預設的情況不符合選項中的任何一個。 

Answer: There is no correct answer.

Explanation:
The given situation does not match any of the options provided. The default scenario is ""I stepped on a can."" which means that the can was already in place and the speaker stepped on it.

"Response: 
解釋:  The sentence ""When I left home, I checked my email"" and ""When I left home, I slammed the door shut"" are both grammatically correct, but they convey different meanings.

Therefore, the answer is (D) None of the above."
"Response: 
解釋:  According to the passage, ""陽光照進了房間"" (sunlight entered the room), which means that there is already light in the room. Therefore, option A cannot be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker opened the window to let more light in, which is not necessary since there is already light in the room. Similarly, option B cannot be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker opened the door to let more light in, but the passage does not mention anything about the door being open or closed."
"Response: 
解釋:  According to the passage, ""she"" is a scammer who has been pretending to be someone else online.

"Response: 
解釋:  According to the passage, ""the boy's hair stood up"" and ""she pulled it."" These two phrases suggest that there are external forces acting on the hair, causing it to stand up or be pulled.

Therefore, option A (the girl's hair grew long) and option B (the girl pulled it) are not supported by the information provided in the passage."

Therefore, neither of these options is more likely to happen based on the information provided in the passage."

解釋:  According to the passage, ""孩子落在蹦床上"" means that the child is sleeping on a bed.
