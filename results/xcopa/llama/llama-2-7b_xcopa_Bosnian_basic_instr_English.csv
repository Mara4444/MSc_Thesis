"Response:  Based on the premise ""Predmet je bio upakovan u foliku sa mjehurićima,"" option A (Bio je krhki) is the most likely cause. The use of the word ""krhki"" suggests that the object was fragile or delicate, which could explain why it broke easily when packed in a folder with small balls."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ispraznio sam džepove,"" Option A (Pronašao sam karticu) is more likely. The word ""kartica"" means ""card"" in English, so it's likely that the speaker found a card or something similar in their wallet rather than a weapon."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that termites have nested in the house (Option A). The sentence mentions ""Termiti su napali kuću,"" which implies that they are inside the house rather than outside.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Patrolni agent them has accused of smuggling) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (It was a holiday) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the sentence ""Kancelarija je bila zatvorena"" implies that something unusual or unexpected has happened, such as a holiday or other event that would close an office. It does not provide any indication of the time of year, so Option B (It was summer) is less likely to be the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Devojka je uštempila nos."", option A is more likely. The word ""uštempila"" means to blow one's nose, so it is unlikely that beba would have spilled something on her bag or tickled her nose with a feather. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Publika je pljeskala уз muziku. "
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Devojka je ostala posle škole zbog kazne) is more likely.

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Umorili su se od svađe) is more likely. The passage states that the couple ""odlučio [sic] da napravi kompromis,"" indicating that they made an effort to resolve their disagreement.

Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause of their ability to compromise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Unajmila je menadžera kampanje) is more likely. 
"Response: 
Option B: Putovao je sa velikim koferom. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the man expected it to be cold during his trip. Therefore, he would be more likely to pack warm clothing in a large suitcase rather than putting on warm clothes."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Uhvatio je studenta kako vara) is more likely as the reason for the teacher's anger towards the student. The premise suggests that the teacher has caught the student cheating, which is a serious offense in academic settings. Option B (Odgovori studenta su bili pogrešni) does not align with the context provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pauza da prestanem da pričam,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""izgubio sam glas"" means ""lost my voice."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Stavio sam ga u mikrovalnu) caused the frozen food to thaw. This is because microwaves are a common household appliance used for heating and reheating food, and they can quickly thaw frozen items. In contrast, option B (Pokriven je plastičnom folijom) does not provide any specific information about how the frozen food was stored or handled, and it could potentially be due to other factors such as exposure to heat or moisture. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause based on the given premise.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pubika is excitedly clapping) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izgubio sam strpljenje,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker has lost patience, which implies a sense of urgency or impatience. Option B does not convey this same sense of urgency, as it simply states that the friend arrived at the appointed time without any additional context. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (they have developed nuclear weapons) is more likely. The premise states that ""Ratne zemlje su željele mir,"" indicating a desire for peace, but developing nuclear weapons would be a means of achieving military superiority and deterrence, rather than a direct path to peace."
"Response: 
Option B: Imao je groznicu."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that her knee was injured (Option B).

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A is correct - ""Breskvica je modrica.""

Therefore, the sentence makes sense when translated to English as ""I have bitten an apple."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ruke su mi se zalijepile,"" option A (Ja sam jeo krafnu) is the more likely cause. The word ""krafnu"" means ""sweet tooth"" in Serbian, indicating that the speaker has a strong desire for sweets. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker's excessive consumption of sweets led to their teeth becoming loose."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gurao sam vrata"", option A is more likely. The word ""gurao"" means to open or unlock, so it is more likely that the doors are open rather than closed."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Proizvodi su testirani za osiguranje kvalitete) is more likely. The passage states that activists have boycotted products, indicating that there are concerns about the quality of these products. Testing for quality control would be a way to address these concerns and ensure that the products meet certain standards. Option B (Proizvodi su proizvedeni kroz dječiji rad) does not provide any information about quality control or testing, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that a mouse came out of the hole (Option A). The reason for this is that mice are known to create holes in walls, so it makes sense that one might come out of a hole that someone has created.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Stavio sam predpasnik) is correct. The word ""predpasnik"" means ""underwear"", so if you have put on your underwear, it would be unlikely to change your shirt or dress. Therefore, option A is a more plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kupac je pretražio njezin novčanik) is more likely as it implies that the customer checked her purse for money after realizing she had lost it. This is a more logical explanation than option B (Kupac joj dao novac), which suggests that the customer gave her money without any indication in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ljudi su mu dali sitnicu) is more likely. The phrase ""privukao gomilu"" suggests that a large crowd has gathered around him, implying that he has attracted attention or admiration from others. Option A aligns with this interpretation by suggesting that people have given him money as a sign of appreciation for his music. Option B, on the other hand, implies that he has simply let go of the crowd, which does not fit with the context provided in the premise."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the riba has jumped out of the aquarium (Option A). The phrase ""posrcalo hranu"" implies that something unexpected or unusual happened to the food in the aquarium, rather than the fish swimming towards the food (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Prebacila je stranku) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The text states that ""Lavabo u kupatilu je bio začepljen,"" indicating that something has clogged or blocked the sink in the bathroom. Option B suggests that the speaker may have accidentally poured hot water down the drain, causing a blockage. This is a plausible explanation for why the sink would be clogged, whereas option A is less likely as it implies that the speaker intentionally set fire to the sink, which seems unlikely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Putnici su sišli iz voza"", option A (Vlak je stigao na stanicu) is the more likely cause."
"Response: 
Option B: Zatvorio je kovertu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, a person has pressed down on a wet blanket cover. This means that the cover has been compressed or flattened, which can cause it to become wetter. Therefore, option B, ""Zatvorio je kovertu,"" is more likely as it implies that the person has closed or covered the blanket, causing it to become even wetter. Option A, ""Stavio je pečat na kovertu,"" does not make sense in this context as a stamp would not have any effect on the wetness of the blanket."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Uživali su u međusobном društvu) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that she was otpusted from her position as accountant. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

The sentence ""Čuo sam da sat otkucava"" implies that the speaker heard the sound of the clock striking, rather than wanting to check the time. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (My wife and I held hands) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for how someone could have gotten their head stuck in a tree. It's unlikely that they would be able to write an essay by themselves while in this position.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Želela je da gleda zalasak sunca) is more likely. The woman wanted to see a solar eclipse, not a lightning storm.
"Response:  Option B: Voda je bila plitka. 
Explanation: According to the premise, ""čovek je nosio spasioci sako u vodi,"" which means ""a man was carrying a spasioci sac in water."" Since the word ""spasioci"" refers to a type of diving equipment used for breathing underwater, it can be inferred that the person was indeed swimming or diving in the water. Given this context, option B - ""Voda je bila plitka"" (The water was shallow) - is the more likely cause, as it would make sense that someone could carry such an item while swimming or diving in relatively shallow water."
"Response: 
Option B: She pressed the backspace key."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dobila je lošu ocenu) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trava je bila blata"", option A is more likely. The fact that there was rain overnight suggests that the grass was wet, rather than being full of dung (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she overslept because she forgot to set her alarm clock (Option B). The premise states that ""Žena je prespavala,"" indicating that she slept for a long time, implying that she did not wake up at the usual time. It is unlikely that she would have fallen asleep in a hotel room without any prior indication of her sleeping schedule being disrupted."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the researchers have withdrawn their theory (Option A). The passage states that ""the researchers have been unable to replicate"" their findings, indicating that they have not been able to confirm or verify their original results through further experiments or observations. This suggests that they may have re-evaluated their initial hypothesis and decided to withdraw or retract their theory. Therefore, Option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the game has gone into overtime) is more likely as it suggests that there was a tie score at the end of regular time, leading to an extension of the match beyond the standard duration. Option B (the referee made a bad call) does not align with this premise as it implies a mistake by the official rather than a tied score.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Uveo sam kombinaciju na bravu,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker has closed a combination lock, implying that they have the key to open it. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of someone else opening the lock."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Grupa se pojačala"", option A is more likely. The word ""pojačala"" suggests that something has become stronger or more intense, so it's more likely that the father gave his son some money rather than physically grabbing him."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kajakeri su veslali vesla,"" option A is more likely. The word ""vesla"" means to row in Croatian, so it's unlikely that a kayak would have reached the shore without someone paddling it there. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Udarila se u ogradu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl lost control of her bike. Since she was unable to maintain control, it is more likely that she collided with a fence than let go of the handlebars."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Osetio sam kako hladni vazduh prolazi preko mene) is more likely. The passage states that there is a cold breeze passing through the speaker's body, indicating that they are feeling chilly or cool air. This suggests that the speaker is in a cold environment where warmth is needed, rather than being wet with water as suggested by option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They were wet) is more likely. The premise states that they returned to the beach, implying that they had been away from the beach for some time, and therefore would have gotten wet while at sea. Option B (They saw a shark) does not align with this reasoning as it implies that they were already near the shore when they saw the shark, which contradicts the idea of them having been away from the beach for some time.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that water came out of the sink (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he will opt for Option A - ""Optužio ju je za nevjeru"". This is because the man feels guilty about cheating on his wife, which suggests that he may be defensive or aggressive towards her. Opting to accuse her of infidelity rather than admitting his own wrongdoing aligns with this character's motivation and emotional state."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Cekao sam da se tinte osuše) is the correct answer. The reason being that ""tinta"" in this context refers to a paint or dye stain, which would not be affected by rain but rather by drying time. Therefore, the speaker is more likely waiting for the stain to fully dry before touching up the posters."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dijete se probudilo vrišteći,"" option A is more likely. The child woke up with a nightmare, indicating that it had a bad dream. This is supported by the fact that children often have nightmares during their sleep, especially during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the child woke up screaming."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dečak je stavio noge na sto."", option B is more likely. The boy put his feet on the table, indicating that he has learned to stand up by himself. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he set up a tent (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Želela je da nauči o drugim kulturama) is more likely. The woman's desire to learn about other cultures suggests that she may have been motivated by a sense of curiosity or interest in exploring new experiences, rather than simply wanting to learn how to draw.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his colleague got a promotion) is more likely to be the cause of his jealousy.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person experienced hallucinations (Option A). The reason for this is that the phrase ""čovek je vidio vanzemaljce"" directly translates to ""a man saw an alien,"" indicating a supernatural or paranormal occurrence rather than something that could be caused by meditation. Hallucinations are a common symptom of various mental health conditions, neurological disorders, and certain medication side effects, but they are not typically associated with meditation practice. Therefore, Option A seems like a more plausible explanation based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kosa mu je postala plava,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Stavio je belivač u nju,"" is the correct answer. The word ""belivač"" means shampoo in Serbian, so it is likely that the person put shampoo into their hair rather than a different colorant like blue dye."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Osetila je udar inspiracije) is more likely. The artist created a new work because she was inspired by something, rather than criticizing her previous work or feeling uninspired.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (On je otpušten iz vojske) is more likely as the reason for Sin's departure from home. The premise states that Sin left his house without any belongings, indicating a sudden and unexpected departure. Being fired or laid off from work would be a significant life change that could lead to such an action, especially if Sin did not have enough time to prepare or gather his belongings. In contrast, going to college implies a more gradual and planned transition, which may not result in such a drastic move. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (police are buried in books) is more likely. The phrase ""knjige su pale sa police"" means that there are a lot of books at the police station, implying that they have a large collection or archives. It does not suggest that the police officers themselves are buried underneath the books, but rather that there are many books present in their workplace. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ja sam upalio svjetlo) is the correct answer. The phrase ""moja kuća"" implies a personal possession or ownership, and ""nestalo struje"" specifically refers to the loss of electricity in one's home. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would be responsible for turning off the lights themselves, rather than resetting a circuit breaker."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It looked frightening) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ja sam ulivao maslac u torbu) is more likely as it suggests that the person was carrying a bag with mayonnaise in it when it started to leak. Option B (Zagrijao sam ga u mikrotalasnoj) means ""I heated it up in a microwave"" and does not fit the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (U komšiluku je nestalo struje) is the most likely outcome. The statement ""Drvo je palo na strujnu vod"" implies that there was a power outage in the area, which could cause appliances to malfunction or stop working. It does not suggest that there was a strong wind that caused trees to fall. Therefore, option A is the best answer."

Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Znoj mi je kapljao sa lica) is more likely to occur as it suggests that the girl's tears are falling onto Sam's face. Option B (Na mom prstu je formirala kap krvi) does not make sense in this context as it implies that the girl's blood is forming a cap on her mother's finger, which is unlikely. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he drowned (Option B). The fact that his body was found at the surface of the reservoir suggests that he may have fallen into the water accidentally or intentionally, but since he did not resurface, he would have eventually succumbed to drowning rather than being eaten by a fish.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (he was too cold) is a more likely cause for his hoarse voice than Option B (he stopped smoking).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that lift stigao na određeni sprat (Lift reached a certain floor). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Lagao je roditelje) is more likely as it implies that the protagonist has run away from home due to some conflict or issue with his parents. This is a common reason why teenagers might leave their homes without informing their parents.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""WC je preplavio"" (the toilet has flooded) is the cause of the water damage. The fact that the water is coming from inside the house suggests that there may be a blockage or overflow issue with the toilet, rather than an external factor like a broken water heater. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vlasnik je stavio ogrlicu na štene) is more likely. The wording of the premise suggests that something has been placed near or around the owner's neck, rather than being held by them directly. Therefore, it is more likely that an ogrlica was used to keep the owner close, rather than simply holding their hand.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je uhvatio njegov odraz,"" it is more likely that Option A (the person was under a huge tree) is correct. The word ""uhvatio"" in Serbian means ""to catch,"" implying that the person caught their own reflection, not something above them. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Nazvao sam je) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Pas im je pobjegao od kuće) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in the premise suggest that something or someone has left or escaped from the house, rather than being taken away without permission.
Response:  Option A: Bilo je hladno.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Želeli su bolje uslova rada) is more likely as the reason for the formation of a union. The text states that the employees formed a syndicate to improve their working conditions, indicating that they were dissatisfied with their current circumstances and sought better treatment from their employer. This aligns with Option A, while Option B does not provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the employer's pay increase was the primary motivation for forming the union.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Smrad truljenja je ispuniva kuhinju) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something heavy or thick (smrad) has filled the kitchen, implying that it was not just a light or faint smell but rather a substantial amount of food that had been cooked. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nosio je visoke štikle) is more likely as it implies that the woman was struggling to walk due to her heightened heels, rather than skinning off her shoes.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Voda je ključala) is more likely to be the correct answer. The word ""ključala"" in Croatian means ""to lock"", so it suggests that someone or something locked the water from flowing out of the bucket. Option B does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that you covered the bucket with anything."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ja sam nosio sandale) is correct. The sentence ""Sve moje čarape su bile u vešeri"" implies that all of the speaker's shoes were in a state of disrepair or worn out, which suggests that they may have been wearing sandals rather than boots or other types of footwear. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Izgubio je podršku birača) is more likely. The argument that the politician has lost support among voters suggests that their popularity or approval rating has decreased, rather than being accused of corruption.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Par je bio trudan) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Milioner je htio da zgrada bude srušena) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the building was destroyed. Option B (Milioner je dao novac da se izgradi) does not provide any explanation for why the building was constructed or destroyed.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The prodavač has accused the girl of stealing, indicating that he saw her taking something without permission. This suggests that the prodavač may have witnessed the girl putting an item in her bag, which aligns with Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely. The fact that the country has declared war on a neighboring territory suggests that there will be an increase in military activity and mobilization of troops, rather than them being sent home to their families. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sud je potvrdio kontroverznu odluku,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Pobuna je izbila ispred sudnice,"" will occur. This is because the wording of the premise suggests that there has been a controversial decision made by the judge, which could lead to unrest or protests from those affected by the decision."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Izvadila je kolačiće iz staklenge) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kiša je padala kao iz šume"", option A - ""Oluja se pogoršala"" - is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Lift je prestao da radi. The phrase ""evakuja se"" suggests that there has been an emergency situation that requires immediate action, such as a fire or other hazardous condition. It is unlikely that the elevator would simply stop working without any warning signs or indication of what caused the malfunction. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the building was evacuated."
"Response: 
Option B: Otac je izbacio sina iz kuće.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that Otac je bio ljut na sinovu alkoholizam, it is more likely that he would have thrown his son out of the house rather than buying him alcohol. This option better aligns with the emotions expressed in the premise."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sekretarica je otišla kući) is the correct answer. There is no mention of a lift being in a state of disrepair or any other reason why the sekretarica might not have been able to reach her destination via the elevator. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she left the office by another means.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his friend stopped talking to him) is more likely as a cause for his sadness than Option B (his friend bought him lunch). The premise suggests that there has been a disruption in their friendship, which could be causing his sadness rather than a small act of kindness like buying him lunch.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Kasaj has given the girl a small amount of money) is correct. The reason for this is that the phrase ""dala svoj novac blagajniku"" implies that the girl gave the man some money, rather than the other way around. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Bila je paralizovana u nesreči) is more likely. The sentence implies that the woman was injured in an accident, which could result in paralysis. It does not provide any information about her entering a hospital on a stretcher. Therefore, Option A is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zemlja je slavila svoju nezavisnost) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that the people have raised their national flag in front of their homes to celebrate their country's independence, indicating a positive and joyful occasion. Therefore, option A is the better choice.

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Osetio sam se posramljeno) is more likely. The phrase ""uzaklio mi je ukaženo"" suggests that the speaker feels embarrassed or ashamed about their situation, rather than proud of it."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Posmatrao je u nastavi) is more likely. The text states that ""Dječak je pao na ispit iz istorije,"" indicating that he failed the test in history. This suggests that he may have been paying attention during class but still struggled with the material, rather than simply forgetting what he learned."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zemljotres je pogodio grad) is more likely as a cause for the building collapse in the center of town. Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially if they occur close to populated areas. Therefore, it is more plausible that an earthquake was responsible for the destruction of the building in this scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Molio ju je da ga vrati) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that their heads collided (Option B). The reason being that the phrase ""se spuštalo"" means ""were falling"", indicating a vertical movement, whereas ""odvozila"" means ""was carried away"", indicating a horizontal movement. Therefore, it is unlikely for the ball to be carried away by an unseen force without any explanation of how or why. On the other hand, if their heads collided, there would be some logical explanation as to how they ended up in this situation, such as them bumping into each other while playing."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (there was a karton in the trash can) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dečak je oštrio olovku,"" it is more likely that option A (it was cheap) is the correct answer. The reason being that a sharp knife would be more useful for cutting than something that is boring or dull."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Brzo je zacijelio) is more likely.

The phrase ""putnici u voзу"" suggests that the people in question are traveling by plane, while ""mu čudno pogledali"" implies that they were looking at something strange or unusual. It is unlikely that they would be talking to themselves while flying a plane."
"Response:  Option A - Mravi su se popeli do mrvica. 
Explanation: According to the premise, dečak (boy) has left crumbs on the floor. This implies that there are crumbs available for ants to find and carry away. Therefore, option A, where ants have climbed up to the crumbs, is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Žena je sestra preklopila ruke) is a more likely cause than option B (Ženin brat je počeo da plače). This is because the word ""maramica"" in Serbian implies that the woman has caused some kind of trouble or problem for her sister, rather than the brother being the source of the problem. Therefore, it is more likely that the woman's action was the direct cause of the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegove usne su bile raspršene) is more likely as it provides a physical explanation for why the man's face was contorted in pain after he received the medal. The other option (Brinuo se za loš zadah) does not provide any logical reasoning to explain the man's facial expression. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Njena saradnica je pokrila) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I had stage fright) is more likely. The actor's nervousness and fear of performing in front of an audience are common causes of forgetting lines or freezing up during a performance. It is less likely that they would simply forget their lines due to lack of memorization or not caring about their role.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam bio izgubljen,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""brojao sam svoju gotovinu"" means ""I was counting my losses."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Okrenuo sam paljenje) is a more plausible explanation for why the car stopped working than option B (Motor se pregrijao). This is because ""sam paljenje"" means ""self-ignition,"" which suggests that the engine may have malfunctioned or caught fire, rather than overheating due to a mechanical issue with the motor itself. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option B: Legao je u krevetu nekolike dana. 
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Čovek je povredio leđa,"" it is more likely that he will stay in bed for a few days to rest and recover from his injury rather than going to see a psychiatrist."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ja sam zapalio vatru u kaminu) caused the fire in the house than option B (Bilo je hladno u kući). This is because the statement ""Ja sam zapalio vatru u kaminu"" directly implies that someone intentionally started a fire in the chimney, whereas ""Bilo je hladno u kući"" does not provide any information about how the fire started. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (ima grčeve u boku) is the correct answer. The phrase ""žena je prestala trčati"" suggests that she has stopped running, which could be due to muscle cramps or other discomforts related to her body. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the woman has stopped running than option B (dobila je drugi dah), which implies that she received another breath of life without any logical explanation as to how this occurred."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kucao sam na komšijinu vrata,"" option A is more likely. The fact that I knocked on my neighbor's door suggests that they were home and available to receive a visitor, making it more likely that they invited me inside."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njen muž je pogrešno shvatio njezine brige) is more likely as it suggests that the woman's husband misunderstood her concerns rather than simply ignoring them.
"Response: 
Option A: Student has accurately answered the question. "
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ženi su ponestalo jaja"" (Women have too many eggs), Option B is more likely.

Therefore, it is more likely that she went to the supermarket to buy eggs rather than going to a farm."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Otkrila sam mu tajnu) is more likely. The phrase ""otkrila sam mu tajnu"" suggests that the speaker discovered a secret or hidden truth about their old friend, rather than physically touching them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Uhvatila je ribu) is more likely. The premise states that the woman avoided going to the lake, suggesting that she may have had a reason for doing so. The possibility of catching a fish is a plausible explanation for why someone might avoid going to a lake, making Option A the more likely choice.

Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Korisnik je pomerio miša) is more likely as it directly implies that the user moved the mouse pointer without clicking it. Option A (Korisnik je kliknuo mišem) does not imply any movement of the mouse pointer. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Došlo je do nesreće na glavном putu) occurred. The phrase ""zaobišao put"" suggests that the driver went off the main road, which could have led to a collision with another vehicle or an obstacle. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the car ran out of fuel."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Ploče je osušilo"" (The leaves have dried up) - is the correct answer. The premise mentions that there is a layer of wet mud on top of the leaf, indicating that the leaf has been exposed to moisture. Therefore, it is unlikely that the leaves would dry up due to lack of water, making Option A the most plausible choice."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je gledao u noćno nebo,"" option A is more likely. The man wanted to see the stars in the sky rather than wishing for summer. "

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je otišao kod berbera,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the word ""polagala"" means to comb or brush in Serbian. Therefore, it can be inferred that the man went to a barber."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dečak has welcomed his new classmate) is more likely. The premise states that ""he played tricks with his new classmate,"" indicating a friendly interaction between the two. Therefore, it is more likely that Dečak greeted or welcomed his new classmate rather than showing dislike towards him."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Želela sam čašu mlijeka,"" it is more likely that option A (Ja sam jeo kolače) is the correct answer. This is because the word ""čašu"" in Croatian means ""cup,"" so the speaker is indicating that they wanted a cup of milk. Option B (""Pecao sam hleb"") does not make sense in this context as ""hleb"" means bread in Croatian. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Počela je da pada kiša,"" option A is more likely. When it starts raining, the driver may turn on their windshield wipers (farove) to improve visibility during heavy rain. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""parkirao sam preko puta"" (I parked over the way) is correct. The reason for this is that the sentence implies that the speaker parked their car somewhere other than directly in front of the building, which suggests that they may have had to walk a short distance to reach the entrance. This is consistent with Option A, but not with Option B, where the speaker would have parked next to the entrance."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she had a blockage) is the correct answer. The fact that she missed the deadline suggests that there was an issue with her writing or creativity, rather than her simply deciding to redraw the plan.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tražio sam da razgovaram sa nadređenim) is more likely. The fact that he was asked to wear a headset suggests that he may have been in a remote work environment or working with colleagues from different locations, and therefore needed to communicate with them directly. Asking for permission to speak with his superior is a reasonable action in this scenario, as it would be important to ensure that any communication with higher-ups is done appropriately and professionally.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vetar je puhao kroz otvoren prozor"", option A is the correct answer. The wind was blowing through an open window. Therefore, the sound of a bell ringing (option A) is more likely to occur than the sound of branches creaking (option B)."
"Response:  Based on the given information, Option B (Ja sam pucao osigurač) is the most likely cause of the lost power at home.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (On je ispružio mišiće u ogledalu) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the person's face looks distorted in the mirror. The other option (Podigao je šipku izнад glave) does not provide any logical explanation for the distortion in the mirror image.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Izvukao je kalkulator) is more likely. The student has successfully calculated a complex equation in his head, indicating that he has strong mental abilities and problem-solving skills. It is unlikely that he would be confused or zombified, as suggested by option B.

"Response:  Option B - Svi na slikama su se odbili da se nasmeju. 
Explanation: The premise states that the photographer forgot to use a flash on his camera. This means that the lighting in the photos will be poor, resulting in underexposed images with dark shadows. As a result, it is more likely that all of the people in the photos will have their faces looking away or towards the side, rather than smiling directly at the camera. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I was alone) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam vežbao,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Osetio sam se energičan"" is the correct answer. This is because the verb ""vežbao"" means to train or exercise, which suggests that the speaker has been actively engaging in physical activity. The phrase ""osetio sam se energičan"" means I felt energized, which aligns with the idea of exercising and feeling invigorated. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise than option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam stisnuo vlažnu spužву"", option A is more likely. The word ""stisnuo"" means to suck or drink, so it's more likely that she was drinking water rather than water escaping from her."

The sentence ""Odmornici su se prevezli trajektom do odmarališta"" implies that the passengers had to take a ferry to reach their destination, which suggests that they were not able to stay at the hotel due to its occupancy. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause of the delay."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Boiled was afraid of the needle) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Postao sam sumnjičav"". This is because the speaker has become suspicious of an unknown car parked in front of their house, which could be a potential threat or danger to them. It is natural for someone to feel concerned or uneasy when they notice something unusual near their home, especially if they are not sure what it is or who might be behind it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible response to the given situation."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he was framed (Option A). There are no details or evidence to suggest that there were no dokaza against him (Option B). The fact that he has been accused without any proof suggests that someone may have set him up or framed him for a crime he did not commit.

"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ona je skliznuo) is a more likely outcome than option B (Ona se tresla). The word ""skliznuo"" in Croatian means to slip or slide, so it makes sense that the girl would have slipped on the ice rather than trembling. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (She was awake all night) caused her to have the dream about having a ring under her eye. Being awake for an extended period can lead to vivid dreams or hallucinations, especially if one is feeling stressed or anxious. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the woman's dream.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Znala je sve na zabavi) is more likely. The premise suggests that the woman knew everything at the party, implying that she was actively participating and engaged in the events unfolding around her. This makes it less likely that she would want to leave the party without any explanation.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Пustila me je да прођем кроз Naplatu) is a more likely outcome than option B (Zadrжao ме је на Naplatu). This is because the verb ""pustila"" in Option A implies movement or passage through the plateau, while ""zadržao"" in Option B implies holding or keeping someone at the plateau. Therefore, Option A suggests that the speaker was able to pass through the plateau, whereas Option B does not provide any information about what happened after reaching the plateau."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prodao je akcije svoje kompanije) is more likely to be the cause of the executive director's bankruptcy. This is because selling shares of one's company can provide a significant source of income, especially if the company is performing well financially. On the other hand, spending money recklessly or foolishly (option B) can lead to financial difficulties and potentially result in bankruptcy.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Doktor je bio na odmoru) is more likely. The premise states that ""čovek je otišao kod doktora,"" indicating that someone went to see a doctor, but it does not provide any information about why they went or how they were feeling. Therefore, it is more likely that the reason for their visit was simply that the doctor was away on vacation rather than anything serious being wrong with them."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izašao sam iz sobe kroz prozor,"" it is more likely that option A (the house was on fire) is the correct answer. The phrase ""izašao sam"" means ""I came out,"" and ""kroz prozor"" means ""through the window."" This suggests that the speaker escaped through a window while the house was on fire. Option B (the house was empty) does not fit with this information as there is no indication in the premise that the house was unoccupied."
"Response:  Option A: Dugo se tuširao.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the boy's fingers have become dry. This could be caused by prolonged exposure to water or soap, which would make his fingers feel dry and rough. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja ispljuvam mleko"", it is more likely that option A is correct - ""Mleko je imalo kisel ukus"". This is because the word ""ispljuvam"" in Croatian means ""I am thirsty"", indicating that the speaker wants to drink something. The fact that they are experiencing a sour taste suggests that they have consumed something acidic or bitter, such as milk with an unpleasant flavor."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Propustio sam autobus,"" it is more likely that option A (I came late to work) is true. The premise suggests that something unexpected happened to prevent the speaker from arriving on time, which aligns with option A. Option B (""Kasnio sam na posao"") implies that the speaker was absent or missed work without any external reason, which does not fit with the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kamion se sudario sa autom,"" option B is more likely. The word ""sudario"" suggests a collision or impact, which would result in damage to the car. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he climbed onto the roof (Option B). The fact that he was ""zAKLJUČAN VAN SVOje KUĆE"" suggests that he was unable to open a door or window from inside his house, so he would have had to find another way up. Climbing onto the roof provides a higher vantage point than opening an exterior window, making it the more likely option."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zvono je zvonilo"", option A is more likely. The sound of a bell indicates that someone has approached or entered the house, so it is more likely that the visitor knocked on the door rather than peeking through a keyhole hole in the door."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he put his clothes in the washing machine (Option A). The sentence ""Čovek je namazao odijelo"" means ""Man put on his clothes,"" so it is logical to assume that he would want to clean them rather than storing them in a closet (Option B)."
Response:  Option B - Devojka je ispljunuta pastu za zube.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pacifists organized a protest) is more likely to be the correct answer. The passage states that civilian deaths in war are ""porasle,"" or unacceptable, indicating that there is widespread opposition to the use of violence in conflict resolution. It is therefore more likely that pacifists would organize a protest to draw attention to this issue rather than holding a parade."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ona je vezala vrpcu) is more likely. The premise states that a girl pulled out a hair from her own head, indicating that she was the one who tied the knot in the first place. Therefore, it is more likely that she tied the knot rather than being born with it.
"Response: 
Option B: Izgledao je mlađe. 
Explanation: According to the premise, after undergoing a plastic surgery, Stario looks younger. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

The phrase ""izgubio ravnotežu na ljestvama"" suggests that the person has lost balance on a ladder, implying that they are in danger of falling. Therefore, it makes sense for them to try to climb down by stepping on each rung carefully, rather than simply letting go and relying on gravity to take them down."
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Uzeo je gutljaj gazirane vode) is a more plausible explanation for why the baby's diaper is soaked. As the passage states, ""Dijete je erčalo,"" indicating that the child has urinated. Since the baby's diaper is already wet, it is unlikely that they would have used a spoonful of salt to make it wetter. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ja sam se opustila) is a more likely explanation for why the cold current entered through the window. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Njeni kolege su joj poštovali) is more likely to be the cause of Studentica receiving a scholarship. The passage states that ""Studentica je dobila stipendiju,"" indicating that she received a scholarship, and then goes on to explain why her colleagues respected her. This suggests that it was her academic achievements or personal qualities that earned her the scholarship, rather than simply having good grades."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Živela je pored njega) is more likely. The girl was teasing the boy, indicating that they were close friends or neighbors who spent time together. This suggests a platonic relationship rather than romantic feelings. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (On je izazvao sažaljenje) is more likely. The phrase ""ukrala hranu"" suggests that someone has taken food without permission, which could be seen as disrespectful or hurtful to the person who owns the food. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the person might be feeling sad."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Htela sam privatnost) is more likely the cause of feeling lonely. The premise suggests that the speaker wanted to be alone, which could indicate a desire for privacy or personal space. This is more consistent with the idea of feeling lonely than Option B (Osećao sam se usamljeno), which implies a sense of isolation or disconnection from others.
"Response: 
Option A: Ja sam mu ruku stisnuo. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Čovek je pružio ruku prema meni"", it is more likely that the person reached out towards me rather than the other way around. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam se sklonila,"" option A is more likely as it suggests that the fire started due to an external factor such as a spark or flame rather than being caused by something internal like a sudden burst of energy or movement (option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option A: Bila je zabrinuta.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Devojka je ugrizla nokte,"" it is more likely that she was feeling anxious or worried rather than being surprised or amazed. The act of biting one's nails can be a sign of anxiety or stress, so option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Označio sam sastanak na kalendaru) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker opened that page of the calendar. The sentence suggests that the speaker scheduled an appointment on the calendar, rather than simply marking the beginning of a new month as the reason for opening that page. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will podnoi (submitted) a divorce request than to otpustio (released) his lawyer. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B - Podnio je zahtev za razvod.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Djevojci je pala gumena lopta,"" option A is more likely. The word ""odbila"" in Croatian means ""rejected."" Therefore, it is more likely that the ball rejected the girl's hand rather than the girl throwing the ball with force."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ona je pogodila odgovor) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Njegov protivnik je uhvatio) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (They were ripe) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Ja sam pokupila paradajz sa vinove loze"" means ""I picked grapes from a vineyard,"" and ""paradajz"" refers to grapes. Therefore, the speaker must have picked mature or ripe grapes from the vineyard, rather than juicing them."
"Response: 
Option A: Sreo je svoju bivšu devojku na ručku.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it's more likely that he will see his ex-girlfriend at the bar than buy her chocolate. The phrase ""htio da bude romantičan"" suggests that he wants to be romantic, but seeing an ex-partner in a social setting like a bar may not necessarily be the most appropriate or respectful way to express those feelings. Buying chocolate as a gesture of goodwill or appreciation could be seen as a more neutral and less potentially awkward approach."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the thermometer has risen (Option B). The phrase ""Gvožđa u termometru je porasla"" means ""The mercury in the thermometer has risen,"" indicating that the temperature inside the thermometer has increased. This suggests that the environment outside the thermometer has become warmer, which is consistent with Option B. Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: Vreme je postalo toplije (It has become warmer)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Krov sudnice je odletjela) is more likely.
"Response: 
A) His grades have improved."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Osećao sam se prijatno"", option A (Kleknuo sam na zemlju) is a more likely cause than option B (Zavila sam se u deku). This is because the word ""prijatno"" suggests a feeling of comfort or relaxation, which could be caused by lying down or sitting in a comfortable position, but not necessarily by being sucked into a deku."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam polirao kamen"", it is more likely that he became slippery (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the coffee had a strong flavor (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je pomišao novine"", it is more likely that he has thought about the newspapers (Option A). Uniting him with the papers is not a logical consequence of thinking about them. Therefore, Option B is less likely to occur."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Udario sam čavao u čavao,"" option A is more likely. The word ""čavao"" means ""to be stuck"" or ""to be caught,"" so it's likely that the person is stuck in something, such as a tree. Option B does not make sense in this context because ""zarđao"" means ""to get angry."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Riba je ugrizla konopac,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ribar je ušao u ribu,"" will occur. This is because the word ""ugrizla"" means ""bitten"" or ""attacked"", indicating that the fish has bitten into something, which could be a person entering the water. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
"Response:  Option A: Ima trbuha.  
Explanation: According to the premise ""Tinejdžer se stidio da ide u školu,"" it is more likely that the reason for not wanting to go to school is hunger (ima trbuhu) rather than having a fever (skinula je aparat)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izraz lica mi je osvijetlio,"" option A (Dobio sam dobre vesti) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A: Ručnik je bio mokar.  
Explanation: The sentence ""Obrišeta sam ruke ručniku"" implies that the speaker has washed their hands with soap and water. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it suggests that the ručnik (the person who received the handwashing) was dirty or wet. Option B does not make sense in this context as the speaker's hands are being described as clean, rather than wet."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Prolio je boju na stolici) is more likely to be the cause of the man losing his balance. The premise states that the man has lost his balance, indicating that he is no longer stable or secure in his position. This could be caused by a variety of factors, including external forces such as wind or uneven terrain, or internal factors such as dizziness or disorientation. However, the phrase ""prolio je boju na stolici"" specifically suggests that the man's loss of balance may have been caused by an internal factor, such as a sudden change in blood pressure or other medical condition. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Izgubili su igru) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the two teams have a score of 0-0, indicating that neither team has scored any points during the game. This suggests that the game may have ended in a tie or draw, rather than one team winning and the other losing. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Žalio sam zbog svoje greške) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker has made a mistake, which would lead them to feel regret or sorrow. Option B (Postigla sam svoj cilj) does not align with this sentiment as it implies achieving one's goal, rather than feeling remorse for a mistake.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (On je neprestano pričao o sebi) is more likely to be the cause of her becoming bored with him. The passage states that he has been talking about himself nonstop, which suggests that he may not have been giving her enough attention or allowing her to participate in the conversation. This could lead to feelings of boredom or disinterest towards him.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Pojavile su se njenе šupljine) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Neprijateljski brod je eksplodirao."", option A (Prošao je preko rudnika) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je probo noge"", option A is the most likely cause. The word ""probo"" means ""broke"" or ""fractured"", so it is likely that the man broke his legs rather than stallied them onto broken glass."
"Response: 
Option A: Otkrili su identitet ubice. "
"Response:  Option A: Obilazio sam put. 
Explanation: The premise ""Na autoputu je bilo dosta saobraćaja"" implies that there was a lot of traffic on the highway, suggesting that the speaker has been driving for some time. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the speaker has passed by many places while driving."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mnogi su bili nezaposleni) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Prepoznala ih je iz komšiluka) is more likely. The passage states that ""čuvar na granici"" saw them from the guardhouse, indicating that they were in a position to recognize them from afar. It's unlikely that they would try to run into traffic without being seen or recognized by the guard. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the children were blown away by the guard."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Rekao mi je istinu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""okrenuo sam oči prema prijatelju"" suggests that someone has turned their eyes towards a friend, implying a genuine expression of emotion or concern. In contrast, Option B (""Napisao je sarkastičnu primedbu"") implies a sarcastic comment, which would not align with the tone of the premise. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Vozač je bio Zaglavljen na cesti) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Žena je pocela da rađa"", it is more likely that option A - ""Beba je rođena"" - will occur. This is because the premise specifically states that the woman has started to give birth, indicating that a baby has been born. Option B - ""Žena je imala jutarnju mučninu"" (Woman had morning sickness) does not align with the premise as it implies that the woman is still pregnant rather than having already given birth."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Skinned his hat) is more likely. The premise states that ""his hat has flown away,"" implying that it was blown by the wind or otherwise removed from his head, rather than being carried away by someone or something else. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why his hat has flown away."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dobila je pozivnicu) is more likely. The premise states that she was invited to a birthday party for her school friend, indicating that someone else took the initiative to invite her rather than her purchasing a gift herself.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that his mother measured his temperature (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (he wanted to impress his boyfriend) is more likely as the reason for the man's actions.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tražio sam lampu) is more likely. The fact that electricity in the house has been turned off suggests that there may be a problem with the electrical system, which could cause a light bulb to burn out. Therefore, it is more likely that the person is looking for a replacement lamp rather than using a ladder to reach a light switch that is already on.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sin je završio srednju školu) is more likely as it provides a clear and specific reason for the family's move to a larger house. The other option (Majka je rodila blizance) does not provide any logical explanation for the change in living arrangements. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Videla je ciljnu liniju) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the marathon runner would be running at a slow pace. The other option (Želela je daštedi energiju) does not provide any clear reasoning for why the runner would be running slowly.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Machine exploded) is a more plausible explanation for why the boy got hurt than option B (Knedla with chips got stuck). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Okrenuo sam oči prema njemu) is more likely. The phrase ""okrenuo sam oči prema njemu"" means to turn one's eyes towards him, indicating a sense of longing or yearning for the deceased friend. This choice better fits with the emotional tone of the premise, as it suggests that the speaker is feeling melancholic and nostalgic about their lost friend. Option B (Ja sam ga Zagrlila), on the other hand, implies a more physical and intimate connection with the dead person, which may not be in line with the emotional nuances conveyed by the premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he paid by cash (Option B). The reason for this is that if he had written a check, it would have been rejected due to insufficient funds in his account, rather than being approved with payment made in cash.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je proklet,"" or ""Man is cursed,"" it is more likely that he has been struck by something (Option B). The phrase ""proklet"" implies a negative event or situation has occurred to the man, rather than him simply having scratches or bruises."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his brother got into a fight with their parents) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the man's pride in his brother. The other option (Option B) does not provide any logical connection to the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Gleda u zvezde) is more likely. The girl wants to learn about solar systems, so looking at stars would be a better option than going to the library.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Postavio sam poster izнад vrata) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Plakat je zalijepio za zid"" implies that someone placed a poster on a wall, and Option A aligns with this meaning. Therefore, we can eliminate Option B as the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Arhitekta je izgradio zgradu) is correct. The premise states that the client approved the architect's plans for a building, indicating that the architect actually built the structure. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ruka mu se trese) will occur than Option B (Lizao je žlicu). This is because the phrase ""čovek je ispustio"" implies a careless or accidental action, whereas ""lizao"" suggests deliberate action. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person's hand might involuntarily hit the light switch than for them to intentionally pick up the light bulb and put it in their pocket."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Upravni odbor je raspustio kompaniju) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I have come to the podium) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Napali su drugoga zatvorenika) is more likely to be the cause of the man's release from prison. The premise suggests that the man was released due to the actions of another inmate, rather than through any financial means or legal proceedings. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for the man's release.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that their house caught fire (Option B). The family has lost all of its belongings, indicating a significant loss or destruction of property. While Option A suggests that they sold their home, there is no indication in the premise to support this possibility. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible explanation for why the family has lost everything.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B: Kontejner je razbijen (The container is broken) is more likely to happen. 
Explanation: The premise states that the container is made of aluminum, which is a relatively soft metal compared to other materials commonly used in containers. Therefore, it is more likely that the container will be damaged or broken if it falls from a height rather than being recycled."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Naučila je da koristi računar) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Moje raspoloženje se poboljšalo) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Slušao sam muziku"" means ""I listened to music,"" which suggests that the speaker's mood improved as a result of listening to music. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the improvement in their mood."
"Response: 
Option B: Organizirali su aukciju. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the organization organized an auction rather than feeding the homeless. The premise states that the organization has set a goal to collect money, which suggests that they are trying to raise funds through some means. An auction would be a good way for them to do this, as people can bid on items or services to donate to the cause. Feeding the homeless may also be a noble act, but it does not necessarily involve raising funds in the same way."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Putnici su vrištali) is more likely. The idea of a rollercoaster jumping down a steep hill is likely to cause fear or discomfort rather than laughter among passengers.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Proved the postal package when I left the house) occurred. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je htio da gleda izlazak sunca"", it is more likely that he stood up early in the morning to watch the sunrise. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Savili smo papir"", option A (Reciklaža papira) is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
Option B: Lideri drugih zemalja su poslali hitnu pomoć. 
Explanation: Given that the nation has experienced a natural disaster, it is more likely that other nations will send aid rather than forming a union to address the crisis. This option better aligns with the given premise as it highlights the immediate response of providing assistance in times of need."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dečakova odeća je bila mokra,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Izašao je iz bazena,"" is the correct answer. This is because the premise states that the boy's clothes were wet, which would be expected if he had just gotten out of a bathtub or swimming pool, rather than if he had fallen into a basin."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Trebao je biti vraćen u biblioteku) is more likely. The student has finished reading a book, indicating that it was borrowed from the library and needs to be returned.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zločinac je pogubljen,"" option A (Bačen je u zatvor) is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Otvorio sam zavese) caused the sunlight to enter the room, rather than option B (Otklučao sam vrata). This is because opening a window would allow sunlight to enter the room directly from outside, while locking the door might not have any effect on the amount of sunlight entering the room. Therefore, option A is the better answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam ga povukao za kosu"", it is more likely that option A is correct, i.e. ""Paruka joj je pala"". This is because the sentence structure and verb tenses suggest a causal relationship between the speaker's action of pulling the cat (povukli) and the result of the cat falling (parula)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Smatrao je rukopis uvjerljivim) is more likely. The fact that the editor changed a sentence in the manuscript suggests that he found it convincing or persuasive enough to warrant alteration, rather than simply finding it unclear or ambiguous.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Shvatila je da nedostaje kreditna kartica) is a more likely cause than option B (Shvatila je da je karta istekla). This is because if the woman has lost her credit card, she would be aware of it and take steps to report it missing or cancel it, rather than simply assuming that it has expired without realizing it. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the woman did not have her credit card with her.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that they got married (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Javio sam glasnoću) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Muzika je bila preslaba"" suggests that there was not enough music to hear, implying that the speaker did not sing loudly enough for others to hear. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation of the situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kosa je dečaka bio u visini"", it is more likely that option A is correct - ""Devojka je to izmicala"". This is because the word ""visina"" implies a height or elevation, which could be reached by someone climbing upwards. Therefore, it makes sense that the girl would have been able to reach the boy from above."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prskao sam se sa repelentom za insekte) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has accidentally sprayed themselves with insect repellent rather than intentionally taking an insecticide.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otvorio sam oči"", option A (Ja sam se probudio) is more likely as it implies that the speaker woke up from sleep."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tražio sam da je smanji) is more likely.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Tražio je posao) is more likely. The fact that Studentica has graduated from university suggests that she may be actively seeking employment or career opportunities. Taking up a hobby without any prior experience or qualifications would be less likely in this scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the artist mixed yellow with blue to create a green color. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (It's been a while since I talked about things that interest me) is more likely to be the cause of the conversation becoming dull. This is because the speaker has not had many opportunities to talk about topics they are interested in recently, leading to a lack of enthusiasm or excitement in their conversations.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ja sam mu dala hladno rame) is more likely. The brother has been released from the hospital, but instead of welcoming him back home with warmth and care, the speaker has given him a cold shoulder. This suggests that there may be tension or conflict between the two siblings, which could be due to something the brother did while he was in the hospital or something else entirely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zavesa na pozornici je podignuta"", it is more likely that Option A - ""Počela je scena otvaranja predstave"" - occurred."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Otmičar jepretio da će povrijediti taoca) is more likely to be the cause of Zeta's surrender. The fact that the abductor threatened to harm the hostage suggests that they were willing to use violence or the threat of violence to achieve their goals. This implies that they may have been more likely to surrender if faced with the prospect of actual harm coming to the hostage. Option B (Otmičar jeostavio taoca samog), on the other hand, does not necessarily imply a desire to harm the hostage, but rather a lack of concern for their well-being. It could also suggest that the abductor was simply uninterested in holding onto the hostage any longer. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that the abductor would threaten to harm the hostage in order to get what they want.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Bum je odjeknuo po pozornici"", option A is more likely. The word ""kucao"" in Croatian means to kick or strike something with one's feet, so it is unlikely that the musician hit a drum with his foot. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dete se bojalo da pogleda ispod njenog kreveta) is more likely. The premise suggests that something unexpected happened in the child's room, and the fact that the child was afraid to look under the bed implies that there might be something hidden or scary there. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why the parents were called into their child's room.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she was born too early) is the cause of her ability to communicate through sign language. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Voda je postala kontaminirana) is more likely to occur than Option B (Usjevi su propali).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mačka je gonila pticu"", it is more likely that Option A: Ptica je odletjela. The premise implies that the cat was chasing the bird, which suggests that the bird may have flown away rather than being caught by the cat."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the school is free for the summer) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zaposleni su u štrajku) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ekstremisti su ga uticali) is more likely. The passage suggests that the leader's actions have caused tension among extremists in his country, rather than the other way around. Therefore, it is more plausible that the leader's actions led to their hostility towards him, rather than the other way around.
"Response:  Option B: Talasi su se lupali uz obalu. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Talasi su se lupali uz obalu"" (The waves are crashing against the shore) better fits the given premise than ""Pijesak mi se zalijepio za noge"" (The sand has stuck to my feet). This is because the second option does not convey any information about the movement of the waves, while the first option explicitly states that the waves are moving towards the shore."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Stavio sam gaće) caused the feeling of coldness. This is because putting on extra layers of clothing can help to keep a person warm in cold weather. On the other hand, drinking water may not have a significant impact on a person's body temperature or overall sense of warmth. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Majka je ućutkala sina"", it is more likely that her son smiled (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zaključao sam gaće) is a more likely cause than option B (Spušio sam se na pločnik). The sentence ""Rana u mojim trapericama"" suggests that something has happened to the speaker's feet or legs, which could be caused by walking or running on uneven terrain or stepping on something sharp. It is less likely that the speaker would accidentally fall down from a height, as suggested in option B. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Option A - He has a career.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Juče sam vežbala u teretani,"" it is more likely that option A (Danausam se probudio sa bolovima u mišićima) is correct. The sentence suggests that the speaker has been exercising in the gym recently, which could cause muscle soreness or fatigue. Option B (Danas sam se probudio sa bolom u grlu) does not fit with the premise as there is no mention of any discomfort or pain in the throat."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The other students are likely to feel left out or excluded when they see a particular student being served first at lunch.

Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (signed his will) is the correct answer. The fact that he has survived a deadly disease suggests that he may have been seriously ill and near death, but since he has signed his will, it implies that he has made arrangements for his assets after his death. It is less likely that he would receive a transplant as he has already passed away.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ugrizao sam jezik) is correct. The sentence suggests that the speaker bit their tongue, which can cause pain and discomfort but does not necessarily result in burning or spilling of hot coffee. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Pisac je izbegavao pristrasnost u svojim pričama) is more likely. The fact that the editor fired the writer suggests that there was a problem with the writer's work, possibly related to their lack of objectivity or impartiality in their stories. It is less likely that the writer missed an important deadline without any explanation.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Spawned sam ceo dan) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Osećao sam se iscrpljeno"" suggests that the speaker feels tired, which could be caused by not sleeping all day. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."

The phrase ""podvrgnut hitnoj operaciji"" suggests that the person has undergone an emergency surgical procedure, which is typically performed to treat cardiac problems such as a heart attack rather than vascular issues like loss of blood flow to the brain."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (On je pomerio ruke) is the more likely cause of the muscle strain in the hand. The sentence suggests that someone has moved their hands, which could potentially lead to a strain or injury if done forcefully or repetitively. Option B (On je trljao ruke), on the other hand, does not provide any context or explanation for how the strain occurred, making it less plausible as the cause.
"Response: 
Option A: Bio je bio iznenađen. "
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vjerovala sam da su njegove namere dobre) is more likely as it suggests that she believed he had good intentions rather than assuming he knew better.

Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The owner of the house was looking for a way to get rid of his trash, which suggests that he may have been keeping a secret farm of rats in his home.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she has hidden her brother's diary (Option A).

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ruka deteta je brzo povukla,"" option A is more likely. "
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that they offered a discount to new customers (Option A). This is because offering a discount can be a direct way to incentivize people to try out a company's products or services for the first time. Conducting surveys among existing customers may also provide valuable insights, but it would not necessarily lead to increased customer satisfaction as directly as offering a discount.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Dečak je bacio jastuke sa kauča) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there are holes in the floor. Option B (Dečak je vuče stolicu po podu) does not provide any logical explanation for this phenomenon. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam zaštitio lice,"" it is more likely that option A (Moj neprijatelj me je ismijavao) is the correct answer. The sentence suggests that someone was making fun of the speaker's face, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Udario ga je grom) is more likely as a cause for the statue to be destroyed. The premise states that the statue was famous and revered, but then it was destroyed by lightning. Lightning is a natural phenomenon that can cause destruction, making Option A a more plausible explanation than Option B (Ljudski su dolazili da ga veneruja), which suggests that people were coming to worship the statue, which does not align with the premise provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ostavio sam voće na stolu,"" it is more likely that Option A - ""Voće je prolivilo seme"" - occurred. The wording of the premise suggests that something has happened to the fruit after it was left on the table, rather than anything happening to the flies or other insects. Therefore, the most likely explanation for why the fruit is gone is that it has been eaten by someone or something else."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Pokazala je prstima) is the more likely cause of Balerina's injury.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Naucio je kako da ih veže) is more likely. The premise states that the child's ties have come undone, indicating that something has caused them to become loose. Option A provides a plausible explanation for this by suggesting that the child has learned how to tie them again. Option B does not provide any logical explanation for why the child's ties would come undone. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vratio sam knjegu) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker has returned the book to its original location or owner, rather than losing track of time.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegovi roditelji su ga uticali) is more likely as it suggests that the man's beliefs were influenced by his parents, who are a significant factor in shaping one's worldview during childhood.

"Response:  Option B - Sladoled je kapio iz čunjeva.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""čovek je pojeo sladoled na suncu,"" which implies that the person ate ice cream in the sun. This could cause the ice cream to melt and become watery, making it less likely for it to lose its taste. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A: Ćili, tepih je bio prljav.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Objesila sam umetnicka dela u sobi,"" it is more likely that the floor was dirty (option A) than the walls were bare (option B)."
"Response:  Option B - Moj šef je imao sastanak. 
Explanation: The premise ""Rano sam otišao sa posla"" implies that something unexpected happened to prevent him from going to work. Option B provides a plausible explanation for this situation by stating that his boss had a meeting, which could have been a valid reason for him not being able to attend work. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the owner has fed the cat (Option B). The phrase ""štenad je uprljao tepih"" suggests that something has been fed to the cat, and the word ""uprljao"" specifically means to feed or nourish. Therefore, Option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Prijatelj mi je oprostio) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he was carrying a backpack (Option A). The phrase ""istakao se u gomili"" suggests someone standing out or drawing attention in a crowd, which could be due to their appearance or behavior. Carrying a backpack would be a common item for a traveler or student, making it a plausible reason why they stood out in the crowd. On the other hand, carrying a neon sign might not be as practical or commonplace in everyday life, especially if the person is just walking down the street. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice based on the information provided."
"Response: 
Option B: Optužen je za krivokletstvo. 
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker has lied under oath, which means they have given false testimony. As a result, they are likely to be charged with perjury or subornation of perjury, also known as ""krivokletstvo"" in Croatian law. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Želela je novi izglik) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Deported) is more likely to occur. The premise states that immigrants are undocumented and living in the country illegally, indicating that they may be at risk of deportation if caught by authorities. This outcome is more plausible than Option A (Found a job), as it is unlikely that undocumented immigrants would be able to secure employment without proper documentation or authorization.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Publika se nasmijala) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pogledao sam u sunce"", option A is more likely. The word ""oslijepilo"" means ""blinded by the sun"". Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Osjecao sam dosadu"", option A ""Ja sam šmrkao"" is a more likely response as it means ""I have seen something""."
"Response:  Option B: Biftek je bio sirov.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Biftek je bio težak za rezanje,"" it suggests that the meat was too tough for cutting. Therefore, option B, ""Biftek je bio sirov,"" or ""The steak was raw"" makes more sense as a possible cause of difficulty in cutting it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ona je stakla ogromne dugove) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (I decided to visit him) is more likely. The fact that ""svjetla u stanu"" were burning suggests that someone was in the apartment, and therefore it's more likely that the speaker decided to visit their friend rather than wondering if they had left the lights on before leaving the house."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Stavio sam cvijet ispod nosa"", option A (Petlje su se odvojile od cveta) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Našla je prijatelja iz detinjstva) is more likely. The premise suggests that the woman has been feeling nostalgic, which could be triggered by reuniting with an old friend from childhood. This is a common experience for many people, especially as they get older and reflect on their past. In contrast, Option B (Vrištala je na svoju decu) does not align with the premise and is less likely to occur.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (Predać ће rad ranje) will occur. The student has been delaying their work, so it makes sense that they would continue to do so in the future.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was in a market (Option A). The sentence ""Auto mi se pokvario"" means ""My car broke down,"" so it is unlikely that she called a mechanic (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (It was anonymous) is more likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ptica je macala krilima,"" it is more likely that she has been lifted into the air by the wind (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the garage was open) caused the car to roll away. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the victim raised their hands rather than the criminal spun the gun. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Planirao sam da prisustvujem ujakovom sahranjivanju) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that the speaker has a specific plan to attend their uncle's funeral, indicating that this is a more important event for them than the wedding of a friend.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Izgubio sam pojam o vremenu,"" option A (Sanjao sam) is a more likely cause than option B (Bilo mi je mučno). This is because the phrase ""izgubio sam pojam"" means ""lost my sense of time,"" which suggests that the speaker has been in a state of disorientation or confusion for an extended period of time, rather than experiencing a brief moment of difficulty as suggested by option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (there isn't enough ink) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Fanovi su se okrenuli prema zastavi) is more likely. The fans turning towards the flag suggests that they are paying attention to something happening near it, such as the national anthem being played. Option B (Fanovi su se upali na teren) does not align with the given information and seems unlikely based on the context provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dip je bio bezukusan,"" it is more likely that Option B (Stavio sam sol u nju) is correct. The word ""bezukusan"" means ""without salt,"" so it is unlikely that the speaker added salt to the dip."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B - ""Izlivanje je ostavilo ljepljivi trag"" - is more likely. The fact that the paper has absorbed liquid suggests that it has come into contact with water or another substance that can cause it to become sticky or tacky. This is consistent with the idea of izlivanje leaving behind a residue. Option A - ""Ručnik je apsorbirao tečnost"" - does not necessarily imply that the book will become sticky or tacky after being exposed to liquid."
"Response:  Option B: Ponovo je procitala knjigu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman was interrupted while reading her book. Therefore, it is more likely that she will pick up where she left off rather than marking her page or starting over from the beginning."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Čovek je pogledao kroz prozor) is more likely because it suggests that the person was able to see something outside of the plane despite being in turbulence. Option A (Čovek je počepio pojas) does not provide any context or explanation for why the person might be holding onto their seatbelt.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B (Devojka ga je gurnula) is the correct answer. The word ""uskrstio"" in Serbian means to pinch or tickle someone, so it can be inferred that the boy was being playfully annoyed by the girl. Option A (""Devojka ga je ignorisala"") does not make sense in this context as ignoring someone would not result in them being ""uskrstio""."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, option A (Amputated her legs) is the most likely cause of the patient's condition. The passage states that the doctors performed an experiment on the patient without her consent, which suggests that they may have intentionally caused harm to her body. Amputation of a person's legs would be a serious and irreversible act, making it the most likely explanation for the patient's condition.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she will pull her hand away from him (Option B).
Response:  Option A: Ja sam cenio njegovo mišljenje.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Blata se zalijepila za njegove cipele) is correct. The reason being that the word ""zalijepila"" means to stick or get stuck, which makes sense in this context as a child standing in mud would indeed get their shoes stuck. Option B (Blaga ga je udarila u lice) does not make much sense in this scenario as there is no indication of any physical harm or injury caused by the girl's action."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that schools are closed (Option A). The reason for this is that snowfall of a few centimeters is not typically enough to warrant people hiding underground. While some people may choose to stay indoors or avoid traveling during heavy snowfall, it is unlikely that schools would be completely shut down due to such a small amount of snow.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Otišao je kući na dan) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Drvo je palo na krov) is a more likely cause of damage to the house than option B (Drvo je zasjenilo dvorište). This is because falling trees can potentially hit the roof or other parts of the house, causing significant damage, while shading the courtyard may not have as much impact. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Drvo se raspolovilo,"" option A is more likely. The word ""raspolovilo"" means ""split"" or ""broke apart,"" so it's likely that the speaker cut the wood with a saw rather than winding it with a sword."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Par je objavio da se razvode) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She loved him) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I was confused) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Želeli su da nađu kompromis) is more likely. The friends want to find a compromise rather than making a hasty decision without considering all perspectives.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the person emptied the fridge (Option A). The phrase ""Tajmer u kuhinji"" suggests a sudden and unexpected event, such as an empty fridge, rather than someone taking food from a cooking pot (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ona je naporno radila) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegov sin je upleo u pravne probleme) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the woman will get burned by the flame (Option A).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that her driving license was taken away (Option A). The reason for this is not specified in the premise, but it could be due to a variety of reasons such as a traffic violation or a suspension of her license. On the other hand, having a car accident (Option B) does not necessarily imply that her driving license was taken away.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Napravila sam doručak) is correct. The alarm going off suggests that something unexpected has happened, such as a fire or an intruder, rather than simply forgetting to set the alarm. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the protagonist woke up through the alarm.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Kamere su treptale u njegovem pravcu) is more likely. The fact that a person has stepped out of a luxury car suggests that they are someone important or wealthy, and therefore it is more likely that cameras would be filming them for some reason.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that water in the bucket has become wet (Option A). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (pridružio se bratstvu) is more likely. The sentence ""htjela da se upozna sa drugim studentima na kampusu"" suggests that Studentica wants to meet new people at campus, which aligns with joining a fraternity or sorority as a way to socialize and connect with others. On the other hand, graduating with a degree in engineering does not necessarily involve meeting new people or expanding one's social circle. Therefore, option A is more likely given the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tražio sam sitnicu) is more likely as it aligns better with the context of the situation provided in the prompt. The speaker mentions that they were looking for a couch, which suggests that they had a specific goal or purpose in mind when searching for one. On the other hand, Option B (Preuredila sam dnevnu sobu) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the speaker was trying to schedule their daily routine. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice based on the information given in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Oša je letjela prema dječaku"", it is more likely that the bird flew towards the boy (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Bila je osuđena na smrt) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pomiješao sam šećer u vrući čaj,"" it is more likely that the šećer will melt or dissolve into the tea rather than the tea boiling away. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Veteran je šepao,"" it is more likely that he was regrutovan for war (Option A). The phrase ""je šepao"" suggests that he has been through a difficult experience, and being regrutovan for war would be a significant and traumatic event that could lead to hearing loss or other physical and emotional challenges."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Policija je progonila kriminalca) is more likely. The fact that the criminal has escaped from the police suggests that they were being pursued by law enforcement officers. Therefore, it is more likely that the police was actively trying to catch the criminal rather than simply being present at the scene of a crime.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ja sam je ispustio) is more likely as the laptop was not plugged in, indicating that it may have been accidentally turned off or disconnected from power source.
Response:  Based on the given information in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Dobila je opsežnu garderobu) is the correct answer. The premise states that the woman has lost her space in her orchard without providing any information about a large wardrobe. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why she might have lost her space.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je bio slomljenog srca"", option B (Žena ga je ostavila) is more likely as it suggests that the man's heart was broken due to his wife leaving him."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The man's offer for a job was rejected, so he did not become qualified for the job he wanted.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (pozdravljao je publiku) is more likely as it aligns with the context of a concert where an artist would typically greet their audience.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Novčić je potonuo na dno) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Lopta je ušla u rupu) is more likely to occur.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ja sam štucao) is correct. The word ""štucao"" means to inhale or breathe deeply, so it makes sense that the speaker would be breathing in the dust from the table. Option B (""Kihnuo sam"") does not make as much sense in this context, as there is no clear reason why the speaker would have kicked something. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kasac je zvao osiguranje) is more likely to be the cause of the damage. The phrase ""zvao osiguranje"" suggests that the caller may have made a false claim or provided misleading information, which could result in unnecessary repairs being carried out. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the damage found during the inspection."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Od smeća u kuhinji je bilo gadno) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and vocabulary suggest that something was found in the kitchen that caused a mess, rather than the speaker accidentally throwing away an important document.
"Response:  Option A (Deca were fascinated by the animals).
Explanation: The premise states that the family went to the zoo, indicating that they were interested in seeing and learning about the animals. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests that the children were fascinated by the animals rather than being aggressive towards them."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovjek je dizao glasno,"" option A is more likely. The premise suggests that the man was singing loudly, which could potentially strain his vocal cords or cause discomfort in his throat, leading to a sore throat or hoarseness. Option B does not align with this reasoning as it implies that the man's lungs were blocked, which would not be caused by singing too loudly."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (asked a friend if he was interested in going) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the speaker asked their friend for his opinion, indicating that they are seeking input or feedback from someone else. This suggests that the speaker may not have made a final decision yet and is still considering different possibilities, making option B the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Izvukao sam pokrivače) will cause the temperature in the house to decrease than Option B (Otvorio sam prozore). This is because opening windows can allow warm air from outside to enter the house, potentially increasing the temperature inside rather than decreasing it. On the other hand, covering windows with blankets or curtains can help keep the cold air out and reduce the temperature inside the house. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for how the protagonist might have caused the temperature in their home to decrease.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njegov ruksak je bio otvoren) is more likely to be the cause of his back pain. 
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Napekla sam joj tortu) is the more likely cause for why she received a present from her mother. This is because ""napekla"" means to bake or make something sweet in Croatian, so it suggests that the mother may have made something special for her daughter as a gift. Option B (Bio je njen rođendan), on the other hand, simply means ""It was her birthday,"" which does not provide any specific information about how the mother gave her daughter a present. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Baštovan is eaten by a bee) is more likely. The text does not provide any information that would suggest vervet monkeys are capable of digging up lamps, so it is unlikely they were responsible for the destruction of Narcis' garden.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Plamen je izbledio (Plamen has melted). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They did not want to discuss their dispute in court) is more likely as the reason for the settlement. The fact that they were able to reach an agreement without going through a lengthy legal process suggests that they may have been motivated by a desire to avoid further conflict rather than a desire to repair their personal relationship.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (roditelji su im umrli) is the correct answer. The fact that the protagonist has been sent to an orphanage suggests that their parents have passed away, rather than simply being neglectful or abusive towards them.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Meteorit je pao u okean,"" option A (Došlo je do cunamija) is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was dehydrated (Option A). The reason for this is that dehydration can cause symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, and fatigue, which are consistent with what the premise describes. On the other hand, panic attacks do not typically cause these specific symptoms. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Upalila sam pećnicu) is a more plausible explanation for why the oven got hotter. Therefore, it is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ja sam stisnuo klin od limuna,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Limun je postao plijesan"" (The lemon has become sour) is correct."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Država je kolonizovala zemlju) is more likely. The text states that ""Zemlja je otkrila nove teritorije,"" indicating that a new territory has been discovered or colonized by the state. This suggests that the state has taken control of this new land, rather than leaving the Earth altogether. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Rasprskao se po cijelom podu) is more likely. The phrase ""čaša je pala sa stola"" implies that the cup fell from a table, which could result in it breaking into pieces or splashing its contents onto surrounding surfaces. It's less likely for a broken cup to accumulate in one place like a pile of rubbish without any external influence."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sto se treseo,"" it is more likely that pod was clumsy (option B)."
"Response: 
Option A: Njegov sin je priznao istinu.  
Explanation: According to the premise, Otac has caught his son lying. Therefore, it is more likely that the son will admit the truth rather than the father believing him without evidence."
"Response: 
Option B: Uzeo je aspirin.  
Explanation: The premise states that the person's head was throbbing from a headache, indicating that they are experiencing pain. Aspirin is a common medication used to relieve headaches, making it the more likely option."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Voz je usporio,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Približao se stanici"" (He approached the station) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man has been through therapy for a psychological disorder such as depression. This is supported by the fact that he has undergone therapy, which suggests that he has sought professional help for his mental health issues. Option A, that the man's psychological disorder was inherited from his family, does not align with this information as there is no indication that the man's condition was caused by genetics or heredity. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Progutala je hranu) is more likely. The word ""zgrabila"" means to grab or take hold of something, so it's unlikely that she would have swallowed the apple whole without chewing or tasting it first. Therefore, option A is a better fit for the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that her voice was hoarse (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Slinilo se) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Postala je bogata."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zvono je zvonilo) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the students are leaving their classroom. The other option (Učitelj je dao domaći zadatak) does not provide a specific reason for the students' departure. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Njeni poznanici su izrazili sumnju) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Skoro se utopio u okeanu) is more likely. The premise states that the person has lost their hearing, which could potentially lead to feelings of isolation or depression, making it more likely for them to contemplate suicide by drowning themselves in the ocean.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dijete je pustilo konopac balona,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Balon se ispraznio,"" will occur. This is because when a child lets go of a helium-filled balloon, it will most likely deflate or lose its buoyancy due to the loss of gas inside."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (imao je moždani udar) is more likely to be the cause of the man's inability to speak. The premise suggests that the man has lost his ability to speak due to a brain injury or stroke, which is a common cause of speech difficulties. While Option B (duboko je udahnuo) does not provide any logical explanation for the man's inability to speak, it is unlikely to be the actual cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Imela pukotinu u cementu) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Spasitelj je skočio za njem) will occur because the word ""bacio"" in Italian means ""threw"", indicating that the person threw something into the pool, rather than putting something into the water. Therefore, a rescuer jumping into the water to save him is the most plausible outcome."
Response:  Option A: My infection has passed.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the driver pressed the brake (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Plastika se rastopila,"" option A (Umakla sam posudu u toplu vodu) is the more likely cause. This is because plastic melts when exposed to high temperatures, so placing a plastic container in hot water would likely cause it to melt. In contrast, option B (Stavio sam posudu na vruću peć) does not provide any information about the temperature of the oven, making it less likely that the plastic would melt."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Auto je ubodao,"" option A is more likely. The driver was hit by a car."
"Response:  Option A - Preskočio je ispit. 
Explanation: According to the premise ""Dečak je čitavu noć studirao,"" it is more likely that he skipped the exam rather than passing it. The use of the word ""studirao"" implies that he spent the entire night studying, which suggests that he did not have time to attend the exam. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mladić was afraid he would learn to swim) is more likely as the reason why he did not go near the edge of the pool.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Osetio sam otkucaje srca) is more likely to occur. The phrase ""Stavio sam ruku na grudi"" suggests that the speaker has placed their hand on their stomach, which could be a sign of nervousness or anxiety. This could lead to an increase in heart rate, as the body prepares for flight or fight response. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (there was a mess in the office) is more likely.
Response:  Option A (Porodica je pozvala komšiju na večeru) is more likely because it aligns with the idea of a family wanting to get to know their new neighbors better by inviting them over for dinner. This option allows for a more personal interaction and exchange of information compared to simply talking from behind fences (Option B).
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the plivač (swimmer) jumped into the pool (option A). Therefore, the answer is option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ugrizao sam komad lubenice,"" option A (Slučajno sam progutao sjeme) is more likely. The word ""ugrizao"" implies a deliberate action of biting into something, whereas ""slučajno"" suggests an accidental or unintentional act. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker accidentally bit into a seed than intentionally bit their tooth."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jakna mu je bila otvorena) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the boy's pants are down. The other option does not provide any clear reason for why the boy's pants would be down without his consent.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The woman has pierced her own ears, indicating that she took action to address a problem (her own discomfort) rather than relying on someone else to do so (like a buck).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ponovo sam napunio boku vode"", option A is more likely. The word ""napunio"" means to fill up or pour something, so it's likely that the speaker poured water into their mouth rather than storing it in a fridge."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the television show was censored due to vulgar language used in the episode (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Brod je propao,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""propalo"" in Croatian means ""sank."" Therefore, it is more likely that the boat sank than for any of the other options to occur."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (On je riješio zagonetku) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Čovek je spustio slušalicu) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Žena je buljila u mene."", option A (Ja sam je zagrlio) is the most likely answer. This is because the word ""buljila"" in Croatian means to hit or punch someone, so it implies that the speaker was physically harmed by the woman. Option B (""Osećao sam se nelagodno"") means ""I felt uncomfortable"", which does not align with the physical violence implied in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Slikali su izložbe) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Prijatelj me je podržao.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Čovek je počeo da se svađa sa mnom,"" it is more likely that the friend will support you rather than introduce you to him."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Gume mog bicikla su bile prazne,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that air was injected into the tires, which would cause them to become inflated."
"Response: 
Option B: Njen otac je dodirnuo njeno čelo."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Koristio sam olovku) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he was in debt) is more likely as the cause of him being rejected for a credit card. Being in debt can negatively impact one's credit score and increase the likelihood of being rejected for credit.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Imala je boginje) is more likely to be the cause of the girl staying home without school. The premise mentions that she has no school, but it does not provide any information about her enjoying math or having a good attitude towards learning. Therefore, it is more plausible that she did not have access to school due to lack of resources or other external factors rather than simply enjoying math.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vreća za smeће је била пuna"", option A is more likely. The word ""vreća"" means a container or a trash can in Serbian, so it's likely that the speaker threw the garbage into the trash can rather than burying it underground or throwing it away somewhere else. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (My comb broke) is a more plausible explanation for why my hair looks messy than option B (My cat lost its fur). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response: 
Option B: Bacio je stolicu preko sobe.  
Explanation: The premise states that the person has lost control, indicating a sudden and unexpected event. Baci...ng the ceiling is an unpredictable and chaotic act, making it more likely than isolating the computer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the branch will burn (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je izašao из туша"", option A is more likely. The word ""tunel"" in Serbian means a narrow passage or a hole through something, so it's unlikely that the man couldn't find his way out of a tunnel. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ohrabruju decu da se igraju napolju) is more likely to be the effective solution for the parents' problem. The passage suggests that the parents want their children to have a good education, but they are unable to afford it. Instead of saving money for their children's tuition or encouraging them to play outside, the parents could try to find ways to make education more accessible and affordable for their family. This could involve researching financial aid options, looking into scholarships or grants, or exploring alternative educational paths such as online courses or community college. By taking these steps, the parents may be able to provide their children with the opportunity for higher education without breaking the bank.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the cipele have broken (option A). The word ""ot kopčao"" in Croatian means ""to break"", so it is a more logical conclusion than the other option."
Response:  Option A - On je smrznuo ostatke.
Response:  Option B: Obavio sam ga losionom. (I spilled it on him.)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (I talked to a colleague at my desk) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Vrata moje kancelarije su bile otvorene"" implies that the speaker's office door was open, which means they were in their office and could have easily spoken with a colleague nearby. In contrast, Option B (""Čulo sam razgovor u hodniku"") suggests that the speaker heard a conversation in the hallway, which would be less likely given the location of the speaker's office. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible choice based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Morao sam da čekam u redu,"" option A (Sjela sam) is the most likely answer. The sentence suggests that the speaker has been waiting in line, so it's unlikely that they would have had time to look at a magazine while waiting."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je pogledao u mušku"", it is more likely that option A - ""Muha je odletela"" will occur. This is because the phrase ""čovek je pogledao u mušku"" implies a sudden and unexpected change in perspective, which could potentially cause the fly to leave its original location. Option B, ""Muha je ostala mirna"", does not convey this same sense of sudden change or movement."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Čovek je napisao oporusku"", it is more likely that he died rather than being a widower. The reason for this is that writing a will typically indicates that the person has passed away, as they are no longer able to make changes or updates to their estate plan. Therefore, option A (he died) is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response: 
Option B: Ubrzao je svoj korak. "
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Ja sam smislio rešenja) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker came up with a solution themselves rather than seeking outside help.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he was in ecstasy (Option B). The phrase ""putnik je hodao po drhtljivom visećem mostu"" suggests a sense of wonder or excitement, rather than fear or anxiety. Additionally, the use of the word ""ekstazi"" implies a heightened emotional state, which is consistent with being in ecstasy rather than being afraid."
"Response: 
Option B: On se kladio sa svojim prijateljima.
Explanation: The premise states that ""čovek"" (man) has predicted a victory for his team, indicating that he has placed a bet or gambled on the outcome of the match. Option B suggests that he has laid a bet with his friends, which is more likely given the context of the situation."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he set his alarm clock (Option A). The fact that he couldn't sleep suggests that he may have been lying awake thinking about something or feeling anxious, rather than counting sheep (Option B). Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why he couldn't fall asleep.
