Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Het was kwetsbaar) is more likely. The article was packaged in bubble wrap, indicating that it was fragile or delicate, making it more susceptible to damage during shipping.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb mijn zakken leeggemaakt,"" Option A is more likely. This is because if someone has emptied their bags, it is unlikely that they would find a card or weapon in them."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The termites have eaten through the wood in the house, indicating that they are still inside.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the agent accused them of smuggling) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (It was a holiday) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Het kantoor was gesloten"" implies that the office was closed, which could be due to a holiday or other day off. Therefore, Option A is the most likely cause for the office being closed."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ze speelde dammen) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the girl lost energy without any explanation or context, suggesting that she may have been engaging in a sedentary activity such as playing checkers or chess. Damman is a game of strategy and skill that does not require much physical exertion, making it a plausible reason for why the girl might have lost energy while playing it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (more people came to the line) is the more likely cause for why the woman lost her place in the queue.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het meisje knipte haar neus,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the girl pinched her nose suggests that she may have been experiencing discomfort or irritation, which could lead to tearing up or even vomiting. It is less likely that the baby would be responsible for making a mess on their own without any external stimulus."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Het publiek klapte mee met de muziek) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Het meisje bleef na schooltijd voor de straf) is more likely. The fact that the girl stayed after school suggests that she may have received a punishment or consequence for her actions, rather than simply bringing the teacher an apple as a gesture of gratitude.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hun kampbegeleider vertelde ze een spookverhaalt) is more likely as it suggests that the young campers were scared by a story told to them by their campsite leader.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man heeft zijn hoofd gestoten,"" option B (he has a concussion) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the scenario, it is more likely that option A (Mijn bankrekening was leeg) is the correct cause for why de check die ik schreef is niet betaald. This is because if the person had received a salary increase, they would have had sufficient funds in their account to cover the cost of the check they wrote. Therefore, the fact that the check has not been paid suggests that there were insufficient funds in the account at the time the check was written, which is consistent with option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he sent a mass email (Option B). The fact that his email inbox was full of spam suggests that he receives a lot of unsolicited emails, which could lead him to send out a large number of emails as well.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De zeeman was in quarantaine,"" it is more likely that he was exposed to the disease (option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She recited it to herself) is more likely. The fact that she was able to recall the code without writing it down suggests that she may have committed it to memory, making Option A a more plausible explanation for how she retained the information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb het water in het glas gegoten,"" option A is more likely. The act of pouring water into a glass would quench one's thirst rather than filling up the glass. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij wilde zijn vriend steun bieden) is more likely. The man remained silent because he wanted to offer his friend support rather than thinking about what to say next.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het ongeluk was mijn schuld,"" option A (Ik voelde me schuld) is more likely. "
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (De ketting was om een band gewikkeld) is a more likely explanation for why the chain broke than option B (Er was een gebroken schakel in de keten). This is because the phrase ""de ketting was uit elkaar"" suggests that the chain was not broken at any specific point but rather came undone or unraveled, which could be caused by it being wrapped around something. In contrast, if there were a broken link in the chain, it would have been more likely to break at a specific point due to excessive stress or wear and tear. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They were arguing) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She has given testimony in court) is more likely to result in her being elected as a public official. The fact that she has appeared in court suggests that there may be legal proceedings or controversy surrounding her candidacy, which could potentially harm her chances of winning the election. In contrast, hiring a campaign manager (option A) would suggest that she is taking a more conventional approach to running her campaign, which might not necessarily impact her electability.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He reisede with a large suitcase) is more likely. The fact that he expected cold weather suggests that he packed warm clothing, which would require a larger suitcase to accommodate all of his belongings.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He staked his hand) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man kreeg tranen in de ogen,"" option A (Erzat stof in zijn ogen) is a more likely cause than option B (Hij hatha een bril over zijn oogen). This is because the phrase ""tranen in de ogen"" suggests that there may be an irritation or discomfort in his eyes, which could be caused by something other than wearing glasses."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Haar opponent accused her of cheating) is more likely. The fact that she won five consecutive matches suggests that she was performing well, but her opponent's accusation implies that there may have been some suspicion of unfair play. It is less likely that her opponent would feel sympathy for her without any prior issues or concerns.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the answers of the student were unjust) is more likely. The teacher did not trap or cheat the student; instead, the student gave incorrect answers that led to failing the examination."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik stopte om te stoppen met praten,"" option A (Ik ben mijn stem kwijt) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""om te stoppen"" suggests that the speaker has been talking for a long time or repeatedly, and therefore it is plausible that they have lost their voice."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Ik heb het in de magnetron gedaan) caused the frozen food to thaw. The magnetron is a component of a microwave oven that produces electromagnetic waves at a frequency that can heat or cook food quickly. It is unlikely that covering the food with plastic foliage would cause it to thaw, as this would not allow for any air circulation around the food and could potentially create a hot spot within the folds of the plastic. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hij had buikkrampen) is more likely as a cause for the worker to act as if he were sick. Buikkrampen are a common stomach disorder that can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, making it difficult for someone to work or perform daily activities. It is more plausible than option B (Hij wilde een dag vrij), as wanting a day off without any valid reason may not be a sufficient explanation for the worker's behavior.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ze rende op het zwembaddek) is more likely. The premise states that the girl ""landed"" in the swimming pool, indicating that she entered the water from above. It is less likely that she would have jumped into the pool from the springboard without first entering the water from above. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It was the opening day of the film) is more likely to be the cause for the sold-out tickets. The fact that it's the opening day of a movie often leads to high demand and sell-outs, especially if it's a popular or highly anticipated film. On the other hand, poor reviews may lead to lower ticket sales over time, but they are less likely to result in a complete sell-out on the opening day itself.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man is afgevallen,"" option A (Mensen hebben hem ge√Øsoleerd) is more likely. The premise suggests that something has caused the man to fall out of favor with others, which could be interpreted as a form of isolation or exclusion. Option B (Mensen complimenteerden hem) does not align with this interpretation and seems less plausible given the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She has a letter typed) is more likely. The fact that she has ""blaren"" or calluses on her hands suggests that she spends a lot of time typing, which is consistent with the idea that she is writing a letter. Climbing up a rope would not typically result in calluses on the hands."
"Response:  Option B: The acrobat swung from a trapeze.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the acrobat will swing from a trapeze rather than jumping for joy. Trapeze is an essential apparatus used by aerialists and acrobats in circuses, and it makes sense that the performer would use this equipment to showcase their skills. In contrast, option A does not provide any context or explanation as to why the audience would be surprised or impressed by someone simply riding a unicycle. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I lost my patience,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the speaker's friend let them wait suggests a lack of consideration or care for their companion's feelings, which could have caused the speaker to lose their patience."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ze onderhandelden over a verdrag) is more likely. The premise suggests that the warring countries want peace, so they will be more likely to negotiate a treaty rather than develop nuclear weapons.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man nam slaap pillen,"" it is more likely that he became sleepy (option A). Taking sleeping pills would cause drowsiness or sedation, leading to a state of being sleepy. Having fever (koorts) does not necessarily lead to feeling sleepy."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (She has a bruise on her knee) is more likely. The fact that she ""botst"" against the bank suggests that there was a sudden impact or collision, which could result in a bruise on her knee rather than the ben of the bank becoming loose."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De jongen drukte de baloon,"" it is more likely that option A, ""De ballon is gesprongen"" (The balloon burst) will occur. This is because when a child squeezes a balloon, it can cause the rubber to stretch or even burst. Therefore, option A is the most logical choice based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They have gone to the airport) is more likely. The fact that they have checked into their hotel room suggests that they are now at their destination, rather than still traveling to get there.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik beet in de perzik,"" it is more likely that option A, ""De perzik is gekneusd,"" is correct. The verb ""beet"" implies a physical action of biting into something hard, which would cause damage to the fruit. Therefore, it is more likely that the perizon has been crushed or damaged as a result of being bitten into."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mijn handen werden kleverig,"" option A (Ik heb een donut gegeten) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""kleverig"" typically means sticky or gooey in Dutch, which would be consistent with eating a sugary food like a donut. Having a sweet tooth ( Option B) does not necessarily explain why one's hands might become sticky."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (the door went open) is more likely to be true.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the products were tested for quality assurance) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that activists are boycotting the products, suggesting that there is a problem with their quality or ethical production process. While child labor is a serious issue, it is unlikely that activists would focus solely on this aspect without also raising concerns about other aspects of the products' production, such as quality control. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I have drilled a hole in the wall,"" option A is more likely. The premise suggests that something small enough to fit through the hole (such as a mouse) could potentially emerge from it. Option B does not provide any information about what might come out of the hole, making option A the more plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The woman felt jealous of her sister because she (the sister) was separated from their parents.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb wijn op mijn shirt gemorst,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as the speaker has a shirt on rather than having taken it off. Therefore, the likelier response would be ""Ik heb een schort aan."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De klant hath his purse searched) is more likely because it implies that the customer had to search through their own belongings to find the money, rather than simply giving it away. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mensen gaven hem wisselgeld) is more likely. The idea of a street musician drawing a crowd and receiving money from them aligns with the concept of passersby showing appreciation for good performances through tips or donations. It's less likely that a street performer would use their music to intimidate or scatter a crowd, as this goes against the social norms of how audiences typically interact with buskers in public spaces.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De kleine jongen huilde naar zijn oppas,"" option A is more likely. The boy missed his parents, which is a common reason for children to cry. Snack time may also be a possibility, but it's less likely given the context of the situation."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the pilot flew through the storm (Option B). The radar of a plane's pilot would detect any nearby storms, so if there was one in the vicinity, the pilot would be aware of its presence. It is unlikely that they would simply turn off their radar without taking any action to avoid the storm. Therefore, option B is the most plausible choice given the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De boom liet zijn bladeren vallen,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""De bladeren veranderden in kleur,"" occurred. The premise suggests that something changed about the blades of grass, rather than their location or accumulation."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he decided to play a trick on his sister) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (his father stopped the car at a gas station) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the child would need to go to the restroom. The other option (giving him a fizzy drink) does not provide any obvious reason for the child's sudden need to use the restroom.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het kind sprenkelde visvoer in de tank,"" option A (De vis sprong uit de tank) is more likely to occur. The act of sprinkling food into a tank would cause the fish inside to move towards it, potentially resulting in some of them jumping out of the water."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She was betrokken bij een protest) is more likely to be the cause of the change in her political opinions. The premise suggests that she has been involved in a protest, which could have exposed her to new ideas or perspectives that may have influenced her views. Option A (Ze is van partij veranderd) implies that she has simply changed parties, which may not necessarily result in a significant shift in her political beliefs.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ik heb de kraan open gedaan) is more likely to be the cause of the mess. This is because opening a drain can potentially cause water or other substances to flow out of it, leading to a messy situation. Option B (Ik heb er afvoerreiniger in gegooid) does not provide any information about causing a mess, and it is unlikely that cleaning a drain would result in a mess without any prior action being taken to unclog or open it first. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De passagiers stapten uit de trein,"" option A is more likely. The train has arrived at the station, which means that the passengers have disembarked from it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Hij has a stamp on the envelope) is correct. The fact that the man's fingerprints are found on the moist flap of the envelope suggests that he may have placed a stamp there, rather than simply closing the envelope.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They enjoyed each other's company) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She was onsaled) is more likely. The premise states that the accountant ""had used the company's money incorrectly,"" implying that their actions were unethical or illegal, leading to disciplinary action such as termination of employment."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik keek naar de klok,"" option A is more likely. The speaker heard the clock ticking rather than wanting to control time."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mijn hand kreeg kramp,"" option A is more likely to be the correct cause. The sentence suggests that the writer's hand suddenly clinched or cramped up, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as fatigue, injury, or medical conditions like muscle spasms or seizures. It is less likely that the writer's wife held them tightly enough to cause their hand to cramp, especially if they were not aware of it happening until afterward."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De schroef is gespannen,"" option A is more likely to be the correct answer because it suggests that the screw has been tightened rather than loosened."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Het stel verhuisde naar het appartement) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ze wilde de zonsondergang zien) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why the woman was sitting outside on the veranda at that time of day. The other option, Option B (She thought she saw a bolt of lightning), does not provide any logical explanation for her actions.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij kon niet zwemmen) is more likely. The fact that he wore a life vest suggests that he knew how to swim but still felt unsafe in the water, indicating that he may not have been a strong swimmer. This supports Option A as the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she pressed the backspace key (Option B). This is because a typographical error can be corrected by pressing the backspace key to delete one or more characters, rather than deleting an entire document.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ze kreeg een slecht cijfer) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het grasveld was modderig,"" option A is more likely. It rained all night, causing the ground to be muddy."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option B (she forgot to set her alarm clock) is the correct answer. The woman fell asleep without realizing it, indicating that she may have forgotten to set her alarm clock or simply overslept. This is a common occurrence for many people, especially if they are tired or not feeling well. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the woman did not wake up at the intended time.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man had zonnebrandcr√®me op,"" option A (Hijzat in de schaduw) is the most likely cause. The fact that he has sunburn cream suggests that he was exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period of time, which would not be possible if he were in the shade. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Individuen accepteerden de theorie) is more likely. The underlined sentence suggests that individuals accepted the theory, implying that it was widely accepted or popularized among a significant portion of people. This contrasts with Option A, where the researchers retracted their theory, suggesting that it may not have been well-received or supported by evidence.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the game went into overtime) is more likely. The fact that the fans are booing suggests that the game was close and there were some controversial calls made by the referee, but it does not necessarily mean that the referee made a wrong decision. It's possible that the teams were evenly matched and the game required extra time to determine a winner.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I have locked my combination) is more likely. This is because if you have entered your combination correctly but the lock remains unopened, it means that either you made a mistake in entering the combination or there is an issue with the lock itself. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De menigte werd intenser,"" option A is more likely. The father giving his son money suggests that he is trying to help him in some way, which could make the situation more intense for the son. Option B does not provide any information about how the father's action will affect the son, so it is less likely to be the correct answer based on this premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I have cleared the snow from the way) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the given information that the snow blocked the entrance. Clearing the snow would make it easier for someone to enter through the entrance. Option A (I collected the snow into a snowball) does not necessarily address the issue of the blocked entrance.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De kajakers peddelen met hun roeischaal,"" option A (the kayak reached the coast) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the kayakers are paddling with their oars, implying a steady and deliberate movement towards a specific destination, rather than being tossed around by waves or getting stuck in a particular location. Therefore, it is more likely that they will reach their intended destination, the coast, rather than getting caught up in a wave or losing control of their vessel."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she lost control of her bike because she let go of the handlebars (Option A). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The sentence ""Ik voelde hoe koele lucht over me heen ging"" suggests that a cool breeze was blown onto the speaker's skin, which is consistent with the action of a fan or air conditioner. In contrast, water being sprinkled on the skin would not produce a cooling sensation. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They were exhausted) is more likely. The premise states that the surfers returned to the beach, implying that they had been away from it for some time. Being exhausted after a long day of surfing is a more plausible reason for their return than seeing a shark, as there are no other details provided in the premise to suggest otherwise.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Het water is uit de badkuip gedrenkt.) is the most likely outcome. The premise mentions that the drain has been pulled out of the bathtub, indicating that water has been drained from the bathtub. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He bekee his ontrouw anne) is more likely. The fact that he feels guilty about cheating suggests that he has done something wrong, and admitting it to his wife would be a way of taking responsibility for his actions.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I waited until the ink was dry) is a more plausible explanation for why the ink on the poster has smudged than option B (I put water on the poster). This is because waiting for the ink to dry would allow it to set properly and become less prone to smudging, while putting water on the poster would likely cause the ink to run or blur.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het kind was schreeuwend wakker,"" option A is more likely. The child's nightmare could have caused them to wake up screaming."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De jongen legde zijn voeten op de tafel,"" option A (Zijn vader ging aan tafel zitten) is more likely. This is because the action described in the premise does not involve giving a sermon or any other form of communication, but rather sitting down at the table. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ik zwaaide met mijn armen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De burgers verrichtten een opstand) is more likely. The premise suggests that the government has been oppressive towards its citizens, leading to frustration and anger among them. This could lead to a situation where the citizens decide to take matters into their own hands by staging an uprising or revolt against the government. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome in this scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he has a tent up. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ze wilde leren tekenen) is more likely as it provides a specific reason for her traveling abroad that aligns with her interests and skills.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zijn collega kreeg een promotie) is more likely as a cause for the man's jealousy.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had hallucinations) is the correct answer. The fact that he saw aliens suggests that his experience may have been a product of his imagination or a hallucination rather than him actually seeing them.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zijn hair is now blonde,"" it is more likely that he has used bleach or a lightening product (option A) rather than shampoo (option B). This is because bleach is commonly used to lighten hair, while shampoo does not typically have this effect."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B is more likely. The artist felt a surge of inspiration to create new work, indicating that she was in a productive phase rather than criticizing her previous work.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hij is ontslagen uit het leger) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the son's move away from home. The other option (Hij ging naar de universiteit) does not provide a specific reason for his departure.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the planks were covered with dust) is more likely. The premise mentions that ""booken vielen uit de boekenkast,"" which implies that something caused the books to fall out of the bookcase, rather than the bookcase itself shaking or moving. Since the planks are mentioned as being covered in dust, it's more likely that the books simply fell out due to gravity or some other external force, rather than an earthquake or other seismic event causing the bookcase to shift."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ik heb een licht aangestoken) is the correct answer. The statement ""De stroom in mijn huis is uit"" implies that there is no electricity flowing through the house, which means that lights cannot be lit. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the light in your house is not working."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""We rode the roller coaster,"" option A (It looked eerie) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De zak popcorn begon te knallen,"" it is more likely that option A (Ik heb boter in de zak gegooid) is the correct answer. The use of the word ""boter"" suggests that something has been added to the bag, rather than the bag itself being heated."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (De weersvoorspelling voorspelde zware winden) is more likely. The falling tree hitting an electrical line is more likely to cause a power outage if there are strong winds predicted.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He beledigde the public) is more likely. The speaker made offensive remarks that upset or insulted the audience, leading to a negative reaction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb mezelf met de speld gestoken,"" it is more likely that a drop of blood will appear on your finger than a drop of sweat. This is because inserting a needle into one's self with a sewing needle can cause injury or bleeding, rather than causing sweating. Therefore, option B (a drop of blood on your finger) is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vis Zweefde op het oppervlak van de tank,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the fish is floating suggests that it may have died or be in a state of distress, rather than simply being hungry."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De stem van de man klonk hees,"" option A (Hij was verkouden) is the most likely cause. The sound of his voice suggests that he has a cold or flu, which could affect his vocal cords and make his voice sound hoarse or wheezy. Option B (Hij is gestopt met roken) does not fit with the premise as there is no indication in the sentence that he has stopped smoking."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the lift came to a stop at the designated floor) occurred. The reason for this is that there is no indication in the premise that the lift got stuck between floors, which would be the case if option B were true. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened based on the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De tiener is het huis uit geslopen,"" option A (Hij loog tegen zijn ouders) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""het huis uit geslopen"" implies that the teenager left home without his parents' permission or knowledge, suggesting that he lied to them about where he was going or why he needed to leave. Therefore, it is more likely that the teenager deceived his parents rather than his parents imposing a form of house arrest on him."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (het toilet is overstroomd) is the cause of the flooded bathroom. The phrase ""de badkamer is overstroomd"" specifically refers to the bathroom being flooded, which suggests that the issue is related to a plumbing problem rather than a malfunctioning water heater. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De pups bleef bij zijn eigenaar,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""bleef bij"" means ""stayed with,"" indicating that the owner kept the dog. Therefore, it is more likely that the owner had a leash or collar around the dog's neck to keep it from running away."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man zag zijn weerspiegling,"" option A (Hij stond onder de uitgestrekte boom) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""onder de uitgestrekte boom"" suggests a specific location where the man could see his reflection, which aligns with Option A."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ik heb haar zur√ºckgebeld) is correct. The sentence suggests that the speaker has called their friend's phone back, indicating that they have tried to contact her. Option B (Ik heb met haar gegeten) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication of having eaten with the friend.
Response:  Based on the given information, Option A (Hun hond is weggelopen) is more likely to be the cause of their concern. The family has searched the neighborhood, indicating that they are actively looking for something or someone in their surroundings. This suggests that they may have lost their dog, rather than having valuables stolen from their home.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I saw my breath when I exhaled,"" it is more likely that option A (it was cold) caused the observation. When we exhale, our breath turns into vapor and can be seen in cold air. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zij wilden betere arbeidsomstandigheden) is more likely. The formation of a union suggests that workers were seeking better working conditions, rather than simply accepting an increase in pay from their employer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (a rotting smell) is more likely to occur because an apple tart that has been baked will typically produce a pleasant, warm aroma rather than a foul odor.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ze droeg hoge hakken) is more likely to be the cause of her struggle to walk. High heels can make it difficult to walk comfortably and may cause discomfort or pain in the feet, ankles, or legs. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why she struggled to walk.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Er kwam stoom uit de pot met water,"" option A is the most likely cause - het water kookte."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Al mijn sokken waren in de was,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ik droeg sandalen,"" is correct. The use of the Dutch word for ""sandals"" (""zandalen"") suggests that the speaker wore a type of footwear that does not cover the feet as much as lace-up shoes or boots do. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (He lost the support of the voters) is more likely to be the reason why the politician's argument was considered absurd. The fact that he lost the support of the people suggests that his argument may have been unpopular or lacking in credibility, leading to its rejection by the public.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (het stel wordt zwanger) is more likely to happen. The couple's disagreement over their engagement is a significant source of tension in their relationship, making it less likely that they would run away together without addressing this issue first. On the other hand, pregnancy can provide an unexpected opportunity for them to re-evaluate their feelings and come to a decision about their future together.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De miljonair wilde het gebouw afbreken) is more likely. The fact that the building was dedicated to a millionaire suggests that it was built for them or with their financial support, and therefore they would have had some say in its design and construction. It's unlikely that they would have wanted to destroy something they had invested time and money into.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (De verkoopmedewerker saw the girl stealing merchandise) is more likely. The premise states that the salesperson accused the girl of shoplifting, implying that they witnessed her taking something without paying for it. This suggests that the salesperson did not help the girl find a lost bag, but instead accused her of wrongdoing based on their observation. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that soldiers were sent to fight in the war rather than being reunited with their families. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Er brak een rel los voor het gerechtsgebouw) is more likely. The use of the word ""bevestigde"" in the premise suggests that the court's decision was confirmed or upheld, which could lead to a reaction from those who are unhappy with the outcome. This is further supported by the phrase ""controversi√´le uitspraak,"" which implies that the decision was not without controversy. Therefore, it is more likely that there would be an angry response from the public rather than someone making promises before the court."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ze nam de koekjes uit de pot) is more likely. The premise states that het meisje rook iets brandends, implying that something is burning or smoking. Taking the cookies out of the pot would be a more common action than leaving them in the oven to burn. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het regende in stort,"" option A (De storm werd erger) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the lift stopped working) caused the building to be evacuated. The fact that the alarm went off does not necessarily mean that there is a fire or other emergency situation that would require an evacuation. It could simply be a malfunction of the alarm system. However, if the lift is not functioning properly, it could create a safety hazard and make it difficult for people to leave the building safely, leading to an evacuation. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the father kicked his son out of the house) is more likely. The father's anger towards the son's alcoholism may lead him to take drastic measures such as kicking him out of the house rather than buying him a beer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De secretaresse is naar huis gegaan) is more likely. The fact that the advocate went to her office suggests that she may have been expecting someone there, but since the secretary is not present, it is possible that she has gone home for the day. This explanation provides a logical reason why the advocate could not find the secretary at work.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man werd ge√Ørriteerd door zijn vriend,"" option A is more likely. The fact that his friend interrupted him suggests that there was a disruption in their conversation or activity, which could have caused the man to feel irritated. Option B does not provide any information about why the man might be feeling irritated, so it is less plausible as the cause of his emotional state."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De kassier gaf het meisje haar wisselgeld) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, Option A (She was verlamd by an accident) is more likely than Option B (She came to the hospital in a stretcher). This is because the phrase ""in a rollator"" suggests that she has mobility issues due to paralysis or another neurological condition, rather than simply needing medical attention for some other reason."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Het land herdenkte zijn onafhankelijkheid) is the more likely cause for why burgers in this country would hang their national flag outside their homes. This is because the act of hanging a national flag outside one's home is often seen as a symbol of patriotism and pride in one's country, particularly during times of celebration or commemoration such as independence days. Therefore, if the country was recently independent, it is more likely that people would want to display their national flag prominently to showcase their newfound freedom and identity.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The team's loss may have inspired their fans rather than disappointing them. 
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The speaker feels proud of being able to eat with their teeth rather than feeling embarrassed about it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he is forgetten to study) is more likely. The fact that he did not pass his history exam suggests that he may have forgotten to study or did not put enough effort into preparing for the exam, rather than simply being observant in class.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (a earthquake) is more likely to be the cause of the building collapse than option B (increase in crime). Earthquakes can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially in areas prone to seismic activity. While an increase in crime could also lead to vandalism or looting that might result in building collapses, it seems less likely given the specific context provided. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Hij smeekte haar om hem terug te nemen) is more likely. The fact that he begged her to take him back suggests a level of desperation and vulnerability, which could be an indication that their relationship was important to him and that he is willing to do whatever it takes to win her back.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the ball rolled away) is more likely to occur. The premise states that both children are reaching for the ball at the same time, which means they are in close proximity to each other. As a result, there is a higher chance of them bumping into each other or their heads colliding rather than the ball rolling away. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Er zat karton in de vuilnisbak) is more likely. The fact that the beer has ""geplunderd"" (pillaged/stolen) the trash can implies that something valuable or important was taken from it, rather than just a simple object like a lid. Additionally, the presence of karton (cardboard) in the trash can suggests that there may have been other items inside as well, such as food packaging or other household waste, which could provide further clues about what happened to the beer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De jongen had het potlood geslepen,"" option B is more likely. The boy probably found it boring to sharpen the pencil, rather than it being cheap."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (She is her bonnetje kwijt) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""bonnetje kwijt"" means ""lost her hat"" in English, indicating that the woman may have misplaced or lost her hat rather than the dress not fitting properly."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De schram in mijn huid was diep,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""het heeft een litteken achtergelaten"" suggests that the wound has left a scar, which is a common consequence of deep cuts. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He stared at himself) is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for why he received strange looks from the passengers. Staring at oneself can be an unusual behavior that might attract attention from others. In contrast, looking at the ground does not provide any obvious reason for why he would receive strange glances. Therefore, Option B is the better answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mieren kruipen naar de kruimels) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The sister of the woman began to cry.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man nam een munt,"" option A is more likely. The fact that his lips were torn suggests that he may have bitten them in pain or surprise while taking the coin."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They had traffic around the theatre) is more likely. The sentence ""Het stel vertrok vroeg voor de show"" implies that they left early for the show, which could be due to heavy traffic around the theatre. Therefore, option A is a better fit than option B."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: Haar collega heeft haar ingedekt (Her colleague has stolen her work). This is because the word ""ingedekt"" implies a negative action taken by someone else towards the speaker's work, rather than a positive reaction from their boss."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hij steunde hun zaak) is more likely. The premise states that the man signed a petition in support of the activists' cause, indicating that he agreed with their views and was willing to show his support publicly. This suggests that he was sympathetic towards their cause and did not accuse them of madness or foolishness as suggested by Option B.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: He had a fear of forgetting his lines (scalphobia). This is because the actor's heart was racing due to his anxiety about remembering his lines, rather than having forgotten them entirely. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik was verdwaald,"" option A (Ik heb mijn geld geteld) is more likely. The phrase ""verdwaald"" implies a state of confusion or disorientation, which could lead to forgetfulness or confusion about one's belongings, including money. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker would say they have misplaced their money rather than unfolded a card."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De rijpe vruchten bleven in de zon hangen,"" option A (It is eaten) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""bleven in de zon hangen"" suggests that the fruit has been left out in the sun to ripen, indicating that it is ready to eat. Therefore, option A is the best choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (I have caused the breakdown) than option B (the motor overheated). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hij is naar een psychiater geweest) is more likely. The fact that he has hurt his back suggests that it may have been caused by an injury or strain, rather than just a few days of rest. Therefore, seeking medical attention from a psychiatrist seems like a more plausible explanation for how he got better.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ik had geen brandhout meer) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why there might not have been any fire in the hearth. It is less likely that the house would be cold if there were no fire burning.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She has cramps in her side) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why she stopped jogging. Option B (She got a second breath) does not provide any logical explanation for why she would suddenly stop running. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mijn buurman nodigde me binnen) is more likely. The fact that you knocked on your neighbor's door suggests that they may have been expecting you or were willing to receive you, whereas the absence of your neighbor without any explanation implies that they may not have been available or interested in seeing you.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrouw zuchtte van frustratie,"" option A is more likely. The woman's sigh suggests that her husband has not understood her concerns properly, leading to frustration. Option B does not align with the given information as there is no indication of a kiss in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the student gave the correct answer to the question) is the cause of the teacher's praise. Therefore, you should choose option A as your answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ze went to the supermarket) is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for why the woman did not have eggs at home. The supermarket is a common place where people buy groceries, including eggs, so it makes sense that she would go there if she needs eggs. In contrast, going to the boerderij (Farm) may not be as practical or feasible for someone who does not have their own chicken farm.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ik heb hem een geheim verteld) is more likely. The fact that you ""ontmoette"" an old friend suggests a chance encounter or reunion, rather than a deliberate act of giving someone a hug. Additionally, the mention of a secret being shared implies a deeper level of intimacy and trust between the two friends, which may not be immediately conveyed through a simple hug."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She has a fish) is more likely. The woman avoided going into the lake because she had caught a fish and didn't want to disturb it while trying to leave.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De student came wet to class,"" option A (his umbrella broke) is the more likely cause. The fact that he came wet suggests that it may have been raining outside, which could have caused his umbrella to break or not function properly. Option B (his bike was stolen) does not provide a clear explanation for why he would come wet to class."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the user clicked with the mouse) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (an accident occurred on the main road) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""took a detour"" suggests that the driver took an alternative route to avoid something, and the mention of an ""on geluk"" (Dutch for ""accident"") implies that there was some kind of incident or mishap on the main road. Therefore, it is more likely that the driver took a detour to avoid the accident rather than following someone else's truck."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik hing het natte linnengoed op de waslijn buiten,"" it is more likely that option B: Het linnen is befouled. This is because the word ""nat"" (wet) in the premise implies that the linen has been exposed to water, making it more susceptible to dirt or stains. Therefore, it is more likely that the linen will become befouled rather than dry."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrouw zette haar bril op,"" option A (Het zonlicht was helder) is more likely as it provides additional context that supports this conclusion. The fact that she put on her sunglasses suggests that she is in a bright environment, making option A the most plausible explanation for why she called a taxi."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man staarde naar de nachtelijke hemel,"" option A (Hij wou dat het zomer was) is the most likely cause. The fact that he wishes it were summer suggests that he is not content with the current weather conditions, implying a desire for something else."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik voelde me uitgeput,"" option B is more likely. The fact that the speaker felt exhausted suggests that they did not go to bed early but instead lay awake for a significant portion of the night."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man ging naar de kapper,"" option A is more likely. The fact that he went to the barber suggests that he may have gotten a haircut, which would result in his hair growing longer. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The boy did not welcome his new classmate, indicating that he found him unpleasant or unwelcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik had een drang naar een glas melk,"" option A (Ik at koekjes) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""had een drang"" means ""had a strong desire or craving,"" so it's likely that the speaker wanted to eat something sweet like cookies rather than bake bread."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the driver switched to reverse) is more likely because it would allow the car to move away from the rain. Option A (the chauffeur turned on the headlights) does not necessarily help the car avoid the rain.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I have parked at the entrance) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ze had een schrijversblok) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for missing the deadline without requiring any additional context or information.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I asked for a supervisor) is more likely to be the correct answer. The text states that the employee ""hing op"" or ""depended on,"" indicating that they were expecting someone to help them with their work-related issue. Asking for a supervisor would be a logical step in seeking assistance, whereas providing one's identification number may not necessarily lead to finding a solution to the problem. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De wind waaide door het open raam,"" option A (the doorbell went) is the most likely answer. The wind blowing through an open window would not cause a doorbell to ring."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De stroom in mijn huis is uit,"" option A (Ik heb de lamp uitgekoppeld) is more likely as a cause for the power outage in your house than option B (Ik heb een zekering laten ontploffen). This is because turning off a light switch or unplugging an appliance are common causes of a temporary power outage, while causing an explosion to occur is highly unlikely and not a typical solution to fix a power outage issue."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Hij bewoog zijn spieren in de spiegel) is the more likely cause for why the man's reflection looked heavier. This is because muscles are not visible in a mirror image, so it would be impossible for him to have moved his muscles in the mirror. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he raged in the war) is more likely. The idea of a student trying to calculate something in his head without any tools or resources is absurd, as it would be very difficult for him to do so accurately. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the premise provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De vader heeft de luier van de baby veranderd) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the baby fell asleep so quickly. The other option, Option B (De vader schudde de baby zachtjes), does not provide an obvious reason for why the baby would fall asleep so quickly.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The boy being ""doorweekt"" (soaked) better fits with the idea of a water balloon hitting someone than the person having a ""hersenschudding"" (concussion)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Iedereen op de foto's weigerde te glimlachen) is more likely. The fact that everyone refused to smile suggests that there was something wrong with the photos, possibly due to a lack of proper lighting or composition, rather than just being blurry.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (I was alone) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""afgewezen"" in Dutch means ""rejected,"" so it's likely that the speaker declined the invitation because they didn't want to attend the party alone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb getraind,"" it is more likely that option A (Ik voelde me energiek) is the correct answer. The word ""getraind"" means trained in Dutch, so the speaker is likely to feel energetic after training. Option B (Ik was bang) does not fit with the context of the sentence as there is no indication of fear or anxiety in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Het heeft water opgenomen) is correct. The phrase ""Ik heb de natte spons geperst"" implies that the speaker has squeezed out water from a wet sponge, which suggests that there was already water present in the sponge beforehand. Therefore, it is unlikely that option B (Er lekte water uit) is true, as there would be no water to leak if the sponge were already wet."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The resort was fully booked) is more likely to be the cause of the vacationers' disappointment. The fact that the resort was fully booked suggests that there were no available rooms for the vacationers, leaving them with no choice but to look for alternative accommodations. This is a more plausible explanation than Option B (The resort lay on an island), as it does not provide any logical reason why the vacationers would have difficulty finding a room at the resort due to its location.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B: She wanted to rebel is more likely. The fact that she got a tattoo despite being afraid of needles suggests that she may have been trying to assert her independence or express herself in a way that goes against societal norms. This is consistent with the idea of teenagers often engaging in risky behaviors as a form of rebellion against authority figures or societal expectations.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (I became suspicious) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Het bewijs betrof hem) is the more likely cause. The text states that de criminal gave himself up, implying that he had been involved in illegal activities and was aware of the consequences. This suggests that there may have been evidence against him, leading to his decision to surrender. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the criminal gave himself up.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De dikke man besloot af te vallen,"" option B is more likely. The reason being that de dikke man has decided to lose weight, which means he will be consuming less calories than usual, including caffeine. Therefore, it is more likely that he will have reduced or no caffeine intake, making option B the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she glided (Option A). The word ""gleed"" implies a smooth and effortless movement, which fits with the idea of someone moving across ice. In contrast, ""beefed"" does not have any obvious connection to the concept of ice or movement. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrouw had ringen onder haar ogen,"" option A is more likely. The woman stayed awake all night because of the rings under her eyes, indicating that she was tired or uncomfortable due to some physical discomfort caused by the rings. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the woman couldn't fall asleep."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (De vulkaan barstte uit) is the more likely cause of the lava flowing out. The sentence implies that there has been an eruption or explosion within the volcano, which would result in a sudden release of magma and gas. This is a common occurrence during volcanic activity and is therefore the most likely explanation for the lava flowing out. Option B (De vulkaan was slapen) means ""The volcano was sleeping"", which does not convey any sense of recent volcanic activity or eruption."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrouw trok haar schoenen aan,"" option A is more likely. The fact that she knew everyone at the party suggests that she was comfortable there and enjoying herself, which makes it less likely that she would want to leave."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ze liet me door de tolkist) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker was allowed or let through by a toll operator. Option B (Ze hield me tegen bij de tol) means ""He held me back at the toll"" and does not fit the context as well."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij verkocht zijn aandelen) is more likely as it suggests that the director sold his shares to avoid financial difficulties rather than squandering his fortune.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man ging naar de dokter,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the doctor was away on leave suggests that the man went to see another doctor or a different medical professional. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I left my bedroom through the window,"" option A (the house was on fire) is the most likely cause. "
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He has his hands with soap suds) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the boy's fingers were cleaned. Taking a long shower would not necessarily explain why his fingers were cleaned.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik spuug de melk uit,"" it is more likely that option A, ""De melk smaakt zuur,"" is the correct answer. The phrase ""spuug de melk uit"" implies that something unpleasant or unwanted happened to the milk, such as tasting sour. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why someone might say this sentence than option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb de bus gemist,"" it is more likely that option A (Ik was vroeg op het werk) is correct. The sentence suggests that the speaker missed the bus, which would be consistent with being early to work."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrachtwagen botste met de auto,"" it is more likely that the car will be damaged (Option B). Therefore, the answer is Option B."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they have won the competition. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De frisdrankfles zisse,"" it is more likely that option A (Ik heb de fles omgedraaid) is the correct answer. The phrase ""omgedraaid"" suggests a rotation or turning of the flesh, which aligns with the idea of drinking from a bottle. Option B (Ik heb de dop afgedraaid) means ""I have turned off the cap,"" which does not fit as well with the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He is by an open window into the house) is more likely.  The premise states that the boy was ""uit zijn huis gesloten,"" which means he was outside his house. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would have climbed onto the roof to get inside. Instead, he may have entered through an open window or other opening in the house."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De deurbel ging,"" option A is more likely. The visitor knocked on the door."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man heeft zijn pak beflektet,"" it is more likely that he hung it in his closet (Option B). The phrase ""beflecket"" means to wet or dampen something, so it's unlikely that he would have taken his jacket to a dry cleaner's."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De tandpasta sprong uit de buis) is more likely to occur because it implies a sudden and unexpected movement of the tandpasta out of the tube. The other option (Het meisje spuugde de tandpasta uit) does not convey such an action.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pacifisten organizeerden een protest) is more likely to have an impact on the increase of civilian casualties during war. This is because a protest can raise awareness about the issue and put pressure on decision-makers to take action, but it may not directly address the root causes of the conflict or lead to immediate changes in military tactics. In contrast, a parade may be seen as less relevant or effective in addressing the issue of civilian casualties during war.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het meisje rukte het lint uit haar hair,"" option A is more likely. The fact that she pulled it out of her hair suggests that she had previously fastened or tied something with the lint, making option A the most plausible explanation. Option B does not provide any context to support the idea that the lint looked babyish, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Hij saw er jonger uit) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Uit het ei kwam een kippenjong,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""uit het ei"" means ""out of the egg,"" so it is unlikely that the speaker would say they broke the egg to get a chicken hatched from it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De gefangene verhongerde,"" option A (Hij is overleden) is more likely. The phrase ""verhongerd"" means ""starved to death,"" indicating that the prisoner has died due to lack of food or other basic necessities. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man verloor zijn evenwicht op de ladder,"" option B (Hij viel van de ladder) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij nam een slok frisdrank) is more likely as it directly contradicts the premise that the child dug.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Er kwam een koude luchtstroom door het raam,"" option A (Ik ontspan) is the most likely response. The arrival of a cold air current through the window would make someone feel chilly or relaxed, leading them to unwind or loosen up. Option B (Ik beefde) means shivering or trembling, which may occur as a result of feeling cold but does not align with the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (her classmates having respect for her) is more likely to be the cause of why she received a scholarship. The premise states that she was able to attend university because of a scholarship, implying that it was awarded based on merit or achievement rather than just financial need. This suggests that her classmates may have had respect for her due to her academic performance or other personal qualities, rather than simply because she had good grades.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (She was in love with him) is more likely. The fact that she made fun of him suggests that there may be a personal connection or rivalry between them, rather than just living near each other. Additionally, the phrase ""het meisje"" (the girl) implies a romantic interest, further supporting this option."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij wekte medelijden op) is more likely. The phrase ""stal eten"" implies that the man stole food, which would likely elicit sympathy or empathy from others rather than a lack of money."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ik wilde privacy) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man stak zijn hand naar me uit,"" option B (Ik slaagde hem) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb me verstopt,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Het vuurwerk ging omhoog"" (The fireworks went up) is the correct answer. This is because ""verstopt"" in Dutch means ""hidden"" or ""secretly"", so the sentence suggests that something unexpected and dramatic happened to the speaker, such as a firework display going off without warning. Option B, ""De frisbee vloog naar mijn hoofd"" (The frisbee flew towards my head), does not fit with this context and seems less likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het meisje beet in haar nagels,"" option B is more likely. The girl biting her nails suggests that she was surprised or startled, rather than being worried about something."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Ik heb een afspraak op de kalender) is more likely as it provides a specific reason for changing the calendar. Option B (Het was het begin van een nieuwe maand) does not provide any context or explanation for why the calendar would be changed. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (he has filed for divorce) is more likely. The husband's discovery of his wife's affair may lead him to seek legal separation or divorce as he seeks to move forward from the betrayal and hurt caused by her actions.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the ball bounced) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (She has her answer wrong) is more likely. The fact that she made a mistake in her answer suggests that she may have misunderstood or misinterpreted the question, rather than simply relying on someone else's answers. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why she failed her exam.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De speler tackelde zijn tegenstander,"" it is more likely that his opponent fell to the ground (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb de tomaten van de wijnstok geplukt,"" it is more likely that option A is correct, as plucking ripe tomatoes from a vine would be the most logical explanation for why they are no longer on the vine. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hij heeft zijn ex-vriendin ontmoet voor de lunch) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I let the thermometer fall) is more likely to have caused the temperature reading to increase than option B (the weather became warmer). This is because a falling thermometer would be subject to random fluctuations in temperature due to external factors such as air currents or contact with objects, whereas changes in weather patterns are less likely to result in sudden increases in temperature readings. Therefore, it is more plausible that the increase in temperature was caused by the thermometer being dropped rather than changes in the weather.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (het dak of het gerechtsgebouw is opgeblazen) is more likely to occur as a result of a tornado passing through the city. Tornados are known for their destructive power and can easily damage or destroy buildings, including government buildings like courthouses. The other option, that the snelway was gevaarlijk befrozen, does not seem to be directly related to a tornado's effects.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zijn cijfers zijn verbeterd) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik voelde me op mijn gemak,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""op mijn gemak"" suggests a comfortable state of being, which could be achieved by wrapping oneself in a blanket or other soft material. Therefore, option B is the most plausible cause for why the speaker felt at ease."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I have polished the stone,"" it is more likely that option A, ""It became smooth"" is correct. The verb ""polish"" means to make something smooth or shiny by rubbing it with a polishing material, so it is reasonable to expect that the stone would become smoother after being polished. Option B, ""It became glittering,"" does not fit as well with the premise, as it implies that the stone became sparkly or flashy, rather than simply smooth."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb suiker aan de koffie gedaan,"" it is more likely that Option A (the koffie rook sterk) will occur. This is because adding sugar to coffee can make it taste bitter or unpleasant, rather than sweet."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he has cut himself than that he has torn up the newspapers. Therefore, option A (Hij heeft zich gesneld) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (De spijker is in het hout geslagen) is correct. The premise states that the spike was struck with a hammer, which would suggest that the spike has been driven into the wood rather than becoming rusty. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vis has de lijn gebeten,"" option A (De visser trok de vis in) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She has a pimple) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise suggests that the speaker is embarrassed about going to school because of their appearance, specifically a pimple. This is a common concern for many teenagers, and it's unlikely that they would have their ear pierced as a result of feeling embarrassed about their appearance. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mijn gezichtsuitdrukking verlichtte,"" option A (Ik heb goed nieuws) is the most likely cause. The phrase ""verlight"" means to light up or brighten in Dutch, so it suggests that the speaker has good news to share. Option B (Ik verloor mijn geduld) means ""I lost my patience,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I wiped my hands with a damp cloth,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the handdoek was wet suggests that it was used to clean something or someone, rather than being simply damp from humidity. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker's hands were wet."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man verloor zijn evenwicht op de kruk,"" option A is more likely. The fact that he lost his balance suggests that something external to him caused it, such as the kruk shaking underneath him. It is less likely that he simply made a mistake while painting and got his own balance wrong (option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They have lost their game) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the team members are giving each other the blame.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I asked for forgiveness,"" option A is more likely. This is because asking for forgiveness implies that one has made a mistake or wronged someone, which aligns with the definition of ""spijt"" as feeling remorse or regret. Option B does not necessarily convey this meaning, as it could simply imply that the speaker has achieved their goal without any negative consequences."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The man talked nonstop about himself, indicating that he was self-centered and not interested in getting to know the woman better. This behavior is consistent with the idea that he was boring her with his constant talk of himself.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het meisje glimlachte,"" it is more likely that Option A is correct, as her rosy cheeks are a common feature associated with smiling."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the mine) caused the explosion. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man had zijn voet doorboord,"" option A (Hij liep in een plas) is the most likely cause. This is because the phrase ""doorboord"" implies a deep wound or injury to the foot, which could only occur if the person was walking through water or another liquid. Option B (Hij stapte opgebroken glas) does not fit with this premise as it suggests that the person stepped on broken glass, which would not typically result in a deep wound to the foot."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ze ontdekten de identiteit van de moordenaar) is more likely. The fact that the investigators have been searching for the killer's identity based on fingerprints suggests that they may have found a match or lead that could help them identify the perpetrator. Option B (They vonde het wapen op de plaats delict) does not provide any information about the investigation's progress or outcome, so it is less likely to be the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Er was veel verkeer op de snelweg,"" option A (Ik ben een omweg genomen) is more likely. "
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (many people were unemployed) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They were on the point of crossing the road) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the children were in a situation where they could have crossed the road, but the guard blew her whistle to stop them. This implies that they were close to the road and potentially at risk of being hit by a car. Therefore, Option A is more plausible than Option B.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hij vertelde me de waarheid) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De chauffeur was op de weg gestrand) is more likely. The fact that the car ran out of gas suggests that the driver may have been driving for an extended period without realizing it, which could happen if they were lost or stranded in a remote area. Option B (De chauffeur hath a lifter opgehaald) implies that someone else helped the driver, which may not be as plausible given the context provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrouw ging bevallen,"" option A is more likely. The woman has given birth to a baby, indicating that the pregnancy has ended successfully. Option B does not provide any information about the outcome of the pregnancy and simply states that the woman experienced morning sickness, which can occur at various stages of pregnancy. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the provided premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De hoed van de man is weggeblazen,"" option A (Hij trok de hoed af) is the most likely cause. The wind blowing away the man's hat does not provide a clear explanation for why his hat would be gone, whereas pulling it off himself provides a logical reason for its absence."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She received an invitation) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zijn moeder nam hem mee naar het park) is more likely. The mention of his mother taking him to the park suggests that she may have been caring for him or spending time with him in a pleasant outdoor setting, rather than measuring his temperature.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (He wanted to impress his date) is a more likely explanation for why the man sprayed himself with cologne than option B (He put gel in his hair). The fact that he went out of his way to apply cologne suggests that he was trying to make an impression or look attractive for someone else, rather than simply styling his hair.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De stroom in het huis is uit."", option A (Ik zocht naar een zaklamp) is more likely. "
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (De moeder baarde tweelingen) is more likely to be the cause of the family's move to a larger house. The fact that the son has graduated from high school does not necessarily imply that the family needs a larger house, as they may have other reasons for moving, such as having more children or wanting to live in a different location. On the other hand, having twins would likely require more space, especially if the twins are young children, making it more plausible that the family moved to a larger house to accommodate their growing family.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ze wilde haar energie besparen) is more likely. The reason for slowing down during a marathon is usually to conserve energy rather than seeing the finish line.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De machine spuugt het wisselgeld uit) is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for why the boy was able to get money from the vending machine. The other option does not provide a clear reason as to how the boy managed to get money from the machine. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (I gave him a knuffle) is more likely. The fact that you ""rolle[d] your eyes"" suggests that you may have been annoyed or unimpressed by your friend's news, whereas giving someone a knuffle is a more comforting and empathetic response."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij schreef een schuldbekentenis) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man vervloekt,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""knipte zijn nagels"" means ""cut his nails."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man was trots op zijn broer,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the man is proud of his brother suggests that they have a positive relationship, which means that their parents must have gotten along with them well. Therefore, it is less likely that there was a fight between their parents and brother."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She kept looking at the stars) is more likely. The premise mentions that the girl wanted to learn more about the sun, but it also states that she looked at the stars, implying that she was already interested in astronomy and space. Therefore, it is more likely that she would continue to observe the stars rather than go to the library to research them.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (I have put the poster above the door) is the correct answer. The fact that the poster is ""hingan de muur"" suggests that it is attached to a wall or surface, rather than being held up by tape on the back. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the poster ended up where it was found."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the architect has changed the plans) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man liet zijn lepel vallen,"" it is more likely that his hand trembled (Option A). This is because a person's hand may shake or tremble when they accidentally drop something, such as a spoon, without any intention to do so. It is less likely that he would lick the spoon after dropping it, as this action does not make sense in the context of the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De raad van bestuur has the company dissolved) is more likely. The CEO's sudden resignation suggests that there may be internal issues within the company that led to this decision. It is less likely that the board of directors would find a replacement for the CEO if they had already decided to dissolve the company.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I approached the podium) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zijn familie betaalde zijn borgtocht) is more likely to be the reason for his release from prison. This is because the premise specifically mentions that he was ""verloren gelaten"" (freed without trial), suggesting that he was released early due to a financial settlement or payment made by his family rather than through any legal proceedings. Option B (Hij viel een medegevangene aan) does not align with this interpretation of the premise and seems less plausible in this context."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Their house is in a brand-new fire) is more likely to be the correct answer. The family has already lost all their belongings, suggesting that they have experienced significant financial difficulties or hardships. It is unlikely that they would sell their only remaining asset, their home, without any other alternatives available. Therefore, it is more plausible that their house was destroyed by a recent fire, leaving them with nothing but the clothes on their backs.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Het blikje is gerecycled) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She learned communication skills) is more likely. The premise mentions ""het meisje"" (the girl) going with the debate team, which suggests that she was involved in a group activity where communication skills were important. Learning to use a computer (option A) would not necessarily have an impact on her ability to communicate effectively in a group setting."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (I listened to music) is a more plausible explanation for why my mood improved than option B (I did the dishes). Listening to music has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health and well-being, while doing the dishes may not necessarily improve one's mood. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (They gave the homeless food) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the purpose of the fundraising event was to raise money, but giving food to the homeless is a more direct and practical way to help them than holding a veiling. Therefore, it is more likely that they actually gave the homeless food rather than held a veiling.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De eightbaan stortte in de steile val,"" option A is more likely. The passengers are likely to be thrown around or jolted during a sudden stop or crash, rather than simply screaming."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ik sloeg de deur dicht toen ik het huis verliet) is more likely to be true than option A (Ik heb de brievenbus gecontroleerd toen ik het huis verliet). This is because the premise mentions that the speaker left the house, but does not mention anything about checking the mailbox. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker closed the door behind them when they left the house rather than checking the mailbox.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The man getting up early to see the sunrise is a more plausible explanation than him traveling to the north for that purpose.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb het papier gefolden,"" option B (het papier kreukelde) is more likely. The act of folding implies that the paper was not in its original state and therefore more likely to have creased or crumpled."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (leaders of other countries sending noodhulp) is more likely. The premise states that ""the nation has suffered a natural disaster,"" which could result in significant damage to infrastructure and resources, making it difficult for the affected country to provide aid to its own citizens, let alone accept help from others. Therefore, it is more likely that other countries would send aid to help alleviate the suffering of the affected population."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De kleren van de jongen zijn doorweekt,"" it is more likely that he fell into the swimming pool (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Het moest naar de bibliotheek) is more likely. The sentence implies that the book had to be returned to a library, rather than being borrowed from a friend.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij was in de gevangenis gegooid) is a more likely cause than option B (Hij was veroordeeld voor moord). The sentence ""De misdadiger werd ge√´xecuteerd"" implies that the person was put to death, which could only happen through execution by hanging or other means in prison. Therefore, it is less likely that he would have been sentenced to life imprisonment for murder."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het zonlicht drong de kamer binnen,"" option A (Ik heb de gordijnen opengedaan) is the more likely cause. The sunlight entering the room suggests that the curtains are open, allowing the light to enter."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik trok de bedrieger aan zijn hair,"" option A is more likely. The word ""haar"" in Dutch means both ""hair"" and ""her."" So, it's possible that the speaker pulled the liar by her hair. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He found the manuscript interesting) is more likely. The editor's positive reaction to the manuscript suggests that they enjoyed reading it and found it engaging, rather than being confused by it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She beseft that the card was gone) is more likely. The premise states that she annulled her credit card, indicating that she intentionally removed it from her possession. It's unlikely that she would forget about a credit card being gone without realizing it, especially if she had just used it recently. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why she can't find her credit card.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They got married) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ik heb mijn eigen liedje gecomponeerd) is more likely. The speaker seems to be suggesting that they have created their own music as a response to the weak sound they heard earlier, rather than simply turning up the volume of the existing music.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het hair of the boy stood up,"" option A is more likely. The reason being that when a person's hair stands up, it is usually due to excitement or surprise, rather than intentionally pulling it. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the boy's hair stood up in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De bug was pulverized,"" option A is more likely. The use of the word ""pulverized"" suggests that something has been crushed or ground into a fine powder, which could be caused by spraying oneself with insect repellent. Option B does not make sense in this context as it implies that one has climbed onto an insect, which is unlikely given the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb mijn ogen geopend,"" option A (Ik werd wakker) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I asked him to lend me his CD) is more likely. The speaker mentions that their neighbor's music is loud, so they might be more inclined to ask for a copy of the music rather than asking them to turn it down.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He earned less than the minimum wage) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He took up a hobby) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (De verf is overal gespat) is more likely. The artist mixed yellow paint with blue paint, resulting in a uniform green color throughout the canvas.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ik had niets meer om over te praten) is more likely as it suggests that there was nothing else to talk about, indicating a lack of interest or engagement in the topic being discussed.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ik heb hem een koele schouder gegeven) is more likely. The fact that the brother has been discharged from the hospital suggests that he may be feeling unwell or weak, and therefore may need extra care and attention. Giving him a cold shoulder could be seen as an act of neglect or indifference towards his well-being, rather than a warm welcome home.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The opening scene of the play began) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De ontvoerder dreigde de gijzelaar te kwetsen) is more likely. The fact that the captor submitted to the kidnapper's demands suggests that they were trying to avoid harm or danger. Threats of violence are often used by criminals to gain compliance from their victims, so it is plausible that the captor was trying to protect themselves by cooperating with the kidnapper's demands.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the musician struck the drum) is more likely because it provides a clearer explanation for how the loud noise was produced. Option A (the musician kicked with his foot) does not provide a clear explanation for how the noise was produced.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (het kind werd schreeuwend wakker van een nachtmerrie) is more likely. The fact that the child woke up screaming suggests that they had a nightmare or an unsettling experience in their sleep, which could be caused by various factors such as stress, anxiety, or a traumatic event. It's less likely that the child would be afraid to look under their bed without any obvious reason for doing so.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ze is te vroeg geboren) is the correct answer. The woman communicated with gestures because she was born too early to speak or understand language.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (het water werd verontreinigd) is more likely. The premise mentions ""droogte"" or drought, which can lead to soil salinization and contamination of groundwater sources, ultimately affecting the quality of drinking water. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De kat jaagde de vogel achterna,"" it is more likely that option A, ""De vogel is weggevlogen,"" will occur because the word ""achterna"" implies chasing or pursuing, which suggests that the cat has caught up to the bird. Therefore, the bird is unlikely to have been caught by a worm (option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She has moved to a new town) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the girl would no longer be attending school. It is less likely that the school would be free during the summer months without any indication of such in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the workers went on strike) is more likely. The owner of the factory refused to increase wages, leading to dissatisfaction among the workers who then decided to go on strike as a form of protest. This is a common response when employees feel that their demands are not being met or ignored by management.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (De extremisten hebben hem be√Ønvloed) is more likely. The leader was influenced by the extremists rather than being murdered by them.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I walked barefoot on the beach,"" option A (sand at my feet) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik werd midden in de nacht wakker met een koude,"" option B is more likely. The fact that you were suddenly awake in the middle of the night with a cold suggests that you may have been exposed to a cool or chilly environment, which could cause your body to react by producing sweat (option B). Option A does not make sense in this context as it implies that you are wearing a jogging suit, which would not provide any protection from the cold."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De moeder zwijgde haar zoon,"" it is more likely that her son glimlachte ( Option A). This is because the verb ""zwijgen"" means to remain silent or keep quiet, so it is unlikely that her son would have reacted with anger or displeasure by zeurden (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Een gap in my jeans,"" option B (I tripped over the curb) is more likely. The premise suggests that there was an unexpected opening or tear in the speaker's pants, which could have been caused by a sudden impact or jolt, such as tripping over something. Option A (I closed my fly) does not provide any explanation for how the gap in the speaker's pants came to be."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De jongen droeg een beugel,"" option A (Hij heeft een gaatje) is more likely. The word ""beugel"" in Dutch means a small hole or opening, so it's likely that the boy has a small hole or gap in his tooth rather than his teeth straightening."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb gisteren in de sportschool getraind,"" option A is more likely. The premise suggests that the speaker has been exercising or engaging in physical activity, which can cause muscle soreness or fatigue. Option B does not provide any context related to exercise or physical activity, making it less likely as a possible consequence of getting trained at the sports school."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. Other students at the lunch table felt left out or excluded because of the whispering girls. This suggests that their behavior was disruptive or hurtful to others in some way, leading to a negative impact on the social dynamics of the group.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ze sprong weer in de lucht) is more likely. The child landing on the trampoline suggests that they have already fallen from a height, so it is unlikely that they would then decide to try and spin around. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the information provided.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A: The post has delivered the letter. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The post has delivered the letter.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij heeft al z‚Äôn geld ingezet) is more likely. The text suggests that the man has already placed his bets, implying a sense of confidence in his decision-making. This aligns with the idea that he is self-assured and unlikely to change his mind once he has committed to something.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the wind became stronger) is a more plausible explanation for why the fire spread quickly. The text does not provide any information to suggest that the perpetrators were caught or apprehended, so this option can be ruled out as a possible cause of the fire's rapid spread.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The fact that the child's mother has put a bandage on the wound suggests that she may have tried to treat the injury rather than sending him to his room. Therefore, Option B is the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (He has his testament signed) is more likely to be the correct answer. The fact that he survived a deadly disease suggests that he may have been in poor health for some time, making it less likely that he would have undergone an organ transplant without proper medical attention. Additionally, signing a will is often seen as a way of putting one's affairs in order before death, rather than after.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik nam een slok van de gloeiende koffie,"" it is more likely that option B, ""ik heb mijn tongue verbrand,"" will occur. This is because taking a sip of hot coffee can cause burns to one's tongue, leading to pain and discomfort. Option A, ""ik beet mijn tong,"" does not make sense in this context as it would not cause any physical harm or discomfort."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the writer missed a deadline) is more likely. The fact that the editor fired the writer suggests that there was a problem with their work, rather than simply avoiding prejudice. Additionally, missing a deadline could result in serious consequences for the writer's career, making it a more plausible explanation for the editor's actions.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik voelde me uitgeput,"" option A is more likely. This is because being exhausted can be caused by a variety of factors, including lack of sleep or excessive studying. Therefore, option A, ""Ik heb de hele dag geslapen,"" is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker feels out of breath than option B, ""Ik heb de hele dag gestudeerd."""
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ze identificeerde de symptomen van de pati√´nt) is more likely. The premise states that De arts ""stelde de diagnose,"" indicating that she identified the patient's symptoms rather than prescribing medication. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik krabde mijn huid,"" option A (het was zweterig) is a more likely cause than option B (het jeukt). This is because ""zwetterig"" means wet or damp in Dutch, while ""jeuk"" means itching. Therefore, if someone scratched their skin, it is more likely that they were experiencing discomfort due to wetness rather than an itchy sensation."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He lost his patience) is the more likely cause of the situation described. The premise states that the man underwent a sudden operation, which could be a stressful and unpredictable event that might lead to impatience or frustration. It's less likely that he would have a heart attack without any previous symptoms or warning signs, especially since the premise doesn't mention any such indications. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information given in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De arm spieren van de man uitgestoken,"" option A (Hij buigde zijn armen) is a more likely cause than option B (Hij wrijft zijn armen). This is because stretching or pulling one's arms can result in injury to the muscles or tendons, which may be painful and limit mobility. Writhing or rubbing one's arms, on the other hand, may provide some temporary relief from discomfort but is unlikely to cause significant damage to the muscles or tendons."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man stak zijn wenkbrauwen op,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""stak zijn wenkbrauwen op"" suggests that the man made a deliberate effort to raise his eyebrows, which implies he was not surprised or discouraged but rather taking an action to express something. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ik geloofde dat zijn bedoelingen goed waren) is more likely. The speaker seems to have given their colleague the benefit of the doubt and believed that they had good intentions. This suggests that the speaker may not have been as critical or skeptical of their colleague's actions as Option B implies.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij begon meer te bewegen) is more likely. The fact that he stopped smoking suggests that his body may have experienced changes as a result of quitting, such as increased energy levels or improved physical functioning, which could lead to him being more active overall.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (The woman struck her attacker in the nose) is more likely to result in the attacker's death or serious injury. The nose is a sensitive area that can cause significant bleeding if hit hard enough, leading to potentially life-threatening injuries. Therefore, it is more likely that the attacker would be seriously injured or killed as a result of being struck in the nose rather than simply beginning to bleed.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De pijl miste het oog van de stier,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""missed the eye of the stier"" implies that the arrow was aimed directly at the target but missed it by a small margin, suggesting that the man may have made a mistake in his shot rather than simply losing the game. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the man lost the game."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He discovered rats in his basement) is more likely. The mention of a ""huiseigenaar"" and a ""kamer"" suggests that the setting is a residential home, and the presence of rats in the basement is a common pest problem in homes. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person called an exterminator to deal with the rat infestation rather than keeping a colony of ants in their room."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (I was too tired to cook) is the correct cause for why the host did not prepare anything for their guest. The premise suggests that the host was too exhausted to do any cooking, which aligns with Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Ze begon het dagboek te verbergen) is the correct answer. The fact that she was caught reading her sister's diary suggests that she may feel embarrassed or ashamed about being found out, leading her to hide her own diary to avoid similar situations in the future.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has taken leave) is more likely. 
Explanation: The premise states that the woman did not have enough money for rent, indicating that she may have been out of work or taking a break from her job. Taking leave is a common reason why someone might not have enough money for their expenses, making it the more likely option among the two provided."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He raaged the hot kettle) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the child's hand returned quickly, indicating that it was not injured or damaged from hitting its head. On the other hand, option B (He knocked the puppy's head) does not align with the given information as there is no mention of a puppy in the premise. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the child's hand returned quickly.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (They have distributed an enquete to customers) is more likely to increase customer satisfaction. By gathering feedback from customers through a survey, the company can gain valuable insights into their needs and preferences, which can be used to improve products or services and enhance overall customer experience. Offering discounts to new customers (option A) may provide short-term incentives but does not directly address the root causes of dissatisfaction among existing customers.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the boy threw the pillows from the bench) is more likely. The premise mentions that the wooden floor was scratched, which suggests that something soft and lightweight was moved across it, such as pillows. Option B (the boy pulled a chair across the floor) would not have caused the same type of scratches on the floor. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I protected my face,"" option A is more likely. The speaker is trying to convey that they took steps to protect their face from harm, implying that they were in a situation where they needed to do so. Option B does not fit with this context as it implies physical violence, which would not be necessary if the speaker was simply trying to protect themselves from laughter or insults."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (het was getroffen door de bliksem) is more likely. The statement ""het beroemde standbeeld is afgebrand"" implies that the statue was struck by lightning, which can easily ignite flammable materials such as wood or fabric. While Option B (mensen kwamen om het te vereren) does not provide a clear explanation for why the statue caught fire."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that flies will swarm the fruit than for the fruit to produce seeds. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (She has her ankle twisted) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the ballerina has a torn ligament in her ankle, which suggests that she may have injured herself while performing a dance move or during practice. Twisting or rolling of the ankle can lead to a torn ligament, making option B a more plausible explanation than option A (She wedged with her toes).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He has learned how to bind them) is more likely. The sentence ""De schoenvaters van het kind waren los"" implies that the child's shoes were untied, which suggests that the person in question has learned how to tie shoes. Option B (""Hij rende rund op de speelplaats"") does not provide any information about tying shoes or binding anything else, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I was the time quits) is more likely. The speaker mentions that they were fascinated by the book but then lost track of time, indicating that they may have been too engrossed in reading it to return it on time.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zijn ouders hebben hem be√Ønvloed) is more likely. The passage states that the man shared the same convictions as his parents, indicating that he was influenced by them. This suggests that his beliefs were shaped by their opinions rather than being in opposition to them.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that option A (the benzine is out) caused the car to stop suddenly. The driver did not fall asleep, so option B is less likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man at het ijs in de zon,"" option A is more likely. The phrase suggests that the ice has lost its flavor or taste due to exposure to heat from the sun, rather than simply dripping off a cone. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Het tapijt zag er vies uit) is more likely as it suggests that the artwork looked dirty or unclean, which could be due to a lack of proper maintenance or care.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik ben vroeg weggegaan,"" option A (I had a headache) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De eigenaar schold de pup) is more likely. The premise states that the puppy made a mess on the carpet, implying that it was not well-behaved or obedient. Therefore, it is more likely that the owner will scold or punish the puppy rather than giving it a treat.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mijn vriend heeft me vergeven) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man stond op in de menigte,"" option A (Hij droeg een rugzak) is a more likely cause than option B (Hij droeg een neonvest). This is because the premise specifically mentions that the man was standing among a crowd of people, which suggests that he may have been carrying something with him to help him navigate through the dense group of people. A rugbag would be a practical item for this purpose, as it could hold essentials such as water, snacks, or other small items needed during a long day outdoors. In contrast, a neonvest is not typically associated with carrying everyday items, so it is less likely that the man would have been wearing one while standing in a crowd."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De getuige loog onder ede,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""loog onder ede"" implies that the witness lied under oath, which means they gave false testimony. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She wanted a new look) is more likely. The fact that she has dyed her hair suggests that she wants to change her appearance or try something different, rather than blend in with the crowd.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (They were deported) is more likely to occur. The premise states that the immigrants are caught for illegal residence in the country, indicating that they have been living there without proper documentation or authorization. As a result, it is likely that they will be deported back to their home country rather than finding work in the host country.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the audience laughed (option A).
"Response: 
Option B: The sun has baked my skin."
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""Ik verveelde me"", option A (ik snot) is a more likely response as it means ""I'm bored"" in Dutch."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the mes was dof) is more likely the cause of the difficulty in cutting the beef. The premise suggests that the blade of the knife may have been dull, making it harder to cut through the meat. This is a common issue with knives that are not properly maintained or used frequently enough. In contrast, option B (the beef was raw) does not provide any explanation for why the knife would have difficulty cutting through the meat.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has enormous debts built up) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (I decided to visit him) is more likely. This is because the fact that the light in his apartment was on suggests that he may be home or present in some way, leading you to decide to visit him rather than simply wondering where he might be.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb de bloem onder mijn neus gelegd,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something has happened to the flower, rather than the speaker experiencing a sensory impression of its scent."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrouw voelde herself nostalgic,"" option A is more likely. The woman ran into a childhood friend, which often triggers feelings of nostalgia. Option B, where she yelled at her children, does not align with the sentiment expressed in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He has the stuk unvolledig ingediend) is more likely. The fact that he has not received any feedback yet suggests that his submission may have been incomplete or lacking in some way, rather than having submitted it early.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mijn auto is kapot,"" option B (Ik heb een monteur gebeld) is more likely. This is because the phrase ""kapot"" implies that the car has broken down or stopped working, making it unlikely that the speaker would go to the mall ( Option A). Instead, they are more likely to call a mechanic to fix the problem."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the letter was anonymous) caused the letter to be lost or misplaced. The fact that the writer did not sign their name suggests that they intended for the letter to remain private and untraceable. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vogel klapte met zijn vleugels,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Het heeft eieren gelegd,"" is correct. The act of flapping wings suggests that the bird may be preparing to lay eggs, rather than flying upwards."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (the garage was open) caused the car to be parked on the driveway rather than option B (the garage was full). This is because if the garage were full, it would not have been possible for the car to be parked inside. Therefore, the fact that the garage was open suggests that there may have been space available inside for parking the car.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (The victim stuck his hands up) is more likely to occur because it suggests that the victim may have tried to defend himself or protect himself from the attacker's weapon. Option A (The criminal laid down the weapon) does not provide any information about how the situation unfolded and could be interpreted in various ways.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik keek uit naar het weekend"", option A is more likely. The speaker is looking forward to the weekend, indicating that they have plans or activities they want to do. Option B does not align with this sentiment as it implies attending a funeral or wedding, which are typically somber events. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik was de tijd kwijt,"" option A (I was daydreaming) is a more likely explanation for why the speaker lost track of time than option B (I was sick). Daydreaming can distract someone from their surroundings and make them lose touch with reality, while being sick typically causes discomfort or pain that would draw attention to itself rather than causing someone to forget about time."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (the printer had little ink) caused the document to be unreadable. The statement implies that there was not enough ink available for printing, rather than a problem with the paper. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the fans stroomden het veld op) is more likely. The fact that the fans are described as ""stroomden"" suggests a large number of people moving towards the field in unison, which is consistent with the idea of a crowd rushing to see something exciting or important happening at the stadium. Option A (""De fans keerden zich naar de vlag"") does not convey the same sense of movement or excitement."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De dip smook smaakt"", option A is more likely. The correct answer is (A) I have served it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the handdoek has absorbed the fluid) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She read the book again) is more likely. The woman's interruption while reading her book suggests that she may have forgotten where she left off or wants to refresh her memory, making it more likely that she will re-read the book rather than set a bookmark as an alternative.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the man looked out of the window) is more likely because it suggests that the man was paying attention to what was happening outside the plane rather than focusing on his own safety equipment.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Het meisje has him stoked) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They have her been amputated) is more likely. The premise states that doctors gave the patient a prosthetic leg, indicating that they had to remove one of her legs for medical reasons. This is a common procedure in cases where a patient has suffered significant damage or disease affecting their limbs. Option B (They are controlling her vital functions) does not align with this scenario as it implies direct control over internal bodily processes rather than removing an external body part.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De jongen knipte de elleboog van het meisje,"" option A is more likely because it aligns with the physical action described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ik waardeerde zijn mening) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De jongen stapte in de modder,"" option A is more likely. The mud was already at his shoes, so it's unlikely that it would have reached his face without him noticing."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mensen verstopten zich onder de grond) is more likely. The idea of people hiding underground suggests a level of panic or desperation that would be unlikely if schools were simply closed due to snowfall.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Hij dreigde met ontslag) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (De boom viel op het dak) is more likely as it provides a clear and specific detail about how the tree fell onto the roof. The other option does not provide any information that would suggest the tree caused damage to the house.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ik zwaaide met de bijl naar het hout) is more likely to be the cause of the wood splitting into two halves. The act of hitting the wood with a hammer can generate enough force to split it along its grain line. Option A (Ik heb het hout in de open haard gestapeld) does not provide sufficient explanation for the wood to split into two halves.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (het echtpaar kondigde aan dat ze wilden gaan scheiden) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (She found him cute) is more likely. The fact that she sent him a Valentine's Day card suggests that there may be some mutual interest or affection between them, but it does not necessarily imply that she kissed him without his consent.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Iknikte met mijn hoofd naar de verklaring van mijn vriend,"" option A (I was in the war) is a more likely explanation than option B (I was with him). This is because the phrase ""ik knikte"" suggests that the speaker was physically nodding their head, which would be difficult to do if they were in agreement with someone else. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker was lost in thought or confused by what their friend was saying rather than actively agreeing with them."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ze wilden een compromis vinden) is more likely. The friends wanted to find a solution that would work for everyone, rather than taking an arbitrary decision or relying solely on chance.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De timers in de keuken ging af,"" it is more likely that option A, ""De man gooide de boodschappen in de koelkast,"" occurred. This is because the phrase ""de timers in de keuken ging af"" suggests that something unexpected happened in the kitchen, such as a power outage or malfunctioning appliances, which could cause the man to put his groceries in the fridge instead of cooking them. Option B, ""De man nam de pizza uit de oven,"" does not fit with this scenario as it implies that the man was actively preparing food in the oven, which would be unlikely if there were no working timers in the kitchen."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She has worked hard) is more likely. The woman set herself an ambitious goal, indicating that she has put in effort to achieve it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zijn zoon erfde zijn fortuin) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrouw trapte op de vlammen,"" option A (De vlammen zijn uit) is the most likely outcome. The woman stepping on the flames would likely result in the extinguishing of the flames rather than an increase in smoke production."
Response:  Based on the given information, Option A (Haar rijbewijs is ingetrokken) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman's car was in the garage than Option B (Ze heeft een auto-ongeluk gehad). The fact that her driver's license has been revoked suggests that she may have had an accident or received a traffic violation, but it does not necessarily mean that she was involved in a serious crash. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb door mijn wekker geslapen,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Ik heb ontbijt gemist,"" is true. This is because waking up late implies that you missed breakfast."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the cameras flashed in his direction) is more likely to be the correct answer. The fact that the public figure stepped out of the limousine suggests that he is in a public setting where there are likely to be reporters and photographers present, and therefore it is more likely that their cameras would be flashing in his direction.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Het badwater became lukewarm) is more likely. The premise states that the woman remained in the bathtub, indicating that she did not leave or get out of the bathtub. Therefore, it is unlikely that the water would have been drained from the bathtub.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He went to a fraternity) is more likely. The premise mentions that the student wanted to meet other students on campus, which aligns with the purpose of many fraternities and sororities to provide social opportunities for their members. Joining a fraternity would give him access to a network of like-minded individuals who share similar interests and goals, making it easier to meet new people. In contrast, studying engineering may not necessarily lead to meeting new people, as it is a technical field that focuses on designing and developing systems, rather than socializing or networking. Therefore, option A is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ik zocht wat kleingeld) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""ik heb de kussens van de bank omhoog gehaald"" suggests that something has been moved or lifted from a surface, and the mention of ""kleingeld"" implies that the object being moved was small and valuable. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker was searching for money rather than renovating their living room."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De wesp vloog naar de jongen toe,"" it is more likely that Option A (the jongen is weggelopen) is correct. The wasp flying towards the boy suggests that the boy may have left or run away, rather than picking a flower."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (She was sentenced to death) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A is correct, as ""geroerd"" means to steep or infuse something, so the tea has been brewed with sugar already added. Therefore, the tea is not just sweetened but also flavored by the sugar during the brewing process."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De veteraan liep met een hink,"" option B is more likely. The fact that the veteran is walking with a limp suggests that he has been injured in some way, and given the context of war, it is more likely that he was wounded during combat rather than being called up for military service."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (The police are behind the criminal) is more likely. The fact that the criminal ""lied his way out of trouble"" suggests that they were able to evade the authorities, implying that the police were not successful in their pursuit."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De laptop ging niet aan,"" it is more likely that option A (I let it fall) caused the problem rather than option B (I charged it). Therefore, the answer is Option A."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She has an extensive wardrobe) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why she doesn't have any space left in her closet.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man was van slag,"" option A (Zijn vrouw heeft bevallen) is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Hij werden gekwalificeerd voor de baan die hij wilde) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: He spoke into the microphone.
Explanation: The premise states that the man's voice was clearly heard throughout the hall, indicating that he used a microphone to amplify his voice. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the munt zonk tot op de bodem) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the ball went into the hole) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik ademde het stof op zolder in,"" option A (Ik had een hik) is more likely. This is because the phrase ""ademde het stof"" suggests that something was inhaled, which could cause discomfort or irritation in the throat, leading to coughing."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the customer used false money) is more likely. The fact that the cashier called security suggests that there may have been an issue with a transaction or payment, which could potentially be due to the use of counterfeit money. It is less likely that the customer would simply leave their headlights on in the store without any other explanation.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (het vuilnis maakte de keuken stinken) is the correct answer. The premise mentions ""het vuilnis"" being taken out, which suggests that something was thrown away or disposed of. This is consistent with the idea that the speaker may have accidentally thrown their grocery list away while cleaning up after taking out the trash. Option B does not fit as well with the given information, as there is no mention of anything related to a grocery list in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the children bewondered the animals) is correct. The premise mentions that the family went to the zoo, which implies that they were there to observe and learn about the animals, rather than chasing them around.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De ademhaling van de man was luid,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the man's breathing was loud suggests that he may have had difficulty breathing or was experiencing respiratory distress, which could be caused by problems with his lungs such as pneumonia or asthma. This is more likely than the other option, which does not provide any context for why the man's breathing would be loud."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I asked my friend if he was interested in going) is more likely. The premise states that you had an extra ticket for the concert, implying that you already knew someone who might be interested in attending. Asking your friend directly if they are interested shows a proactive approach to finding a suitable companion for the event.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I have opened the windows) is more likely to be effective in cooling down the house than option A (I have taken blankets). This is because opening windows allows for a greater flow of outside air into the house, which can help to lower the temperature inside. Taking blankets, on the other hand, will not have any direct impact on the temperature of the house.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zijn rugzak was open) is more likely to be the cause of the boy's back pain. 
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (It was her birthday) is more likely the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (a bee has stung the gardener) is more likely. The reason for this is that bees are known to be aggressive when they feel threatened or provoked, and it's not uncommon for them to sting people if they are bothered or disturbed while collecting nectar from flowers. On the other hand, eekhoorns (or rabbits) do not typically dig up bulbs in a garden, as their burrowing behavior is usually focused on creating underground tunnels and dens rather than disturbing above-ground plant material.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I have defeated Lucifer,"" it is more likely that option A, ""The flame has gone out,"" is correct. The idea of defeating Lucifer implies a powerful opponent who could potentially extinguish a flame. Therefore, it makes sense that the flame would be extinguished after such an encounter. Option B, ""Lucifer produced a flame,"" does not align with the premise as it suggests Lucifer was responsible for creating the flame in the first place, rather than being its source of power or defeat."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (They wanted to avoid a court battle) is the most likely cause for why the parties reached an agreement. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (their parents are dead) is more likely to be the reason why the children were sent to an orphanage. This is because there is no indication in the premise that their parents have neglected or abused them, leading to their removal from the home. Therefore, it is more plausible that their parents have passed away, leaving the children without any other family members to care for them.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Er was een tsunami) is more likely. The landing of a meteorite in the ocean would likely cause a tsunami due to the displacement of water upon impact. Hailing is less likely as it requires specific weather conditions that are not typically associated with a meteorite impact.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Raakte in paniek) is more likely. The premise mentions that the walker came across a poisonous snake, which could cause panic or fear. Option A (Uitgedroogd) does not necessarily convey this emotion.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De oven werd heet,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that someone turned on the oven, making it hot. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the citron has become moldy) than option B (the citron has been sprayed). The word ""geperst"" in Dutch means to press or squeeze something, but it does not have any direct connection with spraying. Therefore, option A seems a better fit for the given context."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the country colonized new lands) is more likely. The premise states that ""het land ontdekte nieuwe landen,"" indicating that the country discovered new territories, suggesting a process of colonization rather than leaving the country altogether. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Het is over de hele vloergebroken) is more likely. The phrase ""het glass viel van de tafel"" implies that the glass broke into pieces after falling from the table, so it is unlikely that it would have landed in a pile of was. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De tafel schudde,"" option A (the floor was not level) is a more likely cause for why the table was shaking than option B (the floor was smooth)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zijn zoon heeft de waarheid bekend) is more likely. The son has discovered his father's lies, indicating that he already had a suspicion about his father's behavior beforehand. This suggests that the son may have been keeping an eye on his father for some time, perhaps even trying to gather evidence of his dishonesty. As such, it is more likely that the son has known about his father's lies all along than that the father trusted him with the truth.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het hoofd van de man bonkte van pijn,"" option A (Hij nam hoestsiroop) is the more likely answer because hoestsiroop is a common remedy for headaches. Aspirine, on the other hand, is not typically used to treat headaches."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De trein vertraagde,"" option A is more likely. The train delayed means it did not arrive at the station as expected or scheduled, so it is more likely that it was behind schedule rather than having walked away from the track."
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (Geestelijkeziekte liep in zijn familie) is more likely to be the cause of the man's mental health issues. The fact that he has had therapy suggests that he has been experiencing symptoms for a while, and the mention of his family history of mental illness further supports this conclusion. Option B (Hij was gediagnosticeerd met depressie) does not provide as much context or evidence to support this conclusion.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De vrouw greep haar keel vast,"" option B is the most likely cause: She stikked in her eat."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Haar stem klonk ruw) is correct. The premise mentions that the woman had a rough voice, which suggests that her speech was harsh or coarse, rather than being influenced by an accent. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the dog looked at the juicy beef stew on the table and Option A (It dried) is the correct answer. The word ""droog"" in Dutch means dry, so it is a plausible outcome for what happened to the beef stew if a dog were to look at it."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (She onslaught her workers) occurred. The premise states that she became successful, but does not mention anything about becoming rich. It is possible that she may have taken advantage of her employees or laid them off in order to achieve success, which aligns with Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the bell went) is more likely to be the cause of the students leaving class. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Haar kennissen waren sceptisch) is more likely. The woman's claim that she saw a ghost may have been met with skepticism by her friends, who may not have believed her or taken her seriously. This is more plausible than Option B (Haar kennissen waren verwant aan haar), as it is less common for someone to be related to their own ghost.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he Verdronk bijna in de oceaan) is more likely as it provides a specific and plausible reason for the person losing their hearing. The other option (he was bijna gedood in an explosion) does not provide such a clear explanation and may be less likely to occur.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Het kind liet de balloonstring los,"" it is more likely that option A, ""De ballon is leeggelopen"" (The balloon has deflated) will occur. This is because when a child lets go of a string with a balloon attached to it, the balloon will most likely deflate due to the lack of air pressure."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had a stroke) is the correct answer. The phrase ""lost his speech"" suggests that the person experienced some kind of brain damage or disruption to their nervous system, which could be caused by a stroke. Option B (""he took a deep breath"") does not provide any explanation for why the person lost their speech."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (a tear in the concrete) is more likely to be the reason for the woman's fall. The mention of her name being called suggests that someone may have been calling out to her, but it does not provide any information about a possible cause of her falling.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the man has thrown a cannonball into the swimming pool) is more likely. The use of the word ""cannonball"" implies that the object thrown was large and heavy, making it unlikely for the badminton coach to catch or dodge it. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the information provided."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I took antibiotics,"" it is more likely that option A, ""My infection is cured"" will occur. The use of antibiotics can effectively treat bacterial infections by killing or inhibiting the growth of the pathogenic microorganisms causing the infection. Therefore, it is more likely that taking antibiotics will result in the infection being cured rather than the infection spreading."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the driver presses the brakes) is more likely. The yellow traffic light indicates that it's time for the driver to slow down or stop, so they will probably press the brakes to do so.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (I have put the container in warm water) is a more likely cause than option B (I have set the container on the hot stove). This is because putting something in warm water can help to soften or melt it, whereas placing it directly on a hot surface like a stove can cause it to burn or become damaged. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the plastic container might be melting.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De auto is in de benen getrapt,"" it is more likely that option A (the chauffeur raaged a telephone pole) occurred. This is because the phrase ""in de benen getrapt"" implies that the car was driven into something solid, such as a telephone pole or wall, rather than simply running over a red light."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De jongen studeerde de hele nacht,"" it is more likely that Option A (Hij heeft het examen overgeslagen) is true. This is because studying all night suggests that the boy may not have prepared well for the exam or may be feeling anxious about it, leading him to perform poorly."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The boy's fear of learning to swim is a common phobia among children, making it the most plausible explanation for why he would cling to the side of the pool.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik legde mijn hand op mijn borst,"" option A is more likely. When you place your hand on your chest, it can cause a physical sensation that may be felt as a heartbeat or increased heart rate. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Mijn kantoor was luidruchtig) is more likely. The fact that the building next to my office was in construction suggests that there may have been noise from the construction site, which could have made it difficult for me to focus at work.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Het gezin zwaaide vanuit hun tuin naar de buren) is more likely. The family is more likely to initiate contact with their neighbors by waving from their garden than inviting them over for dinner.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Er kwam water uit het zwembad,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""kam water"" suggests that something entered the swimming pool from outside, rather than the swimmer themselves ( Option B). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ik heb per ongeluk een zaadje ingeslikt) is more likely to occur than option B (Ik heb per ongeluk mijn tandgebroken). This is because swallowing a seed accidentally is a common occurrence that can happen to anyone, while breaking one's tooth is less likely to happen without any external force or trauma. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De jongenstruikelde,"" it is more likely that his jacket was loose (option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ze was afgeleid door lawaai) is the more likely cause for why a woman has earplugs in her ears. This is because the premise does not provide any indication that the woman's ears were pierced or damaged in any way, which would suggest Option B (Ze had haar oren doorboord). Therefore, it is more likely that the woman was simply distracted by loud noises and inserted the earplugs to block them out, rather than having her ears intentionally pierced or damaged.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb mijn waterfles weer gefilld,"" it is more likely that Option A (the speaker has already drunk all the water) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (het bevatte vulgaire taal) is the correct answer. The show was censored, indicating that there were explicit or offensive elements present in the content that needed to be removed for broadcast. This suggests that the language used in the show may have been considered vulgar or offensive by the network's standards.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""het schip is verongelukht"", option A (de bemanning verdronk) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Het kind vroeg om een hint) is more likely. The boy was confused by the riddle and asked for a hint, indicating that he had not yet solved it.
"Response:  Based on the given premise ""De telefoon ging"", option A is more likely. The correct answer is: De man hing op."
"Response: 
Option B: Ik voelde me niet op mijn gemak."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They took photos of the exhibitions) is more likely. The premise mentions that they left the museum, implying that they were not able to see all of the exhibitions before leaving. Taking photos would be a way for them to document what they saw without having to spend additional time in the museum.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mijn vriend stelde me voor aan de man) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De band van mijn fiets was plat,"" option A is more likely. The premise suggests that something happened to the tire of the bike, which would cause it to go flat, rather than changing the gears of the motor."
"Response: 
Option B: Haar vader voelde haar voorhoofd.
Explanation: The premise states that het meisje (the girl) looked pale, indicating that she may be feeling unwell or sickly. Option B suggests that her father felt her forehead, which could be a way to check if she has a fever or other symptoms of illness. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A, as it better fits with the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De pen raakte zonder inkt,"" it is more likely that option A (Ik heb een potlood gebruikt) is correct. The use of a pencil would not produce any ink, hence the pen ran out without any ink being produced."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij was in de schulden) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why the man did not receive any loans. Being in debt can make it difficult to obtain new credit, especially if the individual has a poor credit history or cannot provide collateral for the loan.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ze had waterpokken) is more likely. The premise states that the girl stayed home from school, implying that she was not feeling well or did not want to go to school for some other reason. Waterpokken (diarrhea) is a common illness that could prevent someone from going to school. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ik heb het in de vuilnis zak gezet) is correct. The phrase ""in de vuilnis zak"" suggests that the speaker disposed of the object in a trash bag or can, rather than throwing it down the drain. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ik heb het tapijt gefacu√ºmt,"" it is more likely that option A (Mijn kamergenoot heeft punch gemorst) is the correct answer. This is because the act of vacuuming a floor or carpet typically involves using a device to remove dirt and debris from the surface, rather than creating a messy substance like punch. Therefore, it is unlikely that the speaker's kamergenoot would have created a mess with punch while in their room."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man verloor zijn patience,"" option A (Hij has turned off his computer) is a more likely explanation for why he lost his patience than option B (He threw a chair across the room). This is because turning off one's computer can be a frustrating experience due to various reasons such as slow performance or technical issues, leading to feelings of annoyance or irritation. Throwing a chair across the room, on the other hand, is generally not an action taken in response to minor inconveniences but rather as a result of extreme anger or frustration. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man lost his patience based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: De tak is verbrand. The premise states that the girl threw a twig into the campfire, which implies that there was already a fire burning before she added the twig. As such, it is unlikely that the fire would have gone out as a result of her action. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man came out of the shower,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the warm water was gone suggests that the man had been in the shower and then got out, rather than not being able to find a towel after getting out of the shower."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (They encouraged their children to play outside) is more likely. The parents want their children to go to university because they believe it will provide them with better opportunities in life, but they also encourage their children to spend time outdoors playing and exploring as a way of developing their creativity and independence.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man loste zijn veters,"" option B is more likely. The word ""versleten"" means to wear out or damage something through use, which fits with the idea of a man losing his shoes due to heavy use. Option A does not fit as well, as ""losse"" means lost in Dutch, and does not convey the sense of gradual wear and tear that would lead to a shoe falling off."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij koelde de restjes in) is more likely. The sentence ""De man at de helft van het voorgerecht op"" implies that there was already food prepared beforehand, and therefore it makes sense that he would want to cool down the remaining portion rather than saving the recipe."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mijn enkel was gezwollen,"" option A is more likely. This is because ice (ijs) is often used to treat swelling or inflammation, so it's a common remedy for a swollen ankle. Option B, lotion, may provide temporary relief from itching or discomfort but is less likely to address the underlying cause of the swelling."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mijn deur stond open,"" it is more likely that Option A (Ik heb met mijn collega aan mijn bureau gesproken) is correct. This is because if your door was open, you would be more likely to have spoken with someone inside your office rather than hearing a conversation in the hall."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Iknam plaats) is more likely to be the correct response because it matches the context of waiting in line.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De man sloeg de vlieg,"" it is more likely that the fly will go away (Option A). When a person swats at a fly, it typically flies away in response to the threat or disturbance caused by the movement of their hand. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Hij was stervende) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he increased his speed (option B). The phrase ""inhaled"" suggests that the opponent was gaining ground quickly, indicating that the speaker needs to accelerate their pace to maintain their lead."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Ik heb een oplossing bedacht) is more likely. The speaker has already come up with a solution to the problem, indicating that they have taken action towards finding a resolution. Option A (Ik vroeg om advies) suggests that the speaker is still seeking advice or input from others before taking any further action.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""De reiziger liep over de wankelende hangbrug,"" option B is more likely. The word ""extase"" suggests a feeling of euphoria or rapture, which aligns with the idea of walking on a swinging bridge that sways gently in the air. Option A, ""voelde hij zich doodsbang,"" implies a sense of fear or terror, which does not fit as well with the image of walking on a swinging bridge."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He has a bet with his friends) is more likely. The man's excitement and anticipation suggest that he has placed a wager with his friends, which would make him more invested in the outcome of the game. Option A (He came with his friends to watch the game) does not necessarily imply a financial stake in the outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he counted sheep) is more likely because it is a common activity that people use to help them fall asleep.
