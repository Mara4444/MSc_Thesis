"Response:  Option B: 난방기가 고장 났어요 (The heater broke down)
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the heater broke down rather than the toilet being submerged in water.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""강아지는 주인의 곁에 머물렀다,"" option B is more likely. The phrase ""주인의 곁에"" implies that the dog was near or next to its owner, rather than on top of them. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for how the dog ended up in this situation."

Explanation: The premise states that he caught his reflection, indicating that he was in front of a reflective surface. Since lakes are typically quieter than forests, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: 저녁에 만났어요 (He met her in the evening)

Explanation: The premise ""숨을 내쉬는 걸 봤어요"" suggests that something is causing discomfort or pain in the speaker's chest. Option B better fits this description as it implies a tightening or constriction of the speaker's chest muscles, which could be caused by various factors such as stress, anxiety, or physical exertion. In contrast, option A does not provide any specific reason for why the weather might have been hot, and therefore seems less relevant to the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Their employer raised their wages.

Taking off one's shoes would not be a significant obstacle in this context, but it could be seen as a small sacrifice or effort made towards achieving one's goal. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: 난 을 덮었어.  
Explanation: The correct answer is option B because it better fits the context of the premise. In this scenario, there are two possible causes for the steam to rise from the water pot: either the water inside the pot is boiling or someone has covered the pot with a lid. Since the word ""난"" (nal) in Korean means ""lid,"" option B is the more likely cause for the steam to rise. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 난 을 덮었어."
"Response:  Option A (샌달을 입고 있었어요) is more likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise. The phrase ""내 양말은 모두 세탁실에 있었어"" means ""All of my clothes are in the laundry room,"" so it's unlikely that she would have been wearing a bra at home. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: He was indicted for corruption charges.
Explanation: According to the premise, the politician's statements were seen as nonsensical, indicating that he had lost credibility among voters. This could have led to him facing legal consequences, such as an indictment for corruption charges. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."

"Response:  Option B: 판매원 동료는 소녀가 좋아하는 지갑을 찾도록 도왔다.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the salesperson's colleague accused them of stealing a girl's purse. This implies that the colleague believed the salesperson had taken something valuable from the girl without her permission. Given this context, it is more likely that the colleague was looking for the girl's favorite purse rather than simply watching her put items in her own bag."
"Response:  Option B: 군인들은 가족들과 다시 만나게 되야.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the soldiers were reunited with their families rather than being deployed to fight in a war. The phrase ""전쟁을 선포했다"" (declared war) suggests that there was already an ongoing conflict between two countries, but the focus of the sentence is on the soldiers' reunion with their families, indicating that this event occurred after the start of the war."
"Response:  Option B: 한 부부가 법원 앞에서 서약을 했습니다. (One couple made a pledge at the court.)
Explanation: The premise states that there are controversial judgments, indicating that there may be disagreement or protests related to the verdict.

"Response:  Option B: 화재 경보가 울려 (The fire alarm went off).
Explanation: The premise states that ""the building has evacuated,"" indicating that there was a sudden emergency situation that required everyone to leave immediately. Given this context, it is more likely that the fire alarm went off than the elevator stopped working."
"Response:  Option B: 아버지는 아들을 집 밖으로 내쫒았다.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the father was unhappy about his son's alcohol addiction. Therefore, it is more likely that he would kick him out of the house rather than giving him beer."
"Response:  Option B: The elevator was broken.
Explanation: According to the premise, the lawyer had to take the stairs to get to his office. This implies that there was an issue with the elevator, making option B the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: He asked his friend to eat with him.
Explanation: According to the premise, the man's friend did something that annoyed him (짜증이 났어요), which suggests that there was a conflict or issue between them. The option that best fits this context is Option B, as it implies that the man asked his friend to eat with him in an attempt to resolve their differences.

"Response:  Option B: 现金管理员은 女子에게 证书를 忘了。 (The money manager forgot to give the woman a certificate.)
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl gave the money to the money manager, but there is no mention of the money manager giving anything in return. Therefore, it is more likely that the money manager simply forgot to give the woman a certificate as promised."
"Response:  Option B: She went to the hospital from her bed.
Explanation: The premise states that she was in a wheelchair, indicating that she had difficulty walking or standing. Therefore, it is more likely that she was transported to the hospital from her bed rather than having been in a car accident."

Response:  Option B: They inspired their fans.
"Response:  Option B: 저는 자랑스러워햐습니다. (I am proud of it.)

"Response:  Option A: 쓰레기통에는 카르본이 있었어요 (There was a carbuncle in the trash can)
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that there was a carbuncle in the trash can than for the rubber to have fallen out of the trash can. Carbuncles are small, hard lumps that form under the skin, often as a result of an infection. They are not typically associated with trash cans or rubber objects. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation based on the given information."

Explanation: The premise states that the boy found it difficult to write with a pencil, implying that he lacked interest or motivation in doing so. Therefore, option B, ""It was a boring task,"" is the more likely cause for his difficulty in writing with a pencil."

Explanation: The phrase ""드레스의 환불"" in the premise suggests that the woman was not satisfied with her dress fitting, which implies that she tried it on but it did not fit well. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for why the woman refused to give the money for the dress."
"Response:  Option B: 상처가 남았어 (The scar remained)
Explanation: According to the premise, the area of skin where the hair follicle was removed has become deep. This suggests that there may be some residual damage or scarring after the procedure, which is consistent with option B. Option A implies a complete healing without any remaining effects, which is unlikely given the premise."
"Response:  Option B: He was talking to himself.
Explanation: The passage states that the man received strange looks from other passengers on the train, indicating that he was behaving strangely. It does not provide any evidence that he was looking at the floor. Therefore, option B is more likely."

"Response:  Option B: They received information about the play from the theater staff.
Explanation: The passage states that ""They had expected to arrive early enough to secure good seats,"" indicating that they made an effort to get there ahead of time. This suggests that they may have received information about the play from the theater staff or signs outside the theater, rather than simply relying on their own predictions about traffic. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why they arrived early."
"Response:  Option B: 동료가 그녀를 덮어줬어요 (Her colleagues praised her)
Explanation: The premise states that she did not go home, indicating that she spent the day at work. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that her colleagues praised her for a job well done during the day."

"Response:  Option B: 집에 차가웠어요 (The fire was caused by a spark from the stove in the house.)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the fire was caused by a spark from the stove in the house rather than the absence of trees nearby. The phrase ""집에 차가웠어요"" suggests that the fire started inside the house, implying that there were flammable materials present such as cooking oil or gas that could have ignited easily. In contrast, the absence of trees nearby would not provide enough fuel to sustain a large fire. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for the cause of the fire based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: 그녀는 새로운 바람을 어요. (She has a new wind.)
Explanation: The premise ""그 여자는 조깅을 그만뒔어요"" implies that something unexpected or surprising happened to her.

"Response:  Option B: 슈퍼마켓에 갔어요 (Went to the supermarket)
Explanation: The premise ""그 여인은 계란이 다 떨어졌어요"" implies that something unexpected happened to her eggs, making it unlikely for her to go to a farm or a ranch. Supermarkets are more likely places where people buy groceries, including eggs, so option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: 저는 그를 포옹했습니다. (I hugged him.)

Explanation: According to the premise, ""She was driving on a main road when an accident occurred,"" suggesting that she was driving in a straight line on a major road. The option B choice, ""She followed the truck,"" aligns better with this scenario as it implies that she was following another vehicle, rather than experiencing an accident on the main road. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the given information."
"Response:  Option B: 옷이 얼룩졈어.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker has tied a rope around their waist and dipped it in water. This means that the rope will be wet, not the clothes. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

"Response:  Option A (쿠키를 먹고 있었어요)
Explanation: The sentence ""우유 한 잔을 먹고 싶었어요"" implies that the speaker wants to drink a cup of yogurt. However, the phrase ""쿠키를 먹고 있었어요"" suggests that the speaker was eating cookies instead of drinking yogurt, making option A the more likely answer."

Explanation: The premise states that ""우리 집의 전기가 꺼졌어요"" which means ""Our house's electricity went out."" This implies that there is an issue with the power supply to the household, rather than a problem with the electrical system within the home. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option B: He became confused.
Explanation: According to the premise, the student tried to calculate in his head but failed, indicating that he became confused. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: 아버지는 부ds러게 아기를 흔들었다.  
Explanation: The correct answer is option B because it better fits the context of the premise. The phrase ""아기가 잠들었어"" implies that the baby was sleeping, so the father's action of gently rocking the baby would be a more appropriate response to help the baby fall asleep rather than pulling its ears."
"Response:  Option B: 그 아이는 젖어 버렸어. (The boy was covered in milk.)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""소녀는 소년에게 물 풍선을 던졌다"" (A girl threw a water balloon at a boy), it is more likely that the boy would be covered in milk rather than having brain damage. The term ""뇌진탕"" (brain damage) implies a serious injury, while ""젖어 버렸어"" (covered in milk) is a more lighthearted and humorous consequence of being hit with a water balloon. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."

The speaker mentions that they have been exercising regularly, which suggests that they are in good physical shape and do not feel tired easily. This contradicts option B (난 겁에 질렸어), which implies that the speaker feels weak or exhausted. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker does not feel tired even after working all day.
"Response:  Option B: 물이 흘러나쳤어요 (Water flowed out)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""난 습한 스폰지를 눌렀어,"" it is more likely that water will flow out of the sponge rather than be absorbed by it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: 리조트는 섬에 있었다 (The resort was on an island).
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the resort was located on an island rather than having been booked.

Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the volcano erupted) is more likely. The sentence ""화산에서 용암이 흘러나왔다"" implies that molten lava flowed out of the volcano, indicating an eruption.

"Response:  Option A (He sold the company's stock)
Explanation: According to the premise, the CEO has gone bankrupt. This means that he has failed to meet his financial obligations, including paying off debts. Selling the company's stock would be one way for him to raise cash quickly, as it would provide a lump sum of money. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option B: They manipulated the contest to their advantage.
Explanation: Based on the premise, it seems that the team deliberately manipulated the contest in order to gain an unfair advantage. This suggests that they did not actually win the competition fairly but rather cheated to get ahead. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A (병을 뒤집어놔요) is the correct answer because it better fits the rhyme scheme of the poem. The word ""병"" (bang) in Korean means ""sickness,"" so the line ""병을 뒤집어놔요"" can be translated to ""I turned sickness upside down."" This makes sense in the context of the poem as a way to deal with stress or anxiety caused by work-related issues."
"Response:  Option B: He climbed onto the roof.
Explanation: The premise states that the boy was sleeping outside, implying that he was lying on the ground or a surface below the house.

"Response:  Option B: His teeth were growing long and sharp.
Explanation: The premise states that the boy was ""writing"" with a brush, implying that he was using his teeth to create something. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer as it suggests that the boy's teeth are growing long and sharp, allowing him to use them as a makeshift pen or brush."
"Response:  Option B: 오늘 목이 아파서 깨어났어요 (Today I woke up with a headache)
Explanation: The phrase ""오늘 목이 아파서"" (Today I woke up with a headache) suggests that the speaker may have had a poor night's sleep or experienced some discomfort during the night, leading to a headache in the morning. This is a more plausible explanation than option A, as it is common for people to experience muscle soreness after engaging in physical activity, especially if they are not used to exercising regularly."
"Response:  Option B: 점심 식탁에 앉아 있던 다른 학생들은 외면당했다고 느꼈습니다.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl was sitting at a table with other students who were facing her. Therefore, it is more likely that they would have noticed her reaction and felt embarrassed themselves."
"Response:  Option B: She decided to try again.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the girl was thrown into the air again after she landed on the tram pole. This implies that she tried to jump again, which is consistent with option B. Option A suggests that she flew back into the air without any effort, which doesn't make sense in this context."
"Response:  Option B: 우체국은 편지를 가속화 시켰습니다. (The post office accelerated the delivery of the letter.)
Explanation: The premise states that ""나는 편지 상자에 편지를 보관했다"" (I stored a letter in an envelope), indicating that there was already a letter inside the envelope before it reached the post office. Therefore, it is less likely that the post office would have delivered the letter faster than usual, as there was already something inside the envelope that needed to be delivered. Instead, it is more likely that the post office simply processed and sorted the letter according to its normal procedures."
"Response:  Option B: He returned home with empty pockets.
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker had gambled away all of their money, indicating that they had lost a significant amount of money gambling. This suggests that option B, ""He returned home with empty pockets,"" is more likely to be true."
"Response:  Option B: 방화범들은 체포됐습니다. (The arsonists were caught.)
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the arsonists were caught rather than the wind becoming stronger.

Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the given information."
"Response:  Option B: 그의 어머니는 그 상처를 붕대로 묶어놨어요.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""그 아이는 무릎을 찢어 버렸다,"" it is more likely that the mother would bandage the child's injured leg rather than sending him to his room. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: He received a life-saving organ transplant.
Explanation: The premise states that he survived a fatal disease, which suggests that his condition was critical enough to require immediate medical attention. Organ transplantation is often the only option for patients with end-stage organ failure caused by diseases such as cancer or cirrhosis. Therefore, it is more likely that he received an organ transplant rather than simply signing a will."
"Response:  Option B: 혀를 태웠어요 (I drank the coffee)
Explanation: The premise ""나는 끓는 커피를 한 잔 마셨다"" means ""I drank a cup of hot coffee"". Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it implies that the speaker drank the coffee."
"Response:  Option A: 작가님은 편견을 피했습니다. (The author avoided criticism)
Explanation: According to the premise, the editor fired the writer because of their poor performance. However, option A suggests that the writer avoided criticism rather than having a critical attitude towards the work. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: 하루 종일 공부했어요 (I studied all day yesterday)
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker has been feeling tired for a long time, implying that they have not been getting enough rest or sleep. Given this context, it is more likely that option B, ""I studied all day yesterday,"" is the correct answer because studying can be mentally exhausting and may contribute to feelings of fatigue."
"Response:  Option A (She diagnosed the patient's symptoms.) 
Explanation: According to the premise, the doctor diagnosed the patient's symptoms, indicating that she was able to identify the underlying condition or illness causing the patient's discomfort.

"Response:  Option B: 가려움증이 느껴졌어요.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the patient has a rash on their skin, which suggests that they may have an allergic reaction or contact dermatitis.

Explanation: The premise states that he received an emergency surgery, which suggests that his condition was severe enough to require immediate medical attention. Heart attack is a common cause of sudden illness that can lead to cardiac arrest and requires urgent medical intervention. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A (He stretched his arm.)
Explanation: The sentence ""팔 근육이 팽창했어요"" implies that something has expanded or grown, which is not a characteristic of an arm. Therefore, option A is the correct answer as it suggests that the person stretched their arm, which can be done to lengthen or expand it."

Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome based on the given information."
"Response:  Option B: 공격자는 피를 흘리기 시작했어요 (The attacker started bleeding)
Explanation: The premise states that the woman attacked the man with a fist, indicating that there was physical contact between them. As a result, it is more likely that the attacker would be injured and start bleeding rather than transforming into an inanimate object."
"Response:  Option B: 그 남자는 게임을 잃어가고 있었다. (He was losing the game.)
Explanation: The premise states that ""화살이 쏘는 건"" (a bullet) hit him, indicating that he was in a dangerous situation. Option B better fits this context as it implies that he was not just losing the game but was also in danger of being injured or killed by the bullet. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: He found a cockroach farm in his bedroom.
Explanation: The premise states that the homeowner requested someone to get rid of the pest problem in their house.

"Response:  Option B: 내 손님이 너무 오래 머물렀어 (My guest has stayed too long)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the speaker's guest has stayed too long than the speaker being too tired to prepare food. The speaker mentions that they have not prepared anything for their guest, suggesting that they did not expect them to stay for so long. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for why there is no food available."
"Response:  Option B: She has a new diary.
Explanation: The premise states that the girl discovered her brother was reading her journal, implying that she had been writing in it regularly. If she were to start using a new diary, it would be reasonable for her to keep her old one hidden from her brother, rather than simply stopping to write in it altogether. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Option B: She quit her job.
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman did not have enough money for rent, indicating that she may have had financial difficulties or struggled to make ends meet. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it suggests that she quit her job due to these challenges rather than being fired."
"Response:  Option A (He made a hot oven)
Explanation: The premise states that the child's hand went back quickly, indicating that they were able to move their hand in a short amount of time. This is unlikely if they had to hold onto something heavy like an animal's head. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B (They distributed surveys to their customers)
Explanation: According to the premise, the company wanted to measure customer satisfaction. Distributing surveys to customers is a common method used to gather feedback from them, making option B more likely than option A."
"Response:  Option B: 소년은 바닥을 가로질러 의자를 끌었다.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""나무 바닥이 긁혀진 곳"" suggests that there are trees growing out of the ground, making it unlikely for a boy to pull an chair from underneath the floor using rope. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: 적이 주먹을 뻗어 (The monster bit its cheek)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the monster bit the protagonist's cheek rather than the protagonist protecting his face from them. The phrase ""적들이 날 놀렬어"" (They bit my cheek) suggests that the monster was responsible for causing injury to the protagonist's cheek, rather than the protagonist defending himself against them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: 사람들은 그것을 숭배하러 왔어요. (People came to worship it.)
Explanation: The premise states that a famous statue has burned down, suggesting that it was a significant cultural or historical landmark.

"Response:  Option B: 파리들이 과일을 다.  
Explanation: According to the premise, there are flies on the table. Flies lay eggs in rotting fruit, so it is more likely that they will eat the fruit than plant seeds in it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: 발목이 굽어졌어요 (Her ankle was twisted)
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that her ankle was twisted than that she got a sprain in her calf muscle. The word ""발목"" (bam-gok) specifically refers to the ankle joint, indicating that the injury occurred there rather than further up the leg."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He was playing in the park) is more likely. The fact that the child's shoelaces were untied suggests that they were running around or playing actively, which is consistent with being in a park. Option A (He learned how to tie his shoes) does not fit well with the context of the premise as it implies that the child had already mastered tying their shoes, which may not be the case if they are still young.
"Response:  Option B: 시간이 흐르면서 (As time passed)
Explanation: The phrase ""시간이 흐르면서"" suggests that the speaker's interest in the book grew over time, rather than immediately after reading it. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: His parents disowned him.
Explanation: The premise states that the man had a belief similar to his parents', indicating that he was raised in a religious household. However, the punchline reveals that his parents disowned him, suggesting that they rejected him due to his beliefs or lifestyle choices. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: 운전자가 잠들었어 (The driver fell asleep).  
Explanation: The premise states that the car slowed down and eventually stopped, indicating that the driver was not paying attention or was unable to operate the vehicle due to fatigue or other factors.

"Response:  Option B: 아이스크림이 콩에서 떨어졌어요.

"Response:  Option A: 카펫이 더러워 보이네요.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the artist hung artwork on the wall, but the canvas looked worse afterward.

Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."

"Response:  Option B: 내 친구는 화를 내었다. (My friend got angry.)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""친구한테 사과했어요,"" it is more likely that the friend got angry than forgave me. The word ""화"" in Korean means anger or annoyance, so option B is a better fit for the given context."

Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Option B: They were deported.
Explanation: According to the premise, the undocumented immigrants were caught living in the country illegally. Therefore, it is more likely that they were deported rather than finding jobs."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the audience stood up) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: 태양이 내 피부를 연다.  
Explanation: The phrase ""태양이 내 피부를 연다"" means that the sun's rays are causing the speaker's skin to burn or become reddened. This is a common effect of exposure to direct sunlight, especially during peak hours when the sun's rays are strongest. Therefore, option B is the more likely choice based on the premise provided in the question."

Explanation: According to the premise, ""she declared bankruptcy,"" indicating that she had accumulated a significant amount of debt that she was unable to pay off. This is more likely than option A, which suggests that she received child support, as bankruptcy is typically associated with financial difficulties rather than receiving financial assistance."

Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the speaker will decide to visit their friend's apartment because they are curious about why the light in his apartment is on. This option suggests that the speaker has made up their mind to go see their friend and find out what's going on."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (꽃잎이 꽃에서 떨어져 왔어요) is more likely. The phrase ""코 밑에"" means ""underneath,"" so it's unlikely that the scent of a flower would be above the petals. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option A (She was teased by her young friends).
Explanation: The premise states that the woman had a strong sense of smell, indicating that she may have been sensitive to certain odors or scents. This could be interpreted as meaning that she was teased by her young friends for being particularly attuned to these sensory details. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option B: 피해자가 손을 들어줬어요
Explanation: According to the premise, the criminal sacrificed their gun for the victim. This means that the victim was able to grab the gun and use it against the criminal, making option B the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option A (저는 삼촌의 장례식에 참석할 계획이엇습니다.) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the conversation. The speaker mentions that they were looking forward to the weekend, implying that they had plans or activities scheduled for that time. Given the mention of a funeral service for an uncle, it is more likely that the speaker was planning to attend their uncle's funeral rather than a friend's wedding.
"Response:  Option B: 메스꺼웠어요 (I was sleeping)
Explanation: The lyrics suggest that the speaker was asleep during the time period in question, which aligns with option B. The line ""난 꿈만 꾸고 있었어"" (I was just dreaming) further supports this interpretation. Therefore, the most likely cause for the speaker's absence from work is that they were sleeping."

"Response:  Option B: The fluid that leaked from the pipe has left behind a sticky residue.
Explanation: According to the premise, there was a leak in the pipe, and as a result, some fluid escaped. Since the fluid is described as ""sticky,"" it's more likely that it left behind a residue rather than being absorbed by the paper towel. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: She read the book again.
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman was interrupted while reading a book. Therefore, it is more likely that she had to start over from the beginning rather than marking her page with a bookmark."
"Response:  Option B: He looked out of the window.
Explanation: The premise states that there was a slight change in altitude, indicating that they were flying at a higher altitude than before. Looking out of the window would be the most logical thing to do in this situation, as he would want to check if everything is normal outside.

"Response:  Option B: 소녀가 그를 찌르더군요.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""소년은 떨엇다"" (the boy was crying), indicating that he is upset or hurt in some way.

This is a more common reason for a child to become upset than being ignored by someone they like (Option A). Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - They cut off her legs.
Explanation: The premise states that doctors gave a patient artificial legs, but option A better fits the context of the sentence as it implies that they removed or amputated the patient's natural legs rather than simply giving them artificial ones."
"Response:  Option B: She pushes his arm away.

The action of pushing someone's arm away is a common response to unwanted physical contact or advances, especially in a social setting where personal space and boundaries are important."
"Response:  Option B: 내가 옳았다는 걸 알액은 더  LIKELY CAUSE.  
Explanation: The sentence ""내가 옳았다는 걸 알액"" implies that the speaker has a clear understanding of their own opinion and can confidently express it. This suggests that they are more likely to have given advice based on their own beliefs rather than considering their friend's perspective. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: 진흙이 그의 얼굴을 쳤어요.  
Reasoning: The premise states that the boy put his foot in mud, indicating that he was standing or walking near a location where mud exists. Given this context, it is more likely that the mud would have splattered onto his face rather than sticking to his shoes."

Explanation: The premise states that ""몇 인치"" of snow fell in a small town, indicating a significant amount of snowfall. This suggests that the town was buried under a large amount of snow, making it difficult for people to leave their homes or move around.

"Response:  Option B: 나무가 뒷마당에 그늘을 씌웠다. (The tree fell onto the backyard.)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""나무가 집을 손상시켰어,"" it is more likely that the tree fell onto the backyard rather than landing on the roof. The phrase ""뒷마당"" specifically refers to the area behind a house or building, indicating that the tree fell in this direction."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (the tree was hit by a hammer) is more likely to be the cause of the tree branch breaking off. The use of the word ""던졌어"" (hit) implies a sudden and forceful impact, which could potentially break the tree branch. Option A (I built a wall with the tree branches) does not provide any evidence that the tree branch broke off due to an external factor. Therefore, option B is the better answer."
"Response:  Option B: 부부는 그들이 아기를 가질 것이라고 발표했다.  
Explanation: The passage states that ""가족들은 이 부부를 축하했습니다,"" indicating that they are a happy couple. Therefore, option B, where the couple announces that they will have a baby, is the more likely cause."

"Response:  Option B: They wanted a fair decision.
Explanation: The premise states that the friends threw a coin to decide who would pay for the meal. This implies that they were unable to come to an agreement through negotiation or compromise, leading them to resort to chance (throwing a coin). Therefore, option B is the more likely cause, as it suggests that they wanted a fair decision rather than simply accepting one outcome over the other."
"Response:  Option B: 그 남자는 피자를 오븐에서 꺼냈어요. (He turned off the oven.)
Explanation: Based on the premise ""부엌의 타이머가 꺼졌어"", it is more likely that the man turned off the oven than put food in the refrigerator.

"Response:  Option B: 불꽃에서 연기가 솟아나왔다. (The flame burst out from the fire.)
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman stepped on a spark, which ignited a fire. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the flame burst out from the fire, indicating that the fire has been reignited or intensified due to the woman's action."
"Response:  Option B: 교통사고가 났어요 (The accident occurred)
Explanation: The premise states that the woman's car was in the repair shop, indicating that there may have been an issue with the vehicle. However, the option A does not align with this information as it implies that the driver's license was cancelled due to a separate reason unrelated to the car's condition. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the woman's situation."
"Response:  Option B: 아침식사를 놓쳤어요 (Morning meal was left uncooked)

"Response:  Option B: His family attended a press conference.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""The public figure has fallen from grace,"" it is more likely that his family would attend a press conference to address the situation rather than the camera angles changing direction due to an unknown reason."

"Response:  Option B: 거실을 재배치하고 있었어요
Explanation: According to the premise, the speaker was looking for a small amount of money. This suggests that they were in a financial difficult situation and needed to find some extra cash. On the other hand, rearranging a living room does not necessarily require a large amount of money, so it is more likely that the speaker was doing this as a way to pass their time or for personal enjoyment rather than for financial gain. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B is more likely. The phrase ""거미는 소년을 향해 날아갔다"" suggests that a spider flew towards the boy, indicating aggression or threat. Therefore, it is more likely that the boy will try to escape (option A) rather than being attracted by a flower (option B)."
"Response:  Option B: She received a death sentence.

"Response:  Option A: 차가 증기되었다.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""나는 뜨거운 차에 설탕을 섞었다,"" which means that sugar was added to a hot cup of tea. This would cause the tea to become sweeter, not melt or dissolve. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: He was injured in battle.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man walked for three days to get medical attention, indicating that he was injured during a battle or combat situation rather than being conscripted into military service. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
