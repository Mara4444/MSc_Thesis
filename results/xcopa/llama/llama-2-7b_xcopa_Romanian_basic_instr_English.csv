"Response:  Option A: Era fragilă.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the product was wrapped in a delicate paper with bubbles. This suggests that it was fragile, making option A the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mi-am golit buzunarele,"" Option A (Am recuperat un bilet de călătorie) is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B - ""Termitele au mâncat lemnul din casă"" (The termites have eaten the wood in the house) - will occur."
"Response:  Option B: Agentul de patrulare i-a acuzat de contrabandă.  
Explanation: The premise states that travelers have reached the border, indicating that they are in a foreign country. Given this context, it is more likely that the agent will accuse them of smuggling something illegal rather than simply checking their passports."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (There was a holiday) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Biroul era închis"" implies that the office was closed, which could be due to a holiday or other official reason. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (A jucat dame) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Fata a rămas fără energie"" suggests that something has happened to make her weak or tired, which could be due to playing too much dama (checkers). Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (More people have entered the line) is a more likely cause for why she lost her place in line. The premise states that ""she has lost her place in the line,"" implying that there are now more people ahead of her than before. This suggests that new individuals have joined the line, causing her to fall behind. Option B (She got out of the line) does not align with this reasoning as it implies that she voluntarily left the line, rather than being pushed back by new entrants."
Response:  Option B: Copilul i-a murdărit scutecul.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that public has applauded to their music (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premises given, option B (Fata i-a adresat profesorului un măr) is more likely. The fact that the girl stayed after class for punishment suggests that she may have done something wrong or disruptive in class, which could include bringing an apple to her teacher without being asked to do so. On the other hand, option A (Fata a rămas după ore pentru detenţie) does not provide any context for why the girl would be staying after class, and it could simply mean that she was late or missed something important during the lesson.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the counselor told them a ghost story) is more likely to be the cause of their fear.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (S-a pierdut în gânduri) is more likely. The phrase ""s-a lovit la cap"" suggests that something has happened to the person's head or mind, which could cause them to become lost in thought or disoriented. This is a common experience for many people, especially when they are under stress or experiencing strong emotions. Option B (A avut o contuzie) does not fit as well with the given premise, as it implies a physical injury rather than a mental one."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (the author's bank account was empty) is the correct answer. The passage states that the author had written a check for $100 but did not have enough money in their bank account to cover it, indicating that they did not have sufficient funds in their account at the time the check was written. This suggests that the author's bank account was indeed empty when they wrote the check.
"Response:  Option B - A trimis un e-mail în masă.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man's email inbox was full of spam, indicating that he received many unwanted emails. Therefore, option B, which involves sending an email to many people, is more likely as it aligns with the given information."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the sailor was exposed to disease (Option A). The sentence ""Marinarul a fost pus în carantină"" implies that the sailor was placed in quarantine due to illness or suspected illness, rather than having recovered from an illness. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ea a recitat-o pentru ea) is the more likely cause. The fact that she forgot to write down the code suggests that she may have been distracted or preoccupied with other things, making it less likely that she would remember it.
Response:  Option A - Apa mi-a potolit setea.
"Response: 
Option A: A wanted to offer support to his friend."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (M-am simţit vinovat) is the correct answer. The use of the first person pronoun ""m-am"" and the phrase ""simţit vinovat"" suggest that the speaker feels guilty or responsible for the accident, which aligns with Option A."
"Response:  Option B: There was a break in the chain.
Explanation: The premise states that ""the link has broken,"" indicating that there was a failure in one of the components of the chain, most likely a break in the chain itself. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They have become fed up with arguing) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: A depus mărturie în instanță.  
Explanation: According to the premise, if a woman decides to run for public office, she will have to depose a statement in court. This means that option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (A împachetat haine calde în valiză) is correct. The premise states that the man has anticipated that it will be cold in his journey, so he packed warm clothes in his suitcase. Option B does not provide any information about the man's preparations for the weather, making it less likely to be correct.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the student raised his hand than made a mistake. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: Şi-a pus ochelari de protecţie pe ochi.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""ochii au început să plângă"", indicating that there is some kind of discomfort or pain in the eyes. Wearing protective glasses would be a logical solution to alleviate this discomfort, making option B the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Adversary accuses her of cheating) is more likely to occur. The fact that she has won five games in a row suggests that she is performing well, and an adversary might become suspicious or resentful of her success. Option B (Adversary feels sorry for her) does not fit with the context as there is no indication that the adversary has any particular feeling towards her.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Professor caught student cheating) is more likely. The professor has directly caught the student cheating, indicating that the student was attempting to deceive the professor through dishonest means. Option B (Student's answers were incorrect) does not necessarily imply that the student was trying to cheat, as their answers could simply be wrong due to lack of understanding or other factors. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation based on the provided premise.
"Response:  Option B - Mi-a rămas respiraţia.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker has stopped speaking, implying that they are no longer producing sound. Respiration, or breathing, is a necessary function for life but does not involve speech production, making it a more plausible explanation for why the speaker has stopped talking."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Am pus-o în cuptorul cu microunde) caused the ice cream to melt. Microwaves can quickly heat up food and liquids, including frozen desserts like ice cream. Therefore, placing the ice cream in a microwave oven would be more likely to cause it to melt than covering it with plastic wrap.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the boss pretended to be sick (Option A). The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it suggests that the boss's excuse was fabricated, implying that they were not actually feeling unwell.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Fata aterizat în piscină (Fata fell into the pool). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: A alergat pe puntea piscinei (A ran to the edge of the pool).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Film has sold out) is more likely as it suggests that there is high demand for the movie, leading to its sellout. This implies positive word of mouth and good reviews, rather than poor critical reception.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul a slăbit,"" option A (Oamenii l-au izolat) is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (A has become with a rope) is more likely than option A (She wrote a letter). The premise mentions that the girl's hands have become with something, implying that she has been physically affected in some way. Writing a letter would not require any physical alteration to her hands. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Publicul a aplauded with amazement) is more likely. The artist's ability to juggle while riding a unicycle is an impressive feat that would likely elicit applause from the audience. Option B (Acrobat s-a aruncat de pe un trapez) does not align with the given information as it refers to an acrobatic move performed on a trapeze, which is different from the context of the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mi-am pierdut răbdarea) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker has lost their patience, which aligns with the context of waiting for someone who didn't arrive on time.
"Response:  Option B: Au negociat un tratat.  
Explanation: The premise states that the countries in conflict desired peace, which suggests that they are willing to negotiate a treaty or agreement to end their conflicts. Developing nuclear weapons would not necessarily lead to peace, as it could escalate tensions and make resolution through diplomacy even more difficult. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Avenit somnifere) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence ""Omul a luat somnifere"" implies that the man took sleeping pills, which can cause drowsiness or even induce sleep. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice."
"Response:  Option A - The man's leg has been broken.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Femeia s-a lovit de canapea,"" it is more likely that the woman hit the man with her fist rather than breaking his leg. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Balonul a explodat.
Explanation: The premise ""Băiatul a strâns balonul"" implies that the boy has collected or gathered something (the balloon). This could be done for various reasons such as playing with it, using it to create something else, or even keeping it as a souvenir. However, when we consider the option of the balloon exploding, it becomes clear that this outcome is less likely than the balloon flying away. While it's possible for a balloon to burst due to various factors like overinflation or exposure to extreme temperatures, it's much less probable for a balloon to suddenly take off into the air without any external influence. Therefore, based on the given information, option A - Balonul a explodat seems like the most plausible conclusion."
Response:  Option B: Au plecat la aerport. (They have left for the airport.)
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am muşcat în piersică,"" it is more likely that option B: ""A vărsat suc"" (sour taste). This is because the word ""muşcat"" in Romanian means ""bitter"" or ""sour"", so it would make sense for the person to have tasted something sour rather than their piercing being frozen."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am mâncat o gogoaşă) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a plausible explanation for why someone might have licked their fingers. Eating a popsicle or ice cream could potentially leave a sticky residue on one's fingers that would make them taste sweet. However, having a sweet tooth is not a logical reason why someone would lick their fingers.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am împins uşa,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Uşa s-a deschis."""
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Produsele au fost testate pentru asigurarea calității) is more likely. The activists have boycotted products because they are not tested for quality, rather than being produced by children's labor.
Response:  Option A - Un şoarece a ieşit din gaură.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sora ei era fericită) is more likely. The passage states that Femia was jealous of her sister's happiness, indicating that her sister was happy and content, while Femia herself felt left out or unhappy. This suggests that the reason for Femia's jealousy is not because her sister has divorced her husband, but rather because she feels inadequate or unfulfilled in some way compared to her sister. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer.
"Response:  Option B - Mi-am schimbat cămaşa (I have changed my shirt).
Explanation: The premise ""Mi-am vărsat vin pe cămaşă"" implies that something has spilled onto the speaker's shirt. Option B better fits this scenario as it suggests that the speaker has changed their shirt to avoid getting stained further. Option A does not make sense in this context as putting a short would not solve the problem of having spilled wine on one's existing shirt."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Clientul şi-a căutat în portofel) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Oamenii i-au dat schimbare) is more likely. The passage states that ""oamenii i-au dat schimbare,"" indicating that they gave him change, which suggests that he received money from them. This implies that he was successful in his performance and earned money from the crowd. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: I-a fost dor de părinţilor lui.  
Explanation: The boy cried at his grandmother's house because he missed his parents. This is the most likely explanation based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the pilot has flown through the storm) is more likely.
Response:  Option A - Frunzele au become colored.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A decided to play a trick on his sister) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tatăl lui a oprit maşina la o benzinărie) is more likely. The reason being that stopping at a gas station would not address or solve the problem of the child feeling sick after drinking water. It would only provide a temporary solution by giving him something to do while they are on their way to the bathroom.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Peştele a înotat spre mâncare) is more likely. The premise states that the child has put food in the aquarium, implying that the fish has moved towards the food.
"Response:  Option B: She has joined a protest.
Explanation: The passage states that ""părerile politice ale femeii s-au schimbat,"" indicating that her political views have changed. Joining a protest is a common way for people to express their newfound political beliefs or values, making option B the most likely answer."
"Response:  Option B: Am turnat detergent de scurgere în ea.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the bathtub was filled with water, but since there is no mention of any water being drained from it, it is unlikely that the robinet has been opened. Therefore, option B, turning detergent into the bathtub, is a more plausible explanation for why the water in the bathtub has turned cloudy."
Response:  Option A: Trenul a ajuns la gara.
"Response:  Option B: A sigilat plicul.
Explanation: The premise states that the man has pressed his wet handkerchief onto the sealed envelope, indicating that he has tried to open it but was unsuccessful. Since the envelope is still sealed, it means that the man has not been able to open it using any means, including applying a stamp or sigilizing it. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (they have moved to different cities) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (A fost concediată din funcția ei) is correct. The reason for this is that the premise states that the accountant ""managed incorrectly the company's funds,"" which implies that they made mistakes or poor decisions while handling the finances of the company. This could potentially lead to disciplinary action such as dismissal from their job. Option B (A plecat în concediu de maternitate) does not align with this reasoning as it suggests that the accountant went on leave due to pregnancy, which is an unrelated factor to the mistake mentioned in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Am auzit ceasul tic-tac) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""auzit ceasul"" means ""hear the clock,"" indicating that the speaker can hear the sound of the ticking clock. This suggests that the speaker is close enough to the clock to hear its sound, making it unlikely for them to need a visual representation of time. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B - Eu şi soţia mea ne-am Ţinut de mână.  
Explanation: The premise ""Mi-a intrat mâna în crampă"" suggests that someone has gotten a cramp in their hand. Option B is the most likely cause as it implies that the speaker's spouse also had a cramp in their hand, which would be a common occurrence for people who are holding hands."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Am înlocuit șurubul) is the correct answer. The phrase ""buloul s-a strâns"" suggests that something has become tight or constricted, which could be caused by a loose screw or other mechanical issue with the lock rather than simply rasing the key. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why the door won't open."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Cuplul s-a mutat în apartament) will occur. The couple has signed a lease agreement for an apartment, indicating their intention to move in. Option B (Oraşul a condamnat apartamentul) means that the city has condemned the apartment, which is unlikely based on the information provided. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A crezut că a văzut fulger) is more likely. The fact that Femia was sitting outside on the veranda suggests that she may have been in a state of relaxation or leisure, rather than actively looking for something to see. Additionally, the phrase ""a crezut"" implies that Femia may have misinterpreted what she saw, which is more plausible given her state of mind at the time. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Option B: Apa era puţin adâncă.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the water was shallow rather than the man not knowing how to swim."
Response:  Option B: A apăsat pe butonul de backspace.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (took a bad note) is the correct answer. The phrase ""s-a lăudat prietenilor"" suggests that Fata was praised by her friends, which implies that she did something good or impressive. Taking a bad note would be an unlikely action for someone who has been praised by their friends, so option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (A plouat peste noapte) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Gazonul era noroios"" suggests that the lawn was wet overnight, which could have caused the grass to grow unevenly or become discolored. Option B (""Era plin de buruieni"") does not provide a clear explanation for why the lawn might be in this state."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the woman slept at an hotel) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the woman ""slept"" at an hotel, indicating that she spent the night there. Option B does not make sense in this context as it implies that the woman would put her watch on snooze mode, which is not something one would do when sleeping at a hotel. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the information given in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (El a stat la umbră) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the man has taken shelter under something to protect himself from the sun, rather than going to the beach.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cercetătorii au retras teoria) is more likely. The passage states that ""cercetătorii au dovedit teoria,"" indicating that researchers have proven the theory, but then goes on to say that ""teoria a fost retrasa,"" suggesting that the theory has been withdrawn or retracted. This implies that the researchers have reconsidered their findings and no longer support the original theory, rather than people accepting it without question. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the game has entered extra time) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am închis lacătul) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Tatăl a luat mâna fiului său) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the father took his son's hand, which could lead to an increase in intensity of the situation, whereas option A (Tatăl i-a dat fiului său niște bani) does not necessarily imply any change in intensity.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am adunat zăpada într-o bulă de zăpadă) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker has collected snow in a ball of snow, indicating that they have been able to move past the obstruction caused by the snow. Option B (Am scos zăpada din drum) means ""I removed the snow from the road,"" which would not be possible if the snow had blocked the entire road. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B - Caiacul has hit a wave. 
Explanation: The premise states that canoegists have been struggling with their canoes, indicating difficulty in paddling or maneuvering them. This could be due to strong winds or waves, which would make it harder for the canoeists to control their vessels. Therefore, option B, where Caiacul has hit a wave, is more likely than option A, where Caiacul has reached shore, as hitting a wave is a more plausible explanation for the struggle described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: A left the handlebars. This is because the phrase ""Fata a pierdut controlul motocicleții"" implies that the woman lost control of the motorcycle, which could be caused by letting go of the handlebars momentarily."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am pornit ventilatorul,"" option A (Apa stropită pe pielea mea) is the most likely answer. The word ""pornit"" in Romanian means to breathe or blow air, so it suggests that the speaker is experiencing something related to breathing or air movement. Option B (""Am simţit cum aerul rece treze peste mine"") means ""I felt as if cold air was passing over me,"" which does not fit with the context of the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They were exhausted) is more likely. The premise states that surfers have returned to shore, indicating that they may have been tired from their time in the water. It does not mention anything about seeing a shark, which would be an unlikely reason for them to return to shore. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (The water has drained from the bucket) is the most likely outcome. Therefore, the answer is (A) The water has drained from the bucket.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will accuse her of infidelity (Option A).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Am aşteptat ca cerneala să se usuce) is the correct answer. The fact that the stain has been removed suggests that it was not caused by water being poured onto the poster. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the stain disappeared.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the child woke up crying) is the correct answer.
Response:  Option B: Tatăl lui i-a ţinut predici.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Am făcut cu mâinile) is more likely. The premise states that my friend turned his head in my direction, implying that he reacted to something I did or said. Therefore, it is more likely that I spoke or made a gesture with my hands rather than shouting his name.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Cetățenii au organizat o revoltă) is more likely. The premise suggests that the government is exerting control over citizens, implying a power imbalance in which citizens are resisting or rebelling against the government's actions. This is more consistent with Option A than Option B, where citizens are simply registering to vote, which would not necessarily involve resistance or rebellion.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the boy raised a shelter (Option A). The premise states that the boy got lost in the forest, indicating that he may have been separated from his family or group for an extended period of time. Building a shelter would be a practical solution to protect himself from the elements and potential dangers in the forest. Struggling for help might not be feasible given his situation, especially if he does not know where he is or how to find assistance. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible choice.
"Response:  Option B: Voia să înveţe despre altele culte. 
Explanation: The passage states that the woman wanted to learn about other cultures, indicating that she was interested in broadening her knowledge of the world beyond her own culture. This aligns with option B, as learning about other cultures is an important aspect of cultural exchange and understanding."
Response:  Option A (Colegul lui de muncă a primit o promovare.)
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (A had hallucinations) is the correct answer. The fact that the man was a witness to an extraterrestrial encounter suggests that he may have experienced some kind of psychological or neurological event that caused him to see or hear things that were not there. Hallucinations are a common symptom of certain mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and can also be induced by drugs, alcohol, or other substances. It is less likely that the man meditated and saw something extraordinary as a result, given the specific details provided in the premise.
"Response:  Option B: A put shampoo in it.
Explanation: The premise states that the man's hair became blonde, indicating that he used some kind of hair product to achieve this change. Shampoo is a common product used for washing and conditioning hair, so it is more likely that the man put shampoo in his hair rather than using a clâtitor (which is not a commonly used term in English)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A felt a shock of inspiration) is more likely. The artist has created something new, indicating that they have been inspired to create something fresh and original. Criticizing their previous work would not be consistent with this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he was discharged from the army) is the correct answer. The premise states that he ""moved away,"" which could imply that he left his home for some reason, such as being discharged from the army. It does not provide any indication that he went to college. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Option B: Un cutremur a zguduit raftul de cărți.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Cărțile au căzut din raft,"" indicating that something caused the books to fall from the shelf. Option B provides the most plausible explanation for this occurrence, as an earthquake (cutremur) can easily disrupt or destroy a bookshelf. In contrast, option A does not provide a logical reason for why the raft would be covered in dust, as it is unlikely that a raft would be submerged in water with no apparent means of getting there. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause for the books falling off the shelf."
"Response:  Option B: Am resetet inetrruptorul.
Explanation: According to the premise, there was a power outage in the house, which means that none of the lights turned on when the current was cut off. Therefore, option B, ""Am resetet inetrruptorul,"" or ""I reset the circuit breaker"" is the most likely answer as it explains why the light did not turn on during the power outage."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Arăta înfricoşător) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Am mers cu roller coaster-ul"" suggests that the speaker had a thrilling or frightening experience on a roller coaster ride, which aligns with Option A's description of being ""intriguing"" or ""frightening"". Therefore, the speaker is more likely to have experienced something that was intense and exciting rather than something that was distracting."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am turnat unt în punga) is more likely to be the cause of the popcorn starting to spill. This is because turning the bag could disrupt the kernels inside and cause them to burst through the top of the bag. In contrast, heating the bag in the microwave may not have the same effect.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A căzut curentul în cartier) is more likely. The phrase ""un copac a căzut pe linia de curent"" suggests that something heavy has fallen onto the power line, which could cause damage or disrupt electricity supply in the surrounding area. It's unlikely that strong winds would directly affect the power line, so option B (Previziunea prevedeuă vânture puternice) is less relevant to the scenario described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the public became bored) occurred. The orator's incorrect political comments may have failed to hold the audience's attention, leading to boredom rather than offense.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that a drop of sweat has formed on my face (Option A). The premise mentions ""acul"" (meaning ""the needle"") and ""sudoarea"" (meaning ""the sweat""), indicating that the action described is related to medical procedures or injuries. It is unlikely that a drop of blood would form on one's finger in this context. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the fish died (Option B). The phrase ""peştele plutea pe suprafața rezervorului"" suggests that the fish was floating on the surface of the reservoir, indicating death rather than hunger."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vocea omului suna rau,"" option A (A fost răcit) is the most likely cause of the man's voice sounding bad. The premise suggests that something has affected the man's vocal cords or his overall health, causing him to speak in a raspy tone. Option B (A renunță la fumat) does not provide any logical explanation for why the man's voice would sound bad based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B: Liftul s-a blocat între etaje. The lift has stopped between floors, indicating a mechanical failure or obstruction.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the adolescent lied to his parents) is the correct answer. The fact that he ""furişat afară din casă"" suggests that he left home without permission, which could be a result of him lying to his parents about where he was going or what he was doing. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the adolescent is not at home."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that option A (the toilet has been flushed) caused the flood in the bathroom. The fact that the water level has risen significantly suggests that something has disrupted the flow of water into the bathtub, and given that the toilet is one of the primary sources of water supply in a bathroom, it is plausible that someone flushes the toilet, causing the water level to rise. Option B (the heater broke down) seems less likely as it would not explain why only the bathtub is affected and not other parts of the house.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Proprietarul a pus un guler pe cățeluș) is more likely. The fact that the cat has been left with its owner suggests that it was intentionally left behind by its owner, rather than being kept in a cage or enclosure.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Stătea sub copacul întinzându-se) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the idea of reflecting one's thoughts. When someone stands under a tree stretching out their arms, they are in a position that allows them to gaze upwards towards the sky and reflect on their thoughts without any distractions or obstacles. This is in contrast to standing above a calm lake, where there may be other things to focus on such as the water or surrounding landscape. Therefore, option A is the better fit for the given premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am sunat-o înapoi) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that their dog has run away from home (Option A). The mention of ""familia"" suggests that there are people involved in the situation, and the context implies that something has happened to one of their pets rather than valuable items being stolen from their house."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mi-am văzut respirația când am expirat."", option A (Vremea era rece) is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker felt like they had seen their breath when exhaling."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (the employees formed a union) is the more likely cause for the change in their working conditions. The passage states that ""Angajaţii au format un sindicat"" (The employees formed a union), indicating that they took collective action to address their concerns about their working conditions. This suggests that the employees were not satisfied with their current conditions and decided to organize themselves to advocate for better treatment from their employer. In contrast, option B does not provide any evidence to support the idea that the employer voluntarily increased the employees' salaries without any external pressure or motivation. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for the improvement in the employees' working conditions."
"Response:  Option B: O aroma caldă umpluse bucătăria.
Explanation: The premise states that ""am făcut o plăcintă cu mere"", indicating that something sweet was made with apples. Option B, ""o aromă caldă umpluse bucătăria,"" suggests that a warm fragrance filled the kitchen, which is consistent with the idea of baking something sweet like apple pie. Option A, ""un miros de putregai umpluse bucătăria,"" implies a sour or unpleasant smell filling the kitchen, which does not fit with the context of making a sweet dish. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: Și-a scos pantofii.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the woman is struggling to walk. Taking off her shoes would make it easier for her to move around, as she wouldn't have to deal with the added weight or discomfort of wearing them. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vaporul a crescut din oala cu apă"", it is more likely that option A, ""Apa a fost fierbat."" This is because vapor is formed when water is heated, not covered."
"Response:  Option B: Am purtat cizme.
Explanation: The premise states that all shoes were at the cleaner's, implying that the speaker was not wearing any shoes. Therefore, option B, ""Am purtar cizme,"" is the most likely choice as it implies that the speaker was indeed wearing shoes."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A pierdut sprijinul votanților) is more likely. The argument of the politician was considered absurd by his opponents, leading to him losing support from the electorate.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the couple will stay together despite everyone's disapproval. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Milionarul a vrut ca clădirea să fie demolată) is correct. The premise states that the building was dedicated to a millionaire, which implies that the person who owned the building had some sort of connection or interest in it. It is unlikely that a millionaire would contribute funds towards constructing a building unless they had some personal stake in its creation or maintenance. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the building was dedicated to the millionaire.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Vânzătorul a văzut-o pe fată punând marfă în poşetă) is the more likely cause. The fact that the salesman saw the girl putting merchandise in her purse suggests that she may have been shoplifting, which is a common form of theft.  
"Response:  Option A: Soldaţii au fost trimişi să lupte.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Ţara a declarat război teritoriului vecin,"" which means that the country has declared war on its neighboring territory. Therefore, it is more likely that soldiers will be sent to fight in the war rather than being reunited with their families."
"Response:  Based on the given premises, option A (A revolt has broken out in front of the courthouse) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of the word ""izbucnit"" (meaning ""to break out"") and the mention of a ""revolt"" suggest that there has been some kind of sudden and violent uprising or protest in front of the courthouse. This is more consistent with the idea of a group of people expressively disagreeing with a court decision than a couple making an oath before the tribunal."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fata a mirosit ceva arzând"", it is more likely that she left the cakes in the oven (Option B)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ploaia a început să curgă,"" option A (Furtuna s-a înrăutățit) is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the ascensor has stopped functioning) is the cause of the building being evacuated. The mention of ""ascensor"" suggests that the building has an elevator system, and if the elevators have stopped working, it would be difficult or impossible for people to access certain floors, leading to an evacuation. Option B (the alarm has sounded) could also be a possible reason for an evacuation, but without additional context, it seems less likely given the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Option B: Tatăl şi-a dat fiul afară din casă.  
Explanation: The father's anger towards his son's alcoholism may lead him to take drastic measures such as kicking him out of the house. This option better reflects the consequences that a parent might face when dealing with their child's addiction problem."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A: The secretary has left for home today. Therefore, the lift does not function. 
Response:  Option A (Prietenul său l-a întrerupt.)
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Casierul i-a dat fetei restul) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the money was actually given to the girl by the cashier, rather than the cashier forgetting to give her a check.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Femina was put into a wheelchair after an accident (Option A). This is because there is no mention of her entering a hospital voluntarily or involuntarily, which suggests that she may have been injured in some way to require the use of a wheelchair.
"Response:  Option B: Ţara se confruntă cu dificultăţi economice.  
Explanation: The premise states that citizens have hung the national flag in front of their homes, indicating a sense of patriotism and pride. However, the second option suggests that the country is facing economic difficulties, which could be a reason for people to feel less optimistic and enthusiastic about their nation's future. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Ei şi-au inspirat fanii.  
Explanation: The phrase ""Ei şi-au inspirat fanii"" suggests that the team has inspired their fans, rather than disappointing them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Option A: Mi-a fost ruşine.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the boy was attentive during class) is the correct answer. The premise states that the boy ""a picat examin,"" which means he passed the history examination, indicating that he was paying attention and studied for the exam. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the boy did well on the exam."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (an earthquake hit the city) caused the building to collapse. The mention of ""centru"" (center) suggests that the location is urban or metropolitan, where earthquakes are less common than other causes such as criminal activity. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the building's collapse."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A implorat-o să-l ia înapoi) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Capetele lor s-au ciocnit.  
Explanation: According to the premise, both children have simultaneously recovered the ball. Since they are holding onto it together, their heads must have collided as a result of this action. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The rat had eaten the trash bag) is more likely. The sentence ""Racunul a jefuit coşul de gunoi"" implies that something has been consumed or digested, which suggests that the rat has eaten the trash bag rather than the other way around."
Response:  Option A: A was cheap.
Response:  Option A (şi-a pierdut chitanţa) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the woman would not have gotten her dress back from the case worker.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Grinza de pe pielea mea era adâncă"", option B is more likely. The phrase ""adâncă"" suggests that the wound was deep, so it's unlikely that she would have recovered quickly from such a severe injury. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Se holba la pământ) is more likely. The man is likely to be embarrassed or ashamed of himself for receiving strange looks from his fellow passengers in the train.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Copilul a pus pâinea deoparte) is more likely because it explains why there are crumbs on the floor without any other factors involved. Option A (Furnicile s-au târât pe firimituri) does not make sense in this context as furniture cannot move on its own.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Sora femeii şi-a încrucişat mâinile) is the more likely cause. The premise states that ""Femeia i-a dat surorii ei un şerveţel,"" indicating that the woman gave her sister a shawl. This action does not suggest any emotional response or distress from the sister, such as crying. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the sister may have crossed her arms."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Buzele lui erau rupte) is the more likely cause for his bad breath. The premise does not provide any information that would suggest he has a respiratory problem or that he smells badly due to another reason. Therefore, it is more plausible that his beard was dirty or had some other issue causing his bad breath rather than him having a serious health problem.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (They had anticipated traffic around the theatre) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Cuplul a plecat mai devreme pentru spectacol"" implies that they left earlier than expected to get to the theatre, which suggests that they were aware of potential delays or congestion on their route. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why they arrived early at the theatre."
"Response:  Option B: Colega ei de la muncă a acoperit-o.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman's boss praised her for staying home from work, indicating that she was appreciated for her decision to take care of herself. This suggests that option B, where a colleague covered for her at work, is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the man signed the petition of the activists (Option A). The premise states that he has ""signed the petition of the activists,"" indicating that he supports their cause. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Option A: Avea frică de scenă.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Mi-am numărat banii) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Am fost pierdut"" implies a state of confusion or disorientation, which could lead to forgetting one's money. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the speaker has counted their money, is more plausible in this context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fructele coapte au rămas în soare,"" it is more likely that option A, ""A fost mâncat,"" is correct. The phrase ""coapte au rămas"" suggests that the fruit has been left out in the sun, which could cause it to spoil or rot. Therefore, it is more likely that the fruit was eaten by an animal or a person rather than being stranded in the sun."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the engine overheated) is the correct answer. The phrase ""mașina s-a stricat"" suggests that something has happened to the car's engine, and the mention of ""supraîncălzit"" implies that this event was caused by an excessive temperature buildup within the engine. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the car stopped working."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (the person stayed in bed for a few days) is the correct answer. The reason being that the premise states that the person was injured at the back, which could be a cause of discomfort or pain that would make it difficult to get out of bed.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (“Nu mai aveam lemne de foc”) is more likely to be the cause of the lack of heat in the house. The phrase “nu mai aveam lemne de foc” suggests that there were no more logs left for burning, indicating a temporary shortage or absence of fuel rather than extreme cold weather.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Femina has received a second wind rather than having a cramp in her side. The reason for this is that a cramp in the side would be a sudden and intense pain, whereas receiving a second wind is a gradual increase in energy or endurance. Therefore, option B (receiving a second wind) is the more likely explanation for why Femina is now able to run again.
Response:  Option A (Vecinul m-a invitat înăuntru).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Soțul ei nu a înţeles îngrijorărilor ei) is more likely. The fact that she feels frustrated suggests that her husband has not understood or addressed her concerns, leading to further feelings of unhappiness in their relationship.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Studentul a răspuns corect la întrebare) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She was at the supermarket) is more likely.
Response:  Option A (I-am dezvăluit un secret)
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (A prins un peşte) is the correct answer. The fact that the woman tried to avoid entering the lake suggests that she was aware of something dangerous or undesirable in the water, such as a large fish. This is further supported by the mention of her catching a fish, which implies that there were potentially other hazards present in the lake. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why the woman did not want to enter the lake.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that his umbrella was broken (Option A). The reason being that there is no mention of any other personal belongings or valuables that could have been stolen from him, such as a bicycle. Therefore, given the context of the situation, it makes more sense for his umbrella to be the item that has gone missing.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Utilizatorul a făcut clic cu mouse-ul) is more likely as the reason for the cursor to move on the screen. The user's action of clicking with the mouse is a common way for the cursor to move around the screen. Option B (Utilizatorul a mutat mouse-ul) means that the user has moved the mouse itself, but this is less likely to be the cause of the cursor moving on the screen without any input from the user.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (A avut loc un accident pe drumul principal) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""pe o cale de cotitură"" suggests that the driver took a detour or turned off onto a side road, which could potentially lead to an accident on a smaller, less busy road. Option B does not provide any information about the location of the accident, making it less specific and therefore less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  Option A: Lenjeria s-a uscat.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Femeia a pus ochelarii,"" option A (Lumina soarelui era strălucitoare) is more likely to be the correct cause. The premise suggests that the woman put on her sunglasses because of the bright sunlight, which is consistent with option A. Option B (A chemat un taxi) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the woman called a taxi."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul se uita la cerul nopţii,"" option A (El a dorit să fie vara) is the more likely cause. The man wanted it to be summer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""M-am simțit epuizat,"" option A is more likely. The correct answer is (A) M-am dus la culcare devreme."
Response:  Option A: Îşi lăsase părul să crească.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Băiatul nu-l plăcea pe noul coleg de clasă) is more likely. The fact that the boy played ""trucuri rele"" with his new classmate suggests that he may not have gotten along well with him, hence option B."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am mâncat prăjituri) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the information provided in the premise. The statement ""Am avut o poftă de lapte"" suggests that the speaker has a craving for milk, which could lead them to eat cookies or other sweet treats. On the other hand, ""Am fost de coacere pâine"" means ""I have been baking bread,"" which does not align with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Option B: Șoferul a dat înapoi.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Am parcat peste drum) is correct. The sentence implies that there was no car parked in front of the building, so it is more likely that someone parked over the road rather than next to the entrance.
Response:  Option A: A had a block of writer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Am cerutsă să vorbescu cu un supraveghetor) is the correct answer. This is because the speaker mentions asking to speak with a supervisor, which suggests that they are trying to resolve an issue or problem with their associate. Option B (Mi-am dat numărul de identificare) does not provide any context or clues about why the speaker might have been asked to identify themselves.
"Response:  Option B: Cortinele s-au zguduit.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""vântul sufla prin fereastre deschise"", indicating a gentle breeze blowing through open windows. This suggests that the window is not closed tightly, allowing the wind to enter the room. Therefore, option B, ""Cortinele s-au zguduit"", which means ""The curtains have been shaken"" is the most likely effect of the wind blowing through the open windows."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B - ""Am explodat o siguranță"" - caused the current to be cut off in the house. The phrase ""am explodat o siguranță"" suggests that there was an explosion or a malfunction in one of the safety devices in the house, which could have resulted in the cutting off of the electrical current. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: A has raised the bar above her head.
Explanation: The premise states that ""Ridiculaţia de greutate a mormântuit,"" which means ""She ridiculed her own weight."" This implies that she was feeling self-conscious about her appearance and may have been trying to make herself look thinner by raising the bar above her head. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the student was confused) is more likely. The idea that the student tried to perform calculations in his mind implies that he may have been struggling or having difficulty with the task, rather than simply pulling out a calculator.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tatăl a schimbat scutecul copilului) is more likely as it provides an explanation for why the child woke up. The other option does not provide any logical reasoning to explain why the child woke up. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: Băiatul s-a udat.  
Explanation: The premise states that the boy was hit by the water balloon, which means he got wet. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Toţi cei din fotografii au refuzat să zâmbească.  
Explanation: The premise states that the photographer tried to use the built-in flash on their camera, but it didn't work as expected. This could be due to various reasons such as the subject being too far away or the lighting conditions not being suitable for the flash. However, since the photographs came out blurry, it is more likely that the subjects refused to smile rather than the flash not working properly."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I was alone) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (M-am simţit plin de energie) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the sentence. The speaker has just mentioned that they have done exercises, which could potentially increase their energy levels. Therefore, option A better fits the given information than option B (Am fost speriat).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am stoarcit buretele umed,"" option A (A absorbit apa) is more likely to occur. The word ""umed"" in Romanian means ""water"", so it's likely that the sentence is referring to water being absorbed by the soil or a plant. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the resort was reserved) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Oaspeții au luat un feribot spre stațiune"" implies that the guests took a ferry to reach their destination, which suggests that they were traveling to a specific location rather than being stranded on an island. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A wanted to rebel) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A: Am become suspicious. 
Explanation: The premise states that a mysterious car has been parked in front of the speaker's house, leading them to feel suspicious rather than immediately calling the police. This suggests that the speaker may be inclined to investigate the situation themselves before involving law enforcement."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dovezile l-au implicat) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the criminal has surrendered himself, indicating that there are evidence or clues that have led to his capture. This suggests that someone else may have played a role in his capture, rather than him having no alibi. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Aevit cafeina) is more likely to be the cause of the man's weakness. The premise states that the man has become weaker after deciding to avoid caffeine, suggesting that caffeine was previously providing him with energy or stimulation. Therefore, it is more likely that his decision to avoid caffeine has caused him to feel weaker rather than his consumption of sweets.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fata a călcat pe gheaţă,"" option A (A alunecat) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (A woman has rings under her eyes) is a more likely cause of why she might be tired all night than option B (She put her son to sleep). The premise suggests that the woman may have dark circles or bags under her eyes due to lack of sleep or other factors, which could be caused by various reasons such as stress, fatigue, or poor sleep quality. It does not provide any information about putting the son to sleep, so it is less likely to be related to this action. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Vulcan erupted) is the correct answer. The premise states that lava is flowing out of the volcano, indicating an active eruption. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A wanted to leave from the party) is more likely. The sentence ""Femeia şi-a pus pantofii"" implies that she was getting ready to go somewhere, and the fact that she knew everyone at the party suggests that she had been there for a while. Therefore, it is more likely that she wanted to leave than that she knew everyone at the party."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (M-a reţinut la taxă) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (şi-a vândut acţiunile companiei) is more likely. The director has sold the company's shares, indicating that they have made a profit from their investment rather than losing money.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the man felt sick) is more likely. The premise does not provide any information about the doctor's whereabouts or circumstances that would suggest he was on vacation, so it is unlikely that option A (the doctor was on vacation) is true.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Casa era în flăcări) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A făcut un duş lung) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the boy's hands are stained with prunes. It is unlikely that he would have accidentally gotten his hands dirty with soap while washing them, especially since there is no mention of him doing so in the premise. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am scuipat laptele"", option A is more likely. The word ""scuipat"" means to spit or vomit in Romanian, indicating that the speaker may have tasted something sour or unpleasant. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Am întârziat la muncă) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the car was destroyed (Option B).
Response:  A) They have won.
"Response:  Option A: Am întors sticla.  
Explanation: The premise states that the liquid inside the bottle has spilled out through the cap, indicating that the bottle was turned upside down. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the boy climbed onto the roof (Option B). The phrase ""închis în afara casei"" implies that he was outside his house, and the sentence ""a târât printr-o fereastră deschisă"" would not make sense in this context as there are no open windows nearby. Therefore, Option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A sunat soneria"", option A (Visitor knocked at the door) is more likely."
Response:  Option B: A agățat-o în dulapul lui.
Response:  Option A - Pasta de dinti a iesit din tub.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that pacifists have organized a protest (Option A). The increase in civilian deaths during war suggests that there may be growing opposition to the conflict among non-combatants, leading them to take peaceful action such as organizing a protest or demonstration to express their concerns. This is more likely than pacifists organizing a parade, which might not necessarily convey a message of opposition to the war.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ea a legat panglica) is the more likely cause. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that ""she tied the knot"" is a more common way of expressing the idea of tying something tightly, rather than using a childish or playful phrase like ""rubanul părea copilăresc."" Therefore, option A is the better answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he has aged (Option A).
Response:  Option A: Oul a eclozat.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (The prisoner died of starvation) is correct. The premise states that the prisoner has died, and given the context of being imprisoned without food or water, it is plausible that the cause of death was starvation rather than escape. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul şi-a pierdut echilibrul pe scară,"" it is more likely that he has fallen off the ladder rather than having climbed up it. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) He has fallen off the ladder."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A luat o înghiţitură de suc) is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for why the child would have taken a sip of juice after burping. On the other hand, option B (A deschis cutia cu suc) does not provide any clear reason as to why the child would have opened a box of juice after burping. Therefore, option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Option B: Am tremurat.
Explanation: The premise states that ""a current has entered through the window,"" which implies that there was an external force acting upon the person. This could cause them to shake or tremble, making option B the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Colegii ei de clasă o respectau) is the correct answer. The premise states that the student received a scholarship to attend college, which suggests that they have been successful academically and are well-respected by their peers. This is consistent with Option A, but not necessarily with Option B (A avut note bune), as having good grades does not necessarily imply that one's classmates respect them.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Locuia alături de el) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Fata a făcut mişto de băiat"" suggests that the girl made something delicious for the boy, implying that she was living nearby or in close proximity to him. Option B (Ea a avut o pasiune pentru el) does not provide any information about their geographical location or proximity to each other, making it less likely as an explanation for why the girl made something delicious for the boy."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (El a incitat la milă) is more likely. The phrase ""flămând a furat"" means ""he stole with fire,"" implying that he took something without permission or rightfully belonging to someone else. This could be interpreted as stealing food from someone who cannot afford it, thus eliciting pity rather than sympathy for his financial situation. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mi-am sunat prietenul să vorbim,"" option A (Am vrut intimitate) is the most likely cause. The phrase suggests that the speaker wanted to talk to their friend in a private setting, implying that they desired intimacy or closeness with their friend."
Response:  Option A - I-am dat mâna.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (M-am ascuns) is the most likely cause for the frisbee to have flown towards my head. The phrase ""m-am ascuns"" means ""I was kidding,"" implying that the speaker did not actually throw the frisbee but rather pretended to do so in order to trick someone else. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fata s-a muşcat de unghii,"" option A (Era îngrijorată) is a more likely cause than option B (A fost surprinsă). The phrase ""s-a muşcat de unghii"" suggests that something has happened to her nails, which could be a source of concern or anxiety for her. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Am întors pagina din calendar) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""am întors pagina din calendar,"" which means I turned the page of my calendar, suggesting that I am looking at a new date or day. This implies that the event or appointment mentioned in the passage has already occurred or is scheduled for a future date, rather than marking the beginning of a new month. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Option B: A cerut divorțul.
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the husband will ask for a divorce rather than concluding his legal representation. The discovery of an extramarital affair can be a significant betrayal of trust in a marriage, leading to a breakdown in the relationship and potentially resulting in a divorce."
Response:  Option A - Mingea a sărit.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she made a mistake in her answer (Option A). Therefore, the correct choice is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (Adversary's attack hit the ground) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A: Erau coapte.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Am cules roşiile de pe viță,"" it is more likely that the speaker had a dream about red roses growing on life. The word ""coapte"" in Romanian means ""dreamed."" Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (S-a întâlnit cu fosta lui iubită la prânz) is more likely.
Response:  Option B: Vremea s-a încălzit.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Autostrada a devenit periculos de îngheţată) is more likely to occur as an effect of a tornado passing through the city. The other option, Option A (Acoperișul tribunalului a explodat), may not be directly related to a tornado's passage.
"Response: 
A) Notele lui s-au îmbunătățit."

Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that adding sugar to coffee will make it taste sweeter (Option B).
Response:  Option B - A distrus hârtiile.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Cârligul a intrat în lemn) is more likely. The word ""ciocan"" in Romanian means both ""mallet"" or ""hammer"", but also ""wooden mallet"". Therefore, it's possible that the speaker has entered into wood with a wooden mallet, rather than becoming rusted."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Peştele a muşcat coarda"", option A is more likely. The word ""muşcat"" means ""bitten"" in Romanian, so it's likely that the fish bit the line rather than the fisherman repairing the line."
"Response:  Option B: Şi-a scos aparatul.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the adolescent did not want to go to school. Therefore, it is more likely that they took their phone with them instead of leaving it at home."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Expresia feţii mele s-a luminat,"" option A (Am primit veşti bune) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A: Prosopul era ud.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Mi-am şters mâinile cu un prosop,"" which means I wiped my hands with a towel. If the towel was dirty or had something sticky on it, it would be more likely for me to say ""Am mâinile ude"" (I have dirty hands) than ""Prosopul era ud"" (The towel was dirty). Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the scaun se clătina sub el) is the more likely cause. The premise states that the man has lost his balance, indicating that he may have been knocked or pushed off balance, rather than simply spilling paint on the seat. Therefore, it is more likely that the scaun se clătina sub el due to an external force rather than a simple accident with the paint.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that they have lost the game rather than their coach canceling practice. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am cerut iertare,"" option A is more likely. The correct answer is (A) Am regretat greşeala mea."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Asked questions about her) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Fata a zâmbit,"" Option A is more likely. The phrase ""a zâmbit"" means ""to become angry"" or ""to be annoyed."" Therefore, option A, ""Obrajii ei au roşcat,"" which translates to ""Their eyes have turned red,"" is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (A trecut peste mina) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""Nava inamic a explodat"" suggests that an enemy ship has been destroyed, and the word ""trecut"" implies that it passed over or through something. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul şi-a înţepat piciorul,"" it is more likely that he stepped on a sharp object (Option B)."
"Response: 
A) Au descoperit identitatea criminalului."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am luat-o pe o cale de cotitură) is more likely. The sentence suggests that there was a lot of traffic on the highway, so it would be more practical to take a detour rather than asking for a ride.
"Response:  Option B: Mulţi oameni s-au confruntat cu şomajul.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""economia naŢiunii a scăzut,"" indicating a decline in the economy of the nation. This can lead to job loss and unemployment, making option B more likely than option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (They were on their way to cross the street) is more likely. The passage states that they were ""pe cale să intre în traficul din partea cealaltă,"" indicating that they were in the process of crossing the street when they were recognized by someone from their neighborhood."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mi-a spus adevărul) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B - Şoferul a luat un autostopist.  
Explanation: The premise states that the car has run out of fuel, indicating that it cannot move forward. Therefore, option B, where the driver took an autostop, is more likely as they would need to stop somewhere for help or transportation. Option A, where the driver was left stranded on the road, does not make sense in this context."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the child was delivered) is true. The phrase ""femeia a intrat în travaliu"" suggests that the woman has entered labor, indicating that she is about to give birth to a child. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (The wind took the man's hat) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the wind was responsible for taking the man's hat, rather than someone or something else. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (received an invitation) is the correct answer. The premise states that Fata participated in the party for her classmate's birthday, indicating that she was invited to attend. It does not mention anything about buying a gift, which suggests that receiving an invitation is the more likely explanation.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mama lui i-a luat temperatura) is correct. The phrase ""fruntea băiatului era fierbinte"" suggests that the boy's forehead was hot, indicating a fever. Taking his temperature would be a logical course of action to determine the severity of the fever and provide appropriate treatment. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Option A (A wanted to impress his partner).
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Am luat o lopăt) is more likely to cause a blackout because it involves disrupting or removing an electrical conductor, such as a wire or cable, that carries current from one point to another in an electrical circuit. This can effectively ""cut off"" the flow of electricity and result in a blackout. Option A (Am căutat o lanțǎ) does not directly affect the flow of electricity and is therefore less likely to cause a blackout."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the son has graduated from high school) is the correct answer. The premise does not provide any indication of multiple births or other significant life events that could lead to a family moving into a larger house. Therefore, the most logical explanation for the change in living situation is that the son has completed his education and the family has upgraded their housing accordingly.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Marathon runner went slowly) is more likely as it explains why the marathon runner would want to conserve their energy during the race.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Mașina a scuipat restul) is the most likely cause. The boy hitting the vending machine would not result in the remaining products being scattered across the floor.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Mi-am întors ochii la el) is more likely. The speaker's reaction to their friend's dog dying is more likely to be sadness or melancholy than an emotional outburst of joy upon seeing their friend again.
Response:  Option B: A plâtit cu bani gheață.
"Response:  Option A: Și-a tăiat unghiile. (He cut off his fingers.)
Explanation: The premise ""Omul blestemat"" suggests that something bad has happened to a person, and cutting off one's own fingers is an extreme and unlikely action that would not be taken by someone who is simply hit on their finger. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option A - Fratele lui s-a certat cu părinții lor.
"Response:  Option B: S-auitat la stele.
Explanation: According to the premise, Fata wants to learn about the solar system. Looking at stars (option B) is not a feasible way for her to do this, as stars are much farther away than the planets in our solar system. Therefore, option A, going to the library, is the most likely choice for Fata to learn about the solar system."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Am pus posterul deasupra uşii) caused the poster to remain on the wall. This is because placing the poster above the door would make it less likely for it to be blown away by the wind. Option B (Am pus bandă pe spatele posterului) does not provide any information about how the poster was placed or where it was located, so it cannot be determined whether it would have prevented the poster from remaining on the wall.
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (Arhitectul a ajustat planurile) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the premise provided. The client has approved the architect's plans for the building, indicating that the architect made changes or adjustments to the original design before construction began.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul a scăpat lingura,"" option A is more likely. The word ""tremura"" means to shake or tremble, so it makes sense that the man's hand would be shaking after he escaped from the bear's jaws. Option B does not make as much logical sense, as there is no context for why the man would have licked his own tongue."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Consiliul de administrație a dizolvat compania) is more likely. The director general has resigned, indicating that there may be a leadership crisis or a lack of confidence in the company's management. In this scenario, it is more likely that the board of directors would dissolve the company rather than find an replacement for the departed director general.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (M-am apropiat de podium) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (A atacat un colog de inchisoare) is more likely. The fact that he was ""eliberated"" from prison suggests that he may have been released early for good behavior or as part of a plea deal, rather than having his sentence reduced through financial means. Additionally, the mention of him attacking a colleague in prison implies that he may have had some sort of conflict with another inmate, which could have led to his release."
"Response:  Option B: Casa lor a luat foc. (Their house caught fire.)
Explanation: The phrase ""Familia a pierdut toate bunurile"" suggests that they have lost everything, including their home. Therefore, option B is more likely as it implies that their house caught fire, resulting in them losing their belongings."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the container was recycled rather than being crushed. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
A) A învățat să folosească un calculator. 
Explanation: According to the premise, Fata has joined a debate team. This implies that she has learned how to communicate effectively through speech and argumentation, rather than simply learning how to use a computer. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Am ascultat muzică) led to an improvement in my mood than option B (Am spălat vasele). This is because listening to music has been shown to have a positive impact on mental health and well-being, while washing dishes may not necessarily have this effect. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Option B - They have held a charity event.
"Response:  Option B: Pasagerii au ţipat.  
Explanation: The premise states that the roller coaster has crashed down a steep drop, which would be a frightening experience for passengers. Therefore, option B is more likely as passengers are likely to shout or scream in fear rather than laugh during such an incident."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Eram furios,"" option B is more likely. When you say ""Am trântit uşa"" (I slammed the door), it implies that you were angry or upset, which fits with the premise of being furious. Option A does not convey this same emotion."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (S-a trezit devreme) is more likely. The premise states that the man wanted to see sunrise, which means he was waiting for it to happen. Therefore, it is more likely that he woke up early than traveled north.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am îndoit hârtia,"" option A is more likely. The word ""îndoi"" means to burn or to char, so it's likely that the paper has been burned rather than simply being recycled or getting wet."
"Response:  Option B: Liderii altor țări au trimis ajutoare de urgență.  
Explanation: Given the premise of a devastating natural disaster, it is more likely that other countries would send aid rather than form an alliance to address the crisis. This option better aligns with the scenario presented in the premise."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the boy's clothes were washed (Option A) than that he fell into the pool (Option B). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Trebuia să fie returnată la bibliotecă) is more likely. The student has to return the book to the library because it was borrowed from there and needs to be returned according to the due date. Option B (A împrumutat-o de la un prieten) does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the student borrowed the book from a friend.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the criminal was executed rather than sent to prison. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am deschis draperiile) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I-a căzut peruca) is more likely. The phrase ""am tras de păr impostorul"" suggests that something has happened to the person's hair, and ""peruca"" means wig in Romanian. Therefore, it is more likely that the person has lost their own hair and is now wearing a wig."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A found the manuscript convincing) is more likely. The editor's decision to reformulate the sentence suggests that they were impressed by the quality of the writing and saw potential for improvement rather than confusion or uncertainty about the meaning of the original sentence.
"Response:  Option A: Ea a realizat că cardul lipsea.  
Explanation: The premise states that the woman has cancelled her credit card account. This implies that she no longer had access to the card, which means it was not present or missing. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option B: S-au căsătorit.
Response:  Option A - Am ridicat volumul.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Părul băiatului era ridicat,"" it is more likely that option A (Fata a făcut-o) is correct, as the word ""era"" implies an action in the past tense, suggesting that someone (the girl) did something to raise the boy's hair. Option B (Fata atras-o) does not fit with the context of the sentence and seems less plausible."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (M-am împrăştiat cu insecticid) is the correct answer. The use of ""strivit"" suggests that something has been harmed or killed, which aligns with the definition of insecticide as a substance used to kill insects. Option B (Am călcat pe gândac) does not provide any evidence to suggest that the gander was harmed or killed, and instead implies that the speaker accidentally stepped on the bird."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am deschis ochii,"" option A (M-am trezit) is more likely to be the correct answer because it means ""I have opened my eyes."""
Response:  Option B - Am cerut să împrumot CD-ul de la el.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he was frugal with his earnings) is the correct answer. The passage states that the man lived in poverty, indicating that he did not have a high income. Therefore, it is unlikely that he earned enough to meet the minimum wage requirement. Instead, he may have been careful with how he spent his limited resources, suggesting that he was frugal with his earnings.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A căutat de lucru) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Vopseaua a become green) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Conversation became tense) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I have received him at home) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Cortina de pe scenă s-a ridicat."", option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Răpitorul a amenințat să-i rănească pe ostaticul) is more likely. The fact that the abductor threatened to harm the hostage suggests that they may have been motivated by a desire for power or control rather than simply wanting to isolate them. This could indicate that the abduction was not just about escaping detection but also about exerting influence over others through fear and intimidation. Therefore, option A is more plausible given this information.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Muzicianul a bătut cu piciorul) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Copilul era speriat să se uite sub patul ei.  
Explanation: The premise states that the parents rushed into their child's room, indicating a sense of urgency or concern. Option B better fits this scenario as it suggests that the child was scared to look under their bed, which could be a common fear for children. Option A does not fit well with the given information as it implies that the child woke up crying after a nightmare, which may not necessarily involve looking under the bed."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she was born prematurely) is the correct answer. The premise states that she communicates through sign language, which suggests that she may have developmental delays or challenges related to her premature birth. While being born deaf can also result in communication difficulties, it is less likely given the context of the situation. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why she communicates through sign language.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Apa a devenit contaminată) is more likely. The premise mentions that there was a drought in the region, which could lead to water scarcity and contamination of the water source. It does not mention anything about crop failures or death, which suggests that option B (Culturile au murit) is less likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Pisica a urmărit pasărea,"" it is more likely that option B will occur - ""Pasărea a prins unvierme."" The wording of the premise suggests that the cat was chasing the bird, so it is reasonable to assume that the bird may have tried to defend itself by catching an insect or other small creature."
"Response:  Option A: Şcoala a ieşit pentru vară.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Fata a schimbat şcoala."" This implies that the girl changed schools, which is more likely to happen during the summer break than for any other reason. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Angajații au intrat în grevă.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the proprietor has refused to increase wages for employees. This means that there may be dissatisfaction among workers regarding their pay, leading them to consider taking collective action such as going on strike or entering into a work stoppage, known as a ""grevă"". Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option A: Extremiştii l-au influenţat.  
Explanation: The premise states that the leader has antagonized extremism in his country, suggesting that he may have contributed to or encouraged extremist views rather than being directly influenced by them. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Option B - Valurile s-au ciocnit de-a lungul ţărmului.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Am mers desculț pe plajă"", which means ""I walked barefoot on the beach"". This implies that the speaker was standing or walking on the sandy surface of the beach. As a result, option B, ""Valurile s-au ciocnit de-a lungul Ţărmului"", which means ""The waves crashed against the shore"", is more likely to occur as the speaker would have been in close proximity to the water's edge."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Am băut un pahar cu apă) is more likely to make me feel warmer as drinking water can help regulate body temperature. Option A (Mi-am pus pantaloni de sport) may actually make me feel colder due to the constrictive nature of tight clothing.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (Fiul ei a zâmbit) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Mama a tăcut fiul ei"" implies that the mother was silent or didn't speak to her son, and the fact that he smiled suggests that he was happy or content despite this silence."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am închis fermoarul la blugi) is the most likely cause of the problem. The fact that the speaker mentions ""ruptă"" in blugi suggests that there may have been a sudden and unexpected failure of some kind, rather than a gradual mistake like getting lost or tripping over something. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker accidentally closed the zipper while putting on their pants, rather than causing themselves to trip or get lost."
"Response:  Option B: Dinţii lui au devenit drepţi.  
Explanation: The premise states that the boy wore an orthopedic device, indicating that he may have had a physical disability or deformity. Given this information, it is more likely that his teeth became crooked due to his condition rather than him having a successful career."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (M-am trezit azi cu o durere de gât) is more likely because it suggests that the speaker experienced discomfort or pain in their neck after engaging in physical activity at the gym yesterday. The premise does not provide any information about muscle soreness, which makes option A less likely.
"Response:  Option B: Alți elevi de la masa de prânz s-au simţit lăsaţi în afara.  
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the other students at the table felt left out rather than the new student feeling uncomfortable. The fact that the new student was whispering to himself suggests that he may have been lost in thought or trying to process his surroundings, rather than intentionally excluding others. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for how the other students at the table felt."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A sărit înapoi în aer) is more likely.
Response:  Option A - Poşta a livrat scrisoarea.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (The player was doubtful) is more likely. The player did not place all their money on a single bet, indicating that they were hesitant or uncertain about their chances of winning. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Vânturile au devenit mai puternice) is more likely to be the cause of the spreading focus of attention in the forest. The wind becoming stronger could potentially disperse seeds or spark a fire that attracts attention, leading to a shift in the focus of the animals' attention. Option B (Arsorii au fost prinşi) does not provide an explanation for why the focus of attention would change in the forest.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mama lui a pus un bandaj pe rană) is more likely.
Response:  Option A (Și-a semnat testamentul) is more likely based on the information provided in the premise. The fact that the man has survived an incurable disease suggests that he may have accepted his fate and prepared for death by signing his will. This option aligns better with the given information than the other choice, which implies that he received an organ transplant without any explanation as to how or why this happened.
Response:  Option B - Mi-am ars limba (My tongue has burned).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Scriitoarea a evitat prejudecăţile în poveştile ei) is more likely. The editor has granted the writer permission to write about sensitive topics, suggesting that the writer has been able to avoid controversial or offensive themes in their work.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am dormit toată ziua) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker has been feeling exhausted due to oversleeping.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, option A (Ea a identificat simptomele pacientului) is the more likely cause. The passage states that ""Medicul a diagnosticat pacientul,"" indicating that the doctor has diagnosed the patient, and then lists symptoms that the patient is experiencing. This suggests that the doctor has identified the patient's symptoms and is trying to determine their cause, rather than simply prescribing medication without understanding the underlying issue. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (It was raining) is a more plausible explanation for why she got wet than option B (She was eaten). Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Era transpirat.
"Response:  Option B: A suferit un atac de cord.  
Explanation: The premise states that the man has been subjected to an emergency operation, which suggests that he may have suffered a serious medical condition requiring immediate attention. Given this context, it is more likely that the man has suffered a heart attack (atac de cord) rather than losing his balance (şi-a pierdut cumpătul)."
"Response:  Option A: Şi-a flexionat braţele.  
Explanation: According to the premise, ""Muşchii brațului omului au fost umflati,"" which means that the muscles of the arm have been inflated. Flexing one's arms would involve contracting the muscles in the arm to lift or bend it, which could potentially lead to inflammation or swelling. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul şi-a ridicat sprâncenele,"" option A (A fost surprins) is a more likely cause than option B (S-a simţit descurajat). This is because the phrase ""omul şi-a ridicat sprâncenele"" suggests that the man was taken aback or surprised by something, rather than feeling discouraged."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am crezut că intenţiile lui erau bune) is more likely. The speaker seems to have had a positive impression of their colleague's intentions initially, but then realized that they were mistaken or misled. This suggests that the speaker may have overestimated their colleague's abilities or goodwill.

"Response:  Option B: Omul pierdea jocul.  
Explanation: The premise states that the arrow missed its target, indicating that the person shooting the arrow was not accurate or skilled enough to hit their target. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause, as it suggests that the person lost the game due to their inability to accurately shoot the arrow."
"Response:  Option A (A descoperit şobolani în subsol)
Explanation: The premise states that the owner of the house called an exterminator because he found termites in his basement. This suggests that there are likely to be termites present in the house, rather than just a few furniture bugs. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I was too tired to cook something) is more likely. The author mentions that they were too tired to prepare anything, indicating that they did not have enough energy or motivation to make dinner for their guest. This suggests that option A is the most plausible explanation for why the author suggested going out to eat instead of preparing food at home.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - A începe să ascunde jurnalul.  
Explanation: The premise states that the prince found his sister's journal, implying that he has access to it. If he finds something incriminating or embarrassing in her journal, he may try to hide it from others by keeping it for himself. This option aligns better with the given information than Option B, where she starts a new journal without any context provided in the premise."
Response:  Option A: She worked overtime to pay for rent.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (A atins Sobă Fierbinte) is more likely. The premise states that Manā's power was quickly withdrawn, indicating that it did not have enough time to take full effect. Therefore, option A, which suggests that Manā accidentally hit something hot, is more plausible than option B, which implies that she scratched her own head.
"Response: 
Option B: Au distribuşt un sondaj clienţilor.
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the company distributed a survey to its customers rather than offering a discount to new clients. The purpose of the survey would be to gather feedback from existing customers in order to measure their satisfaction, whereas offering a discount to new clients may not provide as much insight into customer satisfaction."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the boy threw the pillow off the couch (Option A). The reason for this is that throwing something off an elevated surface like a couch is more likely than dragging a heavy piece of furniture like a chair across the floor (Option B).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mi-am protejat faţa,"" option A is the correct answer. The phrase ""m-a batjocorit"" means ""has insulted/ mocked me."" Therefore, the most likely cause for protecting one's face is that someone has insulted or mocked them."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (he was struck by lightning) is more likely as it provides an explanation for how the statue came to be in its current state. The other option does not provide any logical reasoning or evidence to support why people would come to worship a statue that has been damaged by lightning. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Fructele se Dezvolta) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ballet dancer tore a ligament) is the correct answer. The mention of ""degetele de la picioare"" (toes) suggests that the injury occurred in the foot or ankle area, which is consistent with a torn ligament. Option B (She twisted her knee) does not provide any specific details that suggest an injury to the foot or ankle area. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A alergat pe terenul de joacă) is more likely because it suggests that the child has been engaging in physical activity, which could have caused them to get tired quickly. Option A (a învățat cum să le lege) does not provide any information about the child's physical activity level or fatigue.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Am pierdut noţiunea timpului) is more likely. The premise suggests that the protagonist has become so captivated by the card game that they have lost track of time, indicating a state of absorption or obsession. This aligns better with Option B than Option A, where the protagonist simply returns the card.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the man's beliefs were influenced by his parents rather than being rejected by them. The passage states that the man had ""credinţe asemănătoare"" with those of his parents, indicating a similarity or resemblance between their beliefs. This suggests that the man was exposed to and adopted his parents' beliefs, rather than rejecting them. Therefore, Option A (Parents influenced him) is the more likely answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the car ran out of gas) caused the car to slow down and eventually stop. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Option A: Îngheţata şi-a pierdut gustul.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the man has eaten ice cream in the sun, which means that it has probably melted. As a result, the ice cream would have lost its flavor, making option A the most likely answer."

"Response:  Option A: Proprietarul a certat cățelușul.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the cat has scratched the carpet. As a result, the owner is likely to scold or reprimand the cat rather than giving it a treat. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Prietenul meu a devenit furios) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Avea un rucsac) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides additional context that helps narrow down the possibilities. The fact that the man stood out in the crowd suggests that he was noticeable or distinctive in some way, which could be due to many factors such as his clothing, behavior, or appearance. Having a backpack would not necessarily make him stand out in a crowded area unless it was particularly large or eye-catching, whereas wearing a brightly colored vest might draw attention to himself. Therefore, option A is the better choice based on the provided details.
"Response:  Option B: A fost acuzat de sperjur.
Explanation: According to the premise, the witness has lied under oath. This means that they have given false testimony, which can lead to accusations of perjury. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Option B: Voia să se amestece.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman dye her hair, which implies that she wants to change its appearance. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that she wants to mix or blend different shades of hair color."
"Response:  Option B: Au fost deportaţi.  
Explanation: The premise states that immigrants were caught in the country illegally. Deportation is a common consequence of being caught in a country without proper documentation or visas. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the audience will laugh (Option A).
"Response:  Option B - Soarele mi-a bronzat pielea.
Explanation: The premise ""M-am uitat în soare"" implies that the speaker has been exposed to sunlight for an extended period of time. This suggests that the second option, ""Soarele mi-a bronzat pielea,"" is a more likely outcome than the first option, ""Soarele m-a orbit."" While it is theoretically possible for planets to orbit around the Sun, it is much more common and plausible for people's skin to be affected by exposure to sunlight. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Option B: Am bâzâit.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Cuțitul era plictisitor) is more likely to be the cause of difficulty in cutting the friptura. The use of the word ""plictisitor"" suggests that the knife was boring or uninteresting to cut with, rather than the friptura being raw or undercooked."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (She received food assistance) is the correct answer. The premise states that she declared bankruptcy, which means she may have had financial difficulties and was unable to pay her debts. Receiving food assistance would be one way for her to meet her basic needs while dealing with these financial challenges. Option B (She accumulated massive debt) does not align with this scenario as it implies that she has taken on excessive debt without any mention of financial difficulties.
"Response:  Option B: M-am hotărît să-i fac o vizită.  
Explanation: Based on the premise that Lumina din apartamentul prietenului meu era aprinsă, it is more likely that you would want to visit your friend's apartment to check if everything is okay rather than wondering if they have left the light on."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am pus floarea sub nasul meu,"" option B is more likely. The speaker has smelled the flower rather than having petals fall from it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Female protagonist has a nostalgic moment) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise does not provide any information that would suggest the female protagonist had children or was in contact with them recently enough for her to have called them. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why she might be feeling nostalgic.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that option A (the student submitted the work earlier) is correct. The text states that the student ""a amânat"" the assignment, which means he/she delayed or postponed submitting it. This implies that the student had enough time to complete the assignment before the deadline but chose to delay submission for some reason. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mi s-a stricat maşina"", option B (Am chemat un mecanic) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (the ticket was anonymous) is the correct answer. This is because the author states that ""am aruncat biletul"" which means ""I threw away the ticket,"" implying that the ticket was not legible or identifiable. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the ticket could not be used."
"Response:  Option B: A urcat în sus.
Explanation: The premise ""Păsarea şi-a batut aripile"" means that the bird flapped its wings. This action would cause the bird to rise into the air, making option B (the bird urcat în sus) the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that garajul era deschis (Garage was open). This is because if the garage were full, it would be unlikely for someone to park in the alleys. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (Victim has raised hands) is more likely to be true because if the criminal had pointed the gun towards the victim, it would have been difficult for the victim to raise their hands.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Am plănuit să particip la înmormântarea unchiului meu) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Am fost visător) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker seems to be struggling with a philosophical concept of time, suggesting that they may have been lost in thought or daydreaming. This is further supported by the line ""am pierdut noţiunea timpului,"" which translates to ""I lost the notion of time."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker was simply lost in thought rather than experiencing a physical discomfort like nausea."
"Response:  Option B: Amprenta era fără hârtie.  
Explanation: According to the premise, the document was printed without ink. Therefore, it is more likely that there was no ink available for printing rather than the printer being lacking in cerneală."
Response:  Option A: Fanii s-au întors spre steag.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that option A (Am servit-o) will occur. The phrase ""Gustul de băutură era bland"" suggests that the drink was too sweet or lacking in flavor, so adding something to enhance its taste would be a more plausible solution than putting salt in it, which would make it even worse. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the prosopium has absorbed the liquid (Option A). The phrase ""pe scurgere"" suggests that the surface of something (probably the prosopium) has come into contact with a liquid, and the fact that there is no residue left behind implies that the liquid has been fully absorbed by the prosopium. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Option A - She marked her page.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Omul s-a uitat pe fereastră) is more likely because it suggests that the person is looking outside rather than focusing on their own safety.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the girl ignored him (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (I-au amputat piciorul) is correct. The premise states that doctors have given the patient a ""membrane,"" which implies that they have removed or amputated something from the patient's body. Amputation of a limb is a serious surgical procedure, so this option is more plausible than option B (Ei au monitorizat semnele ei vitale), which simply means that doctors are monitoring the patient's vital signs."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she raised her shoulders at him (Option A).
"Response:  Option B: Ştiam că am avut dreptate.
Explanation: The correct answer is option B because it better fits the context of the premise. The speaker is looking for their friend's opinion, but they already know they are right, so they don't need to appreciate their friend's opinion. Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  Option A - Lampa i s-a lipit de pantofii. (The lamp got stuck to the shoes.)
Response:  Option A (Şcolile au fost închise)
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Amenințat că va demisiona) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Copacul a căzut pe acoperiș) is the more likely cause of the damage to the house. The premise states that the copac has deteriorated the house, implying that it has fallen or collapsed onto the roof, causing damage. Option B (Copacul umbra curtea din spate) does not directly imply any physical contact between the tree and the house, making it less likely as a cause for the damage.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Am lovit cu toporul lemnul) is more likely. The premise states that the subject has been split into two pieces, indicating that something has hit or cut the wood. Option A (Am pus lemnele în şemineu) does not make sense in this context as it would not explain why the wood was split into two pieces. Therefore, option B is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the couple has announced their separation) is more likely to be the cause of the family's happiness. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (she liked him) is true. The fact that she sent a Valentine's Day card to the boy suggests that she had a positive feeling towards him, rather than simply kissing him without any particular affection. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (Am been confused) is the correct answer. The speaker states that they were ""confused"" by their friend's declaration, indicating that they did not understand or agree with what was said. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Au vrut să găsească un compromis) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A sunat cronometrul din bucătărie,"" option B (Omul a scos pizza din cuptor) is more likely. The premise suggests that something has happened in the kitchen, and since pizza is typically cooked in an oven, it is more likely that the man removed a freshly baked pizza from the oven rather than putting food in the fridge."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A a muncit din greu) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (Fiul său a moştenit averea) will occur. The phrase ""a murit de bătrâneţe"" suggests that the wealthy man has passed away, and his son has inherited his wealth."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Femeia a călcat în flăcări,"" option A (Flăcările s-au stins) is the most likely outcome. The phrase suggests that something has been extinguished or reduced in intensity, rather than something new appearing."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (I-au revocat permisul de conducere) is more likely to be the cause of the woman's absence from work. The premise mentions that she was at home, implying that she did not go to work due to a personal reason rather than an external factor such as an accident. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that you missed breakfast (Option B). The sentence ""Am dormit până la alarmă"" means ""I slept until my alarm,"" indicating that you overslept and missed your breakfast."
"Response:  Option A: Camerele de filmat au fost îndreptate spre el. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""the public persona has come out of the limousine,"" implying that there are cameras present to capture his image. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that the cameras were directed towards him."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Apa de baie a become vague) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A has studied engineering) is more likely. The student's desire to meet other students from the campus suggests that they are interested in socializing and networking, which is a common aspect of college life. Studying engineering may provide opportunities for collaboration or group projects with other students in the same field, increasing the likelihood of meeting new people. In contrast, joining a fraternity may not necessarily lead to interactions with other students outside of the organization.
Response:  Option B: Am fost rearanjarea living (I was rearranging the living room).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Vieasa a zburat spre băiat,"" it is more likely that the bee flew towards the boy. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Femiea was sentenced to death (Option B). The sentence of ""muncă în folosul comunității"" (work in the benefit of the community) does not seem to be a suitable punishment for a crime as severe as adultery."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the zahar will dissolve in the hot tea rather than the tea being made with steam. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: A was injured in battle.  
Explanation: The premise states that the veteran is a ""şchiopăta,"" which is Romanian for ""shrapnel wound."" This implies that the person was injured during combat, rather than being recruited for war. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Poliția a fost la victim) is true. The fact that the criminal has fled from the police suggests that they were at the scene of the crime and are now trying to evade detection. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Mi-a căzut) is the correct answer. The laptop not turning on suggests that there may have been physical damage to the device, such as a drop or impact, which could prevent it from functioning properly. It is less likely that option B (Am încărcat-o) would be the correct answer without any additional context or evidence suggesting otherwise.
"Response:  Option A (Ea a dobândit o garderobă extinsă).
Explanation: The premise states that she has lost her place in the wardrobe, indicating that there are now more clothes than before. This suggests that she has acquired new items to add to her wardrobe, rather than simply rearranging or folding her existing clothes differently. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul a fost cu inima frântă"", option B (Soţia l-a părăsit) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""inima frântă"" suggests that the man's heart has been broken or shattered, which could be caused by his wife leaving him. Therefore, option B is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the offer of employment was canceled) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (El a salutat publicul) is more likely than option B (A vorbit în microfon). The premise states that ""vocea acestui om se auzea în toată sala,"" indicating that his voice was audible throughout the room, suggesting that he spoke aloud rather than using a microphone. Therefore, option A is the more likely answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the coin has fallen to the bottom of the well (Option A).
Response:  Option A - Mingea a intrat în gaură.
"Response:  Based on the Romanian sentence structure and grammar rules, option A (Am sughit) is the correct answer. The verb ""sughit"" in this context means to breathe deeply or to take a deep breath, so it fits better with the given premise than option B (""am strănitat""). Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Clientul şi-a lăsat farurile aprinse) is more likely. The fact that the store's safe has rung suggests that someone has entered it without authorization, which is consistent with the client leaving their keys unattended. Using false money is less likely in this scenario as there would be no obvious reason for the client to leave their keys in the store.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Gunoil has made the kitchen smell bad) is more likely. The premise states that ""Am scos gunoiul,"" indicating that Gunoil was responsible for making the kitchen smell bad. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A: Copiii au admirat animalele. 
Explanation: The premise states that familia was at the zoo, indicating that they were there to observe and appreciate the animals. Therefore, option A is more likely as it implies that the children admired the animals rather than just watching them."
"Response:  Option B: Plamanii lui erau congestați.  
Explanation: The premise states that a person's breathing was noisy, indicating that his lungs were congested. This is a more plausible explanation for why a person's breathing would be noisy than the alternative option of his riniche (alveoli) having given up."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (L-am întrebat pe prietenul meu dacă e interesat să meargă) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is asking their friend if they are interested in going to the concert with them, rather than asking for directions to the venue.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option B, ""Am deschis ferestrele,"" will have a greater impact on the temperature of the house than option A, ""Am adus pături."" This is because opening windows allows for increased airflow into the house, which can help to cool down the space more effectively than adding extra blankets."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Băiatul are dureri de spate,"" option A is more likely. The fact that the boy's backpack was open suggests that he may have accidentally dropped something heavy inside, causing discomfort or pain in his back. This is a more plausible explanation for the boy's back pain than option B, which simply states that the boy's backpack was heavy without providing any additional context or details."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (I-am made my mother a cake) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the albatross attacked the gardener) caused the destruction of the narcissus in the garden. The reason for this is not specified in the premise, but it is mentioned that an albatross attacked the gardener, which could potentially damage or destroy plants in the garden. On the other hand, Option B (vervets digging up bulbs) does not provide a clear explanation as to why the narcissus were destroyed in the garden.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am lovit chibritul"", option A (Flacăra s-a stins) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. The parties in conflict have reached an understanding, indicating that they are willing to work towards repairing their relationship rather than avoiding further discussion in court.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (parents have died) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the phrase ""copiii au fost trimişi la un orfelinat"" implies that the children were sent to an orphanage, which suggests that they are no longer under the care of their parents. This implies that the parents have passed away, rather than having simply abandoned their children."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A: A avut loc un tsunami will occur. The reason for this is that an asteroid impact in the ocean can cause massive waves to form, leading to a tsunami. This is not directly related to precipitation or weather conditions such as heavy rain with hail. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the given information.
"Response:  Option B: A intrat în panică.  
Explanation: The premise states that the traveler has encountered a poisonous snake, indicating that they are in danger. In this situation, it is more likely for the traveler to become panicked than to become dehydrated."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am pornit cuptorul) is more likely to be the correct answer because it implies that the speaker turned on the oven, which could have caused the temperature inside the oven to rise. Option B (Am pus farfuria în cuptor) means ""I put the bread in the oven,"" but does not imply any action related to turning on the oven."
Response:  Option A - Lămâia s-a mucegăit.
"Response: Ţara a colonizat pământul.  
Reasoning: The premise states that ""Ţara a descoperit noi teritorii,"" indicating the discovery of new lands or territories. This suggests that Ţara has expanded its borders and colonized new areas, rather than abandoning the old ones. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (A has atherized in a pile of clothes) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the mixture was uneven) is more likely to be the cause of the problem.
Response:  Option B: Tatăl avea încredere în fiul său.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Capul omului a pulsat de durere,"" it is more likely that Option B (A took aspirin) will occur. Aspirin is commonly used to relieve headache pain, so taking it in this situation makes more sense than taking a cough syrup for a tussive condition."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Trenul a încetnit,"" option A is more likely. The sentence implies that the train has slowed down, which could be due to it approaching a station or being delayed by an issue with the tracks or another train ahead of it. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the train has come to a stop."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the mental illness was inherited) than option B (he was diagnosed with depression). The phrase ""a family history of mental illness"" suggests that the condition may have been passed down through generations, making inheritance a more plausible explanation for the man's current state."
"Response:  Option B: S-a sufocat cu mâncarea.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Femeia s-a apucat de găt."" This implies that she grabbed something to eat, which suggests that option B is more likely. Option A does not fit with the context provided in the premise."
"Response:  Option B: Vorbea cu accent. 
Explanation: The premise states that the woman has a headache, which suggests that she may be speaking in a slow or slurred manner due to her discomfort. This would make option B (speaking with an accent) more likely than option A (having a loud voice)."
"Response: 
A) Salivated"
"Response:  Option B: Ea a devenit bogată.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Afacerea femeii a avut succes"", which implies that she became wealthy as a result of her business's success. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (A sunat clopotul) is more likely to be the cause of the students leaving class. The premise states that ""Elevii au ieșit din clasă,"" indicating that a group of students left class, which could be due to various reasons such as boredom or disinterest in the lesson but not necessarily because their teacher gave them an assignment. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Cunoscuşii ei au legătură cu ea) is more likely. The fact that she has seen a ghost suggests that there may be something unusual or supernatural about her experience, and it's possible that her friends have some connection to this phenomenon as well. Option A (Cunoscuşii ei au exprimat scepticism) does not necessarily contradict the idea of a supernatural occurrence, but it does suggest that they are skeptical of her claim, which could be due to various reasons such as lack of evidence or personal beliefs.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Aproape s-a înecat în ocean) is more likely. The premise states that the man has lost his hearing, which suggests that he may have been in close proximity to loud noises or water, leading him to lose his hearing. Being near an explosion would not necessarily result in losing one's hearing, but being submerged in water for an extended period of time could potentially lead to this outcome. Therefore, option A is the more likely choice based on the information given in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the balloon has risen into the air (Option B). The fact that the pilot let go of the rope suggests that he or she no longer had control over the balloon, which would make it unlikely for the balloon to have frozen in mid-air (Option A).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the person had an attack of cerebral) is the correct answer. The premise states that the person has lost the ability to speak, which could be caused by an attack or injury to the brain rather than simply breathing deeply.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she was distracted by something (Option B) than there being a crack in the sidewalk (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Salvamotorul a sărit după el."" will occur. The reason being that when someone throws a ball into a pool of water, it tends to float on the surface, and a motor cannot jump after something that is floating in water. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Am luat antibiotice,"" it is more likely that option A (Infecția mea s-a vindecat) will occur."
Response:  Option A (şoferul a apăsat frâna).
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Am înmuiat recipientul în apă caldă) is a more plausible explanation for why the container filled with plastic has melted. This is because water at room temperature would not be hot enough to melt plastic, but rather than soak it or soften it slightly. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A (Şoferul a lovit un stâlp de telefon).
Explanation: The premise states that ""Maşina a fost înţepată,"" which implies that something hit the car. Since the driver did not pass through a red light, option B is unlikely. Moreover, hitting a traffic signal pole is a common occurrence in accidents involving cars getting struck by other objects, such as trees or poles falling onto the road due to strong winds or storms. Therefore, option A is more plausible."
Response:  Option B: A trecut examenul. (A passed the exam.)
"Response:  Option A: Se temea să înveţe să înoate.  
Explanation: The boy was afraid to learn how to swim because he thought it would be too difficult for him. This option better fits with the premise provided."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Mi-am simţit inima bătând) is a more likely explanation for how someone might feel when they put their hand on their chest. This phrase translates to ""I felt my heart beating,"" indicating that the person's heart was racing or pounding due to some stimulus. Option B (Ritmul inimii mi s-a accelerat), on the other hand, means ""My heart rhythm accelerated,"" which could also be an appropriate response but may not convey the same level of intensity as feeling one's heart actually beating."
"Response:  Option B: Biroul meu era zgomotos. (My office was noisy.)
Explanation: The premise states that there is a building under construction next to my office, which means there would be noise from construction activities. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Option A (Familia a invitat vecinii la cină) is more likely because it aligns with the idea of wanting to get to know new neighbors better through social interactions like dinner parties or gatherings.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the swimmer jumped into the pool) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am Înghiţit accidental o sămânţă) is more likely. The phrase ""muşcat o felie de pepene verde"" suggests that the speaker has unintentionally bit into a green pepper, which could potentially cause discomfort or pain but is unlikely to result in broken teeth. Option B (Mi-am rupt dinţii din greşeală) implies that the speaker has intentionally damaged their own teeth through carelessness or mistake, which seems less plausible given the context of the sentence."
Response:  Option A (Jacheta lui era desfăcută).
"Response:  Option A: She was startled by the noise.  
Explanation: The premise states that she heard a strange sound in her ears, which suggests that she was startled or alarmed by something unexpected. It's unlikely that she would intentionally make holes in her own ears. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mi-am umplut sticla de apă"", option A is the most likely cause - ""Am băut toată apa din ea"". This means that you have drunk all the water from the bottle."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the serial was censored due to containing offensive language (Option A). The mention of a ""complicated plot"" does not provide enough information to determine why the serial was censored without additional context."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Nava s-a naufragiat,"" option A (Echipajul s-a înecat) is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option B: A cerut un indiciu.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A sunat telefonul,"" it is more likely that option A (omul a închis) is correct because the word ""sunat"" implies a sudden or unexpected action, which suggests that omul may have been caught off guard and unable to react in time to answer the phone."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Femeia se holba la mine,"" option A is more likely. The use of the word ""se"" (she) suggests that the woman is addressing someone else, rather than simply feeling uncomfortable herself. Therefore, it is more likely that she has been embraced by the person she is addressing."
"Response:  Option A: Au făcut fotografii cu exponatele.  
Explanation: The premise states that the group left the museum, indicating that they did not spend time viewing all of the exhibits (Option B). Instead, it is more likely that they took photographs of the artifacts (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Prietenul meu m-a apărat) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Am schimbat viteza de pe bicicletă.
Explanation: The premise states that ""Roata de pe bicicleta mea era praf,"" indicating that the tire was worn out. This means that the bike's speed had decreased, making option B (scheming the speed) a more likely cause of the problem than option A (pumping air into the tire)."
Response:  Option B: Tatăl ei a simţit fruntea ei.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Am folosit un creion) is correct. The use of a pencil would create a softer, darker line than signing with one's name, which would result in a bolder, lighter line.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (had debts) is the correct answer. The reason for being refused an loan is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it can be inferred that the person had outstanding debts or credit issues, which would have made them a higher risk borrower.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Fata a stat acasă de la școală) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that the statement ""Fata a stat acasă de la școală"" suggests that the girl stayed home from school, which could be due to various reasons such as illness or personal issues. On the other hand, while option B (Îi plăcea să înveţe matematică) does not provide any specific evidence to suggest why the girl would stay home from school, it only implies that she enjoys learning mathematics, which may not have anything to do with her absence from school. Therefore, based on the given information, option A is the most plausible explanation for the girl's absence from school."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Am aruncat-o în chiuvetă) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the speaker will throw the sponge into the sink, implying a more active and direct action than simply going to the sponge (option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Câinele meu îşi pierde părul) is more likely.
Response:  Option B: A aruncat un scaun peste cameră.
Response:  Option A: Ramura a ars (The branch has burned).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul a iesit din duş,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Apa caldă a dispărut,"" is the correct answer. The premise suggests that something has disappeared or been lost (omul a iesit din duş), and water (apa) being hot does not provide any logical explanation for its disappearance. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Option B: They encouraged their children to play outside.
Response:  Option B - Pantofii au fost usati. (The shoes have been worn)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A - ""A refrigerated the leftovers"" - will occur. This is because eating half of the menu implies that there are still leftovers, which would need to be stored in the refrigerator to prevent spoilage."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Am pus gheaţă pe ea) is more likely to cause the woman's eyes to glaze over. Freezing her with a cold stare (option B, Am frecat lotiune pe ea) would not have this effect as it does not involve any physical contact or temperature change that could cause such an reaction.
"Response:  Option B: Am auzit conversaţia din hol.  
Explanation: The premise states that there was an open door to the office, indicating that the sound of the conversation could have potentially been heard from outside the office. Therefore, option B is more likely as it suggests that the speaker heard the conversation in the hallway rather than speaking with a colleague at the office."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Am luat loc) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Omul a lovit cu ochiul la muscă,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Mușca a zburat departe."" The reason being that when someone blinks or looks away, they are less likely to notice something nearby, including a fly buzzing around their head. Therefore, in this scenario, it is more probable that the fly will move away rather than stay still."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (the man had written a will) is true. The fact that he wrote a will suggests that he was aware of his own mortality and wanted to make arrangements for after his death. This is consistent with the idea that he was on his deathbed or close to death.
Response:  Option B: He accelerated his pace.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Am venit cu o soluție) is more likely. The speaker has already thought about the problem and come up with a solution, indicating that they are proactive and willing to take action.
Response:  Option B: Era în extaz.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (A made a bet with his friends) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A (He has set his alarm clock).
Explanation: The premise states that the boy could not fall asleep, indicating that he was awake and active at an unusual hour. Setting an alarm clock to wake him up at a specific time is something that someone who cannot sleep would do in order to ensure they are awake for a particular event or task. Therefore, option A is more likely than option B."
