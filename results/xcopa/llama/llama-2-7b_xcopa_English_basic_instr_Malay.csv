"Response: 
The man punctured his foot."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely.

"Response: 
The cause that is more likely is (B) The mother gave birth to twins.
This choice is the most likely because it provides a clear and specific reason for the family's move into a bigger house, which is in line with the information provided in the passage.

Response:  Pilihan B: The bag of chips was stuck.
Response: 2 (B)
"Response:

Excited by this discovery, she continued to observe the stars every night, eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to learn more about our celestial neighbors."
"Response: 
Pilihan A:  I positioned the poster above the door. 
Sebab:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the speaker positioned the poster above the door because it is a common place for posters to be hung."
"Response: 
The most likely answer is (B) The architect adjusted the plans.
This choice best fits the information provided in the passage, as it states that the client approved the architect's plans and then the architect adjusted them. It does not mention anything about the architect constructing the building or approving their own plans."
"Response: 
The man dropped his spoon."
"Response: 
The best answer is (B) The board of directors found his replacement.

Reasoning:
Asas has resigned as the CEO of the company, which means that a new CEO needs to be appointed. The board of directors is responsible for finding and appointing a suitable replacement for the position. Therefore, option (B) is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
Pilihan B: I approached the podium."
"Response: 
The answer is (B) He attacked a fellow inmate. 
Reasoning: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man was released from jail due to him attacking a fellow inmate rather than his family paying his bail. This is because the passage does not mention anything about the man's family being able to afford to pay his bail, and instead suggests that he may have been released as a result of his violent behavior towards another prisoner."

Response: 2 (The passengers screamed)
"Response:

"Response: 
The girl pulled it."
"Response: 
The most likely cause is that you sprayed yourself with bug repellent (pilihan A). This option best fits the information provided in the passage because it suggests that the speaker took an action to protect themselves from bugs, which is consistent with their statement about stepping on a bug. In contrast, steping on a bug would not necessarily prevent future encounters with other bugs."
"Response: 
A. I opened my eyes."
Response:  Pilihan B: I asked to borrow the CD from him.
"Response: 
Pilihan B: He earned below minimum wage. 
The correct answer is (B) He earned below minimum wage. This choice best explains why the man's family lived in poverty, as it suggests that he did not earn enough money to support himself and his family."
"Response: 
The answer is (B) He took up a hobby.
Explanation: Based on the context of the passage, it is more likely that the student took up a hobby after graduating from the university rather than looking for a job or taking up another course. The sentence ""After graduating from the university, he decided to take up painting as a hobby"" suggests that the student pursued an activity outside of his academic studies."

According to the passage, the hostage was taken by a group of armed men who demanded that their leader be released from prison. However, after the leader was freed, the kidnappers simply left the hostage alone without making any further demands or threats. This suggests that they were not motivated by a desire for ransom money or other personal gain, but rather by a political agenda aimed at securing the release of their leader. Therefore, option (B) is the best answer."

The correct answer is (B) The musician pounded the drum."
"Response: 
The parent's rush to the child's bedroom is more likely due to the child waking up screaming from a nightmare (pilihan A)."

Pilihan B: She was born deaf. 
The correct answer is (B) She was born deaf. Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the woman was born deaf rather than being born premature or having a hearing impairment. This is because the passage states that she ""communicated with sign language,"" which suggests that she had been using sign language for some time and was therefore most likely deaf from birth."
"Response: 
The answer is (B) The crops perished.
Reasoning: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the crops perished due to the drought rather than the water becoming contaminated or some other factor."

This implies that the employees took collective action to demand better working conditions and higher pay, which is consistent with the idea of going on strike."
"Response: 
The answer is (B) The extremists assassinated him.
This option best fits the information provided in the passage. According to the passage, the leader was able to antagonize the extremists among his country by taking a firm stance against them. This suggests that he was able to resist their influence and stand up to them, which could have led to their anger and ultimately to their decision to assassinate him."

"Response: 
The mother hushed her son. (Pilihan A)"
"Response: 
The most likely cause is that you tripped on the pavement (pilihan B).

Therefore, option (B) The post office expedited the letter is the best answer."

Pilihan B: He received an organ transplant.

The answer is (B) He started waking up earlier."
"Response: 
The woman punched her attacker in the nose. 
(A)"
"Response: 
The man was losing the game."
"Response: 
Pilihan A (He discovered rats in the basement) is more likely the cause of the homeowner's request for an exterminator because it suggests that there is a rat infestation in the basement, which could be causing problems such as damage to belongings or structural issues. In contrast, keeping an ant farm in one's room is unlikely to require an exterminator."
Response: 2 (B) My houseguest overstayed her welcome.
Response: 2 (B)
"Response: 
The woman was short on money for rent. 
Pilihan yang lebih mungkin adalah ""She quit her job"". This is because the sentence implies that the woman had to find a way to make more money in order to pay her rent, and quitting her job would allow her to have more time to focus on finding other sources of income. Working overtime may not necessarily provide enough additional income to cover the rent."
"Response: 
The correct answer is (B) He patted the puppy's head.
Explanation:
From the context of the sentence, it can be inferred that the child was gentle and caring towards the puppy. Patting the puppy's head is a common gesture of affection and care towards animals, which aligns with the characterization of the child in the passage. On the other hand, touching a hot stove is an action that could cause harm or discomfort to the child, which does not fit with the characterization of the child as being gentle and caring. Therefore, option (B) He patted the puppy's head is the more likely explanation for the child's actions based on the information provided in the passage."
"Response: 
Pilihan B: They distributed a survey to customers. 
This is the most likely answer based on the given information. Offering a discount to new customers (pilihan A) would not provide much insight into existing customers' satisfaction levels, as it only targets those who have never used the service before. Distributing a survey to customers (pilihan B), on the other hand, allows the company to gather feedback from both new and existing customers, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their overall satisfaction."
"Response: 
The boy dragged a chair across the floor. (Pilihan B)"

"Response: 
Pilihan B: People came to venerate it. 
The correct answer is (B) People came to venerate it. According to the passage, the statue of Asas was destroyed by people coming to venerate it, which suggests that the statue had become a place of pilgrimage and reverence for many people. This is more likely than the other options, which are not supported by the information provided in the passage."
Response: 2) Flies swarmed the fruit.
"Response: 
The ballerina twisted her ankle."
"Response: 
The answer is (B) He ran around on the playground.
Explanation: Based on the premise, it is more likely that the child's shoelaces came undone because he was running around on the playground than because he learned how to tie them."
"Response: 
The answer is (B) Lost track of time.
This choice best fits the context of the passage as it suggests that the speaker was so engrossed in reading the book that they failed to keep track of time, which aligns with the idea that the speaker became ""enthralled"" by the book. Choice (A) does not fit well as it implies that the speaker simply returned the book without any further action, while choice (B) provides a more logical explanation for why the speaker did not return the book on time."
"Response: 
Pilihan A: His parents influenced him. 
Sebab: Based on the passage, it is mentioned that the young man shared similar beliefs with his parents, indicating that they had a significant influence on his worldview. This choice is more likely than option B, which does not provide any evidence from the text to support the idea that the parents disowned their son."
"Response: 
The answer is (B) The driver fell asleep.

"Response: 
The most likely reason is:
A) I had a headache."
Response: 2) The owner gave the puppy a treat.
"Response:  The answer is (B) My friend became infuriated.

Explanation:
The sentence ""I apologized to my friend"" implies that the speaker has done something wrong and wants to make amends. The word ""infuriated"" suggests a strong negative reaction from the listener, which aligns with the context of the situation. Therefore, option B is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
The man stood out in the crowd because he wore a neon vest."
"Response: 
The witness lied under oath. 
Motivasi:  Based on the information provided, option B is more likely because it accurately describes what happened to the witness after he testified. According to the passage, the witness ""lied under oath,"" which means that he made false statements while giving evidence in court. This is a serious offense and could result in legal consequences for the witness. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response: 
Pilihan B: She wanted to blend in."
"Response: 
The answer is (B) They were deported.
This choice is more likely because it aligns with the information provided in the passage that the immigrants were caught illegally residing in the country and were subsequently deported. Choice (A) Find employment does not align with this information as it implies that the immigrants were able to legally find work in the country, which is not mentioned in the passage. Similarly, choice (B) They were deported is a direct consequence of being caught illegally residing in the country, making it the most likely option."
"Response: 
The public speaker cracked a joke. (Pilihan A)"
"Response: 
The answer is (A) The sun blinded me."
Response: 2 (B) Yawned
"Response: 
The steak was dull (pilihan A)."
"Response: 
The correct answer is (B) She acquired massive debt.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the woman acquired massive debt after declaring bankruptcy rather than receiving alimony payments or acquiring massive debt before declaring bankruptcy. This is because the passage states that she ""declared bankruptcy,"" which implies that she was unable to pay her debts and had to seek protection under the law. It is unlikely that she would have been able to acquire massive debt before declaring bankruptcy, as this would suggest that she was already heavily indebted prior to seeking bankruptcy protection. Therefore, option (B) She acquired massive debt is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
The best answer is (B) I decided to pay him a visit.
Explanation:
From the context of the passage, it can be inferred that the speaker wanted to see their friend and so they decided to go to their friend's apartment. This choice aligns with the idea of wanting to know whether their friend was out or not. Therefore, option (B) I decided to pay him a visit is the most likely answer."
"Response:

"Response: 
The correct answer is (A) She ran into a childhood friend."
Response: 45%
"Response: 
The answer is (B) I called a mechanic.
Reasoning: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the speaker called a mechanic because they mentioned ""My car broke down"" and ""I called a mechanic."" This implies that the speaker took action to fix their broken-down car by calling a professional for help, rather than simply going to the mall or doing nothing about it."
"Response: 
Pilihan B: It was illegible.

"Response: 
The man looked out the window. (B)"
"Response: 
The girl poked him."
"Response: 
Pilihan A: They amputated her leg. 
Sebab: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that they amputated the patient's leg rather than giving her an artificial limb. This is because the passage states that ""the doctors gave the patient an artificial limb,"" which implies that the patient had a missing limb to begin with. Additionally, there is no mention of any other medical procedure being performed besides the amputation of the patient's leg. Therefore, option A is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the context, option B is more likely. The girl jerked her arm away from the boy, indicating that she was not comfortable with his touching her and wanted to distance herself from him.
"Response: 
Pilihan A: I valued his opinion."
Response: 2 (The mud hit him in the face)
"Response:

"Response:  Based on the information provided, option B is more likely.
Reasoning: The sentence ""The employee's shift ended"" implies that the employee has finished their work for the day and is no longer at the office. This suggests that they may have left the office after their shift ended, which aligns with option B. Option A states that the employee went home for the day, but it does not specify when during the day this occurred. Option B provides a clearer timeline of events and is therefore more likely to be true."

"Response:  Pilihan B: She kissed him. 
The girl's action of sending the boy a Valentine is likely to indicate that she has romantic feelings for him and wants to express her affection. Kissing him is a more intimate act than simply liking him, so it is the most likely answer."

The most likely cause is (B) I agreed with him."
Response: 2) Pilihan B: They wanted to make a fair decision.
"Response: 
The man took the pizza out of the oven. (B)"
"Response:

"Response: 
The answer is (B) His son inherited his fortune.
This choice is more likely because the passage states that ""the wealthy man died of old age,"" which implies that he had lived a long life and was able to accumulate a significant amount of wealth during that time. It is also mentioned that his son inherited his fortune, which suggests that the son was already in line to inherit the wealth after the father's death."
Response: 2 (B)
"Response:

Pilihan B: He majored in engineering. 
Motivasi:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the college student chose option B because he wanted to meet other students on campus who shared similar interests and goals, such as those in his engineering classes or clubs related to engineering. Joining a fraternity may not provide him with the same opportunities for networking and collaboration with like-minded individuals."
