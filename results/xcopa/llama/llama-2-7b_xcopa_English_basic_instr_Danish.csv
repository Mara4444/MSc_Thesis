Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the item was fragile (A). This is because bubble wrap is typically used to protect items from damage during shipping, and it is more effective at cushioning fragile objects than small ones. Therefore, if the item was packaged in bubble wrap, it is likely that it was a delicate or breakable object that needed extra protection.
Response: 100% - Alternativ B: I found a weapon.
Response: 2) The termites ate through the wood in the house.
Response: 2) The patrol agent accused them of smuggling.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the office was closed because it was a holiday. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer.
"Response: 2) She jumped rope. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the girl became exhausted because she was jumping rope. This is supported by the fact that running and playing checkers do not require as much physical exertion as jumping rope does. Therefore, option B (She jumped rope) is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she stepped out of the line (B). This is because the passage states that ""more people entered the line,"" which suggests that the line became longer and more crowded, making it possible for the woman to have stepped out of the line unintentionally or due to fatigue. In contrast, alternative A does not provide any specific reason why the woman might have lost her place in line."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the baby soiled her diaper (B). This is because a baby's first word is often associated with a milestone event such as taking their first steps or saying their first words, and in this case, the baby has already taken her first steps. Therefore, it is more likely that she would say ""soiled"" instead of ""drooled."""
"Response: 
A) The audience clapped along to the music. 
B) The audience politely listened in silence."
Response: 2) Alternativ B: The girl brought the teacher an apple.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B: They toasted marshmallows on the campfire caused the young campers to feel scared. Toasting marshmallows over an open flame can be a fun and enjoyable activity for children, but it can also create a sense of excitement and fear if they are not properly supervised or if they get too close to the fire. Therefore, it is more plausible that the campers' fear was caused by their experience with toasting marshmallows rather than a ghost story told by their camp counselor.
Response: 2) He got a concussion.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason for the check bouncing is that my bank account was empty (Option A). This is because writing a check without sufficient funds in one's account is a common cause of checks bouncing. While Option B mentions a pay raise, this does not directly explain why the check bounced. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He sent out a mass email. 
Beklædning:  The man decided to send out a mass email to all his contacts, including those who had previously sent him spam emails. This would help him filter out the unwanted messages and reduce the amount of spam in his inbox. By sending out a mass email, he could also inform his contacts that he would no longer be receiving their spam emails, which would hopefully prevent them from continuing to send them."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the sailor was exposed to the disease (Alternative A). This is because the text states that he was ""quarantined,"" which implies that he had been infected with something and needed to be isolated in order to prevent its spread to others. There is no mention of him recovering from the disease, so Alternative B is not a viable option."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she forgot to write it down. This is because there is no indication in the passage that she recited the code to herself or that she had any other means of remembering it. It is more plausible that she simply forgot to write it down, which would explain why she was unable to recall it later. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response: 1. The water quenched my thirst.
"Response: 2) He was thinking about his friend's words.
Explanation: Based on the context, it is more likely that the man was thinking about what his friend had just said rather than wanting to offer him support. The sentence ""The man remained silent"" suggests that he did not immediately respond or react to what his friend had said, which could be interpreted as him being lost in thought."
Response: øh, jeg følte mig skyldig. (A)
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that there was a broken link in the chain (B). This is because the phrase ""the chain came apart"" suggests that the chain was no longer connected at one or more points, which is consistent with a broken link. In contrast, the alternative option ""the chain was wrapped around a tire"" would not explain why the chain came apart. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the couple compromised because they grew tired of arguing. This is supported by the phrase ""the couple decided to compromise"" and the absence of any mention of them avoiding discussions about the problem. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer."
"Response: 2018-03-06 17:45:29 UTC (Tuesday)

Answer: Alternative B is more likely.

Explanation:
The passage states that the woman ""decided to run for public office,"" which implies that she has already made up her mind to pursue this goal. Hiring a campaign manager would be a logical step towards achieving this goal, as they can help manage and execute the campaign strategy. Testifying in court, on the other hand, does not directly relate to running for public office. Therefore, alternative B is more likely to occur based on the information provided in the passage."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a specific piece of evidence (packing warm clothing) that supports the main idea of the passage (the man's preparation for cold weather). While alternative B does not provide any direct evidence and seems unrelated to the topic, therefore option A is more likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  I would say that Alternative A is more likely, because the student raised his hand to answer the question.
Response: 2) Dust got into his eyes.
Response: 100% af spørgsmålene i dette spørgsmål er korrekte, og derfor er Alternativ B den mest sandsynlige.
"Response: 2) The student's answers were incorrect.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the teacher tore up the student's exam because the student's answers were incorrect. There is no indication in the passage that the teacher caught the student cheating or that there was any other reason for tearing up the exam. Therefore, option (B) is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that the speaker lost their voice (B). The sentence ""I paused to stop talking"" suggests that the speaker was in the middle of speaking when they suddenly stopped, which could be due to a variety of reasons such as fatigue or loss of voice. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B (I covered it with plastic wrap) caused the frozen food to thaw. Plastic wrap can help prevent moisture from escaping and keep the food fresh for a longer period of time. It is less likely that putting it in the microwave would cause the food to thaw, as this method typically involves heating the food using electromagnetic waves rather than protecting it from external factors like temperature changes or moisture loss. Therefore, Alternative B is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the employee fake... (читать дальше)

Question: Premiss: The employee faked sick.
Alternative A: He had stomach cramps.
Alternative B: He wanted a day off.
Which reason is most likely?
Choose between A and B.
Answer: Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the employee fake... (read more)"
"Response: 2) She jumped off the diving board. 
The given information is that ""the girl landed in the pool"", which suggests that she entered the water by jumping from a height, rather than running on the deck or walking into the water. Therefore, option B (She jumped off the diving board) is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason why the movie tickets sold out is because it was opening day for the movie (Alternative A). This is supported by the fact that opening day is typically a busy time at theaters and many people want to see new movies on their first day in theaters. Therefore, it is more likely that the high demand for tickets led to them selling out rather than the movie receiving poor reviews (Alternative B).
"Response:  B: People complimented him. 
For this reason, the man felt more confident and motivated to continue his weight loss journey."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the girl's hands became blistered due to Alternative B: She climbed up a rope. This is because climbing up a rope can cause friction and rubbing on the skin, leading to blisters. Typing up a letter would not typically cause blisters. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response: 1) Alternativ A: The audience cheered in astonishment.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that ""My friend arrived on time"" (B) is the correct answer. This is because the sentence mentions that the speaker's friend arrived on time, which suggests that there was no delay or inconvenience caused by the friend. In contrast, option A implies that the speaker lost their patience due to some other reason, such as a long wait or an unexpected event. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for why the speaker lost their patience."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the warring countries negotiated a treaty to end the war rather than developing nuclear weapons. This is because the text states that the countries ""wanted peace,"" which suggests that they were motivated to find a peaceful solution to their conflict. Developing nuclear weapons would not necessarily lead to peace, and could potentially escalate the conflict further. In contrast, negotiating a treaty would allow the countries to find a mutually acceptable resolution to their differences without resorting to violence. Therefore, Alternative B is the more likely outcome."
Response: 2. Alternativ B: Han fik en feber.
Response: 2) Alternativ B: She bruised her knee.
Response: 2) Alternativ B: The balloon flew away.
"Response: 2) They went to the airport. 
The sentence ""They traveled to their destination"" implies that they are leaving one place and going to another, which is consistent with the alternative B."
"Response: 
B) Juice spilled out."
"Response: 1. Alternativ B: I had a sweet tooth. 
Dette svaret er korrekt! 
I had a sweet tooth means that you have a tendency to crave or enjoy sweet things, which could explain why your hands became sticky. This is the most likely reason among the options provided."
Response: 1) The door opened.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the activists boycotted the products because they were manufactured through child labor (B). This is supported by the fact that the protesters were specifically targeting companies that used child labor in their production processes. While quality assurance testing may also be an important consideration for consumers and activists, it does not appear to have been a primary motivator in this case.
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (A mouse crawled out of the hole)
"Response: 2) Her sister got divorced. 
The woman felt envious of her sister because she had recently gotten a divorce, which made the woman feel insecure about her own marriage and life choices."
Response: 1. I put on an apron.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the customer handed her money to the cashier. This is because the sentence states that the cashier opened the cash register, which suggests that a transaction was taking place and the customer needed to provide payment. Alternative A does not provide any context for why the customer would be searching their wallet, while alternative B directly contradicts this by stating that the customer handed her money. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response: 1) Alternativ A: People gave him change.
"Response: 2) It was snack time. 
Based on the information provided in the story, it is most likely that the little boy cried because it was snack time and he wanted something to eat or drink. This is supported by the fact that the babysitter had to tell him ""no"" when he asked for a cookie, which suggests that the boy was feeling hungry or frustrated at not being able to have what he wanted. There is no mention of the boy missing his parents, so this alternative cannot be ruled out entirely but it is less likely given the context of the story."
"Response: 2) The pilot flew through the storm.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the pilot flew through the storm rather than navigating away from it."
"Response: 
B: The leaves accumulated on the ground. 
This is more likely because it directly follows the statement ""The tree shed its leaves,"" which implies that the leaves are no longer attached to the tree. Accumulating on the ground makes sense as a result of this action."
Response: 2) He decided to play a practical joke on his sister.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that his father stopped the car at a gas station (B) than that he gave him a soda to drink (A). This is because stopping at a gas station would provide a convenient opportunity for the child to use the restroom, while giving him a soda might not necessarily address the issue of needing to go to the bathroom.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (the fish swam towards the food) occurred because the child sprinkled fish food into the tank. This action would have attracted the attention of the fish and caused them to move towards the food. Therefore, Alternative B is the more likely outcome.
"Response: 
B) She engaged in a protest. 
This answer choice is more likely because it directly involves the woman taking action to express her political views, whereas switching party affiliation is a more indirect way of expressing one's political beliefs."
"Response:  Alternativ B: I poured drain cleaner into it. 
Dette alternativet er mere sandsynligt, da drain cleaner ofte kan hjælpe med at løse klogging i badeværelses sink."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The train blared its whistle. 
Because it is more likely that the sound of the train's whistle would be heard by the passengers after they got off the train, rather than before they got off the train."
Response: 2. He sealed the envelope shut.
"Response: 2) They moved to different cities. 
The reason why the friends lost touch is most likely that they moved to different cities. This option suggests that the friends were geographically distant from each other, which could have made it difficult for them to maintain their friendship over time."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to be true because it directly relates to the main point of the argument, which is that the accountant mismanaged the company's funds. While alternative B may also be a consequence of poor financial management, it is not as closely related to the initial claim as alternative A. Therefore, alternative A is more likely to be true.
Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that the speaker looked at the clock because they wanted to check the time. Therefore, the answer is (B) I wanted to check the time.
"Response: 2) My wife and I held hands. 
The most likely reason for your hand to cramp is that you held hands with someone else, rather than writing an essay by hand."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B (I twisted the wrench) caused the bolt to tighten. This is because twisting a wrench can cause the bolt to turn and tighten. In contrast, replacing the bolt would not necessarily cause it to tighten without additional action, such as tightening it with a wrench or other tool. Therefore, Alternative B is the most likely explanation for why the bolt tightened.
"Response: 100% - Alternativ A is more likely to happen.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the couple will move into the apartment than for the city to condemn it."
"Response: 2) She thought she saw lightning. 
The woman sat outside on the porch because she wanted to watch the sunset, not because she thought she saw lightning. Therefore, Alternative B is the most likely reason for her sitting there."
"Response: 2) The water was shallow.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man wore a lifejacket in the water because he wanted to stay afloat in shallow water. If the water were deep, he would not need a lifejacket and could potentially swim without one. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
Response: 2) She hit the backspace key.
Response: 20% - Alternativ B: She won a contest.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the lawn was muddy because it poured overnight. This is supported by the fact that the lawn was described as ""muddy,"" which suggests that there was excess water present. In contrast, the alternative options do not provide a clear explanation for why the lawn might be muddy. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she overslept because she forgot to set her alarm clock. This is supported by the fact that she did not stay overnight at a hotel, which suggests that she was supposed to wake up at home but failed to do so. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer.
"Response: 2) He went to the beach. 
Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man went to the beach because he applied sunscreen, which is something people typically do when they are going to be outside for an extended period of time, especially in a sunny location like a beach."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the researchers retracted the theory (A). This is because the passage states that ""the researchers proved the theory,"" which suggests that they had initially found evidence supporting it. However, later in the passage, it mentions that the researchers retracted their findings, indicating that they had reevaluated the data and determined that their initial conclusions were incorrect. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the referee made a bad call. This is because the fans' reaction of booing suggests that they were unhappy with something that happened during the game, and since the referee's decision can have a significant impact on the outcome of the game, it is more probable that their reaction was due to a mistake made by the referee rather than the game going into overtime or any other factor. Therefore, Alternative B is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B, ""The lock popped open,"" occurred. This is because entering a combination and then having the lock pop open suggests that the correct combination was entered and the lock opened successfully. In contrast, Alternative A, ""I shut the lock,"" does not provide any information about whether or not the lock actually opened. Therefore, Alternative B is the more probable outcome based on the given information."
"Response: 
A) The father handed his son some money. 
B) The father grabbed his son's hand. "
Response:  Based on the context, it is more likely that Alternative B (I shoveled the snow out of the way) is the correct answer because it better fits the situation described in the premise. Shoveling snow is a common solution to clearing a driveway that is blocked by snow, and it is more practical than gathering snow into a snowball. Therefore, Alternative B is the most plausible response.
Response: 2) Alternativ B: The kayak hit a wave.
Response:  I would say that Alternative B is more likely to happen, as it provides more specific details about what caused the girl to lose control of her bike.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Alternative B (I felt cool air pass over me) occurred. The use of the phrase ""I turned on the fan"" implies that a cooling effect was desired or expected, and the fact that the speaker felt cool air passing over them suggests that this expectation was fulfilled. In contrast, Alternative A (Water sprinkled onto my skin) does not necessarily imply a cooling effect, as water alone may not provide sufficient cooling without other factors such as evaporation or wind. Therefore, based on the given information, Alternative B is the more likely outcome."
"Response: 2) They saw a shark. 
Based on the context of the story, it is most likely that the surfers saw a shark because the sentence ""They saw a shark"" provides a clear and unexpected twist in the narrative, which aligns with the surprise element mentioned earlier. Additionally, the mention of the surfers being drenched does not provide enough information to explain their sudden departure from the beach, whereas the sighting of a shark offers a more plausible reason for their abrupt return. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (The water drained out of the tub)
"Response:  B: He confessed his infidelity to her. 
The husband confessing his infidelity is more likely because it aligns with the emotional tone of the passage, which describes the husband feeling guilty and ashamed about cheating on his wife. It also provides a resolution to the conflict by allowing the husband to take responsibility for his actions and be honest with his partner."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that you spilled water on the poster (B). This is because the sentence ""the ink on the poster smeared"" suggests that something caused the ink to become blurry or smudged, and spilling water on the poster would be a more plausible reason for this than waiting for the ink to dry."
"Response: 1) He had a nightmare. 
Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the child woke up screaming because he had a nightmare. This is supported by the fact that children often have vivid and disturbing dreams during their sleep, which can cause them to wake up in distress. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response: 1) Alternativ A: His father sat down at the table. 
Bemærkning: This answer is more likely because it provides a clear reason for why the boy's feet were placed on the table, whereas alternative B does not provide any explanation."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that your friend heard you shouting his name rather than waving your arms. This is because hearing is a more reliable sense for detecting sounds at a distance than seeing is for detecting movements with the naked eye. Therefore, it is more probable that your friend heard you shouting his name than he saw you waving your arms.
"Response: 
B: The citizens registered to vote.
This answer choice is more likely because registering to vote is an act of resistance that can lead to greater political participation and representation, rather than resorting to violent means like a revolt."
"Response: 2) He screamed for help. 
Bemærkning:  This answer is more likely because it is more direct and straightforward, whereas setting up a tent would not necessarily help him get found quickly."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she wanted to learn about other cultures. This can be inferred from the phrase ""travelled abroad,"" which implies a desire to experience and learn about different cultures outside of one's own. Therefore, Alternative B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 2) His coworker worked late. 
Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man's jealousy stemmed from his coworker working late, as this could be seen as an opportunity for the coworker to stand out and potentially receive recognition or advancement."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man was hallucinating (A). There is no evidence to suggest that he was meditating or experiencing any other form of altered state of consciousness. Hallucination is a common phenomenon that can occur in people who are under stress, sleep deprived, or have certain medical conditions. It is also possible that the man's experience was simply a product of his imagination. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for the man's claim of having seen aliens.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He put shampoo in it. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man's hair turned blonde due to using shampoo than putting bleach in it. Shampoo can sometimes cause hair to lighten or change color, especially if it contains ingredients such as sulfates or oxygen bleach. On the other hand, putting bleach in one's hair would be a deliberate act to lighten or remove pigment from the hair, and it may not result in an immediate change of color. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the man's hair turned blonde."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the artist felt a stroke of inspiration (B). This is because the passage states that she ""felt a sudden surge of creativity,"" which suggests that she experienced an unexpected and intense burst of inspiration rather than simply criticizing her previous work or feeling inspired to create new artwork."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the son moved away from home because he was going to college. This is supported by the fact that the passage states ""He was going to college,"" which implies that he had a specific reason for leaving his parents' house. On the other hand, while ""he was discharged from the military"" could also be a valid explanation for why someone might move away from their parents' house, there is no direct evidence in the passage to support this alternative. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 2) An earthquake shook the bookcase. 
For this reason, it is most likely that the books fell out of the bookcase due to an earthquake rather than because the shelves were covered with dust."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that you reset the circuit breaker than turned on a light. This is because turning on a light would not have caused the electricity to shut off in your house. Resetting the circuit breaker is a common cause of power outages and can result in the loss of electricity in a particular area of the home or building. Therefore, option B (resetting the circuit breaker) is the more probable explanation for the situation described in the premise.
Response: 2) It looked fun.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the bag of popcorn began to pop because you heated it in the microwave (B). This is because the heat from the microwave caused the kernels inside the bag to explode and pop. In contrast, pouring butter into the bag would not have caused the popcorn to start popping.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (the forecast predicted heavy winds) caused the tree to fall on the power line. Heavy winds can cause trees to topple or weaken their roots, leading to a higher likelihood of them falling onto power lines during storms. Therefore, Alternative B is the more plausible explanation for why the power went out in the neighborhood.
"Response: 
B: He offended the audience.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the speaker offended the audience than bored them. The passage states that the speaker made ""politically incorrect"" comments, which suggests that he may have said something controversial or insensitive. This could potentially offend some members of the audience who are sensitive to such issues. In contrast, boring the audience would not necessarily result in their being offended."
Response: 1. A bead of sweat dripped from my face.
"Response: 2) It was dead. 
Beklaring:  The fish did not move or react to its surroundings, indicating that it was dead."
"Response: 2) He quit smoking.
Explanation:  The man's voice sounding hoarse can be caused by various factors, including having a cold or quitting smoking. However, the most likely explanation is that he quit smoking because this is a common side effect of quitting smoking. When someone stops smoking, their vocal cords can become inflamed and irritated, leading to a hoarse voice. In contrast, having a cold is not typically associated with a persistent hoarse voice."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the elevator got stuck between floors (B). This is because there is no indication in the premise that the elevator had reached its destination floor.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the teenager was grounded by his parents. This is because the text states that ""his parents grounded him,"" indicating that they took away his freedom as a punishment for sneaking out of the house without their permission. In contrast, the option ""He lied to his parents"" does not provide any evidence to suggest that the teenager's parents were aware of his actions or that he intentionally deceived them. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the water heater broke (B). This is because a broken water heater would be more likely to cause a flood in the bathroom than an overflowing toilet.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the owner kept the puppy on a leash. This is because the sentence states that the puppy ""stayed near"" its owner, which implies that the puppy was not allowed to roam freely but rather had to remain close to its owner's side. Additionally, the use of the word ""leash"" in the alternatives suggests that this is the most plausible explanation for why the puppy remained near its owner. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the context of the sentence, it is most likely that the man stood under the sprawling tree. This is because the sentence mentions ""his reflection,"" which suggests that he was standing in front of a body of water or a mirror, and the word ""sprawling"" implies a large tree with branches that could create a reflective surface. In contrast, ""standing over the calm lake"" does not provide enough information to determine why the man's reflection would be visible. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response: ø
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that their dog ran away from home. This is because the sentence mentions ""their dog"" and ""home,"" which suggests a personal connection between the dog and the family's residence. Additionally, there is no other evidence in the sentence to suggest that anything else was missing or happened. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response: 1. Alternativ B: My chest felt tight.
Explanation: When you see your breath, it is a sign that the air in your lungs is colder than the air around you. This can happen when the temperature is low enough for the air to condense into visible vapor. In this case, alternative B (My chest felt tight) is the most likely explanation because it suggests that there may be some blockage or restriction in the respiratory system, which could cause you to feel short of breath even though the temperature is not particularly cold."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the employees formed a union because their employer raised their wages. This is supported by the fact that the employees were able to negotiate with their employer and achieve improved working conditions through collective bargaining. While alternative (A) mentions ""better working conditions,"" it does not provide any specific evidence to support this claim, whereas alternative (B) provides concrete details about the outcome of the negotiation process. Therefore, option (B) is the best answer."
Response: Ønsker du at vælge mellem Alternativ A eller Alternativ B?
"Response: 2) She took off her shoes. 
The woman took off her shoes because she found it difficult to walk in them, which suggests that the high heels were causing her discomfort or pain. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative A (The water boiled) is the correct answer. This is because steam rising from a pot of water indicates that the water has reached its boiling point and is producing steam as a result. Covering the pot would not necessarily prevent steam from rising, but rather reduce the amount of heat transferred to the water. Therefore, Alternative A is the most plausible explanation for why steam was observed rising off of the pot.
Response: 20% - Alternativ B: I wore boots.
Response:  I think that Alternative B is more likely to be true, as it is a common occurrence for politicians to face accusations of corruption and lose public support due to various reasons such as scandals or unpopular policies. Therefore, option B is more plausible than option A in this scenario.
"Response: 2) The couple eloped.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the couple eloped rather than getting pregnant. The fact that everyone disapproved of their engagement suggests that they may have wanted to keep their relationship private and away from public scrutiny, which could explain why they chose to elope instead of announcing their engagement to the world."
"Response: 2) The millionaire contributed the funds to build it.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the millionaire contributed the funds to build the building because it is stated that ""the building was dedicated to him."" This implies that he had a significant role in its construction and financing. In contrast, alternatives A and B do not align with this information as there is no indication that the millionaire wanted the building torn down or that he was involved in its construction."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The sales associate helped the girl find the purse she liked. 
The reason why is most likely because it provides a more positive and helpful explanation for the sales associate's actions. If the sales associate had seen the girl putting merchandise in her purse, they would have been more likely to accuse her of stealing. However, if the sales associate helped the girl find the purse she liked, it suggests that they were trying to assist her rather than accusing her of wrongdoing."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely.
Response: 100% - Alternativ B: A couple exchanged vows in front of the courthouse.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she left the cookies in the oven. This is because the sentence ""She smelled something burning"" implies that there was a fire or smoke coming from the oven, which would be more likely if the cookies were still inside rather than having been taken out."
Response: 1. Alternativ A: The storm worsened.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the building was evacuated due to a fire alarm going off (B). This is because the phrase ""the fire alarm went off"" specifically mentions the cause of the evacuation, which suggests that it was not just an ordinary malfunction but rather a serious issue related to fire safety. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  I would say that Alternative B, ""The father kicked his son out of the house,"" is more likely to happen because it aligns with the information provided in the premise. The fact that the father resents his son's alcoholism suggests that he may not want him around anymore, and kicking him out of the house could be seen as a way for him to distance himself from the problem. In contrast, buying his son a beer (Alternative A) does not necessarily address the underlying issue of the father's resentment towards his son's alcoholism."
"Response: 2) The elevator was out of order. 
The text states that the lawyer ""took the stairs up to her office,"" which implies that there is no elevator available. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response: 2) His friend bought him lunch. 
The man became annoyed with his friend because he bought him lunch without asking for permission first, which the man felt was disrespectful and inconsiderate of his wishes."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt. 
This is more likely because it is a common mistake for a cashier to forget something as important as giving a customer a receipt, especially if they are busy or distracted."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she was paralyzed in an accident (A). This is because being put in a wheelchair suggests that she has difficulty walking or standing due to an injury or illness, which could be caused by an accident such as a car crash or fall. In contrast, entering the hospital in a stretcher suggests that she may have been seriously injured and needed medical attention immediately, but does not necessarily imply that she was paralyzed. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why she was placed in a wheelchair.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that citizens hung the national flag up outside their homes to commemorate the country's independence. This is supported by the phrase ""the country was commemorating its independence,"" which suggests that the flag-hanging was a way for citizens to show their patriotism and celebrate this important event. In contrast, the phrase ""the country was facing economic hardship"" does not provide any evidence to support this alternative. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response: 20% - Alternativ B: They inspired their fans.
Response:  B: I felt proud.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that he forgot to study for the exam. This is because paying attention in class does not necessarily guarantee success on an exam, and forgetting to study can be a significant factor in failing an exam. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that an earthquake hit the city (A). This is because a collapse of a building in the downtown area without any other explanation suggests a sudden and unexpected event such as an earthquake. While crime rates may also increase over time, this would not cause a specific building to collapse in one location. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
Response: 100% af gange, han begyndte at bebrejde sig selv for bruddet og til sidst tog sit eget liv.
Response:  I would say that Alternative B is more likely, as it is a common occurrence for siblings to bump into each other while playing together.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the raccoon ransacked the garbage can because the lid was off (B). This provides a direct explanation for why the raccoon would have been able to access and rummage through the contents of the garbage can. In contrast, the presence of cardboard in the garbage can does not necessarily explain why the raccoon would have been interested in or able to access the can. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
"Response: 2) It was dull.
Explanation: Based on the context of the sentence, it is more likely that the pencil was dull than that it was cheap. The sentence mentions the boy sharpening the pencil, which suggests that the pencil needed to be sharpened because it had become dull."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the woman did not get a refund because she lost her receipt. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer.
Response: ø
"Response: 2) He was talking to himself. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the man was talking to himself because ""strange looks from passengers"" suggests that he was behaving in a way that was unusual or noticeable enough to attract attention. Talking to oneself is a common behavior that people often do without realizing it, and therefore it is more plausible than staring at the ground, which could be caused by a variety of reasons such as daydreaming, lost in thought, or simply not paying attention to one's surroundings."
Response: 1. Alternativ A, Ants crawled to the crumbs.
Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that the woman's sister began to cry (B). This is because the sentence mentions that the woman handed her sister a tissue, which suggests that her sister was emotional and needed a tissue to wipe away tears.
"Response: 2) He worried about bad breath. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the man worried about having bad breath because he took a mint. This is supported by the fact that mints are commonly used to freshen breath and alleviate concerns about bad odor. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 2) They got directions to the theatre.
Explanation: Based on the context, it is more likely that the couple got directions to the theatre rather than anticipating traffic around the theatre. This is because there is no indication in the passage that they were aware of any specific traffic issues or delays, and instead, they simply ""left early"" for the show. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why they arrived early at the theatre."
Response: 100% af gange, jeg har spurgt mig selv om det var muligt at skifte arbejdsplads uden at fortælle sin chef om det. Det er derfor, jeg finder alternativet B mest sandsynligt.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the man signed the activists' petition because he supported their cause. This is indicated by the phrase ""the man signed the activists' petition,"" which suggests that he agreed with their views and wanted to show his support. There is no indication in the passage that he denied or criticized their beliefs, so option B (he denounced them as crazy) is not a viable answer. Therefore, the best choice is option A (he supported their cause)."
"Response: 2) He memorized his lines.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the actor memorized his lines rather than having stage fright. Memorizing lines is an important part of preparation for a performance, and it is common for actors to feel confident and prepared when they have rehearsed their parts thoroughly. On the other hand, stage fright is a common phenomenon where performers experience anxiety or fear before or during a performance, which can affect their ability to deliver a good show. Therefore, option B (He memorized his lines) is the most plausible answer based on the given information."
Response:  Based on the context, it is more likely that Alternative B (I unfolded a map) led to the speaker being found. This is because an unfolded map can provide a clear visual representation of the surrounding area and help someone find their way back. In contrast, counting one's cash may not provide any obvious clues about how to get back. Therefore, Alternative B is the more plausible explanation for why the speaker was found.
Response: 100% af gange, det var mest sandsynligt at frugten ville blive spist, end at den ville skive op.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the car broke down due to the engine overheating (B). This is because turning the ignition (A) would not necessarily cause the car to break down, and in fact could potentially make the situation worse by causing further damage to the engine or other components of the vehicle. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response: 2) He stayed in bed for several days.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B (It was cold in the house) is the reason why you started a fire in the fireplace. The statement ""I started a fire in the fireplace"" implies that there was a need for warmth in the house, which could only be fulfilled by starting a fire. Additionally, the fact that it was cold in the house suggests that this was indeed the case. Therefore, Alternative B is the best answer."
"Response: 2) She got a second wind.
Explanation: Based on the context of the passage, it is more likely that the woman got a second wind rather than a cramp in her side or stopped jogging due to any other reason. The passage states that she ""picked up speed,"" which suggests that she was able to maintain her pace and continue running without any discomfort or obstacles. Additionally, there is no mention of any physical symptoms or external factors that could have caused her to stop jogging. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
Response: 1. Alternativ A: My neighbor invited me in.
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that Alternative B is the correct answer. The sentence ""Her husband kissed her goodbye"" suggests that the man was trying to show affection and support for his wife, which aligns with the tone of the passage. In contrast, Alternative A does not provide any information about the husband's actions or motivations, making it less plausible as a response to the prompt."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the teacher commended the student because the student answered the question correctly. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer.
Response: 2) She went to the supermarket.
"Response: 
B) I gave him a hug."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the woman avoided going into the lake because she thought it was contaminated. Therefore, the answer is (B) It looked contaminated.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the student's umbrella broke and caused him to arrive to class soaking wet. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer.
"Response: 2) The user clicked the mouse.
Explanation: When the cursor moves on a computer screen, it can be caused by various actions such as clicking the mouse or shifting the mouse. However, the most likely reason for the cursor to move is that the user clicked the mouse, as this action typically results in the cursor moving to a new location on the screen. Therefore, option (B) is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the driver took a detour (A). This is because there is no indication of an accident occurring on the main road or any other reason why the driver would follow another vehicle.
Response: 1. Alternativ A: The linen dried.
"Response: 2) Alternativ B: She hailed a cab. 
The given sentence is in the present tense and describes an action that happened in the past, so we can rule out option (A) as it does not fit the context of the sentence. Option (B) provides a more logical explanation for why the woman put on her shades, as she may have done so to protect herself from the sunlight while traveling in a taxi. Therefore, the most likely answer is option (B)."
Response: 2) He thought it was beautiful.
Response:  Bedst tilpasset til denne præmis er Alternativ A: I went to bed early. Dette kan forklare, hvordan personen følte sig udmattet, idet de gik tidligt i sengen og fik en god natsøvn, der kan have forbedret deres udmattelse.
"Response:  Alternativ B: His hair was getting long. 
The given sentence is in past tense and mentions ""went"" which implies that the action of going to the barber has already happened, so the most likely answer is (B) His hair was getting long."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the boy disliked the new classmate (B). This inference can be drawn from the phrase ""mean tricks"" which implies that the boy was not friendly towards the new classmate. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that you were baking bread (B). This is because the sentence ""I was baking bread"" provides more detail and context than the other two options, which are quite vague. Additionally, the phrase ""I was eating cookies"" does not make sense in this context, as it is unlikely that someone would be both drinking milk and eating cookies at the same time. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why you wanted a glass of milk."
"Response: 1. Alternativ A, The driver turned on the headlights. 
Bemærkning: This is the more likely outcome because it provides a logical explanation for why the driver would slow down in heavy rain. Turning on the headlights allows the driver to see better and improves visibility, which could help them navigate safely in the rain. Shifting the car into reverse does not provide any obvious reason for why the driver would slow down in this situation."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (I parked near the entrance) is true. This is because there is no indication in the premise that the speaker parked far away from the building, and the word ""empty"" suggests that there were no other cars in the parking lot. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker would have parked closer to the entrance rather than across the street."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she missed her deadline due to writer's block. This is because the passage states that ""the writer missed her deadline for the draft submission,"" which suggests that she was unable to complete the task on time due to a creative or mental block. In contrast, editing the draft would not have caused her to miss the deadline. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information given, it is most likely that Alternative B is the correct answer. This is because the speaker mentions providing their identification number as the reason for the associate hanging up on them. Providing an identification number is typically required in order to verify one's identity and establish a legitimate reason for calling, which could explain why the associate hung up on the speaker.
Response: 1) Alternativ A: The doorbell rang.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that you blew a fuse (B). This is because an electrical fault or overload can cause a fuse to blow, which will cut off the power supply to your home. Unplugging a lamp would not typically cause the electricity to shut off in your entire house.
"Response: 2) He lifted the bar over his head.
Explanation: Based on the context of the sentence, it is more likely that the weightlifter grunted while lifting the bar over his head rather than flexing his muscles in the mirror."
"Response: 
A) He got out a calculator. 
B) He got confused."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the father gently rocked the baby (B). This is because the sentence ""The baby fell asleep"" suggests that the baby was in a state of relaxation and contentment, which could have been induced by being gently rocked. In contrast, changing the baby's diaper would not necessarily cause the baby to fall asleep. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response: 1) Alternativ B: The boy got soaked.
"Response: 
B) Everyone in the photos refused to smile. 
Explanation:  Given that the photographer forgot to use the flash, it is more likely that the photos will turn out blurry (Option A). However, since everyone in the photos refused to smile, the photos are unlikely to be blurry due to a lack of lighting (Option B). Therefore, Option B is the more plausible explanation for why the photos did not turn out well."
Response: 2) I was out of town.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that (B) I was scared. This is because exercising can sometimes cause feelings of fear or anxiety, especially if you are not used to it.
Response: 100% af gange, jeg squeezede det fugtige stykke, tog vand op. Derfor er Alternativ A den mest sandsynlige effekt.
"Response: 2) Alternativ B: The resort was on an island. 
The sentence ""The vacationers took a ferry to the resort"" implies that the resort is located on an island, which makes it most likely that the resort was booked (Alternative A)."
Response: 2) She wanted to rebel.
Response: ø
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the criminal turned himself in because there was no evidence against him (B). This is supported by the fact that the passage states ""there was no evidence against him,"" which suggests that he had nothing to fear from turning himself in. In contrast, option A implies that the evidence implicated him, which would have been a reason for him to avoid turning himself in."
"Response:  Alternativ B: Han untold caffeine. 
Based on the text, it is more likely that the heavyset man will lose weight by avoiding caffeine than by cutting out sweets."
Response: 2) She shivered.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she stayed up all night (A). This is because the phrase ""rings under her eyes"" typically indicates that someone has been awake or tired for a long time, and staying up all night would be more likely to cause this than putting one's child to bed."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the volcano erupted (A). This is because lava flowing from a volcano indicates an active or eruptive phase, rather than a dormant or inactive phase. Additionally, there is no mention of any other factors that could cause lava to flow from the volcano, such as earthquakes or gas emissions. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
Response: 2) She wanted to leave the party.
Response: 1. She let me pass through the tollbooth.
"Response: 2) He squandered his fortune. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the executive squandered his fortune rather than sold his company stock or went bankrupt. The phrase ""squandered his fortune"" suggests that he spent or used up his money unwisely or recklessly, which aligns with the idea of him being bankrupt. In contrast, selling company stock implies a more deliberate and intentional action, while going bankrupt implies a sudden and unexpected financial crisis. Therefore, option B (He squandered his fortune) is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man felt ill (B). This is supported by the fact that the sentence mentions the man going to the doctor, which suggests that he had a medical problem or issue that required attention from a healthcare professional. There is no mention of the doctor being on leave, which makes this alternative less plausible. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason why you exited your bedroom through the window is because the house was on fire (A). This is supported by the fact that you mentioned exiting your bedroom through a window, which suggests that there may have been an emergency situation requiring immediate action. While it is possible that the house was empty and you simply wanted to leave through the window for another reason, the mention of a fire makes this option less likely.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He lathered his hands with soap. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the boy's fingers became pruny because he lathered them with soap. This is supported by the fact that the passage states ""his fingers became pruny,"" which suggests that something was applied to his fingers that caused them to become dry and wrinkled. While taking a long shower could also potentially cause pruny fingers, there is no direct evidence in the passage to suggest this as the cause. Therefore, alternative B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason why you spat out the milk is because your mouth was dry. Therefore, the answer is (B) My mouth was dry.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (I was late to work) is the correct answer because it provides a logical explanation for why the speaker missed the bus.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (The car got smashed) occurred because a collision between a truck and a car can result in serious damage to the smaller vehicle.
"Response: 
B) They dropped out. 
Explanation:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the team dropped out of the contest rather than rigging it in their favor. Dropping out implies a lack of participation or involvement, which aligns with the idea that they did not win the contest. In contrast, rigging the contest would require active manipulation and control over the outcome, which may be less plausible given the context."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is most likely that Alternative B occurred - ""I twisted off the cap."" This is because the hissing sound suggests that there was pressure inside the bottle, which could only be released by opening the cap. Turning over the bottle would not have caused the hissing sound and would not have relieved the pressure inside the bottle. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for why the soda bottle hissed."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely.
Response: 1) Alternativ A is more likely to be true because it provides a specific and detailed action that the visitor took, whereas alternative B only mentions the woman looking through the keyhole without providing any context or detail about what she was doing.
"Response: 100% - Alternativ A, ""He got it dry-cleaned"", is more likely to be the correct answer as it provides a logical explanation for how the man's suit became stained."
"Response:  Alternativ A: The toothpaste squirted out of the tube. 
Bemærkning: This answer is more likely because when you squeeze a tube of toothpaste, it will typically squirt out of the tube rather than being spat out by the person using it."
Response:  Based on historical records, it is more likely that pacifists staged a protest (Alternative A) than held a parade (Alternative B). This is because protests have been a common form of peaceful resistance throughout history and are often used to draw attention to issues such as human rights abuses or military actions. Parades, on the other hand, are typically celebratory events that do not always address specific political or social issues. Therefore, Alternative A is the more plausible scenario.
"Response: 2) The ribbon looked babyish.
Explanation: Based on the context, it is more likely that the girl removed the ribbon because she thought it looked babyish. This choice aligns with the tone and theme of the passage, which emphasizes the girl's desire to look older and more grown-up."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man aged rather than looking younger after getting plastic surgery. Therefore, Alternative A (He aged) is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the egg hatched (Alternative A). This is because a baby chicken emerging from an egg implies that the egg has already hatched and the chick inside has grown enough to escape. Cracking an egg would not result in a baby chicken emerging, as the shell of the egg would still be intact and the chick inside would not have had enough time to grow and develop. Therefore, Alternative A is the most likely explanation for why a baby chicken emerged from the egg.
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (He died) is more likely.
Response: 2) He fell off the ladder.
Response: 2) He opened the soda can.
Response: 2) B: I shivered.
"Response: 2) She made good grades. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the student received a scholarship because she made good grades rather than because her classmates respected her."
Response: 2) She had a crush on him.
Response: 2) He had no money.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that (B) I felt lonely was the reason why I called my friend to chat. The passage states that ""I called my friend to chat,"" which suggests that the speaker was seeking social interaction and company, rather than wanting privacy or feeling lonely. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 
A) I shook his hand."
Response: 2) The frisbee soared towards my head.
Response: 2) She was surprised.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that (B) It was the beginning of a new month, is the correct answer. This is because turning the page on a calendar typically marks the start of a new month, rather than making an appointment or marking a specific event.
"Response:  B: He filed for divorce. 
The husband, feeling betrayed and hurt by his wife's infidelity, decides to file for divorce. This is the most likely outcome as it allows him to distance himself from the situation and move on with his life."
Response: 1) The ball bounced.
Response:  I would say that Alternative B is more likely, as it provides a specific reason for why she might have gotten a wrong answer. Guessing (Option A) does not provide any explanation for how she arrived at the incorrect answer. Therefore, Option B is more plausible.
"Response: 
B: His opponent hit the ground. 
For this sentence, option B is more likely because it provides a clear and specific outcome of the action described in the sentence. Option A is less clear and does not provide as much detail about what happened to the opponent after they were tackled."
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (They were ripe)
"Response:  Alternativ B: He bought his girlfriend chocolates. 
Because it is more likely that a man would buy chocolate as a romantic gesture than meet an ex-girlfriend for lunch, which could be seen as a negative or awkward encounter."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the thermometer rose due to the warm weather (B). This is because the passage states that ""the mercury in the thermometer rose,"" which suggests that there was an increase in temperature. In contrast, the alternative answer (A) does not provide any evidence for why the thermometer might have risen. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response: 100% - Alternativ B: The highway became dangerously icy.
Response:  I would say that Alternative A is more likely, as receiving tutoring can indeed improve one's understanding and performance in a subject, whereas cheating on an exam is unlikely to have any positive effect on one's academic performance. Therefore, it is more probable that the student's grades improved due to his receipt of tutoring rather than through cheating.
"Response:  Based on the context of the passage, it is most likely that the speaker chose option (B) ""I wrapped myself in a blanket"" as the reason for feeling comfortable. The passage states that the speaker was sitting alone in a quiet room and suddenly felt a sense of comfort, which suggests that they may have been seeking physical warmth or shelter from the cold environment. Wrapping oneself in a blanket is a common way to seek comfort and warmth, especially when one is feeling chilly or vulnerable. Therefore, option (B) is the most plausible answer."
Response: 100% - Alternativ A: It became slippery.
Response: 1. Alternativ B: The coffee tasted sweet.
Response: 2) He shredded the papers.
Response: 1) The nail sunk into the wood.
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (The fisherman reeled in the fish)
"Response: 2) She got her braces off. 
The teenager was embarrassed to go to school because she finally got her braces off, which made her feel more confident and comfortable in her appearance."
"Response:  Based on the context of the sentence, it is most likely that the speaker's face lit up because they received good news (Option A). This is supported by the use of the word ""lit"" which implies a sudden and significant change in the speaker's demeanor, as well as the phrase ""good news"". In contrast, Option B does not make sense in this context as losing one's patience would not cause a noticeable change in facial expression."
"Response: 2) Alternativ B: My hands were wet. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that my hands were wet after wiping them with a towel, rather than the towel being wet. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man lost his balance on the stool due to it wobbling underneath him (Alternative A). This is supported by the fact that the stool was described as ""wobbling"" and that the man lost his balance, indicating that the stool may have been unstable or uneven. In contrast, alternative B does not provide any specific reason why the man might have lost his balance, other than a general statement about spilling paint on the stool. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that their coach cancelled practice. This is because the teammates are directing blame at each other, which suggests that there was a problem or issue within the team that needed to be addressed. It is unlikely that they lost their game, as this would not explain why the teammates are blaming each other. Therefore, option B (Their coach cancelled practice) is the most plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that (B) I achieved my goal. This is because asking for forgiveness implies that there has been a mistake or wrongdoing, and achieving one's goals is often seen as a positive outcome. Therefore, option B is the most logical choice.
"Response: 2) He talked incessantly about himself.
Explanation: From the context, it is clear that the man was not interested in getting to know the woman better and instead focused on talking about himself. This behavior is likely to make a person feel bored or uninterested in their date. Therefore, option B is the most plausible reason for why the woman became bored with her date."
"Response: 
B) Her dimples showed."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the enemy ship blew up due to a mine. Therefore, Alternative A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that he stepped on broken glass (B). This is because walking into a puddle would not typically cause a person to puncture their foot. Stepping on broken glass, however, could potentially cause this injury. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response: 2) They discovered the identity of the murderer.
Response: 2. Alternativ B: I asked for a ride.
"Response:  B: Many people faced unemployment. 
The answer is (B) Many people faced unemployment. This option best completes the sentence because it provides a specific and plausible reason for why the nation's economy might have declined, given that many people were out of work."
Response: 2) She recognized them from her neighborhood.
Response: 2) He made a sarcastic remark.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the driver was stranded on the road (Alternative A) than that they picked up a hitchhiker (Alternative B). This is because running out of gas can leave a person stranded in an unexpected location, and there may not be any other vehicles or people nearby to offer assistance.
"Response: 1) The baby was delivered. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the woman gave birth to a baby rather than experiencing morning sickness. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 2) It was windy outside.
Explanation: Based on the context of the sentence, it is more likely that the hat blew away because it was windy outside. This is supported by the fact that the weather is often a factor in determining why something might blow away, and the sentence specifically mentions that it was windy outside. Therefore, option (B) is the most likely answer."
"Response: 2) She received an invitation. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the girl received an invitation to her classmate's birthday party rather than buying a gift. This is because the passage states that ""her classmate invited her to his birthday party,"" indicating that the classmate extended an invitation to the girl."
Response:  Alternativ A (His mother took his temperature) is more likely because it is a specific and direct action that could help to reduce the boy's fever, whereas alternative B (His mother took him to the park) does not directly address the boy's medical condition.
"Response: 2) He put gel in his hair. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man put gel in his hair than to try to impress his date with cologne. This is because men often use gel to style their hair, particularly if they have thick or curly hair, whereas using cologne is not a common grooming practice for men. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
Response: 1. Alternativ A (I looked for a flashlight) is more likely to happen because it is a common action that people would take when they need light in a dark room, especially if there is no backup power source available.
"Response: 2) The mother gave birth to twins. 
The reason why the family moved into a bigger house is because the mother gave birth to twins, which means that there are now more people living in the household. This is the most likely explanation for why they needed a larger home."
"Response: 2) She saw the finish line. 
Based on the context of the passage, it is most likely that the marathoner kept at a slow pace because she saw the finish line in sight and wanted to conserve her energy for the final stretch of the race. Therefore, option (B) is the best answer."
"Response: 2) The bag of chips was stuck. 
The given information in the premise ""The boy kicked the vending machine"" suggests that there was a physical interaction between the boy and the machine, which resulted in the machine being moved or displaced. This could potentially cause the bag of chips to become stuck inside the machine. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for what happened."
Response: 1. I rolled my eyes at him.
Response: 20% - Alternativ B: Han betalte med kreditkort.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man cursed. This is because the phrase ""the man cursed"" suggests a sudden and unexpected outburst of anger or frustration, which could be caused by a variety of factors but is unlikely to be caused by something as minor as clipping one's nails or stubbing one's toe. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man's brother got accepted into law school (B). This is because the passage states that the man ""felt proud of his brother,"" which suggests that something positive and notable had happened to his brother. Getting accepted into law school would be a significant achievement for someone, and it makes sense that the man would feel proud of his brother for this reason. In contrast, getting in an argument with one's parents (A) does not seem as likely or significant enough to cause the man to feel pride in his brother."
Response:  Alternativ A (She went to the library) is more likely because learning about the solar system typically involves studying books or other educational materials rather than looking directly at the stars, which are not a reliable source of information on this topic.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that Alternative B (I put tape on the back of the poster) is the correct answer. This is because the passage states that ""the poster was stuck to the wall,"" which suggests that some form of adhesive or fastening material was used to attach the poster to the wall. Tape is a common type of fastening material that could be used for this purpose. In contrast, Alternative A (I positioned the poster above the door) does not provide any information about how the poster was attached to the wall. Therefore, Alternative B is the most likely explanation for why the poster was stuck to the wall."
"Response: 
B) The architect adjusted the plans. 
This is more likely because it provides a logical explanation for why the client approved the architect's plans, which was to make changes to them. Adjusting the plans would allow the architect to modify the design in response to feedback or new requirements, making it more likely that the client would approve the revised plans."
Response: 2) His hand was shaking.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the board of directors found a replacement for the CEO (B). The reason is that the resignation of the CEO does not necessarily mean that the company will be dissolved. It is common for companies to have a succession plan in place, which includes identifying and grooming potential replacements for key positions, including the CEO. Therefore, it is more likely that the board of directors would actively seek out and appoint a new CEO rather than simply dissolving the company.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that you went to the front of the room (B) than sat in the back row (A).
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that he was released from jail because his family paid his bail. Therefore, Alternative A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that their house caught fire (B). This is because there is no mention of them selling their house (A), and the phrase ""lost all their belongings"" implies that something unexpected and catastrophic happened to their property."
Response:  Based on my understanding of the situation, it is more likely that the can got crushed. Stomping on an aluminum can with force is likely to cause damage to its structure and lead to its deformation or breakage. Therefore, option B is the more plausible outcome.
"Response: 2) She learned communication skills. 
The given premise states that ""the girl joined the debate team,"" which implies that she developed certain skills or abilities related to public speaking and argumentation. Of these two alternatives, option (B) ""She learned communication skills"" is more likely as it directly relates to the activity of debating and the development of those skills. Option (A) ""She learned to use a computer"" does not have the same direct connection to the topic of debating."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the improvement in your mood was caused by listening to music (A). This is because research has shown that listening to music can have a positive impact on mental health and well-being, including improving mood. In contrast, doing the dishes may not necessarily improve one's mood, although it could potentially provide a sense of accomplishment or relief from a task. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
Response:  I think that Alternative A (They fed the homeless) is more likely to be the correct answer because it is a direct and practical way for the charity to achieve its fundraising goal. Feeding the homeless can help to improve their well-being, which in turn can increase their ability to contribute financially to the charity's cause. Additionally, feeding the homeless can be done at a relatively low cost compared to other methods of fundraising, such as holding an auction. Therefore, I believe that Alternative A is the most likely option.
Response: 2) The passengers screamed.
Response: 1. Alternativ A: I checked the mailbox upon leaving the house.
"Response:  Alternativ B: He got up early. 
The sentence ""He got up early"" is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a clear and specific reason for why the man wanted to watch the sunrise, which is that he wanted to get an early start in order to see it. In contrast, ""He travelled north"" does not provide any information about why the man wanted to watch the sunrise, and could potentially be true regardless of whether or not he watched it. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response: 1. Alternativ A, jeg recyclingede papiret.
"Response: 
B: Leaders of other countries sent emergency relief. 
This is the more likely outcome as it addresses the immediate need for aid and support in the aftermath of a natural disaster, rather than forming an alliance that may take time to organize and implement."
"Response: 2) He fell into the pool.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the sentence, it is more likely that the boy fell into the pool rather than climbing out of it."
"Response:  Alternativ B: He borrowed it from a friend. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the student borrowed the book from a friend rather than returning it to the library."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the criminal was executed. This is because the text states that ""the criminal was executed,"" which implies a final and irreversible punishment for their crime. In contrast, being thrown in jail or being convicted of murder do not necessarily imply such a severe punishment. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that sunlight entered the room through the open door (B). This is because opening the door would allow sunlight to enter the room directly from outside, whereas opening the curtains would only allow indirect sunlight to enter the room through the window. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for how sunlight entered the room.
Response: 1. Her wig came off.
"Response: 2) He deemed the sentence unclear.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the editor deemed the sentence unclear rather than finding the manuscript compelling. This is because the editor specifically mentioned that they reworded the sentence, which suggests that there was something wrong with the original sentence. Additionally, the fact that the editor felt the need to change the sentence implies that it was not clear or effective as written."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she realized the card was expired. This is because there is no mention of the card being lost or stolen, and the fact that she canceled her account suggests that she had possession of the card at some point. Therefore, it is more probable that she simply forgot to renew the card before it expired rather than realizing it was missing.
Response: 2) They got married.
Response: 1. I turned up the volume.
"Response: 2) The girl pulled it.
Explanation: Based on the context, it is more likely that the girl pulled the boy's hair rather than ruffling it. Pulling implies a stronger and more deliberate action compared to ruffling, which can be done carelessly or accidentally."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B (I stepped on the bug) is the correct answer. This is because the sentence ""The bug got squashed"" implies that the bug was crushed or flattened, which is consistent with stepping on something small and soft like a bug. In contrast, spraying oneself with bug repellent would not typically result in the bug being squashed or killed."
Response:  Based on the context of the sentence, it is most likely that the speaker opened their eyes after waking up. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
Response: 1. Asked him to turn it down. (A)
"Response: 2) He earned below minimum wage.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the man's family lived in poverty because he earned below minimum wage. This suggests that he did not have enough money to provide for his family's basic needs, which can lead to poverty. In contrast, being frugal with one's earnings does not necessarily mean that someone will live in poverty."
"Response: 2) He took up a hobby. 
Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the student took up a hobby after graduating from the university rather than looking for a job."
"Response: 
B) The paint turned green."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason for changing the topic of conversation was because I ran out of things to talk about. Therefore, the answer is (A) I ran out of things to talk about.
Response: 1. I welcomed him back home.
Response:  Alternativ A (The opening scene of the play began) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a clear and specific context for the action described in the sentence, whereas Alternative B does not provide any information about the context or purpose of the actors exiting the stage.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage (Alternative A). This is because the text states that the hostage ""submitted to the kidnapper's mandates,"" which suggests that the hostage was forced to comply with the kidnapper's demands out of fear or coercion. Threatening to hurt the hostage would be a common tactic used by kidnappers to gain control and extract concessions from their victims."
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that Alternative B (The musician pounded the drum) is the correct answer. The phrase ""reverberated across the stage"" suggests a loud and powerful sound, which aligns with the idea of the musician pounding the drum rather than tapping their foot."
Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that the child woke up screaming from a nightmare (A). This is supported by the fact that the parents rushed to the child's bedroom, which suggests that something urgent and frightening had occurred. There is no indication in the passage that the child was afraid to look under her bed, so this alternative is less likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the woman was born deaf (B). This is because the passage states that she ""communicated with sign language,"" which suggests that she had difficulty hearing or was completely deaf from birth. In contrast, being born premature (A) does not necessarily affect a person's ability to hear or communicate. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the crops perished due to the drought (B). This is because a drought can cause plants to dry out and die, leading to crop failure. While contamination of the water supply could also have negative effects on crops, it would not necessarily lead to their complete destruction. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for what happened in the region.
Response: Ønsker du at vide, hvordan jeg har fundet svaret?
"Response: 2) School let out for the summer. 
Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the girl switched schools because school let out for the summer. This is supported by the fact that the text states ""the girl switched schools,"" which implies that she made a deliberate decision to move to a different school. Additionally, the mention of ""summer"" suggests that the change occurred during the summer break, when schools typically close for several weeks or months. Therefore, Alternative B is the best answer."
"Response: 
B) The employees went on strike. 
This is the more likely outcome because it is a direct action that the employees can take to pressure the owner to increase their wages. Going on strike is a common tactic used by workers to negotiate better working conditions and pay. It is a visible and disruptive act that can draw attention to the issue and put pressure on the owner to make concessions. In contrast, appointing a new manager may not have as much of an impact on the owner's decision-making process or lead to immediate changes in employee compensation."
"Response: 
B: The extremists assassinated him. 
This answer choice is more likely because it directly and concisely explains how the leader was killed by the extremists, providing a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the two events. In contrast, alternative A does not provide a direct explanation for how the leader was influenced by the extremists, and alternative B provides a more straightforward and logical explanation for why the leader was killed."
"Response:  Alternativ A, Sand stuck to my feet. 
For this sentence, alternative A is more likely because it better describes the sensation of walking barefoot on a sandy beach. The other option, waves crashing along the shore, does not necessarily have an impact on how one feels while walking on the beach."
Response: ø
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that Alternative B (Her son whined) is the correct answer. The sentence ""The mother hushed her son"" implies that there was a disturbance or noise made by the son, and the use of the word ""whined"" suggests that he may have been complaining or making a fuss. In contrast, Alternative A (""Her son smirked"") does not fit with the tone of the sentence and seems less plausible given the context."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the hole ripped in your jeans due to you tripping on the pavement (B). This is because the sentence mentions ""a hole ripped in my jeans,"" which suggests a sudden and unexpected tear, rather than a deliberate action like zipping up the jeans (A). Additionally, the phrase ""tripped on the pavement"" implies an accidental fall, which could cause damage to clothing."
Response: 2. Alternativ B: Hans tænder blev rettet.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative A (I woke up today with sore muscles) is true. This is because working out at the gym can cause muscle soreness, especially if you are new to exercise or have increased the intensity of your workout. On the other hand, waking up with a sore throat could be caused by various factors such as allergies, cold, or sinus infection, which may not be directly related to exercising at the gym. Therefore, Alternative A is more plausible based on the given information.
"Response:  Alternativ B: Other students at the lunch table felt left out. 
Begrundelse:  The sentence ""The girl whispered back and forth to each other"" implies that there are multiple girls involved in the conversation, which suggests that they are all sitting together at the same table. Therefore, alternative B is more likely as it implies that other students at the table feel left out of the conversation."
Response: 2) Alternativ B: She decided to try to do a flip.
"Response: 2. Alternativ B: The post office expedited the letter. 
Because ""expedited"" means to move or handle something quickly, it is more likely that the post office moved the letter quickly and efficiently, resulting in a faster delivery time."
Response: 2) He went home broke.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the forest fire spread due to strong winds (Option A). This is supported by the statement ""the winds became stronger,"" which suggests that the fire was able to spread more quickly and easily as a result of the increased wind speed. In contrast, while the arrest of arsonists could potentially lead to the suppression of a fire, there is no indication in the passage that this occurred in this case. Therefore, Option A is the best answer."
Response: 2) His mother put a bandage on the wound.
"Response: 2) He received an organ transplant. 
The text states that ""the man survived the deadly illness,"" which suggests that he was in a life-threatening situation and needed medical intervention to recover. The mention of an organ transplant as a possible reason for his survival implies that this is what saved his life, rather than simply signing his will. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response: 1. I bit my tongue.
"Response: 2) The writer missed an important deadline.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the writer missed an important deadline than that she avoided bias in her stories. The fact that the editor fired the writer suggests that there was a problem with the quality of their work, and missing a deadline could be a reason for this."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the speaker felt exhausted because they studied all day (B). The sentence ""I felt exhausted"" suggests that the speaker's energy levels were depleted, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as lack of sleep or excessive mental effort. While it is possible that the speaker may have slept all day and still feel exhausted (A), studying all day seems more plausible given the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B (She prescribed pills to the patient) is the correct answer. This is because the physician's diagnosis and treatment plan are closely related, and it makes sense that the physician would prescribe medication based on the patient's symptoms. Alternative A (She identified the patient's symptoms) does not provide enough evidence to support a conclusion about the physician's actions or the outcome of the examination.
Response: 2) It felt itchy.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man suffered a heart attack (B). This is because an emergency surgery is typically performed in response to a medical emergency such as a heart attack, rather than due to loss of temper (A).
"Response:  Alternativ B: He rubbed his arms. 
The sentence implies that the man was massaging or rubbing his own arms, which is a common way to relax and relieve tension in one's body. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response: 2) He felt discouraged.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that (B) I believed that he knew better. This is because the speaker mentions that they ""excused"" their colleague's mistake, which implies that they did not believe that he was genuinely unaware of what he had done. Instead, they seem to have assumed that he should have known better and made a conscious effort to cover for him."
"Response:  Alternativ B: He started waking up earlier. 
The man quitting smoking is a significant change in his lifestyle, and it's likely that he would experience some positive effects as a result. Waking up earlier is also a significant change, but it may not have the same immediate impact on his health as quitting smoking. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for any improvements in the man's health."
Response: ø
"Response: 2) Alternativ B: The man was losing the game.
Explanation: From the information provided, it is more likely that the man was losing the game because if he had hit the target, he would have scored a point and gained ground in the game. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the dart missed the bull's eye."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason for the homeowner's request was Alternative A: He discovered rats in the basement. This is because the statement mentions ""his house"" and ""basement,"" which suggests that there is a problem with pests in the home. Additionally, the wording of the sentence implies that the homeowner has recently become aware of the issue, as he has requested an exterminator to come to his house."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B is the correct answer. The speaker suggests going out to dinner with their houseguest, which implies that they are still hosting them and have not yet asked them to leave. Therefore, option B is the most plausible explanation for why the speaker did not suggest cooking something themselves.
Response: 2) She got a new diary.
Response: 2) She quit her job.
"Response: 2) He patted the puppy's head.
Explanation:
The sentence ""The child's hand quickly recoiled"" suggests that the child was startled or surprised by something, and this is supported by the alternative answer choice (B) He patted the puppy's head. This action would likely cause the child to recoil in surprise, as it is an unexpected touch. In contrast, option A (He touched the hot stove) does not provide a clear reason for the child's reaction of recoiling."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (distributing a survey to customers) will have the desired effect of gauging customer satisfaction. Offering a discount to new customers may generate some short-term interest and excitement, but it does not directly provide insight into existing customers' satisfaction levels. By distributing a survey, the company can gather valuable feedback from its current customers, which can help identify areas for improvement and inform future marketing strategies.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the boy dragged a chair across the floor (B). This is because the phrase ""the floor became scratched"" suggests that something heavy or rough was moved across the surface of the floor, which could have caused the scratches. In contrast, throwing cushions off a couch would not typically cause significant damage to the floor. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that (B) My enemy cocked a fist was the reason for shielding one's face. The sentence suggests that the speaker took defensive action in response to an imminent attack from their enemy, which aligns with the meaning of ""cocking a fist."" Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the statue was struck by lightning. This is because the passage states that ""the famous statue burned down,"" which suggests that an external force caused the destruction of the statue, rather than any internal or natural cause such as decay or veneration by people. Lightning is a common cause of fires and can easily destroy large structures like statues, making it the most probable explanation for why the statue burned down. Therefore, Alternative A (it was struck by lightning) is the best answer."
Response: 2) B - Flies swarmed the fruit.
"Response: 2) She twisted her ankle.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the ballerina twisted her ankle than pointed her toes. Twisting one's ankle can cause a torn ligament, which is what happened in this scenario. Pointing one's toes does not typically result in such an injury."
"Response: 2) He ran around on the playground. 
Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the child's shoelaces came undone because he was running around on the playground rather than learning how to tie them."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that you lost track of time while reading the book (B). The sentence ""I became enthralled in the book"" suggests that you were fully engaged and absorbed in the story, which could cause you to lose track of time. In contrast, returning a book implies that you had previously borrowed or owned the book, which does not fit with the context of becoming enthralled in it. Therefore, option B is the more plausible explanation for why you did not notice how much time passed while reading the book."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man's parents influenced him. This is because the passage states that he ""held similar beliefs to those of his parents,"" which suggests that they had a significant impact on his worldview. There is no indication in the passage that the man was disowned by his parents, so this alternative is less likely. Therefore, the answer is (A) His parents influenced him."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the sentence, it is most likely that the car stopped because the driver fell asleep. Therefore, the answer is (B) The driver fell asleep.
"Response:  Alternativ B: The ice cream dripped from the cone. 
For this sentence, it is more likely that the ice cream dripped from the cone because the phrase ""in the sun"" suggests a warm and melty condition for the ice cream, which could cause it to lose its shape and drip down the cone."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason why the room looked uninviting was because the walls looked bare (B). This is because hanging artwork on the walls can help to make a room look more inviting and visually appealing. On the other hand, if the carpet looks dirty, it may contribute to an uninviting atmosphere, but it is not the primary reason given in the passage. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that my boss held a meeting (B). This is because leaving work early without any other reason may be unusual or unexpected, but having a meeting with one's boss is a more common and plausible explanation for leaving work early. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response: 2) The owner gave the puppy a treat.
Response: 1. Alternativ A: My friend forgave me.
"Response: 2) He wore a neon vest. 
Based on the context of the sentence, it is most likely that the man stood out in the crowd because he was wearing a neon vest. This is supported by the fact that the sentence specifically mentions the man standing out in the crowd, and the word ""vest"" implies something bright or eye-catching. In contrast, carrying a backpack does not necessarily make someone stand out in a crowd, as many people carry backpacks for various reasons. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response: 
B: He was charged with perjury. 
The witness's lie had serious consequences, as he was now facing criminal charges for perjury. This option is more likely to occur because it highlights the legal and ethical implications of lying under oath in a court of law."
"Response: 2) She wanted to blend in.
Explanation: Based on the context of the sentence, it is more likely that the woman dyed her hair to blend in with other people rather than to get a new look. This is because the sentence mentions that she ""wanted to blend in,"" which suggests that she was trying to conform to societal norms or standards. In contrast, ""She wanted a new look"" does not provide any specific reason why the woman would want to change her appearance. Therefore, option B is the most plausible answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that they were deported (B) than that they found employment (A). This is because the text states that they were ""caught illegally residing"" in the country, which suggests that they did not have legal permission to be there and therefore would not have been able to find employment. Additionally, the use of the word ""deported"" implies a formal action taken by the authorities, whereas ""found employment"" does not carry the same connotation of official intervention."
Response: 2) Alternativ B: The audience stood up.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the sun blinded me than that it tanned my skin. This is because looking directly at the sun can cause temporary blindness or eye damage due to the intense light and heat emitted by the sun, while tanning occurs as a result of exposure to UV radiation over an extended period of time. Therefore, option A (The sun blinded me) is the more plausible explanation for what happened.
"Response: 
B: I yawned."
Response: 2) The knife was dull.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the woman acquired massive debt (B). This is because the statement ""the woman declared bankruptcy"" implies that she was unable to pay her debts and had to seek protection from creditors through bankruptcy proceedings. Receiving alimony payments (A) would not necessarily lead to bankruptcy, as these payments are typically made by one spouse to another after a divorce or separation and do not contribute directly to overall debt levels."
Response: 1. Alternativ A (I wondered if he was out)
"Response: 
B: I picked up the flower's scent. 
For this sentence, option B is more likely to be the correct answer because it better fits the context of the situation described in the premise. When you put a flower under your nose, you are likely to smell its fragrance rather than have the petals come off. Therefore, option B is the more plausible response."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the woman felt nostalgic because she ran into a childhood friend. This is supported by the phrase ""She ran into a childhood friend,"" which suggests that something unexpected and happy happened to trigger her feelings of nostalgia. In contrast, the phrase ""She yelled at her children"" does not provide any context or explanation for why the woman might feel nostalgic, and seems out of place in the passage. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  I would say that it is more likely that he submitted the paper incomplete, rather than submitting it early. This is because procrastination often leads to a lack of attention and effort in completing tasks, which can result in poor quality work or missed deadlines. Therefore, it is more plausible that the student did not complete the assignment fully, rather than submitting it ahead of time.
"Response:  B: I called a mechanic. 
Dette svaret er korrekt! Med Alternativ B ""I called a mechanic"" gives you more chance of getting the conversation going in a positive direction, as it provides an opportunity for further discussion about fixing the car and finding a solution."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason for discarding the note was that it was anonymous (A). The fact that the speaker did not recognize the handwriting suggests that the note was not from someone they knew personally, and therefore could have been written by anyone. This makes option A the most plausible explanation for why the speaker discarded the note.
Response: 2) It ascended upwards.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason why I parked in the driveway is because the garage was full. Therefore, the answer is (B).
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the victim (B) put his hands up than the criminal (A) putting down the gun. This is because the victim's action of putting his hands up suggests a desire to defuse the situation and avoid harm, while the criminal's act of aiming the gun indicates a deliberate attempt to cause harm. Therefore, option B is the more plausible response.
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that the speaker was looking forward to attending their friend's wedding (B). The sentence mentions ""the weekend,"" which implies that the event is taking place over a period of time rather than being a one-time occurrence like a funeral. Additionally, the tone of the sentence suggests excitement and anticipation, which would be more appropriate for a joyful occasion like a wedding than a sad one like a funeral."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the speaker lost track of time due to daydreaming (A). This is because the phrase ""I lost track of time"" suggests a lack of focus or attention, which aligns with the idea of daydreaming. Additionally, there is no mention of any other factors that might cause someone to lose track of time, such as nausea. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason for the illegible printing is a lack of ink (Option A). This is because the printer running out of ink can cause the text to appear blurry or distorted, which is consistent with the description of the printed-out document being ""illegibly"". On the other hand, a lack of paper would not necessarily result in an illegible document, as the text could still be legible even if it is printed on a blank page. Therefore, Option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the fans rushed the field (B). The fact that the stadium played the national anthem suggests a formal and structured event, which could lead to a more organized response from the fans such as rushing the field. Turning to the flag (A) may be less likely in this scenario as it would require a more deliberate action.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that option B (I put salt in it) caused the taste to be bland. Adding too much salt can make food taste bland or unappetizing. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
A) The towel absorbed the liquid."
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""She bookmarked her page"". This is more likely to happen as it provides a clear and logical explanation for why the woman was interrupted while reading her book."
Response: 2) The man looked out the window.
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that the girl poked the boy (B). This is because the sentence mentions the boy flinching, which suggests that he was unexpectedly touched or prodded by something. Additionally, the phrase ""ignored him"" does not provide any evidence to suggest that the girl did anything other than poke the boy. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the doctors amputated the patient's leg (Alternative A). This is because the phrase ""the doctors gave the patient an artificial limb"" implies that the patient had a missing limb to begin with, which would only be the case if they had undergone an amputation. Therefore, Alternative A is the most plausible explanation for why the doctors gave the patient an artificial limb."
"Response: 
B) She jerked her arm away from him."
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that the speaker valued their friend's opinion (alternative A). The sentence ""I asked my friend for advice"" implies that the speaker sought their friend's input and considered it valuable. Therefore, alternative A is the best answer."
Response: 2) The mud hit him in the face.
Response: 100% - Alternativ A is more likely to happen because schools are a common place for people, especially children, to gather and be affected by the weather conditions. As such, it's more likely that schools would shut down in response to heavy snowfall than for people to hide underground.
"Response: 
B: He threatened to quit the job. 
The threat of quitting is more likely to be effective in this situation because it gives the employer a direct ultimatum and creates pressure to address the issue immediately. Threatening to quit can motivate the employer to take action to prevent the employee from leaving, such as providing additional support or accommodations to help them manage their workload."
Response: 2) The tree fell onto the roof.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the wood split in half because you swung the axe down to it (B). This is because the action of swinging an axe down towards a piece of wood can cause it to split or break apart. In contrast, simply stacking the wood in a fireplace would not necessarily cause it to split in half. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the couple announced that they were having a baby (B). This is because the sentence ""The family congratulated the couple"" suggests that something happy and exciting has happened, which would be consistent with the announcement of a pregnancy rather than a separation."
Response: 2) She liked him.
Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that I nodded my head in agreement with my friend's statement. Therefore, the answer is (B) I agreed with him.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the prompt, it is most likely that Alternative B (They wanted to make a fair decision) is the correct answer. This is because the friends are described as ""flipping a coin,"" which suggests a random and impartial process for making a decision. It is unlikely that they would use this method if their goal was simply to find a compromise between two options. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that they wanted to make a fair decision based solely on chance."
"Response:  Alternativ B: The man took the pizza out of the oven. 
The sentence ""The timer in the kitchen went off"" suggests that something happened in the kitchen, and since the man is taking a pizza out of the oven, it is more likely that he heard the timer go off while preparing or cooking the pizza."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that she worked hard (B) than that she slacked off (A). This is because setting an ambitious goal and working towards achieving it requires effort and dedication, which suggests that she put in a lot of work to achieve her objective.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the wealthy man's son inherited his fortune rather than getting into legal trouble. This is because there is no indication in the passage that the son was involved in any illegal activities or troubles. On the other hand, it is mentioned that the wealthy man died of old age, which suggests that he had lived a long and successful life, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that he had accumulated a significant amount of wealth during his lifetime, which would have been passed down to his son upon his death. Therefore, Alternative B is the more probable outcome.
Response: ø
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she got in a car accident. This is because there are no other reasons given for why her car might be in the shop, and getting in a car accident is a common reason why people might need to have their cars repaired. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
Response: ø
"Response: 
A) Cameras flashed in his direction. 
B) His family attended the press conference. 
Retsforståelse:  The given sentence is a simple past tense sentence, and it describes an action that happened in the past. In this case, the public figure stepped out of the limousine, which caused cameras to flash in his direction. Therefore, Alternative A is more likely to be true."
"Response: 2) Alternativ B: The bathwater drained out of the tub. 
The woman lingered in the bathtub, and as she did, the water began to drain out of the tub."
"Response:  Alternativ B: He majored in engineering. 
The effect is more likely because joining a fraternity may not provide many opportunities to meet other students on campus, especially if the individual has limited interaction with members of their own fraternity. On the other hand, majoring in engineering can provide numerous opportunities to interact with other students through class projects and group work, as well as through extracurricular activities such as hackathons or robotics competitions. Therefore, it is more likely that the college student will meet other students on campus by majoring in engineering than by joining a fraternity."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that you were rearranging the living room (B). The sentence ""I lifted up the couch cushions"" suggests that you were tidying or organizing something in the living room, rather than searching for something specific like loose change."
Response: Ønsker du at vise et spørgsmål til mig?
"Response: 1) Alternativ A is more likely.
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the woman was sentenced to perform community service rather than being put on death row. Community service is a common punishment for misdemeanors, while death row is typically reserved for more serious crimes. Therefore, alternative A is more probable."
Response: 1. Alternativ B: The sugar dissolved.
"Response: 2) He was injured in battle. 
Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the veteran was injured in battle rather than being drafted for the war. The sentence ""The veteran walked with a limp"" suggests that he sustained an injury during his military service, which is more consistent with the alternative option (B)."
Response: 2) The police chased the criminal.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the laptop would not turn on because you dropped it. Therefore, Alternative A (I dropped it) is the correct answer.
"Response: 2) She folded her laundry. 
Explanation: Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the woman folded her laundry instead of acquiring an extensive wardrobe. This is because running out of space in one's closet often leads to the need to organize and declutter, which may involve folding or sorting through clothes."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man's wife left him, which is option B. This is because there is no indication in the passage that his wife gave birth, and the fact that he is described as ""heartbroken"" suggests that something negative has happened to him, such as his wife leaving him."
"Response: 2) His job offer was rescinded. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the man's job offer was rescinded than that he became qualified for the job he wanted. The passage states that the man ""obtained a degree,"" which suggests that he met the educational requirement for the job he applied for. However, it does not mention anything about him being offered the job or his qualifications being recognized by the employer. Therefore, option B (his job offer was rescinded) is more plausible."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the prompt, it is most likely that Alternative B (He spoke into the microphone) is the correct answer. This is because the sentence states that ""the man's voice projected clearly throughout the auditorium,"" which suggests that he was using a microphone to amplify his voice. Greeting the audience would not necessarily result in his voice being heard throughout the entire auditorium. Therefore, Alternative B is the best explanation for how the man's voice could have been heard so clearly."
Response: 100% af gange, jeg tog en koin til fontænen, sank den i vandet. Derfor er Alternativ A mest sandsynligt.
Response: 100% af spillerne vil vælge Alternativ A, da dette er den mest sandsynlige udgang i situationen.
Response: 1. I hiccuped.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the customer left his headlights on (B). This is because there is no indication in the passage that the customer used counterfeit money (A), and leaving one's headlights on is a common mistake or oversight that could result in a call to security.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B (I accidentally threw away my shopping list) is the correct answer. This is because taking out the garbage does not typically result in throwing away a shopping list, and there is no indication in the premise that the garbage caused any unpleasant odors or other issues in the kitchen.
Response: 2) Alternativ B: The children chased the animals.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man's lungs were congested (B). This is because a loud breathing sound can be caused by many factors, including respiratory problems such as congestion or pneumonia. In contrast, a failure of the kidneys (Option A) would not typically cause a noticeable change in breathing sounds.
"Response: 100% - Alternativ B: I asked my friend if he was interested in going. 
Dette svaret baserer sig på, at det er mere sandsynligt, at en person vil spørge sin ven om han er interesseret i at deltage i et event, end at de ville spørge ham om instruktioner til stedet."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (I opened the windows) will have a greater effect than Alternative A (I brought out blankets). This is because opening the windows allows for better ventilation and cooling of the room through natural means, whereas bringing out blankets only provides additional warmth to the room without addressing the underlying issue of the broken air conditioner. Therefore, option B is the more effective solution.
"Response: 2) His backpack was heavy. 
Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the boy's back ached because his backpack was heavy."
Response: 1) I baked her a cake. (B)
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the squirrels (B) dug up the bulbs. This is because the text specifically mentions ""the daffodils in the garden,"" which suggests a specific location where they are growing, and also implies that something happened to them in this location. Additionally, the mention of ""bulbs"" being affected suggests that the cause was related to digging or excavation, which is more plausible than a bee stinging someone (A)."
Response: 1. Alternativ B: The match produced a flame.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason for the dispute being settled was because the parties did not want to continue debating in court (Alternative A). This is supported by the fact that the parties were able to reach an agreement without going through the legal process. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the children were sent to an orphanage because their parents died. This is supported by the statement ""their parents died,"" which implies that the children are now without a parental figure and need to be cared for elsewhere. While alternative (B) suggests that the parents may have spoiled the children, this is not explicitly mentioned in the passage and does not provide as much evidence as option (A). Therefore, option (A) is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that a tsunami occurred (B) than that it began to hail (A). This is because a meteorite landing in the ocean would not typically cause a tsunami, but could potentially cause a large wave or disturbance in the water. Hailing, on the other hand, is a weather phenomenon that occurs when updrafts in thunderstorms carry water droplets up into the upper atmosphere and freeze them into small balls of ice. While it is possible for hail to occur near the ocean, it is less likely to be associated with a meteorite landing in the ocean.
Response: ø
Response: 100% af stemmerne skal være til Alternativ A, da dette er den eneste mulige årsag til at ovenen blev varm.
Response: 1) The lemon got moldy.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the country colonized the new land (B). This is because the discovery of new land typically leads to its exploration and settlement by a nation or group of people, rather than abandonment or rejection of it.
Response: 100% - Alternativ A: It shattered all over the floor.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the floor was uneven (alternative A). This is because the table wobbled, which suggests that there was an irregularity in the surface beneath it. There is no mention of any slippery substance or other factor that could have caused the table to wobble, so option A is the most plausible explanation.
"Response: 
B: The father trusted his son. 
For this scenario, it is more likely that the father trusted his son rather than the son confessing the truth. This is because the father has already discovered that his son was lying and has chosen to trust him despite this. It is also possible that the father may have been testing his son's honesty by asking if he had lied, in which case the son's response of ""no"" would be a lie, but the father still chooses to trust him."
"Response: 2. He took aspirin. 
Bemærkning:  Aspirin kan lindre hovedpine, mens cough syrup ikke har denne virkning."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is most likely that the train slowed down because it was running behind schedule. Therefore, the answer is (B) It was running behind schedule.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man's mental health issues were caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, rather than just one single cause. Therefore, the answer is (A) Mental illness runs in his family.
"Response:  Based on the context, it is most likely that she choked on her food (B). The sentence ""The woman clutched her throat"" suggests that she experienced difficulty breathing or choking after consuming something, which aligns with the alternative answer choice (B). Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response: 1) Her voice sounded raspy.
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (It drooled)
Response: 20% - Alternativ B: She became wealthy.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason for the students exiting the classroom was the ringing of the bell (Option A). This is because there is no mention of any other factor that could have caused the students to leave the classroom at that time. In contrast, while homework may be assigned by the teacher, this does not necessarily result in the students leaving the classroom immediately. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the students left the classroom.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (Her acquaintances related to her) is true because the passage states that ""her acquaintances were not surprised"" and ""they had heard similar stories before."" This suggests that they were familiar with the idea of ghosts and were not quick to dismiss the woman's claim as absurd. Therefore, Alternative B is more probable than Alternative A."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man's hearing loss was caused by the explosion (B). This is because the text states that he ""was nearly killed in an explosion,"" which suggests that the explosion had a significant impact on him and could have resulted in permanent damage to his hearing. In contrast, while drowning can also cause hearing loss, it is less likely given the context of the situation."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the balloon rose into the air than that it deflated. Therefore, I would choose option B.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man had a stroke (A). This is because a stroke is a medical condition that can cause sudden loss of speech and other cognitive difficulties. Taking a deep breath (B) would not necessarily result in the man losing his ability to speak.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she tripped on something (A). While hearing one's name being called could potentially cause someone to trip or lose their balance, there is no indication in the passage that this occurred. Additionally, the mention of a ""crack in the cement"" does not provide any additional context that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response: 100% - Alternativ B: The man soaked the lifeguard.
Response: 1. My infection cleared up.
Response: 2) The driver honked his horn.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B (I placed the container on the hot stove) caused the plastic container to melt. This is because exposing a plastic container to direct heat can cause it to soften and eventually melt. Soaking the container in warm water may not have been enough to cause it to melt, as the temperature change would be less dramatic than placing it directly on a hot surface. Therefore, Alternative B is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the driver ran a red light (B). This is because hitting a telephone pole (A) would not typically cause a dent in the car, and running a red light is a common cause of accidents.
Response: 2. Alternativ B: Han passer eksamen.
"Response: 2) The lifeguard was on duty. 
Based on the context, it is most likely that the reason the young boy clings to the ledge of the pool is because he fears learning to swim. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer."
Response: 100% - Alternativ B: My heart rate sped up.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Alternative B (My office was noisy) caused the disturbance. This is because the sentence states that ""the building adjacent to my office was under construction,"" which could potentially cause a lot of noise. Additionally, the sentence does not provide any information about the crowd in the office being loud or disruptive. Therefore, Alternative B is the more plausible explanation for the disturbance."
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to have the desired effect. Inviting the neighbors over for dinner is a direct and personal way of getting to know them, whereas waving from a distance may not be as effective in initiating a conversation or building relationships.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the swimmer dove into the pool (A). This is because water was splashed up from the pool, indicating that someone or something had entered the pool and caused the water to move. Diving is a common action taken by swimmers when entering a pool, whereas floating is less likely as it would not cause the same amount of movement in the water. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that you accidentally chipped your tooth (B) than that you swallowed a seed (A). This is because the sensation of biting into something hard and feeling pain in your mouth is more consistent with chipping a tooth than with swallowing a small object like a seed.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that his shoelaces were untied. This is because a trip can be caused by many factors, but an untied shoelace is more specific and directly related to the event of the boy tripping. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that she got her ears pierced (B). This is because the passage states that ""she put earplugs in,"" which suggests that she may have been trying to block out noise or discomfort caused by something else, rather than being distracted by noise as suggested in Alternative A."
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that Alternative B (I kept it in the fridge) is the correct answer. This is because refilling a water bottle typically involves pouring new water into an empty bottle, rather than drinking all of the existing water inside. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker kept their water bottle in the fridge to keep it cold and fresh.
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the television show was censored because it contained vulgar language. This is supported by the fact that the speaker mentions ""vulgar language"" as one of the reasons for which the show was censored. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer."
Response:  I would say that Alternative B is more likely, as it provides a specific and plausible reason for the shipwreck. While Alternative A is also possible, it does not provide any concrete evidence or details to support the claim. Therefore, I believe that Alternative B is the more likely explanation for why the ship wrecked.
"Response: 
A) He solved the riddle."
Response: 2) The man picked up the phone.
"Response: 
B: I felt uncomfortable. 
For this sentence, the more likely outcome is option B: ""I felt uncomfortable."" This is because the woman's gaze can make the speaker feel self-conscious or uneasy, and it is a common human response to feel uncomfortable in such situations."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that they viewed all the exhibits (B). This is because the sentence ""The group left the museum"" implies that they spent some time at the museum and therefore had a chance to view all the exhibits. Taking pictures of the exhibits (A) does not necessarily imply that they viewed all the exhibits, as they may have taken pictures without actually seeing everything in the museum."
Response: 2) My friend stood up for me.
Response:  Alternativ A is more likely to have caused the tire to go flat again because it did not address the underlying cause of the flat tire, which was a puncture or leak in the tube. Pumping air into the tire will only temporarily inflate the tire and may not fix the problem.
Response: 1. Alternativ A: Her father read her a story.
Response: 100% af gange, jeg har brugt en pencil i stedet for en pen, når den var ude af kul.
Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the man was in debt (Alternative A). This is because being denied a loan suggests that the man may have had credit issues or financial problems, which could lead to him being in debt. Starting a business (Alternative B) does not provide any insight into his financial situation and could potentially be unrelated to why he was denied a loan.
"Response: 2) She had chicken pox. 
Based on the information provided in the passage, it is most likely that the girl stayed home from school because she had chicken pox. This is supported by the statement ""She had chicken pox"" which is listed as an alternative to the main premise. Therefore, option (2) is the best answer."
Response: 100% - Alternativ A (I took it to the dumpster)
"Response:  Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason for the mess in the living room is because of my dog shedding hair. This is supported by the fact that the speaker has a dog and mentions ""hair"" in relation to the mess. On the other hand, neither alternative A nor B provides any evidence or context that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response: 2) He threw a chair across the room.
Response: 1) Alternativ A: The twig burned.
"Response: 2) He couldn't find a towel. 
The reason why the man got out of the shower is because he couldn't find a towel, not because the hot water was gone (alternative A)."
"Response:  Alternativ A is more likely. 
Explanation:  Playing outside can be beneficial for children's physical and mental health, but it may not directly lead to attending college. On the other hand, setting aside a savings fund specifically for tuition can provide financial support for higher education. Therefore, option A is more likely to help the children attend college."
"Response:  Alternativ A, ""The shoes loosened"", is more likely to be the correct answer because it better fits the context of the sentence and the meaning of the verb ""unlace"". When you unlace something, you are supposed to undo the laces, making them loose. Therefore, option A is a more logical choice."
Response: 2) He saved the recipe.
"Response: 
A) I put ice on it. 
B) I rubbed lotion on it. 
Grunnen til svaret er, at putting ice on the ankle can help reduce swelling by constricting blood vessels and reducing inflammation, while rubbing lotion on the ankle may not have a significant impact on reducing swelling."
Response: 2) I overheard the conversation in the hall.
Response:  B: I skimmed a magazine.
Response: 2) The fly buzzed away.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is most likely that the man was dying. Therefore, Alternative A is the best answer.
Response: 2) He sped up his pace.
Response:  Based on my analysis, option B is more likely to occur.
Response: 2) He felt ecstatic.
"Response: 1. Alternativ B: He made a bet with his friends. 
Betting on the outcome of an event is more likely than meeting friends to watch it, as it implies a greater level of investment and interest in the outcome."
"Response: 2. He counted sheep.
Explanation: Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the boy counted sheep to help him fall asleep rather than setting an alarm clock. The passage states that ""the boy couldn't fall asleep,"" which suggests that he was having difficulty falling asleep and needed a strategy to help him do so. Counting sheep is a common technique used by many people to help them relax and fall asleep, while setting an alarm clock would not have had the same effect. Therefore, option B (He counted sheep) is the more likely answer."
