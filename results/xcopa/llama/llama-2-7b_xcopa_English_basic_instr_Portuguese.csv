Response:  B - I found a weapon.
Response:  B - The termites ate through the wood in the house.
"Response:  B - The patrol agent accused them of smuggling.
Razão:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the patrol agent will accuse the travelers of smuggling because they have reached the border, which suggests that they are entering a country illegally or with something hidden in their luggage without proper documentation. This option aligns better with the context provided in the premisse."
Response:  B - It was summer.
Response:  B - She jumped rope.
"Response:  B - She stepped out of the line.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she stepped out of the line than that more people entered the line."
Response:  B - The baby soiled her diaper.
Response:  B - The audience politely listened in silence.
"Response:  B - The girl brought the teacher an apple.
Razão: A partir da premissa, é mais provável que a menina tenha escolhido a opção B, pois ""wanted to thank"" significa que ela queria agradecer ao professor, e trazer uma mela é um presente simbólico de agradecimento."
"Response:  B - They toasted marshmallows on the campfire.
A premissa menciona que os jovens campistas ""felt scared"", o que sugiere que algo inesperado ou assustador aconteceu com eles. Já a opção B menciona que eles ""toasted marshmallows on the campfire"", o que não parece ter relação direta com o sentimento de medo dos campistas. Portanto, a opção B é a causa mais provável."
Response:  B - He got a concussion.
"Response:  B - I earned a pay raise.
A premissa ""The check I wrote bounced"" indicates that there is not enough money in the writer's account to cover the check, which suggests that they have overspent or underbudgeted. An increase in income (earning a pay raise) would provide more funds in their account and prevent checks from bouncing. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the check to bounce."
"Response:  B - He sent out a mass email.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man sent out a mass email to delete the spam from his inbox. This is because he would need to take action to remove the unwanted emails from his account, rather than simply deleting them individually."
Response:  B - He recovered from the disease.
Response:  B - She forgot to write it down.
Response:  B - The glass became full.
"Response:  B - He was thinking about his friend's words.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o homem permaneceu silencioso após o amigo terminar de falar, o que sugiere que ele estava refletindo sobre o que foi dito, em vez de querer oferecer apoio."
"Response:  B - I pressed charges.
Razão:  Com base na premissa ""The accident was my fault"", é mais provável que a pessoa tenha pressado acusações contra o outro motorista em vez de se sentir culpada. Isso porque, se a pessoa tivesse sentido culpa, ela poderia ter simplesmente admitido a falta e aceitado a responsabilidade pela situação, mas ao presseter acusações, ela está buscando desculpas ou justificativa para evitar a responsabilidade."
Response:  B - There was a broken link in the chain.
"Response:  B - They avoided discussing the problem.
Razão: Ao ler a premissa, sabemos que o casal decidiu comprometer-se. No entanto, não mencionamos que eles começaram a discutir o problema novamente ou que encontraram uma solução para ele. Em vez disso, eles evitaram discutir o problema, o que significa que eles ainda estavam sem resolver o problema subjacente. Portanto, a opção B é a causa mais provável."
"Response:  B - She testified in court.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the woman testified in court than that she hired a campaign manager. The premise mentions her decision to run for public office, which suggests that she may have been involved in legal proceedings related to her candidacy or political activities. Testifying in court is a common occurrence in legal cases involving politics and government, but hiring a campaign manager is not directly related to this scenario."
Response:  A
Response:  B - He goofed off.
Response:  B - He put goggles over his eyes.
Response:  B
Response:  B - The student's answers were incorrect.
Response:  B - I ran out of breath.
"Response:  B - I covered it with plastic wrap.
A premissa states that the frozen food thawed, which suggests that it was exposed to heat or warmth. Covering the food with plastic wrap would not provide enough insulation to keep it cold and prevent it from thawing. On the other hand, putting it in the microwave would expose it to high temperatures, causing it to thaw more quickly. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of the thawed food."
Response:  B - He wanted a day off.
Response:  B - She jumped off the diving board.
Response:  B - The movie received poor reviews.
Response:  B - People complimented him.
"Response:  B - She climbed up a rope.

Response:  B - The acrobat swung from a trapeze.
Response:  B - My friend arrived on time.
"Response:  B - They negotiated a treaty.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the warring countries negotiated a treaty to end their conflict rather than developing nuclear weapons. This is because negotiation and diplomacy are often used to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence or destructive measures like nuclear weapons. Additionally, the development of nuclear weapons would have required significant resources and time, which may not have been feasible during a time of war. On the other hand, negotiating a treaty can be done relatively quickly and efficiently, especially if both parties are motivated to find a peaceful resolution."
Response:  A
Response:  B - She bruised her knee.
Response:  B - The balloon flew away.
"Response:  B - They went to the airport.
The premissa states that they traveled from a faraway place, which implies that they are no longer on vacation and need to catch a flight back home. Going to the airport is the most likely action for someone who needs to catch a flight."

Response:  B - I had a sweet tooth.
Response:  B - The door locked.
Response:  B - The products were manufactured through child labor.
Response:  B - Dust blew out of the hole.
"Response:  B - Her sister got divorced.
A premissa ""The woman felt envious of her sister"" suggests that the woman is feeling jealous or resentful towards her sister for some reason. Option B, ""Her sister got divorced,"" is the most likely cause of this envy because it implies that the sister's marriage has ended, which could be a source of insecurity or discontentment for the woman."
"Response:  B - I changed my shirt.
Razão: Ao ver que spilled wine on his shirt, a more likely response would be to change the shirt rather than putting on an apron. Changing one's clothes is often seen as a practical solution to getting something stained or dirty, whereas putting on an apron might not necessarily solve the problem of having a stain on one's clothing."
"Response:  B - The customer handed her money.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the customer handed her money than that she searched her wallet. This is because the cashier opened the cash register, indicating that they were ready to receive payment from the customer. Therefore, it makes sense that the customer would hand over their money rather than search for it in their wallet."
"Response:  B - He sent the crowd away.
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the street musician sent the crowd away rather than receiving change from them. This is because the premise states that the musician attracted a crowd, which suggests that he was performing and drawing attention to himself. It is unlikely that people would give him change if he were sending them away."
"Response:  B - It was snack time.
A premissa ""The little boy cried to his babysitter"" indicates that the child is upset or unhappy about something, and based on this information, it is more likely that he missed his parents than it being snack time."
Response:  B - The pilot flew through the storm.
Response:  B - The leaves accumulated on the ground.
Response:  B - He decided to play a practical joke on his sister.
"Response:  B - His father stopped the car at a gas station.

Response:  B - The fish swam towards the food.
"Response:  B - She engaged in a protest.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the woman's political views changed by engaging in a protest rather than switching her party affiliation. Protests are often a form of public expression and activism, which can be an effective way to bring attention to one's beliefs and values. In contrast, changing party affiliation may not necessarily reflect a change in political views, as it could simply be a matter of personal preference or strategic voting."
"Response:  B - I poured drain cleaner into it.
Razão:  Drain cleaner is more likely to unclog a sink than turning on the faucet."
"Response:  B - The train blared its whistle.
Razão: A premissa menciona que os passageiros saíram do trem, o que significa que o trem chegou ao final da linha ou à estação. O som do sinistro do trem (blared its whistle) é uma consequência do trem chegar ao fim da linha, então é a causa mais provável."
Response:  B - He sealed the envelope shut.
"Response:  B - They moved to different cities.
Razão: A premissa menciona que the friends ""lost touch"", o que significa que eles se separaram ou ficaram em contato menos frequentemente. A opção B indica que os amigos mudaram para cidades diferentes, o que pode ter causado essa perda de contato. Enquanto a opção A sugeriu que os amigos ainda se divertiam juntos, não há evidências diretas na premissa para apoiar essa opção."
"Response:  A. She was fired from her position.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the accountant was fired from her position due to her mismanagement of the company's funds. This outcome aligns with the consequences of poor financial management and highlights the seriousness of such actions in a professional setting."
Response:  B - I wanted to check the time.
"Response:  B - My wife and I held hands.
A premissa ""My hand cramped up"" suggests that the writer was writing or typing something for an extended period of time, which could cause fatigue in their hand muscles. Holding hands with someone else would not cause this type of discomfort. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for the writer's cramped hand."
Response:  B - I twisted the wrench.
"Response:  B - The city condemned the apartment.
Razão: A partir da premissa, é mais provável que a cidade tenha condemnado o apartamento em vez do casal se mudar para lá."
"Response:  B - She thought she saw lightning.
Razão: A premissa menciona que ela estava fora no pátio, o que significa que ela está em um local aberto e pode ver coisas ao longe, como luzes ou relâmpagos. Além disso, a opção B menciona especificamente ""lightning"", o que é uma possibilidade mais plausível do que ""sunset"" (opção A), já que é menos provável que alguém esteja olhando para o horizonte para ver o sol descer."
"Response:  B - The water was shallow.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o homem usou um lifejacket no água, o que é necessário em águas rasas ou pouco profundas. Além disso, a opção B é a causa mais plausível para uma pessoa usar um lifejacket, pois é para evitar afogamento em águas rasas."
"Response:  B - She hit the backspace key.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the woman hit the backspace key than deleting the document. Hitting the backspace key would delete the last character typed, which could potentially result in typos or other errors."

Response:  B - It was full of weeds.
Response:  B - She forgot to set her alarm clock.
Response:  B - He went to the beach.
"Response:

Response:  B - The referee made a bad call.
Response:  B - The lock popped open.
Response:  B - The father grabbed his son's hand.
"Response:  B - I shoveled the snow out of the way.

Response:  B - The kayak hit a wave.
Response:  B - She crashed into a fence.
Response:  B - I felt cool air pass over me.
Response:  B - They saw a shark.
Response:  B - The water splashed onto the floor.
"Response:  B - He confessed his infidelity to her.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the husband will confess his infidelity to his wife rather than accusing her of it. This is because the husband feels guilty about cheating and wants to take responsibility for his actions by admitting them to his partner."
Response:  B - I spilled water on the poster.
Response:  A - Ele teve um sonho assustador.
"Response:  B - His father lectured him.
Razão: A partir da premissa ""The boy put his feet up on the table"", é mais provável que o pai do menino tenha repreendido ele por colocar os pés no chão da mesa, em vez de sentar-se ao lado dele."
"Response:  B - I waved my arms.
Razão:  The premissa states that the speaker's friend turned their head in their direction, which suggests that they were looking at something or someone else. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker waved her arms to get her friend's attention rather than shouting her name."
"Response:  B - The citizens registered to vote.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the citizens registered to vote rather than staging a revolt. Registering to vote is an act of civic engagement and participation in the political process, which can be seen as a peaceful form of resistance against government oppression. On the other hand, staging a revolt implies violence and conflict, which may not be feasible or practical for a large number of people. Therefore, option B is the most probable outcome based on the premise provided."
"Response:  B - He screamed for help.
Razão:  Screaming for help is more likely to happen when someone is lost in the woods because it would be their best chance of getting rescued or finding their way back home. Pitching a tent may not necessarily solve the problem of being lost."
Response:  B - She wanted to learn about other cultures.
"Response:  B - His coworker worked late.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o homem foi ""jealous"" de seu coworker, o que significa que ele sentiu inveja ou competição em relação ao coworker. A opção B, ""His coworker worked late"", é a causa mais provável da situação descrita na premissa, pois pode ter sido a tardança do coworker no trabalho que fez com que o homem se sentisse ainda mais invejoso."
"Response:  B - He was meditating.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o homem estava em uma montanha, o que sugiere um ambiente isolado e tranquilo, perfeito para praticar meditação. Além disso, a visão de aliens seria um fenômeno psíquico comum associado à meditação profunda. Portanto, a opção B é a causa mais provável."
Response:  B - He put shampoo in it.
"Response:  B - She felt a stroke of inspiration.
A premissa ""The artist created new work"" suggests that the artist was motivated to create something new and original, which is more likely to be caused by a feeling of inspiration rather than criticism or reflection on past work. Therefore, option B is the most probable cause."
Response:  B - He was going to college.
Response:  B - An earthquake shook the bookcase.
"Response:  B - I reset the circuit breaker.
Razão:  Since you mentioned that the electricity in your house shut off, it's likely that there was an issue with the electrical system rather than just turning on a light. Resetting the circuit breaker is a common solution to restore power after a temporary loss of supply."
Response:  B - It looked fun.
"Response:  B - I heated it in the microwave.
A premissa ""The bag of popcorn began to pop"" indicates that there is some kind of internal process or reaction occurring within the bag of popcorn, rather than an external action like pouring butter into it. Therefore, option B (I heated it in the microwave) is the most likely cause for the popcorn to begin popping."
"Response:  B - The forecast predicted heavy winds.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que a árvore caiu sobre a linha de energia, o que pode ter causado um corte no fornecimento de eletricidade na região. No entanto, não é necessário que o corte tenha sido causado apenas pela árvore caída, mas também por outros fatores como ventos intensos. Com base nessa informação, a opção B (o forecast predicted heavy winds) é a resposta correta, pois os ventos intensos poderiam ter contribuído para o corte da energia na região."
"Response:  B - He offended the audience.
Razão:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the speaker offended the audience with his politically incorrect comments rather than boring them."
Response:  B - A drop of blood formed on my finger.
Response:  B - It was dead.
"Response:  B - He quit smoking.
A premissa ""The man's voice sounded hoarse"" suggests that he has recently stopped smoking, which can cause hoarseness due to the irritation of the vocal cords. Option B is therefore the more likely answer."
Response:  B - The elevator got stuck between floors.
"Response:  B - His parents grounded him.
A premissa ""The teenager snuck out of the house"" implies that the teenager disobeyed or broke the rules set by their parents. Therefore, it is more likely that the parents would be angry and punish the teenager by grounding them."
Response:  B - The water heater broke.
Response:  B - The owner kept the puppy on a leash.
"Response:  B - He stood over the calm lake.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o homem catched seu reflexo, o que significa que ele estava em uma posição elevada para ver sua imagem no lago calmo. Portanto, a opção B é a causa mais provável."
"Response:  B - I met her for dinner.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker met his girlfriend for dinner than called her back. The reason being that meeting in person requires a physical presence and can be done at any time, whereas calling someone back implies a need to reach them immediately after missing their call."
"Response:  B - Expensive jewelry was missing from their home.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that expensive jewelry was missing from their home because the family searched the neighborhood, which suggests they were looking for something specific and valuable. Running away of their dog does not provide any logical explanation for why the family would search the neighborhood."
Response:  B - Meu peito sentiu-se tenso.
"Response:  B - Their employer raised their wages.
Razão: A premissa menciona que os empregados formaram uma união, o que significa que eles estavam buscando mudanças no seu trabalho e nos termos de sua emplemento.

Response:  B - A warm aroma filled the kitchen.
"Response:  B - She took off her shoes.
Razão: A premissa menciona que the woman ""struggled to walk"", o que sugiere que ela estava tendo dificuldade em caminhar com facilidade. Taking off one's shoes would likely make it more comfortable for someone who is having trouble walking, rather than wearing high heels which could exacerbate the problem."
Response:  A. The water boiled.
"Response:  B - I wore boots.
Razão:  Boots are more likely to be worn on a cold day than sandals, given that all the socks were in the laundry."
"Response:  B - He was accused of corruption.
Razão: A premissa menciona que a argumento do político foi considerado absurdo, mas não menciona nenhuma acusação de corrupção. Portanto, é mais provável que ele tenha perdido o apoio dos votantes (opção A)."
"Response:  B - The couple eloped.
Razão: Ao ler a premissa ""Everyone disapproved of the couple's engagement"", é provável que o casal decida evitar a oposição dos outros e decidir se casar em segredo, ou seja, elopou-se. Isso é o efeito mais provável dada a situação descrita na premissa."
"Response:  B - The millionaire contributed the funds to build it.
A premissa menciona que o edifício foi dedicado ao milionário, mas não menciona que ele quisesse demolir o prédio. Em vez disso, a premissa indica que o milionário contribuiu com os fundos para construí-lo.

Response:  B - She left the cookies in the oven.
Response:  B - I dashed to get inside.
Response:  B - The fire alarm went off.
"Response:  B - The father kicked his son out of the house.
Razão:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the father would kick his son out of the house than buy him a beer. The father's resentment towards his son's alcoholism suggests that he may not want to enable or support his son's behavior, and therefore might react by distancing himself from him."
Response:  B - The elevator was out of order.
Response:  B - His friend bought him lunch.
Response:  B - The cashier forgot to give the girl a receipt.
"Response:  B - She entered the hospital in a stretcher.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que she was put in a wheelchair, o que significa que ela entrou no hospital em um leito de hospitalização (stretcher). Além disso, a opção A não é consistente com a premissa, pois uma pessoa pode ser paralisada por um acidente, mas não necessariamente entrar no hospital em um leito de hospitalização."
"Response:  B - The country was facing economic hardship.
Razão: A premissa menciona que citizens hung the national flag up outside their homes, which is often done during times of celebration or mourning, but not necessarily during times of economic hardship. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  B - They inspired their fans.
"Response:  B - I felt proud.
Razão:  The premissa mentions that your friend pointed out the food stuck in your teeth, which is typically something that someone would notice and point out to another person if they found it funny or amusing rather than embarrassing. Therefore, option B (I felt proud) is more likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  B - He forgot to study.
"Response:  B - Crime rates in the city increased.
A premissa ""The downtown building collapsed"" suggests that there was some kind of structural failure or catastrophic event that led to the collapse of the building. Earthquakes can cause buildings to collapse, but they are relatively rare in most cities. On the other hand, crime rates increasing could lead to neglect and disrepair of buildings, which could eventually result in their collapse. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."

Response:  B - It was dull.
Response:  B - The dress didn't fit.
Response:  B - It left a scar.
"Response:  B - He was talking to himself.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man was talking to himself rather than staring at the ground. People often talk to themselves when they are lost in thought or experiencing strong emotions, and this behavior can be less noticeable than staring at something without apparent interest."
Response:  B - The child put the bread away.
Response:  B - The woman's sister began to cry.
Response:  B - He worried about bad breath.
"Response:  B - They got directions to the theatre.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o casal saiu cedo para o show, mas não menciona nenhuma dificuldade com o trânsito em torno do teatro. Portanto, a causa mais provável é que eles precisavam de orientação para chegar ao local."
"Response:  B - Her coworker covered for her.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that her coworker covered for her at work rather than her boss praising her. Staying home from work without any notice or explanation can be a significant disruption to the workflow and may require someone else to cover responsibilities."
Response:  B - He denied their cause.
"Response:  A - He had stage fright.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o ator estava com um ""pulso acelerado"" antes do seu desempenho, o que é uma das sintomas clássicos de stage fright ou medo de palco. Embora a opção B também pode ser possível (o ator pode ter memorizado seus diálogos), a opção A é a causa mais provável considerando a premissa fornecida."
"Response:  B - I unfolded a map.
Razão:  Com base na premissa ""I was lost"", é mais provável que a pessoa tivesse necessidade de um mapa para encontrar seu caminho. Contando dinheiro não ajudaria muito em uma situação de perda de rastro."

Response:  B - He stayed in bed for several days.
Response:  B - It was cold in the house.
Response:  B - She got a second wind.
"Response:  B - My neighbor left her house.
Razão:  Based on the premise ""I knocked on my neighbor's door,"" it is more likely that the neighbor left their house rather than inviting you in. This is because if they had invited you in, they would have opened the door for you themselves instead of leaving you to knock."
"Response:  B - Her husband kissed her goodbye.
A premissa informa que the woman sighed with frustration, o que sugiere que ela está se sentindo abatida ou desanimada. A opção B, ""Her husband kissed her goodbye"", não é uma resposta plausível para essa situação, pois um beijo não seria capaz de aliviar sua frustração. Portanto, a opção B é a melhor resposta."
Response:  B - The student hesitated to answer the question.
"Response:  B - She went to the supermarket.
Razão: A partir da premissa ""The woman ran out of eggs"", é mais provável que ela tenha ido comprar mais ovos no supermercado do que ir à fazenda, pois o supermercado é o local mais conveniente para obter ovos em quantidade maior."
Response:  B - I gave him a hug.
Response:  B - It looked contaminated.
Response:  B - His bike was stolen.
Response:  B - The user shifted the mouse.
Response:  B - She followed the truck in front of her.
"Response:  B - The linen stained.
Razão:  Based on the premissa ""I hung the wet linen on the outdoor clothesline"", it is more likely that the linen stained rather than dried. Hanging wet linen outside can lead to staining or discoloration due to exposure to sunlight and moisture in the air."
"Response:  B - She hailed a cab.
Razão: A premissa menciona que the woman ""put on her sunglasses"", o que implica que ela esteve fora em um local público, possivelmente usando transporte público. Hailing a cab é uma atividade comum realizada por pessoas que estão viajando de carro ou usando transporte público, então é a opção mais provável para explicar como a mulher chegou ao lugar onde ela está agora. Já a opção A, ""The sunlight was bright"", não é suficiente para explicar como a mulher chegou ao local onde ela está agora, pois não há nenhuma indicação de que ela esteja fora no exterior."
"Response:  B - He thought it was beautiful.
A premissa ""The man gazed at the night sky"" suggests that he was admiring or appreciating something about the night sky, which is consistent with option B. Option A does not fit well with this context because wishing for summer has nothing to do with looking at the night sky."
"Response:  B - I stayed up all night.
Razão: A premissa menciona que a pessoa se sentiu exhaustada, o que significa que ela não teve um sono adequado. Staying up all night é uma das principais causas de falta de sono, então é a resposta mais provável."
Response:  B - His hair was getting long.
Response:  B - The boy disliked the new classmate.
Response:  B - I was baking bread.
Response:  B - The driver shifted the car into reverse.
"Response:  B - I parked near the entrance.
Razão:  Com a premissa ""The parking lot of the building was empty"", é mais provável que a pessoa tenha parquéado próximo à entrada do edifício, pois não haveria espaço disponível no estacionamento."
"Response:  B - She edited the draft.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the writer edited the draft rather than experiencing writer's block. Editing the draft is an action that can be done to improve the quality of the work, whereas writer's block is a common phenomenon where a writer experiences difficulty in producing new content."
Response:  B
"Response:  B - The curtains shuddered.
Razão:  O vento pode fazer com que as cortinas trembem, então a opção B é a resposta correta."
"Response:  B - I blew a fuse.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o electricidade em casa foi interrompido, mas não especifica se o problema é com o interruptor ou com outro componente elétrico. No entanto, a opção B indica que o problema pode ter sido causado por um fuso quebrado, o que é uma possível causa de interrupção de energia elétrica. Além disso, a palavra ""blew"" sugere que algo foi danificado ou fraturado, o que é consistente com o fato de um fuso ter quebrado. Portanto, a opção B é a causa mais provável."
"Response:  B - He lifted the bar over his head.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o atleta de levantamento de peso ""gruntei"", o que significa que ele fez um movimento forçado ou intensificou seu esforço. Lifting the bar over his head é uma das principais habilidades do levantador de peso e é a causa mais provável da grunhida."
Response:  B - He got confused.
"Response:  B - The father gently rocked the baby.
Razão:  Based on the given premise ""The baby fell asleep"", it is more likely that the father gently rocked the baby to make him fall asleep rather than changing his diaper."
Response:  B - The boy got soaked.
Response:  B - Everyone in the photos refused to smile.
Response:  B - I was out of town.
"Response:  B - I was scared.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o indivíduo exerceu, mas não menciona nenhum sentimento positivo como energia ou felizidade. Em vez disso, menciona um sentimento negativo, medo. Portanto, a causa mais provável é que o indivíduo tenha se sentido medo após exercer."
Response:  B - Water seeped out of it.
"Response:  B - The resort was on an island.
A premissa menciona que os turistas tomaram um ferry para o resort, o que significa que o resort está localizado em uma ilha. Portanto, a causa mais provável é que o resort esteja em uma ilha."
Response:  B - She wanted to rebel.
"Response:  B - I called the police.
Razão:  With an unfamiliar car parked outside your house, it is more likely that you would call the police to report the situation and seek their assistance in investigating who the car belongs to or what their intentions are."
"Response:  B - There was no evidence against him.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que the criminal turned himself in, o que significa que ele já estava em posseção da autoridade e não houve necessidade de evidências para implicá-lo. Portanto, a causa mais provável é que ele tenha decidido se entregar sem precisar ser encontrado pela polícia ou outra autoridade."
"Response:  B - He avoided caffeine.
Razão:  Cutting out sweets might help with weight loss in the short term, but avoiding caffeine is more likely to have a significant impact on overall calorie intake and weight management. Caffeine can increase metabolism and suppress appetite, making it easier to stick to a diet and exercise plan over time."
Response:  B - She shivered.
Response:  B - She put her son to bed.
"Response:  Opção A - The volcano erupted.
A premissa ""Lava flowed from the volcano"" indicates that there has been an eruption of some kind, and therefore option A is the most likely cause. Option B (The volcano was dormant) does not explain why lava would be flowing from the volcano."
"Response:  B - She wanted to leave the party.
Razão: A premissa indica que she put her shoes on, o que significa que ela estava preparando-se para sair do lugar onde estava. Isso sugiere que ela queria deixar a festa, em vez de saber todos presentes."
Response:  B - She detained me at the tollbooth.
"Response:  B - He squandered his fortune.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o executivo ""went bankrupt"", o que significa que ele não apenas perdeu sua empresa ou seu dinheiro, mas também teve dificuldade em pagar suas dívidas. Squandering one's fortune significa gastar dinheiro de forma excessiva e descontrolada, o que pode levar a uma situação financeira insustentável. Com base nessa definição, a causa mais provável para o executivo ter gone bankrupt é que elesquandered his fortune, em vez de vender seus estoques da empresa."
Response:  B - The man felt ill.
"Response:  B - The house was empty.
Razão:  Ao sair pela janela, você não teria que evitar um incêndio ou fugir de uma casa cheia de objetos. Além disso, a premissa menciona ""my bedroom"", o que sugere que você estava em uma habitación particular, o que é menos provável se a casa estiver vazia."
"Response:  B - He lathered his hands with soap.
A premissa menciona que o garoto's fingers (palmas) became pruny, which suggests that they were exposed to water for an extended period of time. Lathering one's hands with soap would likely cause the skin on the fingers to become soft and prune-like, making option B the most probable explanation."

Response:  Opção B - The girl spit out the toothpaste.
"Response:  B - Pacifists held a parade.
A premissa menciona que civilian deaths from the war surged, which suggests that the situation has become more violent and dangerous for civilians. Holding a parade would be an unlikely response to this situation, as it would not address the root cause of the problem and could potentially downplay the severity of the conflict. In contrast, staging a protest is a more likely response, as it allows pacifists to express their opposition to the war and pressure those in power to take action to stop the violence."

Response:  A - The egg hatched.
Response:  B - He fled.

Response:  B - She had a crush on him.
Response:  B - He had no money.
"Response:  B - I felt lonely.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o personagem chamou seu amigo para falar, o que significa que ele sentia necessidade de interação social e não de privacidade.

Response:  B - I slapped him.
Response:  B - The frisbee soared towards my head.
Response:  B - She was surprised.
Response:  B - It was the beginning of a new month.
"Response:  B - He filed for divorce.

Response:  B - The ball glowed.
"Response:  B - She erased her answer.
Razão:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the girl erased her answer than that she guessed at it. The premise states that she made a mistake on her exam, which suggests that she may have been unsure of the correct answer and therefore chose to erase it rather than guessing randomly."
Response:  B - His opponent hit the ground.
"Response:  B - I watered them.
A premissa ""I picked the tomatoes from the vine"" indicates that the tomatoes have already been growing on the vine and are now being harvested. Watering the plants is not likely to cause the tomatoes to ripen or become ready for picking. Therefore, option B is the most probable cause."
"Response:  B - He bought his girlfriend chocolates.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man bought his girlfriend chocolates because he wants to act romantic. Buying chocolates is a common gesture of affection and romance, especially when done unexpectedly or as a surprise. On the other hand, meeting an ex-girlfriend for lunch may not necessarily be seen as a romantic gesture, depending on the context and circumstances surrounding their breakup."
Response:  B - The weather got warmer.
Response:  B - The highway became dangerously icy.
Response:  A. His grades improved.
"Response:  B - I wrapped myself in a blanket.

Response:  B - He shredded the papers.
Response:  B - The nail became rusty.
Response:  B - The fisherman recast the line.

"Response:  B - Their coach cancelled practice.
A premissa states that the teammates are directing blame at each other, which suggests that they have made mistakes or performed poorly in their recent game. Cancelling practice is more likely to be the cause of this than losing a game, as it would give them an opportunity to reflect on their performance and improve for future games."
"Response:  B - I achieved my goal.
Razão: A premissa menciona que você pediu desculpas, o que significa que algo não foi bem feito ou errado. A opção B indica que você conseguiu seu objetivo, o que significa que algo positivo aconteceu. Portanto, a causa mais provável é que você tenha alcançado seu objetivo."

Response:  B - Her dimples showed.
Response:  B - It sailed into the harbor.
Response:  B - He stepped on broken glass.
Response:  B - They found the weapon at the crime scene.

"Response:  B - Many people faced unemployment.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that many people faced unemployment than that they got sick. Unemployment is a common consequence of an economic downturn, while getting sick can happen to anyone regardless of the state of the economy. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome based on the premise provided."
Response:  A
Response:  B - He made a sarcastic remark.
Response:  B - The driver picked up a hitchhiker.
Response:  B - The woman had morning sickness.
Response:  B - It was windy outside.
"Response:  B - She bought a gift.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the girl bought a gift for her classmate's birthday party because the premise mentions ""her classmate's birthday party"" and does not mention anything about receiving an invitation. Therefore, option B is the most probable cause."
"Response:  B - His mother took him to the park.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o garoto tem uma temperatura elevada, o que pode ser causado por muitas coisas, como doença ou exposição a um ambiente quente. No entanto, a opção B é mais provável porque leva o garoto para um lugar fresco e açucarado, o que poderia ajudá-lo a se sentir melhor."
"Response:  B - He put gel in his hair.
A premissa menciona que the man ""sprayed himself with cologne"", which suggests that he applied perfume or cologne to his body. This is more likely to be done for personal hygiene or grooming purposes rather than putting gel in his hair. Therefore, option B is the most probable cause."
"Response:  B - I picked up a shovel.
Razão:  With no electricity in the house, it is more likely that you would need a source of light to navigate through the darkness rather than a tool for digging."
"Response:  B - The mother gave birth to twins.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que the family moved into a bigger house, o que significa que eles tiveram mais espaço para viver. No entanto, não menciona nenhuma mudança significativa no número de membros da família. Em contraste, a opção B menciona que a mãe deu à luz gemelos, o que aumentou o número de membros da família. Portanto, a causa mais provável para a famosa se mudar para um casa maior é a chegada dos bebês."
"Response:  B - She saw the finish line.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o corredor de maratona manteve um ritmo lento, o que significa que ele ainda precisava se esforçar para chegar ao final da corrida. Além disso, a opção B é a causa mais plausível, pois a visão do fim da corrida pode ter motivado o corredor a acelerar seu ritmo e terminar a prova com mais velocidade."
Response:  B - The bag of chips was stuck.
Response:  B - I gave him a hug.
"Response:  B - He paid with cash.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the businessman paid with cash rather than writing an IOU (Option A). This is because a declined credit card can make it difficult or impossible to pay with credit, so he would need to have cash available to make the purchase."
Response:  B - He stubbed his toe.
"Response:  B - His brother got accepted into law school.
A premissa menciona que o homem se sentiu orgulhoso de seu irmão, o que significa que algo positivo aconteceu com ele. A opção B indica que o irmão foi aceito em uma escola de direito, o que é um evento importante e positivo para alguém. Portanto, a opção B é a causa mais provável."
"Response:  B - She looked at the stars.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the girl looked at the stars than went to the library. The premise mentions ""the solar system,"" which refers to a vast celestial body of stars and planets beyond Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, looking at the stars would be a more direct way for her to learn about the solar system compared to going to the library, where she might find books on various topics but not necessarily the solar system specifically."
"Response:  Opção B - I put tape on the back of the poster.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o pôster está preso à parede, o que significa que ele está fixado com algum tipo de adesivo ou tape. Portanto, a opção B é a causa mais provável, pois indica que o pôster foi fixado com tape no local onde está posicionado."
"Response:  B - The architect adjusted the plans.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the architect adjusted the plans than constructed the building. Adjusting the plans implies making changes to the design or layout of the building, which is a common task for an architect before construction begins. Constructing the building, on the other hand, involves actual physical labor and requires more resources and time. Therefore, option B is the most probable outcome based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  B - He licked the spoon.
"Response:  B - The board of directors found his replacement.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the board of directors will find a replacement for the CEO rather than dissolving the company. This is because finding a new CEO is a common response to a leadership change and is often seen as a way to ensure continuity in the organization. Dissolving the company, on the other hand, would be a drastic measure that would have significant consequences for all stakeholders involved. Therefore, option B is the most probable outcome based on the information provided."
"Response:  B - I approached the podium.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker will notice and acknowledge someone who approaches the podium than someone taking a seat in the back row."
"Response:  B - He attacked a fellow inmate.
A premissa informa que o homem foi libertado do presídio, mas não fornece informações suficientes para determinar como ele foi liberado.

Response:  B - Their house caught fire.
Response:  B - The can got crushed.
"Response:  B - She learned communication skills.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the girl learned communication skills than how to use a computer. Joining a debate team typically involves developing one's ability to communicate effectively through public speaking and argumentation, rather than learning new technical skills like using a computer."
"Response:  B - I did the dishes.
A premissa ""My mood improved"" suggests that something positive happened after the action was taken, which is more likely to be caused by doing the dishes than listening to music. Doing the dishes can provide a sense of accomplishment and organization, which can improve one's mood, whereas listening to music may not have any direct impact on one's mood. Therefore, option B is the most probable cause for the improvement in mood."
"Response:  B - They held an auction.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the charity held an auction than fed the homeless. The premise states that the charity made a goal to raise money, and holding an auction is a common way for organizations to raise funds. Feeding the homeless is also a noble act, but it does not necessarily involve raising money for the organization. Therefore, option B is the most probable choice based on the information provided in the premisse."
Response:  B - The passengers screamed.
"Response:  B - I slammed the door upon leaving the house.
Razão: A premissa menciona que a pessoa estava ""furiosa"", o que significa que ela pode ter feito algo com um tom de raiva ou violência. Slamming the door é uma ação violenta e impulsiva, o que é consistente com a emoção de fúria. Portanto, a opção B é a resposta correta."
"Response:  B - He got up early.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o homem queria assistir ao nascer do sol, o que é algo que ele precisaria fazer muito cedo, logo após acordar. Trabalhar no norte não tem relação direta com a possibilidade de assistir ao nascer do sol."
Response:  B - The paper creased.
"Response:  B - Leaders of other countries sent emergency relief.
The premissa states that the nation endured a natural disaster, which suggests that there was widespread destruction and loss of life. In this scenario, it is more likely that leaders of other countries would send emergency relief to help alleviate the suffering of the affected population rather than forming an alliance with them. Therefore, option B is the most probable outcome."
Response:  B - He fell into the pool.
Response:  B - He borrowed it from a friend.
Response:  B - He was convicted of murder.
"Response:  B - I unlocked the door.
Razão:  The premissa ""Sunlight entered the room"" suggests that someone or something allowed sunlight to enter the room, such as opening a window or door. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer because it mentions unlocking the door, which allows entry of light and other objects into the room. Option A does not provide any information about allowing sunlight to enter the room."
Response:  B - She went bald.
"Response:  B - He deemed the sentence unclear.
Raiz:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the editor deemed the sentence unclear because the editor reworded it, indicating that they did not find it clear enough to leave unchanged."
Response:  B - She realized the card was expired.
Response:  B - They got married.
Response:  B - I composed my own song.
"Response:  B - The girl pulled it.
A premissa ""The boy's hair was sticking up"" suggests that the boy's hair was standing on end or messy, which could have been caused by him running around or not paying attention to his appearance. Therefore, option B is more likely, as it implies that the girl intentionally pulled the boy's hair, perhaps teasingly or playfully. Option A does not provide enough context to determine why the girl might have done this."
Response:  B - I stepped on the bug.
"Response:  B - I relaxed.
A premissa ""I opened my eyes"" pode ter várias causas diferentes, como acordar-se, abrir os olhos após dormir, etc. No entanto, a causa mais provável para abrirmos os olhos é relaxar-se, pois quando estamos relazados, é mais comum abrir os olhos. Já a opção A, ""I woke up"", implica que você acordou de verdade, o que não está relacionado à premissa original."
"Response:  B - I asked to borrow the CD from him.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that you would ask your neighbor to lend you his CD rather than asking him to turn down the volume of his music. This is because you are interested in listening to the same music as your neighbor and want to have a copy of it for yourself, whereas asking someone to turn down their music can be perceived as rude or intrusive."
"Response:  B - He earned below minimum wage.
Razão: A premissa menciona que a família do homem vivia em pobreza, o que significa que ele não poderia ter ganhado muito dinheiro. Além disso, a opção B é a única que justifica como a falta de dinheiro pode levar a uma vida miserável."
"Response:  B - He took up a hobby.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o estudante graduou-se da universidade, o que significa que ele está agora em um estado de liberdade para fazer coisas novas e desfrutar de atividades que goste. Taking up a hobby é uma das primeiras coisas que um jovem adulto pode fazer após se formar, então é a opção mais provável. Enquanto looking for a job é uma opção possível também, mas não é tão comum ou intuitiva como tomar um hobby."
Response:  B - The paint turned green.
Response:  B - The conversation became tense.
"Response:  B - I gave him the cold shoulder.
Razão:  Based on the premissa, it is more likely that you gave your brother the cold shoulder upon his return home because this action implies a lack of warmth or enthusiasm towards him, which aligns with the negative sentiment expressed in the premissa. Welcoming someone back home typically involves showing affection and happiness to see them again, which is not consistent with the given situation."
Response:  B - The actors in the play exited the stage.
"Response:  B - The kidnapper left the hostage by himself.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the kidnapper left the hostage alone because this outcome implies that the kidnapper had no further demands or intentions to harm the hostage. Option A (the kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage) does not align with this interpretation and suggests that the kidnapper may still have plans to cause harm to the hostage."
"Response:  B - The musician pounded the drum.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o som reverberou ""across the stage"", indicando que o ruído foi audível em toda a plataforma de música. Isso sugere que o evento que causou esse som foi algo que aconteceu em um local amplo, como bater uma caixa de drums. Além disso, a palavra ""pounded"" indica que o músico aplicou uma pressão intensa no instrumento, o que é consistente com a ideia de um forte impacto sonoro. Em contraste, a palavra ""tapped"" significa apenas tocar levemente algum objeto, o que não explicaria por que o som reverberou em todo o estágio."
Response:  B - The child was scared to look under her bed.
Response:  B - She was born deaf.
"Response:  B - The crops perished.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the crops perished due to the drought than for the water to become contaminated. Droughts can cause significant damage to plants and lead to their death, making option B the most probable outcome."
Response:  B - The bird caught a worm.
Response:  B - She moved to a new town.
"Response:  B - The employees went on strike.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the employees will go on strike rather than appointing a new manager. Strikes are a common form of protest or pressure tactic used by workers when they feel their demands are not being met, including higher wages."
"Response:  B - The extremists assassinated him.
Razão: A partir da premissa, é mais provável que os extremistas tenham assassinado o líder em vez de influenciá-lo. O líder teria razões para se opor às ideias dos extremistas, mas eles poderiam ainda assim decidir matá-lo para avançar suas próprias metas."
Response:  B - Waves crashed along the shore.
"Response:  B - Drink a glass of water.
Razão:  The premissa mentions feeling cold, which suggests that the person may be experiencing hypothermia or discomfort due to low body temperature. Drinking water can help to raise the body's core temperature and alleviate these symptoms. On the other hand, putting on sweatpants would not necessarily address the underlying cause of the person's discomfort."
Response:  B - Her son whined.
Response:  B - I tripped on the pavement.
Response:  B - His teeth became straight.
"Response:  Opção B - I woke up today with a sore throat.
Explanation: Based on the given premise ""I worked out at the gym yesterday"", it is more likely that the speaker will experience soreness in their muscles rather than their throat. Working out can cause muscle fatigue and soreness, but it does not typically affect the throat. Therefore, option B is the most probable outcome based on the premise provided."
Response:  B - Other students at the lunch table felt left out.
Response:  B - She decided to try to do a flip.
"Response:  B - The post office expedited the letter.
Razão: A premissa menciona que a carta foi entregue no correio, mas não menciona se ela foi entregue rapidamente ou lentamente. Em contraste, a opção B afirma que a carta foi expedida, o que significa que ela foi enviada de forma rápida e urgente. Portanto, é mais provável que a carta tenha sido expedida do que entregue rapidamente pelo correio."
Response:  B - He went home broke.
"Response:  B - The arsonists were apprehended.
A premissa ""The forest fire spread"" indicates that the fire grew and expanded, which suggests that it was not extinguished or slowed down by any means. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of the fire's spread, as it implies that the arsonists who started the fire were caught and unable to continue fueling it. Option A, ""The winds became stronger,"" does not provide enough information to explain why the fire spread, and could potentially be an effect rather than a cause."
Response:  B - His mother put a bandage on the wound.
Response:  B - He received an organ transplant.
Response:  B - I burnt my tongue.
"Response:  B - The writer missed an important deadline.
A premissa informa que o editor fired the writer, which means that the writer was dismissed from their job. This implies that the writer did not meet the expectations of the editor or the publication, and missing an important deadline is one possible reason for this outcome. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
"Response:  B - I studied all day.
Razão: A premissa menciona que você feeling exhausted, o que pode ser causado por uma atividade intensa ou prolongada, como estudar todo o dia. Embora a opção A também possa ser uma causa de cansaço, ela não é tão plausível considerando a premissa original."
"Response:  B - She prescribed pills to the patient.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o médico diagnosticou o paciente, o que significa que ele identificou os sintomas do paciente e determinou a causa da doença. Portanto, a causa mais provável é que o médico tenha prescrito medicamentos para tratar a doença do paciente."

"Response:  B - He suffered a heart attack.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que the man underwent emergency surgery, which suggests that he experienced a serious medical condition that required immediate attention. Heart attacks are a common cause of emergency surgeries, making it the most likely option among the two given in the question."

Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man rubbed his arms to relieve tension or warm up, rather than flexing them to show off his strength."
Response:  B - He felt discouraged.
"Response:  B - I believed that he knew better.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o colega fez um erro, mas a opção B indica que você acreditou que ele sabia melhor, o que implica que você esperava que ele tivesse conhecimento ou habilidades superiores para evitar o erro. Isso é consistente com a premissa, pois você está explicando porquê você exculpou seu colega em vez de repreender-lhe."
"Response:  B - He started waking up earlier.
Razão: A premissa menciona que the man quit smoking, mas não menciona nenhum dos outros comportamentos mencionados nas opções. Além disso, a opção B é consistente com a ideia de que quitting smoking might lead to a change in sleep schedule."

Response:  B - My houseguest overstayed her welcome.
"Response:  B - She got a new diary.

"Response:  B - She quit her job.
Razão:  Based on the given scenario, it is more likely that she quit her job to save money rather than working overtime. Quitting a job often results in losing income immediately, but working overtime would only provide temporary financial relief."
Response:  B - He patted the puppy's head.
"Response:  B - They distributed a survey to customers.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the company distributed a survey to customers in order to gather their feedback and measure their satisfaction. Offering a discount to new customers may not provide sufficient data to accurately assess customer satisfaction."
Response:  B - The boy dragged a chair across the floor.
Response:  B - My enemy cocked a fist.
"Response:  B - People came to venerate it.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o estátua foi incendiada, mas não menciona nenhum fenômeno naturais como um raio de luzning. Além disso, a opção B é a más plausível, pois é comum que os fiéis visitem e reverenciem imagens religiosas, incluindo estatuas, em locais sagrados ou em suas casas."
Response:  B - Flies swarmed the fruit.
Response:  B - She twisted her ankle.
"Response:  B - He ran around on the playground.
Raiz da resposta:  The premissa does not provide enough information to determine why the child's shoelaces came undone. Running around on the playground could have caused the laces to come loose."
Response:  B - I lost track of time.
"Response:  B - His parents disowned him.
A premissa menciona que the man held similar beliefs to those of his parents, which suggests that he was raised in a traditional or conservative household. However, the fact that he was disowned by his parents implies that there was a significant disagreement or conflict between them, which could have led to a change in his beliefs and values. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
Response:  B - The driver fell asleep.
Response:  B - The ice cream dripped from the cone.
"Response:  B - The walls looked bare.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o artwork foi colocado no quarto, o que significa que os muros estavam vazios. Além disso, a opção A não é consistente com a premissa, pois o carpet não está relacionado ao tema da premissa."
"Response:  B - My boss held a meeting.
A premissa ""I left work early"" indicates that the speaker finished their work earlier than usual, which could be due to various reasons such as feeling unwell or having other personal matters to attend to. However, based on the information provided in the premissa, it is more likely that the speaker left work early because of a meeting with their boss rather than having a headache. Therefore, option B is the best answer."
Response:  B - The owner gave the puppy a treat.
"Response:  B - My friend became infuriated.
Razão:  Based on the premise ""I apologized to my friend,"" it is more likely that my friend will become infuriated because an apology may not always result in forgiveness or acceptance."
"Response:  B - He wore a neon vest.
A premissa ""The man stood out in the crowd"" suggests that there was something unusual or distinctive about him, and wearing a neon vest is more likely to make someone stand out than carrying a backpack."
Response:  B - He was charged with perjury.
Response:  B - She wanted to blend in.
"Response:  B - They were deported.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the immigrants were deported than that they found employment. The premise states that they were caught illegally residing in the country, which suggests that they did not have legal status to work or live there. Therefore, it is more probable that they were removed from the country rather than employed."
Response:  B - The audience stood up.
Response:  B - The sun tanned my skin.
"Response:  B - I yawned.
Razão:  A resposta correta é ""I yawned"". Embora a premissa mencione que você se sentiu bored, a palavra ""yawned"" significa ""fez um barulho de risada"", o que não é consistente com a emoção de boredom. Já ""snorted"" significa ""emitiu um som forte"", o que também não é relevante para a premissa."
Response:  B - The steak was raw.
Response:  B - She acquired massive debt.
Response:  B
Response:  B - I picked up the flower's scent.
"Response:  B - She yelled at her children.
Razão:  A premissa ""The woman felt nostalgic"" não indica que ela encontrou alguém do passado, mas sim que ela se sentiu triste ou melancólica. Além disso, o termo ""yelled"" sugere uma emoção negativa, como frustração ou irritação, o que é consistente com a premissa. Em contraste, a opção A (""She ran into a childhood friend"") não é inconsistente com a premissa, mas não é tão provável considerando a natureza da emoção expressa na premissa."
"Response:  B - He submitted the paper incomplete.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the student submitted the paper incomplete than early. Procrastination often leads to delaying tasks until the last minute, which means that the student may have waited until the deadline was near or even passed before submitting the paper. Therefore, option B is a more plausible outcome based on the premise provided."
"Response:  B - I called a mechanic.
Explanation: Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker called a mechanic than went to the mall. The reason for this is that calling a mechanic would be the most practical solution to deal with a broken-down car, whereas going to the mall does not have any direct relation to fixing the problem."
Response:  B - It was illegible.
Response:  B - It ascended upwards.
Response:  B - The garage was full.
Response:  B - The victim put his hands up.
"Response:  B - I planned to attend my friend's wedding.

"Response:  B - I was nauseous.
A premissa ""I lost track of time"" pode ser causada por diversas razões, como estar distraída ou preocupada, mas não necessariamente pela nausea. Já a opção B, ""I was nauseous"", é uma condição médica que pode fazer com que alguém perca o contato com o tempo. Portanto, a causa mais provável para a premissa é a opção B."
Response:  B - The print was out of paper.
"Response:  B - The fans rushed the field.
Razão:  Based on the premissa, it is more likely that the fans would rush the field than turn to the flag. This is because the stadium playing the national anthem typically signals a moment of patriotism and respect for one's country, which could lead to a spontaneous display of emotion such as rushing the field, but not necessarily turning towards a symbol of the nation (the flag)."
Response:  B - I put salt in it.
Response:  B - The spill left a sticky residue.
"Response:  B - She reread the book.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the woman will reread the book than bookmark her page. This is because she was interrupted while reading and may want to continue from where she left off rather than marking her place and returning to the book later."
"Response:  B - The man looked out the window.
Razão:  Based on the premise ""The plane hit some turbulence"", it is more likely that the man would look out the window to see what's happening outside rather than tightening his seatbelt, which is a safety measure for unexpected movements inside the plane."
Response:  B - The girl poked him.
"Response:  B - They monitored her vitals.
A premissa ""The doctors gave the patient an artificial limb"" indicates that the patient received a prosthetic limb, which is typically used to replace a missing or damaged limb. This suggests that the patient's condition was serious enough to require surgical intervention, but it does not necessarily imply that they were in critical condition and needed to be closely monitored. Therefore, option B (They monitored her vitals) is the most likely cause based on the given information."
Response:  B - She jerked her arm away from him.
"Response:  B - I knew I was right.
Razão: A premissa menciona que você perguntou o amigo por conselho, mas a resposta sugere que você já sabia o que era certo e não precisava do conselho. Isso indica que você tendeu a ter uma perspectiva mais confiante em relação à sua própria opinião, o que é inconsistente com a ideia de valorizar o conselho do outro pessoa."
Response:  B - The mud hit him in the face.
"Response:  B - People hid underground.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that people would hide underground to avoid the snow rather than schools shutting down."
"Response:  B - He threatened to quit the job.
Razão:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the employee threatened to quit the job rather than going home for the day. Threatening to quit is a common action taken by employees when they are unhappy with their work conditions or treatment by management, while going home for the day is a more mundane and less dramatic outcome."
Response:  A - The tree fell onto the roof.
Response:  B - I swung the axe down to the wood.
Response:  B - The couple announced that they were having a baby.
Response:  B - She kissed him.
Response:  B - I agreed with him.
Response:  B - They wanted to make a fair decision.
"Response:  B - The man took the pizza out of the oven.
Razão:  Based on the given premise ""The timer in the kitchen went off,"" it is more likely that the man took the pizza out of the oven because the timer going off usually indicates that food is ready to be cooked or served."
Response:  B - She worked hard.
"Response:  B - His son inherited his fortune.
Razão: A premissa menciona que the wealthy man died of old age, which means that he had lived a long life and accumulated wealth over time. Therefore, it is more likely that his son inherited his fortune after he passed away, rather than getting into legal trouble."
Response:  B - Smoke arose from the flames.
"Response:  B - She got in a car accident.
A premissa states that the woman's car was in the shop, which means she couldn't have been driving it when the accident occurred. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of the problem."
Response:  B - Missed breakfast
"Response:  B - His family attended the press conference.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the public figure's family would attend a press conference with him than for cameras to flash in his direction."
Response:  B - The bathwater drained out of the tub.
"Response:  B - He majored in engineering.
Razão:  Joining a fraternity (opção A) would not necessarily lead to meeting other students on campus, as the member's social circle may be limited to only that of his fraternity brothers. On the other hand, majoring in engineering (opção B) could provide opportunities to interact with other students through class discussions, group projects, and extracurricular activities related to the field of study."
Response:  B - I was rearranging the living room.
Response:  B - The boy picked a flower.
Response:  B - She was put on death row.
Response:  B - The sugar dissolved.
Response:  B - He was injured in battle.
Response:  B - The police chased the criminal.
"Response:  B - I charged it.
A premissa ""The laptop wouldn't turn on"" suggests that the issue is with the laptop itself rather than external factors like being dropped. Charging the laptop would not cause it to stop turning on, so option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  B - She folded her laundry.
Razão: A premissa menciona que the woman ""ran out of room"" in her closet, o que significa que ela não havia mais espaço para guardar suas roupas. Portanto, a causa mais provável é que ela tenha folhetinado sua malha de roupas para liberar espaço no closet."
Response:  B - His wife left him
"Response:  B - His job offer was rescinded.
The premissa states that the man obtained a degree, which suggests that he met the requirements for the job he applied for and was offered the position. However, since the option B states that his job offer was rescinded, it is more likely that something happened after he obtained the degree to make the employer change their mind about hiring him."
"Response:  B - He spoke into the microphone.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the man spoke into the microphone rather than greeting the audience. The premise states that his voice projected clearly throughout the auditorium, which suggests that he was using a microphone to amplify his voice. Greeting the audience would not have resulted in his voice being heard by everyone in the auditorium."
"Response:  Opção B - The coin broke in half.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que I tossed a coin into the fountain of water, o que significa que o objeto foi submergido em água. Como a água é densa, é improvável que o coin sunk to the bottom, pois teria sido levado pelo fluxo da água até a superfície. Além disso, o coin pode ter se rompido devido à pressão da água ou ao impacto com outras partículas flutuantes no agua. Portanto, a opção B - The coin broke in half é a resposta correta."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A is more likely.
"Response:  B - I sneezed.
Razão: A premissa menciona que ""I breathed in the dust in the attic"", o que pode causar uma reação de choque no sistema respiratório, levando a um sneeze. Hiccup é menos provável neste cenário, pois não há evidência de que o sujeito tenha ingerido ou respirava algo que cause um hiccup."
Response:  B - The customer left his headlights on.
Response:  B - I accidentally threw away my shopping list.
"Response:  B - The children chased the animals.
The premissa ""The family went to the zoo"" implies that the family was visiting a place where they could observe and learn about animals. Chasing the animals is not something that would be expected or allowed in a zoo setting, so option B is more likely to occur based on the given information."
"Response:  B - His lungs were congested.
A premissa ""The man's breathing was loud"" suggests that the man had difficulty breathing and his chest was congested, which can be caused by various respiratory conditions such as pneumonia or acute bronchitis. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause of the man's condition."
Response:  B - I asked my friend if he was interested in going.
"Response:  B - I opened the windows.
Razão:  With the air conditioner broken, opening the windows would be the most likely solution to cool down the room. Bringing out blankets would not have a significant impact on the temperature."
Response:  B - His backpack was heavy.
Response:  B - It was her birthday.
Response:  B - Squirrels dug up the bulbs.
Response:  B - The match produced a flame.
"Response:  B - They wanted to repair their personal relationship.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the parties settled out of court because they wanted to repair their personal relationship rather than avoid debating in court. This option suggests that the parties were motivated by a desire to resolve their conflict amicably and move forward in a positive manner, which aligns with the idea of repairing their personal relationship."
"Response:  B - Their parents spoiled them.
A premissa informa que the children were sent to an orphanage, which suggests that they are no longer living with their biological parents. Since the children are now in an orphanage, it is more likely that their parents either abandoned them or could not care for them anymore due to financial or personal reasons rather than dying or being unable to provide for them. Therefore, option B - Their parents spoiled them - is the most probable cause."
"Response:  B - It began to hail.
Razão:  The impact of a meteorite landing in the ocean would likely cause massive waves and flooding, rather than hail. Hail is more commonly associated with thunderstorms and occurs when updrafts in the atmosphere carry water droplets upward and freeze them into small balls of ice. While it's possible that some debris from the meteorite could be thrown into the air and create hail-like conditions, this is unlikely given the size and weight of a meteorite. Therefore, option B is the most probable outcome based on the premissa provided."
"Response:  B - She panicked.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the hiker panicked after encountering a poisonous snake than becoming dehydrated. Panicking can lead to poor decision-making and increased heart rate, which can cause dehydration in some cases. However, dehydration is not directly caused by encountering a poisonous snake."
Response:  B - I put the dish in the oven.
Response:  B - The lemon squirted.
Response:  B - The country colonized the land.
Response:  A - It shattered all over the floor.
Response:  B - The floor was slippery.
Response:  B - The father trusted his son.
"Response:  B - He took aspirin.
Razão:  Aspirin é um medicamento anti-inflamatório não esteroideo (AINE) que pode ajudar a aliviar o dolor de cabeça. Com base na premissa, é mais provável que o personagem tenha tomado aspirin para tratar o seu dolore de cabeça. Já o cough syrup é usado principalmente para tratar doenças respiratórias, como bronquite ou gripe, e não é adequato para tratar dor de cabeça."
Response:  B - It was running behind schedule.
"Response:  B - He was diagnosed with depression.
A premissa informa que o homem passou por terapia, o que pode indicar que ele estava lidando com algum tipo de problema emocional ou mental. Depressão é uma das principais causas de problemas emocionais e mentais, então é a causa mais provável para o homem ter passado por terapia. Opção A (Mental illness ran in his family) não é suficientemente específica para explicar como o homem passou por terapia, pois não fornece evidências diretas da causa subjacente do seu problema."
Response:  B - She choked on her food.
Response:  B - She spoke with an accent.
"Response:  B - It layed down.
Razão:  Based on the premise ""The dog eyed the juicy steak on the table,"" it is more likely that the dog will lay down to get closer to the food rather than drooling."
"Response:  B - She became wealthy.
Razão: A premissa menciona que a mulher foi bem-sucedida em seu negócio, o que significa que ela pode ter ganhado dinheiro ou aumentado sua renda. Além disso, a opção B é a resposta mais plausível para explicar como a mulher conseguiu ser rica, já que firmar seus funcionários não seria uma causa direta de sua riqueza."
"Response:  B - The teacher assigned homework.
A premissa ""The students exited the classroom"" does not provide enough information to determine the cause of their departure. It is possible that they left for any number of reasons, including being dismissed by the teacher or completing an assignment. However, based on the additional information provided in option B, it is more likely that the teacher assigned homework as the reason for the students' exit from the classroom."
Response:  B
"Response:  B - He was nearly killed in an explosion.
Explanation: Based on the given premise, the most likely cause of the man's loss of hearing is an explosion. Explosions can cause severe damage to the ears and result in permanent hearing loss. Nearly drowning in the ocean would not typically cause such extensive damage to the inner ear. Therefore, option B is the more probable answer."
Response:  B - The balloon rose into the air.
Response:  A - Ele teve um acidente vascular cerebral (AVC).
Response:  B - She heard her name being called.
Response:  B - The man soaked the lifeguard.
Response:  B - My infection spread.
Response:  B - The driver honked his horn.
"Response:  B - I placed the container on the hot stove.
A premissa states that the plastic container melted, which suggests that it was exposed to high temperatures. Option B indicates that the container was placed on the hot stove, which is more likely to cause melting than option A (soaking in warm water)."
Response:  B - The driver ran a red light.
Response:  B - He passed the exam.
"Response:  B - The lifeguard was on duty.
A premissa informa que o menino está agarrando à margem do pool, o que significa que ele não pode estar aprendendo a nadar, pois ele ainda não dominou essa habilidade. Além disso, a presença de um vigia no local indica que os condições de segurança estão sendo cobradas, o que reduz a probabilidade de algo acidentado acontecer. Portanto, a opção B é a causa mais provável."
Response:  B - My heart rate sped up.
"Response:  B - My office was noisy.
Razão:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the noise from the construction of the building next to the office would be a disturbance for the speaker than the crowd in the office."
"Response:  B - The family waved to the neighbors from their yard.
Razão: Ao invitar os vizinhos para jantar, a família está mostrando interesse em conhecê-los e estabelecer uma relação amistosa. Waving (olhar) é um gesto simbólico de bem-vinda, mas não é necessariamente um passo direto para se conectar com eles. Portanto, a opção B é a resposta correta."
"Response:  B - The swimmer floated in the pool.
Razão:  Based on the given premissa, it is more likely that the swimmer was floating in the pool rather than diving into it."
Response:  Opção B - I accidentally chipped my tooth.
Response:  B - His shoelaces were untied.
Response:  B - She got her ears pierced.
Response:  B - I kept it in the fridge.
Response:  B - It had a complicated plot.
"Response:  B - The crew encountered pirates.
Razão:  Com base na premissa ""The ship wrecked"", é mais provável que a tripulação tenha enfrentado problemas com piratas do que morrerem no mar ou sofrer um acidente. Pirates são frequentemente associados a água e podem estar presentes em áreas de navegação perigosa, tornando-os uma ameaça mais plausível para uma tripulação de um navio naufragado."
Response:  B
Response:  B - The man picked up the phone.
Response:  B - I felt uncomfortable.
"Response:  B - They viewed all the exhibits.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o grupo saiu do museu, mas não indica que eles levaram fotos dos exposições. Além disso, a opção B é consistente com a ideia de que o grupo esteve atento aos exposições todo, enquanto a opção A é um detalhe adicional sobre o que eles fizeram durante sua visita ao museu."
"Response:  B - My friend stood up for me.
Razão:  Com base na premissa, é mais provável que o amigo tenha defendido a pessoa do homem em vez de introduzí-la para ele."
Response:  B - Switching gears on the bike is unlikely to have any effect on a flat tire.
"Response:  B - Her father felt her forehead.
A premissa ""The girl looked pale"" suggests that the girl may be feeling unwell or ill, and therefore it is more likely that her father would feel her forehead to check on her temperature or to see if she has a fever. Reading her a story is not directly related to checking her health."
"Response:  B - I signed my name.
Razão:  Signing one's name is more likely to result from the pen running out of ink than using a pencil."
"Response:  B - He started a business.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que the man was denied for a loan, o que significa que ele não had enough money to start a business. Além disso, a opção A (He was in debt) is inconsistent with the premissa, since being in debt would not prevent someone from starting a business."
Response:  A - She had chicken pox.
"Response:  B - I dumped it down the sink.
Razão:  Based on the premise ""The trash bag was full"", it is more likely that the protagonist would dispose of the trash by dumping it down the sink rather than taking it to the dumpster. This option better aligns with the action implied in the premise."
Response:  B - My dog shed hair.
Response:  B - He threw a chair across the room.
Response:  B - The fire went out.
Response:  B - He couldn't find a towel.
"Response:  B - They encouraged their children to play outside.
Razão: A premissa menciona que the parents wanted their children to go to college, which suggests that they valued education and academic achievement. Encouraging children to play outside may not be directly related to this goal, so it is less likely to be the correct answer."
Response:  B - The shoes became worn.
"Response:  B - He saved the recipe.
Razão: A partir da premissa ""The man ate half of the entree"", é mais provável que ele tenha guardado ou salvo a receita para si mesmo ou para outro pessoa, em vez de refrigerar os restos."
"Response:  B - I rubbed lotion on it.
Razão:  Based on the premissa, it is more likely that applying lotion to the swollen ankle would help reduce the swelling than putting ice on it."
"Response:  B - I overheard the conversation in the hall.
Razão:  The premissa states that the speaker's office door was open, which suggests that they were in their office and could hear the conversation taking place nearby. Option B is more likely because it implies that the speaker heard the conversation while in their own office, rather than talking to a colleague at their desk (Option A)."
Response:  B - I skimmed a magazine.
Response:  B - The fly stayed still
Response:  A
Response:  B - He sped up his pace.
Response:  B - I came up with a solution.
"Response:  B - He felt ecstatic.
Razão:  A premissa menciona que o viajante está em uma ponte suspensa ""shaky"", o que pode gerar um sentimento de alegria ou excitação, ao invés de medo ou terror."
"Response:  B - He made a bet with his friends.
Razão: A premissa menciona que o homem ""anticipou"" a vitória do time, o que significa que ele já sabia da vitória antes de ela acontecer. Isso é consistente com a opção B, pois um dos efeitos de fazer uma aposta é esperar ansiosamente pela vitória do time para ganhar dinheiro. Além disso, a palavra ""anticipado"" sugere que o homem estava muito empenhado na vitória do time, o que também é consistente com a ideia de uma aposta."
"Response:  B - He counted sheep.
Razão:  Counting sheep is a common technique used to help people fall asleep by focusing the mind on something repetitive and calming. It is more likely that the boy would have tried this method than setting an alarm clock, which might disturb him if he woke up before it went off."
