"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Była krucha) is more likely to be the cause of the product being packaged in a baby bottle. The word "" Krucha"" means ""soft"" or ""delicate"", which suggests that the product was not durable enough to withstand the rigors of shipping and handling without getting damaged. Therefore, it's more likely that the product was fragile and required special care during transportation, such as being packaged in a baby bottle for added protection."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wypracowałem kieszenia,"" Option A is more likely. The word ""wypracowałem"" means ""I have worked out"" or ""I have practiced"", so it suggests that the speaker has been preparing something in advance. Therefore, finding a ticket (Option A) is more likely than finding a weapon (Option B)."
Response:  Option B - Termites ate the wood in the house.
"Response: 
Option B: Patrol oskarżył ich o przemyt."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the office was closed for Christmas (Option A).
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she skoczyła z liny (jumped from the line) than grała w damę (played chess). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (more people entered the queue) is a more likely cause for the woman losing her place in line.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Dziecko śliniło się na jej szlafrok) is the correct answer. The fact that the girl's nose is stuffy suggests that she may have been exposed to something irritating or unpleasant, such as a runny nose caused by allergies or a cold. It is less likely that her pieluch (stuffed animal) would be the source of the problem, as it is not a living entity that could potentially produce an irritant like mucus.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Publiczność klaszczyła wraz z muzyką) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Dziewczyna przyniosła nauczyciela jabłkiem. 
Explanation: The premise states that the girl wanted to thank her math teacher, which suggests that she may have brought him a small gift as a token of appreciation. Bringing a teacher a fruit like an apple is a common gesture of gratitude, making option B the most likely choice. Option A, on the other hand, does not make sense in this context as there is no indication that the girl was punished or disciplined by the teacher."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Ich doradca obozowy opowiedział im historii o duchach) is more likely to be the cause of their fright. The mention of a ""doradca obozowy"" suggests that there was an adult leader or counselor present who told them a story about ghosts, which could have caused fear in the young campers. Option B (Rozdręczyli marshmallows na ognisku) does not provide any context for why they would be frightened."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ma wstrząs mózgu) is more likely. The phrase ""facet uderzył się w głowę"" suggests that something has hit him in the head, which could cause a concussion or other injury to the brain. This is more likely than option A (Zgubił się w myślach), which means ""Lost in thoughts,"" as it does not provide any explanation for how he was injured."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Moje konto bankowe było puste) is the correct answer. The author states that they wrote a check but it bounced, indicating that their account was empty or had insufficient funds to cover the check. This suggests that there was no money in their account to pay for the increase in rent, hence option A is the most likely explanation.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he unsubscribed from the unwanted emails (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Marynarz was exposed to a disease) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Recytowała to dla siebie) is the more likely cause. The fact that she ""zapamiętała"" the code suggests that it was something she consciously remembered or repeated to herself, rather than something she forgot to write down."
Response:  Option A - Woda ugasiła mego pragnienia.
"Response: 
Option A: Chciał pomóc przyjacielowi. 
Explanation: The man remained silent because he wanted to help his friend, not because he was thinking about what his friend had said. This option better fits the given information as it aligns with the idea that the man's silence was motivated by a desire to assist rather than reflecting upon his friend's words."
Response:  Option A: Czułem się winny.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that there was a breakage (Option B) rather than the chain being wrapped around the tire (Option A). This is because the phrase ""Łańcuch się rozpadł"" implies a sudden and unexpected failure of the chain, which is consistent with a breakage caused by external factors such as a sharp impact or overloading. In contrast, if the chain had been wrapped around the tire, it would have resulted in a gradual loss of power and control, which is not consistent with the sudden failure implied in the premise. Therefore, Option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Męczyły się kłótniami) is more likely. The passage states that ""Para postanowiła pójść na kompromis,"" indicating that they eventually reached a compromise after arguing. This suggests that their disagreement was significant enough to warrant argumentation but ultimately led to a resolution through communication and compromise. Therefore, Option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zatrudniła kierownika kampanii) is more likely. The woman has decided to run for office, indicating that she wants to be involved in politics and potentially hold a position of power. Hiring a campaign manager would be a strategic move to help her achieve this goal.
"Response: 
Option B: Podróżował z dużą walizką.
Explanation: The man packed warm clothing in his suitcase, indicating that he was prepared for cold weather during his trip. Having a large suitcase suggests that he had enough space to pack extra layers of clothing, which would be necessary if he were traveling to a cold climate."
"Response: 
Explanation: Based on the given information, it is more likely that student podniósł rękę (raised his hand) as a response to the teacher's question rather than zgłupiał się (lowered his head). This is because raising one's hand is a common gesture used to indicate that someone wants to answer a question or participate in a discussion, while lowering one's head may be a sign of shame or embarrassment. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Pył dostał mu się do oczu) is a more plausible explanation for why the man cried. This is because pollen can irritate the eyes and cause tearing or redness, leading to crying. Therefore, option A is the better choice among the two options provided.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (her opponent felt sorry for her) is more likely. The fact that she won five matches in a row suggests that she was performing well, but her opponent's sudden change of heart and decision to feel sorry for her implies that there may be something unusual or unexpected about her performance.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the teacher caught the student cheating (Option A). The premise states that the teacher ""rozerwał"" or tore apart the exam paper of a student who had failed an exam, suggesting that the student was attempting to cheat in some way. It does not mention anything about the student's answers being incorrect, which would be the case if they were simply misunderstanding the material (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for why the teacher tore apart the student's exam paper."
"Response:  Option A - Straciłem głos.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker stopped talking to avoid speaking, which suggests that they had been speaking earlier. Losing one's voice (Option A) is a common reason why someone might stop talking, making it the more likely cause in this context."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Włożyłam do mikrofalówki) is more likely as it suggests that the food was heated in a microwave oven, which could explain why it has become soggy or frozen.  
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the worker was faking his illness (Option A). The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it can be inferred from the fact that the worker did not actually have a stomachache or any other physical symptoms of illness. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for why the worker called in sick.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Dziewczyna biegła po balkonie) is the more likely cause. 
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (To was a day of the premiere film) is more likely. The sentence suggests that tickets for the movie have been sold out, indicating high demand and popularity, which is consistent with the idea of a movie premiere.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that people isolated him (Option A). The text states that ""people had begun to isolate him,"" indicating that he was being separated from others intentionally. This suggests that his unusual appearance or behavior led to social exclusion, rather than the opposite."
"Response: 
Option A: Napisała list. 
Explanation: The premise states that ""Ręce dziewczyny stały się pęcherzykami,"" which translates to ""Girls' hands became balloons."" This is a nonsensical scenario, as it is not biologically possible for human hands to transform into balloons. Therefore, option A, ""Napisała list,"" or ""Wrote a letter,"" is the most likely cause, as it provides an explanation for why the girl's hands might be in this unusual state."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Publiczność zachwycona okrzyknęła) is more likely to occur. The use of the word ""żonglował"" suggests that the acrobat was performing a skilled and impressive act, which would likely elicit applause from the audience."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mój przyjaciel kazał mi czekać) is more likely to be the cause of why I missed my appointment. This is because the premise states that ""Straciłem cierpliwość,"" which means ""I lost patience."" It is unlikely that your friend would have arrived on time if you had not been patient and waited for them. Therefore, Option A is the best answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Negotiated a treaty.
Explanation: The premise suggests that the countries involved wanted peace, which would be more likely to occur through negotiation than by developing nuclear weapons."
"Response: 
Option A: Zaczął się śpić."
"Response:  Option B - Zraniła kolano.
Explanation: The premise states that a woman hit a canape, indicating that she may have used her hand or arm to do so. As a result, it is more likely that she injured her collarbone than her sofa cushions."
Response:  Option A - Balon pękł.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Rozpakowali walizki) will occur. The travelers have just arrived at a hotel, so they are likely to be unpacking their bags rather than going straight to the airport.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ugryzłem brzoskwinię,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Brzoskwinia jest zraniona"" will occur. This is because the word ""ugryźć"" means to bite or pierce something, which could cause harm or injury to a fruit like a strawberry. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome given the context of the sentence."
Response:  Option A (Zjadłem pączka)
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Drzwi się otworzyły) is more likely to occur because ""wypchnęłam"" means pushed or pressed, indicating that the door was forced open. Therefore, it is more likely that the door opened rather than remained closed."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Produkty were subjected to quality tests) is a more plausible explanation for why activists boycotted products than Option B (Products were made by child labor). The passage does not provide any evidence or hints that suggest children were involved in the production of these products. On the contrary, it mentions ""badania"" (tests), which implies a systematic process aimed at ensuring quality. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that a mouse (Option A) has emerged from the hole than a cat (Option B). The reason for this is that mice are known to be able to squeeze through small openings and holes, while cats are generally larger and less likely to fit through such narrow spaces. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible choice based on the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (her sister was happy) is more likely to be the cause of her jealousy.
Response:  Option B - Zmieniłem koszulę.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Klient przeszukał portfel) is more likely as it implies that the client searched through her purse to find the money, rather than giving her money directly to Kasja.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Odesłał tłum) is more likely. The musician drew a crowd, but instead of giving them money, he sent them away. This suggests that the musician's actions were not well-received by the audience.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Tęsknił za rodzeństwem) is more likely. The boy's tears suggest that he misses or longs for his parents, rather than just wanting a treat.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Liście zmieniły kolor) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will do something to make his sister laugh (Option B).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jego ojciec dał mu napoje gazowane) is more likely. The fact that the child was given gasoline to drink suggests a deliberate act of cruelty or neglect by the father, rather than an accidental stop at a gas station.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ryba pływała w kierunek jedzenia) is more likely. The child accidentally fed the fish food in the aquarium, indicating that the fish was swimming towards it, rather than away from it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that she has changed her political views (Option A). The passage states that she ""zamieniły się jej poglądy polítczne,"" which translates to ""changed her political views."" This suggests that she may have shifted her stance on certain issues or parties, rather than participating in protests (Option B). Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for the change in her behavior."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Otworzyłem kran) occurred. The reason for this is that the word ""zatkany"" in Polish means ""flooded,"" which suggests that water has entered the toilet bowl. Opening the drain would allow water to flow out of the toilet, rather than putting something into it. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for what happened based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pociąg przyjechał na stację) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why passengers were evacuated from the train. The other option, Option B (Pociąg gwizdtał), does not provide any obvious reason for why passengers would be evacuated from the train. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he will close the umbrella (Option B). The word ""nacisnął"" in Polish means to press or squeeze something, so it's logical to assume that the man will try to close the umbrella rather than place a stamp on it."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They liked each other) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A - Została zwolniona ze stanowiska.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Księgowy was fired from their job due to poor management of funds rather than taking a maternity leave. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Spojrzałam na zegar,"" option A is more likely. The word ""spojrzałam"" means ""I looked at,"" so it suggests that the speaker saw the clock rather than heard it ticking. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Napisałem esej ręcznie) is a more plausible explanation for why I had a cramp in my hand. Writing an essay by hand can be physically demanding and may lead to muscle fatigue or strain, which could result in a cramp in one's hand. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause.
"Response:  Option A: Zmieniałem śruby.  
Explanation: The premise states that ""Szczyt się zacisnął,"" which means that something heavy or difficult has happened. Option A, ""Zmieniałem śruby,"" suggests that the speaker changed gears, which could be a solution to dealing with a difficult situation like the one described in the premise. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Para wprowadziła się do mieszkania) is true. The fact that Para signed a lease agreement suggests that she has taken possession of the flat and moved in, rather than the city withdrawing the flat from her use. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chciała oglądać zachód słońca) is more likely. The woman's desire to watch the sunset suggests that she was simply enjoying the natural beauty around her, rather than experiencing a supernatural event like seeing a lightning bolt.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mężczyzna nie umiał pływać) is more likely. The fact that he was wearing a life jacket suggests that he may not have been a strong swimmer or familiar with water conditions, making it less likely that he would be able to swim in deep water.
"Response: 
Option B: Nacisnęła klawisz przestrzeni.
Explanation: The premise states that a woman committed an error in the text processor. Option B suggests that she accidentally pressed the space key, which could result in the document being moved to a different location or opened in a new tab. This outcome seems more plausible than option A, where the document would be deleted entirely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dzialacz received a bad grade) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (W noc padało) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the field was wet in the morning. The other option, Option B (Było pełne chwastów), does not provide any clear evidence to support the claim that the field was wet in the morning.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that she overslept (Option A) than that she forgot to set her alarm clock (Option B). Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Siedział w ceniu) is more likely. The sentence implies that Facet was in a shaded area, which suggests he may have been seeking relief from the sun rather than going to the beach. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Naukowcy wycofali teorię) is more likely. The passage states that ""naukowcy potwierdzili teorię,"" indicating that the theory has been supported by scientific evidence. However, it does not mention anything about people accepting or rejecting the theory, suggesting that scientists have withdrawn their support for it."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Gra weszła w nadgodziny) is more likely as it suggests that the game started late due to some unforeseen circumstances, rather than a deliberate mistake by the referee.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The correct answer is (B) Zamek się otworzył.
"Response: 
Option B: Ojciec chwycił syna za rękę. "
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Zgromadziłem śnieg w kulę śnieżną) is correct. The sentence suggests that snow has accumulated in a spherical shape, which is unlikely to be caused by option B (Zmyłem śnieg).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Kajak dotarł na brzeg) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Wpadłaby w płot."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option B (Czułem jak chłodne powietrze przechodziło nade mną) occurred. The use of the word ""chłodne"" suggests a cooling sensation, which aligns with the idea of air blowing onto the skin. Option A does not convey this same sense of coolness."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Były mokre) is more likely. The surfers returned to the beach because they were wet from the ocean, not because they saw a shark.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Water flowed out of the sink) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Przyznał się do niewierności) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Wylełam wodę na plakat.
Explanation: The premise ""Czarnoksiedrowy atrament na plakatach"" suggests that something dark and mysterious has occurred on the posters. Option B, ""Wylełam wodę na plakat,"" means ""I poured water on the poster,"" which could be seen as an unexpected and unusual action for someone to take, especially if they are trying to conceal or cover up something. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer based on the context of the premise provided."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (had a nightmare) is the correct answer. The fact that the child woke up crying suggests that they may have had a disturbing dream or nightmare, rather than simply rolling over in their bed.
"Response: 
Option A: Jego ojciec usiadł przy stole."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that I shouted his name (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Mieszkańcy zorganizowali bunt) is more likely. The premise suggests that the government has been oppressive towards its citizens, leading to frustration and anger among them. This could lead to a situation where they organize themselves into a collective action such as a bunt, rather than simply voting in an election.
"Response: 🔍 Option B: Krzyczał o pomoc.  
Explanation: The boy lost in the forest would be more likely to cry for help than to set up a tent."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Chciała się nauczyć rysowania) is more likely as the reason for the woman's departure from her home country. The premise suggests that she left to learn how to draw, which is a specific skill or activity. Option B (Chciała Poznać inne kultyury) does not provide any context or information about why the woman might have left her home country, making it less likely as the reason for her departure.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (his colleague got an promotion) is more likely as a reason for his jealousy.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Miał halucynacje) is the correct answer. The fact that ""ten osób"" (10 people) saw the aliens suggests that this was a shared experience rather than something that only one person experienced through meditation. Additionally, hallucinations are a common symptom of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, which could be a possible explanation for why these individuals saw things that weren't there."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he used a bleach to change his hair from black to blonde. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Poczuciała natchnienie) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Został zwolniony z wojska) is the correct answer. The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the premise, but it can be inferred that if Syn was recently released from the military, he may have had to leave his home temporarily or permanently due to military obligations. This could explain why he did not return home after his parents passed away.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Trzęszenie ziemi potrząsło półkę z książkami) is the more likely cause for the books to have fallen out of the shelf. The earthquake would provide a sufficient force to knock the books off the shelf. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Włączyłem światło) caused the power to go out in the house rather than Option B (Zresetowałem wyłącznik). This is because turning on a light would require electricity to flow through the circuit, which could potentially cause a short circuit or overload if there are other appliances turned on at the same time. Resetting the breaker, on the other hand, does not directly affect the flow of electricity in the circuit. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for why the power went out in the house.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Jechaliśmy górą górską,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something frightening or unpleasant happened while climbing a mountain, which aligns with Option A's interpretation of ""przerażao"" meaning ""frightened."""
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Worek z popcornem zaczął się rozbijać,"" option B is the most likely cause - ""Podgrzałam w mikrofalówce."" This is because microwaves are a common kitchen appliance used for heating food, and it's unlikely that a worker would start breaking apart while in a fridge or freezer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that there was no electricity in the area (Option A). The statement ""Drzewo spadło na linię elektryczną"" implies that a tree fell onto an electrical line, which would cause power outages in the surrounding area. Since there was no electricity in the area, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the speaker nudged (Option A) rather than offended (Option B) the public. The term ""nudging"" implies a gentle prodding or guiding of people towards a particular perspective or course of action, without being overly forceful or confrontational. In contrast, ""offending"" suggests a stronger negative reaction from the audience, such as anger or outrage. Therefore, Option A is the more likely choice given the information provided in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Z twarzy mi strąciło się trochu potu) is the most likely outcome. The phrase ""strąciło się"" suggests that something has been knocked or hit, which aligns with the context of a person getting hit in the face. Option B (Na palcu utworzyła kropla krwi) implies that there was contact with blood, but it does not necessarily imply that the person got hit in the face."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Była głodna) is more likely. The fact that Ryba was floating on the surface of the water suggests that she may have been unable to feed or swim away from danger, leading to hunger rather than death.
Response:  Option A - Był przeziębiony. (He was overheated.)
"Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Winda dotarła na wyznaczone piętro) is the most likely cause. The fact that ""otworył się"" (the doors) suggests that the wind reached its destination and stopped at a specific floor, indicating that it successfully arrived at the designated level. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A - Okłamał rodzinę - is the correct answer. The fact that ""nastolatek wymknął się z domu"" suggests that something unexpected has happened, and it is unlikely that his parents would hide him without a good reason. Therefore, option A provides a more plausible explanation for why the boy did not come home."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the toilet has filled with water (Option A). This is because the phrase ""Łazienka jest zalana"" specifically refers to a toilet being full of water, rather than a heating system malfunctioning. Therefore, Option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (właściciel przywiązał szczeniaka do kołnierza) is more likely. The fact that the dog remained close to its owner suggests that it was attached or tied to them in some way, rather than simply being carried on a leash as implied by Option B.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Stał pod rozległym drzewem) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Oddzwoniłam do niej."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ich pies uciekł z domu) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the family went searching for something in the nearby area. The other option, Option B (Z ich domu Zaginęły drogie biżuteria), does not provide a clear reason for why the family would be searching for something in their neighborhood.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pogoda była chłodna) is a more likely cause for feeling cold after breathing out than Option B (Miałem napiętą klatkę piersiową). The premise mentions ""oddech"", which suggests that the person is referring to their own exhalation, rather than an external factor like weather or muscle tension in their chest. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person felt cold after exhaling due to the cooler air they breathed out into, rather than any internal factor like muscle tension."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the workers formed a union to demand better working conditions (Option A). The mention of ""warunków pracy"" (working conditions) suggests that the workers were dissatisfied with their current conditions and wanted to improve them through collective action."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zapach gniji wypełnił kuchnię) is more likely. The word ""gnij"" in Polish means to spread or fill something with a smell, so it's likely that the smell of freshly baked apple pie filled the kitchen rather than just being present in one area."
"Response: 
Option B: Zdejmowała buty.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman fought to walk, implying that she had difficulty walking due to some obstacle or challenge. Option B suggests that she removed her shoes as a possible solution to this problem, making it the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Para wypływała z dzbanka wody"", option A is the most likely cause - ""Woda gotowała""."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wszystkie moje skarpetki były w pralni,"" it is more likely that Option A (Miałem sandały) is correct. The use of the word ""skarpetki"" suggests a feminine perspective, and the fact that they were all in the washing machine implies that they are clothing items typically worn by women. Therefore, the speaker is more likely to be wearing sandals than boots."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (lost popularity) is more likely to occur. The argument that the politician has become absurd suggests that they have lost touch with their constituents and are no longer seen as effective or credible leaders. This could lead to a decline in their popularity and support among voters.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Para zeszła w ciąży) will occur. The premise states that ""Wszyscy nie pochwalili zaręczyn tej pary,"" indicating that there are negative reactions to their engagement. This could lead to a situation where the couple decides to keep their pregnancy a secret or hide it from their families and friends, rather than facing their disapproval. Therefore, Option A is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Milioner chciał, że budynek został zburzony) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sprzedawca widiał dziewczynę, jak wkładała towar do torebki) is more likely. The fact that the vendor accused the girl of stealing suggests that he had direct evidence of her involvement in the crime, such as witnessing her taking something from his store. This is more plausible than option B (Sprzedawca pomógł dziewczynie znaleźć torebkę, którą lubiła), as it would be unlikely for the vendor to help a thief find their lost bag without any proof or evidence of theft.
"Response: 
Option A: Żołnierze zostali wysłani do walki.  
Explanation: Given the premise that Kraj has declared war on its neighboring territory, it is more likely that soldiers will be sent to fight rather than joining their families. This choice aligns with the theme of conflict and violence in the scenario."
"Response: 
Option A: Zamieszki przed budynkiem sądu are more likely to occur given the controversial decision of the court."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Wyjął ciasteczka z słoika) is the more likely cause. The smell of something burning suggests that there may have been an accident in the kitchen involving food or a cooking utensil, which could be explained by someone taking a cookie out of the oven. On the other hand, leaving a cookie in the oven for too long can also result in it being burnt, but this scenario seems less plausible given the context of the premise.

Therefore, Option A is the better choice.

Explanation: Based on the premise ""Mężczyzna wkurzył się na swojego przyjaciela,"" it is more likely that his friend interrupted him rather than buying him lunch.

Option A: Błagał jegoto her about accepting him back. 
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he will try to convince or beg her to take him back rather than presenting her to his parents.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chłopak wyostrzył ołówek,"" it is more likely that Option A (It was cheap) is the correct answer.

Response:  Option A (Ujawniłem mu sekret).
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Złapała rybę) is more likely. The fact that she ""unikała wchodzenia"" into the lake suggests that there may be something dangerous or undesirable in the water, which could explain why she didn't want to go in. However, the mention of a ""ryba"" (fish) being caught implies that there was actually something worth catching in the lake, which would make it more likely that she tried to enter the water despite any potential dangers."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jego parasol był zepsuty) is more likely. The fact that he came to class wet suggests that it was raining outside, and therefore his umbrella may have been blown inside or gotten wet in some other way.

Explanation: The correct answer is Option A because it better fits the context of the sentence. ""Czułem"" (I felt) is in the first person singular form, which matches the pronoun ""myself"" used in the premise. Additionally, ""energiczny"" (energetic) is a more common adjective to describe someone's state than ""- bałam"" (which means ""I was tired"").

Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the person might be hesitant about getting inked."
"Response:  Option A: Zacząłem coś podejrzewać.  
Explanation: Given the premise of an unfamiliar car parked outside one's home, it is more likely that the protagonist will start to feel uneasy or suspicious rather than immediately calling the police.

Therefore, option A is the more plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Dowody wskazują na niego) is the more likely cause.

Therefore, option A is the better choice."

"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Sprzedał akcje swojej firmy) is the correct answer. The phrase ""sprzedał akcje swojej firmy"" suggests that the person sold shares of their own company, which implies that they had a financial stake in the company and were able to profit from its success or failure. This is consistent with the idea that the person was the owner or manager of the company and made decisions that affected its financial performance. In contrast, option B (""Marnował fortunę"") does not provide any specific information about the person's role in the company or their involvement in its financial affairs. Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, option A is the more likely explanation for why the person became bankrupt."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Doktor was on leave) is more likely.

The statement ""Wypluję mleko"" implies that something is wrong with the milk, such as its taste being sour or bitter. This is a common problem in dairy farming and can be caused by various factors like improper storage or contamination. On the other hand, having dry mouth could also affect one's ability to taste things properly, but it would not necessarily explain why someone is spitting out milk. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Byłem wcześnie w pracy) is more likely. The use of the past tense ""byłem"" suggests that the speaker was early to work, rather than spooning late."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Butelka z wodą syczyła,"" option A (Odwróciłem butelkę) is the more likely cause of the water spilling out of the bottle. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Wpełzł przez otwarte okno) is more likely. The fact that he was ""zamknięty na zewnątrz"" suggests that he was outside the building when something happened to him, which makes it less likely for him to have woken up on the roof. Additionally, the phrase ""wskoczył na dach"" implies a more deliberate action, which may not be feasible in this scenario. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Gość zapukał do drzwi) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option B: Powiesił go w swojej szafie.
Explanation: The man painted his suit in the premise, indicating that he took some effort to change its appearance. Therefore, it is more likely that he put it away in a safe place rather than taking it to the laundry."

"Response:  Option B: Pacyfistów odbyła parade. 
Explanation: The passage states that ""the number of fatalities in the war has risen,"" indicating an increase in violence and conflict.

Therefore, option B, where pacyfists organized a parade, is more likely to have had an impact on the situation."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ona zawiązała wstążkę) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the action of ""zatwiażała"" (meaning to tie or braid something) is intended, rather than the idea of a simple knot forming spontaneously as suggested by Option B."
Response:  Option B - Wyglądał młodziej.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Z jajka wyłoniło się kurczak,"" it is more likely that option A (Jajko się wykluulo) occurred. This is because the premise suggests that an egg hatched a chicken, which means that the egg must have first contained a developing chicken embryo inside. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how a chicken came to exist from an egg. Option B (""Rozbiłam jajo"") does not make sense in this context, as breaking an egg would not result in a live chicken hatching from it."

"Response: 
Option B: Spadł z drabiny.
Explanation: The premise states that the man lost his balance on the ladder, indicating that he fell from it. Therefore, option B is the more likely outcome."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Przez okno wchodził zimny próág"", option B (Drżałam) is a more likely outcome than option A (Odprężam się). This is because the word ""drżałam"" means ""I was shivering,"" while ""odprężam się"" means ""I relax."" Therefore, given the context of someone feeling cold through a window, it is more likely that they would be experiencing shivers rather than relaxation."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Koledzy szanowali ją) is more likely to be the cause of the student receiving a scholarship. The passage states that ""Student otrzymał stypendium na studia,"" indicating that she received financial aid for her studies. This suggests that it was her peers who admired or respected her, rather than her academic performance, that led to her receiving the scholarship. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Mieszkała obok niej) is true. The passage does not provide any indication of a romantic or sexual relationship between the girl and the boy, and instead focuses on her mocking him. Therefore, it is more plausible that they lived near each other than that she was in love with him.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A is more likely. The phrase ""ukradł"" suggests that the glutton stole food, implying that he did not have enough money to buy it legally. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the glutton is hungry."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chciałem prywatności) is more likely to be the correct answer. The speaker mentions that they called a friend to talk privately, indicating that they wanted some alone time or personal space. This suggests that the speaker was feeling overwhelmed or needed some time to themselves, rather than simply feeling lonely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Uścisnęliem mu dłoń) is the most likely outcome.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Fajerwerki rozstrzelały się w powietrzu) is the more likely cause. The use of the word ""rozstrzelały"" in Polish suggests that something exploded or went off, which aligns with the idea of fireworks shooting up into the air. In contrast, Option B (Frisbee polecielo w moją stronę) does not make sense given the context of the sentence and the fact that fireworks are typically used to celebrate special occasions like weddings."
"Response: 
A) Martwiła herself. "
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Zapisałam spotkanie w kalendarzu) is the correct answer.

"Response: 
Option B: His opponent fell to the ground."
"Response:  Option A - Były dojrzałe.
Explanation: The sentence ""Zbierałem pomidory z winorośli"" implies that the speaker was gathering ripe tomatoes from a grapevine. This means that the tomatoes were already mature and ready to be picked, rather than needing to be polished or processed in any way. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Option A (Spotkał swoją byłą dziewczynę na lunchu)
"Response:  Option B: Pogoda się rozgrzała.
Explanation: The premise states that the temperature reading on the thermometer has increased, indicating a rise in temperature. This can be caused by an increase in ambient temperature, which is option B. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Autostrada stała się niebezpecznie lodowata) is more likely. The sentence suggests that a severe weather event such as a tornado has occurred in the city, causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. It is unlikely that the roof of a court building would be blown away by a tornado, but it is possible that an autostrada (highway) could become dangerous due to ice or snow accumulation caused by the storm.
"Response: 
A) His grades improved."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Kleknąłem na ziemi) is a more plausible explanation for why I felt comfortable than Option B (Zawinąłem się w koc). The phrase ""kleknąłem na ziemi"" suggests that I may have been sitting or lying down comfortably on the ground, which could contribute to my feeling of comfort. In contrast, ""zawinąłem się w koc"" does not provide any obvious reason why I would feel comfortable, and it sounds more like an unusual or awkward position. Therefore, Option A is the better choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Stalo się śliskie) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the coffee will smell strongly (Option A).
"Response: 
Option B: Rozszarpał papiery.
Explanation: The premise states that the man ""przeczesał"" (meaning he read) the newspapers, implying that he handled them carefully and gently. Therefore, it is less likely that he would have ""rozszarpał"" (meaning he tore) them, as this action would suggest a more violent or careless behavior. Option A, ""Zranił się w papierze,"" also seems unlikely, as there is no indication in the premise that the man was injured while reading the papers."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Wbił him in the wood) is more likely. The word ""zardzewiały"" means ""to harden"", so it's unlikely that the paznokieć would have hardened as a result of being hit with a hammer. Option A suggests that the paznokieć was actually struck by the hammer and embedded in the wood, which is a more plausible outcome given the context of the sentence."
Response:  Option A - Rybacz wyciągnął rybę.
"Response:  Option A - Ma pryszcze.
Explanation: The premise states that Nastolatka wstydziła się chodzić do szkoły, implying that she felt embarrassed or ashamed about going to school. This suggests that she may have been avoiding school due to some personal issue, such as bullying or social anxiety. Therefore, option A - Ma pryszcze (She was embarrassed) is a more plausible explanation for why Nastolatka didn't want to go to school."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wyraz twarzy się rozjaśnił"", it is more likely that Option A - ""Dzialałem dobre wieści"" (I received good news) is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ręcznik was mokry) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest that the speaker is attributing their wet hands to something external, rather than themselves being wet. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's hands are wet.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Przegrali grę) is more likely. The team lost the game, indicating that they did not perform well enough to win. This aligns with the idea of them blaming each other for their poor performance.
Response:  Option A: Żałowałem swojego błęду (I apologized for my mistake).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Zadawał jej pytania o nią samą) is the more likely cause of her frustration. The fact that he keeps asking her questions about herself suggests that he may be trying to get closer to her or understand her better, but it can also come across as intrusive or disrespectful if taken too far. On the other hand, if he was constantly talking about himself without giving her a chance to share her thoughts or feelings, she might feel ignored or unheard, which could also lead to frustration.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jeje policzki się zaczerwieniły) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the spaceship exploded over a minefield rather than entering a port. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Facet fell into a kałużę ( Option A). This is because the word ""wpadł"" used to describe Facet's action implies a sudden and unexpected fall, which is more consistent with falling into a kałużę than hitting something like glass ( Option B)."
"Response: 
A) Odkryli tożsamość mordercy. "
"Response:  Option B: Poprosiłem o podwiezienie.  
Explanation: The premise states that there was a lot of traffic on the highway, suggesting that it would be difficult to take a shortcut or ask for a ride. Therefore, option B, asking for a ride, is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Many people became ill) is more likely to occur as a result of a decline in the country's economy. The premise states that the country's economy has fallen, which could lead to a decrease in access to healthcare and an increase in poverty and malnutrition, resulting in widespread illness among the population. Option B (Many people were unemployed) does not necessarily follow from the given premise, as there may be other factors contributing to unemployment such as technological advancements or changes in industry structure rather than solely a decline in the economy.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Chcieli wpaść w napływający z przeciwnej strony ruch) is the more likely cause for why the guardian chose to protect the children from the incoming crowd. The guardian may have been aware of the potential danger posed by the large group of people approaching from the opposite direction and decided to act quickly to safeguard the children's well-being. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for the guardian's actions based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Powiedział mi pravdu) is more likely to be the correct answer. The use of the word ""przyjaciel"" (friend) in the premise suggests a close relationship between the speaker and their friend, and the fact that they are looking back on something their friend said implies that it was significant or meaningful. Given this context, it is more likely that the friend told the truth rather than making a sarcastic comment."
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the driver ran out of gas (Option A). The premise states that the car has finished its fuel, indicating that the driver no longer has access to gasoline for the vehicle. This makes Option A a more plausible outcome than Option B, where the driver picks up a hitchhiker.
"Response: 
Option A: Dziecko urodziło się."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zdejmował kapelusz) is more likely. The sentence suggests that something external to the person caused their hat to fly away, rather than a natural phenomenon like wind blowing it off their head.
"Response: 
Option A: Dzysta received an invitation to the party."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jego matka zmierzyła temperatura) is more likely. The fact that the boy's forehead was hot suggests that he may have a fever, which his mother would want to measure using a thermometer. Taking him to the park might not be the most appropriate response to this situation, as it would not address the underlying cause of the fever.
"Response:  Option A - Chciał zaimponować swojej randce.  
Explanation: The premise states that ten people were splashing in the water, implying a recreational activity. Option A aligns better with this context as it suggests that one of the individuals wanted to impress their date by showing off their swimming skills. Option B does not make sense in this scenario as there is no logical connection between using hair gel and splashing in the water."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Szukałem latarki) is the correct answer. The fact that the power in the house has gone out suggests that there may be a problem with the electrical system, which could cause the lights to flicker or go out entirely. It is less likely that someone would take a hammer (Option B) to fix the issue, as this would not address the underlying problem of the power going out.
"Response: 
Option B: Matka urodiła bliźnieTA. 
Explanation: The premise states that the family moved into a larger house, indicating that their previous living situation was not large enough to accommodate their growing needs. This suggests that the birth of twins would be a significant reason for the move, as it would require additional space and resources to care for two infants simultaneously. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause based on the information provided in the premise."

Response:  Option A - Maszyna wypluła resztę. 
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Odwróciłam na niego oczami) is the correct answer. The phrase ""umarł"" means ""died"" in Polish, and the context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is reflecting on their friend's death. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be to express sadness or grief, rather than trying to comfort the deceased person."
"Response: 
Option B: Zapłacił gotówkę."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (obciął paznokcie) is more likely to be the cause of the man's misfortune. The premise suggests that the man was cursed by someone who cut off his fingernails, which is a common superstition in some cultures. It is less likely that he would have accidentally hit himself with his own pinky finger.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jego brat się pokłócił z rodzicami) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the man's pride in his brother. The other option does not provide any logical connection to the premise.

Explanation: The girl wanted to learn about the Solar System, so she looked at the stars instead of going to a library. This option is more likely because it aligns with her goal of learning about space."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Postawiem plakat nad drzwiami) is more likely as it aligns with the context of the situation. The placard has already been attached to the wall, so it's unlikely that the person would then attach it above the doors. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
Option B: Architekt dostosował plany. 
Explanation: The premise states that the client approved the architect's plans, indicating that the architect made changes to the original design in order to meet the client's approval. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."
Response:  Option A: His hand shook.
"Response: 
Option B: Zarząd znalazł jego zastępcę."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the speaker sat in the last row (Option A). This is because the speaker mentions that they arrived late for the lecture, which suggests that they may have had to find a seat quickly without much time to spare. Sitting in the last row would be a practical choice in this situation as it would give the speaker the least amount of distance to travel to reach their destination.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person was released from prison due to their family paying a bail. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sprzedali swój dom) is more likely. The family sold their house to buy food for themselves, indicating that they are in a difficult financial situation where they have lost all of their belongings.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the zinc container was subjected to recycling (Option A). The word ""rozbił"" in Polish means ""broke"", but in this context, it does not make sense as the container would need to be broken down for recycling purposes. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: Nauczyła się umiejętności komunikacji. 
Explanation: The premise states that the girl joined a debate team, indicating that she became proficient in public speaking and communication skills, rather than learning how to use a computer."
"Response: 
Option B: Umyłam naczynia.
Explanation: The premise states that the mood has improved, indicating a positive change. Option B suggests that cleaning dishes may have contributed to this improvement, as it can be a calming and satisfying task. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."

Explanation: The text states that the organization set a goal of collecting money, which suggests that they organized an event such as an auction to achieve this goal. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Podróżował na północ) is more likely. 
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zrecyklowałem papier) is a more likely outcome than option B (Papier się zmarszczył).

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Wyrzucono him to prison) is more likely. The sentence ""Zbrodniarz został stracony"" implies that the person was executed by the state, which means they were not sentenced to prison.

Option A (Podkrewciłgłośność) does not provide a clear explanation for why the music was too weak to hear.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Dziewczyna to rozkręciła) is the correct answer. The phrase ""wystały mu na głowę"" suggests that something unexpectedly grew out of the boy's head, which aligns with the idea of the girl pulling his hair. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Robię to, co muszę) suggests that the speaker may have taken some kind of action or medication to prevent sexual attraction or arousal. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as medical conditions, personal preferences, or cultural/religious beliefs. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause for the situation described in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Otworzyłem oczy,"" option A (Obudziłam się) is a more likely cause than option B (Odprężam się). This is because the verb ""otworzyć"" in Polish means ""to open,"" while ""obudzić"" means ""to wake up."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker opened their eyes rather than relaxed them."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zarabiał poniżej minimalnej płacy) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Student sought employment) will occur.

Therefore, it makes sense that they would now seek to apply their knowledge and skills in a professional setting by seeking employment.

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Skończyły mi się tematy do rozmowy) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker has run out of topics to discuss, rather than the conversation becoming tense.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A: Powitałem him in the home.  The brother was discharged from the hospital, indicating he has recovered or been cleared to leave the medical facility, so it's reasonable to assume he would be returning home rather than being met with coldness by his sibling.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zasłona na scenie została podniesiona) is more likely. The fact that the scene has been opened suggests that something significant has happened, such as a change in location or time, rather than simply actors leaving the stage.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Porywacz groził, że skrzywdzi zakładnika) is more likely. The use of the word ""groził"" suggests a threat or danger to the hostage, which implies that the abductor may have harmed or threatened to harm them if they do not comply with their demands. This is in line with the definition of coercion as ""unlawful detention or imprisonment, often accompanied by threats or violence."" Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer based on the given information."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Muzyk uderzył stopą) is a more plausible explanation for why there was a loud noise on stage. The word ""stopa"" in Polish refers to a drum or percussion instrument, so it's unlikely that the musician would have hit the bęben (drum) with their foot. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (dziecko obudziło się krzycząc z koszmaru) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Urodziła się głuchą) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the woman was able to communicate through sign language, indicating that she may have been born deaf or had significant hearing impairment from an early age. This is a more plausible explanation than Option A (Urodziła się przedwcześnie), as there is no indication in the premise that the woman was born prematurely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the crops were damaged or ""zniszczyły się"" ( Option B) rather than the water being contaminated or ""skażona"" (Option A). The wording of the premise suggests a general lack of rainfall in the area, which could lead to drought conditions and damage to crops but not necessarily affect the quality of the water."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Kot gonił ptaka,"" it is more likely that Option A: Ptak odleciał. The premise implies that the cat was chasing the bird, but since birds can fly away quickly, it is more likely that the bird escaped rather than being caught by the cat."

"Response: 
Option B: Pracownicy strajkowali. 
Explanation: The właściciel's refusal to grant a pay raise suggests that he may be unwilling or resistant to compromise with his employees. In this scenario, it is more likely that the workers will resort to industrial action such as a strike in order to pressure the management into meeting their demands."
"Response:  Option A: Ekstremiści na niego wpłynęli.  
Explanation: The premise suggests that the leader introduced extremists to a conflict with their country, implying that they had some level of control or influence over these groups. It is less likely that the leader would be directly responsible for their murder, as this would imply a higher level of involvement in their death than what the premise suggests. Therefore, option A is the more likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Piasek mi się przyczepił do stóp) is more likely. The sentence suggests that sand has stuck to my feet, indicating a gentle touch or movement of the sand rather than a strong impact from waves.
"Response:  Option B: Wypiałem szklankę wody.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker felt cold in the middle of the night, suggesting that they were not sweating or producing body heat. Drinking water would not have caused them to feel warmer, so option B is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (her son smiled) is the correct answer. The premise states that Matka killed her son, which implies a negative outcome for him. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would smile in response to such an event. Option B (he yelped) also does not fit with the given information as it suggests a loud noise, which is not consistent with the idea of someone being killed.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dziura w moich dżinsach,"" option A (Zamknąłem dżinsy) is the more likely cause. The sentence suggests that there is a hole in the speaker's pants, which could be caused by someone closing or zipping them up too tightly. Option B (Potknąłem się o chodnik) does not provide any context for why there would be a hole in the speaker's pants."
"Response:  Option A - Ma dziurę.
Explanation: The premise ""Chłopak nosił aparat"" (The boy was carrying a camera) implies that he had something heavy in his hands, which could cause him to trip or fall. Therefore, option A, ""Ma dziurę"" (He has a hole), is more likely as it suggests that the boy may have fallen and gotten hurt. Option B, ""Zęby mu się wyprostał"" (His teeth grew out), is less plausible as there is no logical connection between carrying a camera and having one's teeth grow out."
"Response:  Option B - Obudziłam się dziś z bólem gardla.
Explanation: The premise states that you exercised yesterday, but today you woke up with a sore throat. This suggests that the cause of the soreness is not related to your workout, but rather something else such as a cold or allergy.

"Response:  Option A - Ugryzłem się w język.  
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker took a sip of hot coffee, indicating that they touched their tongue to something hot. This is more likely to result in burns or discomfort than spilling coffee on one's shirt, as suggested by option B. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Option A (Pisarz unikał uprzedzeń w swoich opowieściach)
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Spałem cały dzień) is more likely to be the correct answer because it matches the grammatical structure of the sentence and makes sense in the context of the conversation.
"Response:  Option A - Zidentyfikowała objawy pacjenta.
Explanation: The premise states that the doctor diagnosed the patient with a condition, indicating that the doctor identified symptoms in the patient. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Zarysowałem się,"" it is more likely that the cause of the mess is Option A: ""Było pociane."" This is because ""zarysować"" means to draw or paint something, which suggests that the speaker made a mess while drawing or painting something."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the man suffered a psychological breakdown or lost control over himself (Option A) rather than having a heart attack (Option B). The phrase ""przeszedł nagłą operację"" suggests that the man underwent an unexpected surgical procedure, which could be a source of significant stress and trauma leading to a mental health crisis."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Zgiął ręce) is the more likely cause of the swollen arms. This is because the word ""wybrzuszone"" in Polish implies a sudden and significant increase in size, which could be caused by an injury or trauma to the arm muscles. Option B (Pocierał sobie ręce), on the other hand, suggests that the person may have accidentally hit their own arms, but it does not convey the same level of severity as the original premise. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response: 
Option A: Był zaskoczony."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Wybaczyłem kolegę za jego błąd) is more likely. The speaker seems to be taking responsibility for their own actions rather than blaming someone else or assuming they know better. This suggests that the speaker may have a more positive attitude towards their colleague's mistake and is willing to accept responsibility for their own role in it.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Zaczął więcej ćwiczyć) is more likely to lead to quitting smoking than option B (Zaczął się budzić wcześniej). This is because exercising regularly can help reduce nicotine cravings and increase motivation to quit smoking.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The fact that the woman hit the attacker in the nose suggests that there may be some injury or bleeding involved, making option B the most likely outcome. Option A is unlikely as it implies that the attacker died, which is not supported by the information provided in the premise.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the man did not aim) is the correct answer. The premise states that ""Strzała nie trafiła w cele,"" which means ""The bullet did not hit its target."" This implies that the person shooting the gun did not accurately aim or shoot the bullet towards the target, rather than simply missing the target altogether. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the bullet did not hit its target."
"Response:  Option A - Odkrył szczury w piwnicy.  
Explanation: The premise mentions that the owner of the house asked for a guard to come to his home, suggesting that there may be something valuable or important inside the house that needs protecting. The mention of ""szczury"" (rats) in the piwnicy (basement) implies that there could be an infestation of rodents in the house, which would be a common problem that a guard might be called to address. Therefore, option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Byłam zbyt zmęczona, by cokolwiek przygotować) is more likely. The speaker mentions that they were too tired to prepare anything for dinner, indicating that their fatigue was the reason for not being able to cook.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Zaczęła ukrywać pamiętnik) is more likely. The girl's reaction to finding her brother reading her diary suggests that she values her privacy and personal space, so it makes sense that she would try to hide her diary from him in order to protect herself.
"Response:  Option A - Worked overtime.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman had little money for rent, indicating that she may have been working excessively to make ends meet. Working overtime is a common solution for people who are struggling financially, as it provides them with additional income to pay their bills and cover their expenses. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome in this scenario."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Dotknął gorącego pieca) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise mentions that the child's hand quickly withdrew, indicating that it was exposed to something hot. This is consistent with the idea of touching a hot stove or oven, which would cause immediate pain and withdrawal of the hand. In contrast, Option B (Podał szczeniakowi po głowie) does not fit as well with the given premise, as there is no mention of any heat source involved.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Rozdzierali ankietę klientom) is more likely to lead to a higher level of customer satisfaction because it allows customers to provide their direct feedback and opinions about their experience with the company. This will give the company valuable insights into what they are doing well and where they can improve, allowing them to make targeted changes that will increase customer satisfaction. In contrast, Option A (Zaoferowali zniżki nowym klientom) may not have as much impact on customer satisfaction since it only benefits new customers and does not address any underlying issues with existing services or products.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chłopak wyrzucił poduszki z kanapy) is more likely. The fact that the floor was drawn suggests that someone intentionally threw or pushed something onto the floor, rather than simply pulling a chair across it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ukryłem twarz"", option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Uderzył ją piorun) is more likely. The idea that a famous statue caught fire due to lightning strike is more plausible than people coming from far away to worship it.
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Owocami rzucają nasiona"" (The fruit throws seeds). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that something is happening to the fruit itself, rather than just being affected by an external factor like much activity. Therefore, the most likely explanation for why the fruit has left seeds on the table is that they have naturally produced them as part of their reproductive process."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Wskazała palcami) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nauczył się je wiązać) is more likely. The child solved the knots, indicating that they learned how to tie them.
Response:  Option A: Oddałem książkę. 
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that his parents had an influence on him (Option A). The passage states that he ""wyznawał podobne wierzenia"" as his parents, indicating that their beliefs were passed down to him. This suggests that his parents played a significant role in shaping his religious views, rather than rejecting them entirely (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that the car has run out of fuel (Option A). The fact that the car slowed down and then stopped suggests that there was a gradual loss of power, which could be caused by running out of fuel rather than the driver falling asleep (Option B).
"Response:  Option B - Lodies spadły z stożka.  
Explanation: The premise states that a man ate ice cream in the sun, which is not possible as ice cream melts when exposed to heat from the sun. Therefore, it is more likely that the ice cream fell off the cone rather than losing its taste."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Dywan wyglądał na brudny) is more likely as it provides a specific detail about the appearance of the room that could be observed by someone entering it. The other option does not provide any specific details or clues to help determine the most likely cause.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Boli mnie głova) is more likely to be the correct answer. The sentence structure and vocabulary used in this option are consistent with a headache being described as ""boli,"" which means ""hurts"" or ""aches."" Additionally, the use of the word ""glava"" instead of ""ciało"" suggests that the speaker may be experiencing a localized pain rather than a general body aching sensation. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Właściciel nakrzytał szczeniakowi) is more likely. The use of the word ""nakrzyczyć"" suggests a negative reaction from the owner towards the dog, who has made a mess on the sofa. Option B (Właściciel dał szczeniakowi przysmaki) does not convey the same level of anger or frustration as the first option."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Moj prijatel mi wybaczył) is more likely. The sentence structure and word choice suggest a more formal and polite tone, which aligns with the idea of asking for forgiveness. In contrast, Option B (Moj prijateł wpadł w furyę) suggests a more intense emotion such as anger or rage, which doesn't fit well with the context of asking for forgiveness.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Nosił plecak) is more likely to be the cause of why he stood out in a crowd.  
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that he will be accused of perjury (Option B). The phrase ""świadek skłamał pod przysięgą"" means ""the witness lied under oath,"" indicating that the person gave false testimony while testifying in court. Being accused of perjury is a common consequence for someone who provides false testimony while under oath. Therefore, Option B is the most likely outcome based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chciała nowego wyglądu) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: Zostali deportowani.  
Reasoning: The premise states that immigrants were caught illegally staying in the country. This implies that they are not legally allowed to be in the country, and therefore are likely to have been deported rather than finding work."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Publiczność się śmiała) is more likely. The speaker's joke has elicited laughter from the audience, indicating that they found it amusing or funny.
"Response:  Option A - Słońce mnie oślepiło.  
Explanation: The premise ""Spojrzałam w słońce"" implies that the speaker looked directly at the sun, which can cause a condition known as solar retinopathy or solar blindness. This condition occurs when the retina is exposed to too much UV radiation from the sun, causing damage to the photoreceptors in the eye. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice because it suggests that the speaker's eyes were affected by looking directly at the sun."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Snuchnąłem) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Stek was rough) is a more likely cause for why it was difficult to cut through him.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Dostała alimenty) is the correct answer. The phrase ""ogłosiła bankructwo"" suggests that the woman has declared herself bankrupt, which means she cannot pay her debts. In this situation, it is common for a court to grant her alimenty, or financial support, from her ex-husband to help her cover her living expenses. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Zastanawiałem się, czy go nie ma) is more likely. The speaker is uncertain about whether their friend's lights are on or off, indicating that they are not sure if their friend is home or not. This suggests that they do not have a clear reason to visit their friend's house. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice.
"Response: 
Option A: Kwitnę z kwiata."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Spotkała przyjaciela z dzieciństwa) is more likely. The mention of nostalgia suggests that the woman has been feeling sentimental or wistful about something from her past, and encountering an old friend would be a common trigger for these feelings.
"Response: 
Option B: Przesłany został niepełny document."
"Response: 
Option B: Zadzwoniłem do mechanika. 
Explanation: The premise states that the car broke down, so it's more likely that the speaker called a mechanic to fix the problem rather than being in a shopping mall."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that option A (the letter was anonymous) is the correct answer. The passage states that ""Wyrzuciłem list,"" which means ""I threw a letter."" Since the author of the letter remains anonymous, it is unlikely that the letter was not clear or difficult to read. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ptak zaczoł skrzydłami"", it is more likely that Option A (Składała jaja) is correct. The phrase ""Zaczoł skrzydłami"" means ""Flew away"" in Polish, so the bird flew away with its eggs rather than itself flying upwards."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Garage was open) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Przestępca odłożył broń) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (Miałem zamiar wziąć udział w pogrzebie mojego wuja) is more likely as it provides a specific context for the action of ""czekałem"" that is consistent with the meaning of the verb in this situation. Option B (Miałem Zamiar wziąć udział w ślubie mojego przyjaciela) does not provide any such context and seems less plausible given the information provided."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (I had a dream) caused the loss of time. The passage does not provide any specific details to suggest that Option B (I had a migraine) was the cause. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (W drukarcy skończył się atrament) is more likely as it provides a specific reason for why the document may be difficult to read. Option B (Wydrukowano go z papieru) does not provide any explanation for why the document is difficult to read.
"Response:  Option B: Fani wpadli na boisko. 
Explanation: The sentence ""Na stadionie brzmiał hymn nacionalny"" suggests that there was a national anthem being played at the stadium. This implies that fans are present at the stadium watching a sporting event or concert. Given this context, it is more likely that fans would rush towards the field rather than turning to face a flag. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Option A (Ja ją podałem).

"Response:

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Mężczyzna spojrzał przez okno) is more likely. The man looking out of the window suggests that he is trying to get a better view or understanding of his surroundings, which aligns with the idea of him being in an airplane experiencing turbulence. Option A (Mężczyzna zacisnął pasy) does not provide any contextual clues related to the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Dziewczyna go pchnęła) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (amputation of a leg) will be chosen by the doctors as the best course of action for their patient's condition. The premise states that the patient has been in an accident and suffered severe injuries, including the loss of a limb. This suggests that the patient's situation is critical and requires immediate medical attention to prevent further complications or death. In such a scenario, amputation may be necessary to save the patient's life or prevent further damage. Option B (monitoring her functions) does not seem to address the urgent nature of the patient's condition and may not be sufficient to ensure the patient's survival.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chłopak wdepnęł w błoto,"" option A is the most likely outcome. The word ""wdepnęły"" implies that he got stuck in the mud, so it's unlikely that the mud would have hit him in the face (option B). Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that schools have been closed (Option A). The reason being that snowfall of a few centimeters is not usually sufficient to warrant people hiding underground. While some people may choose to stay indoors due to inclement weather conditions, it is unlikely that entire cities would be forced to evacuate their homes for such a minor snowfall event.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Groził, that rzuci trabaj) is more likely. The employee's threat to quit suggests a higher level of frustration or dissatisfaction with their job than simply going home for the day.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zrzuciłem siekierę w dół do drewna) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the tree broke apart into two halves. Option A (Włożyłem drewno do komina) does not provide any clear reason for why the tree would break apart in this manner.

Explanation: The premise mentions a ""zakupy"" (purchases), which suggests that the man went shopping for groceries or other items.

Therefore, option B is more likely, as it involves the man fetching a pizza from a nearby pizzeria."
"Response: 
Option B: She worked hard."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Jego syn odziedziczył fortunu) is more likely. The fact that the rich man died of old age suggests that he had a long life and accumulated wealth over time, making it more likely that his son inherited his fortune rather than having legal troubles.
"Response:  Option A - Płomienie zgasły. 
Explanation: The premise states that a woman was rescued from the ashes of a fire. This implies that the fire has already been extinguished or has burned out, making option A (the fire has burned out) the most likely outcome."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option B: Przegapiłem śniadanie (I overslept breakfast) occurred. The sentence ""Przespałem budzik"" (I woke up late) suggests that the speaker did not get enough sleep or overslept their alarm clock, leading to them missing breakfast."

Response:  Option A - Woda w łazienicy stała się letnia.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Dołączył do bractwa) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the information provided in the premise. The fact that the student wanted to meet other students on campus suggests that he may have been looking for social opportunities or ways to connect with others, which joining a fraternity could provide. In contrast, studying engineering does not necessarily imply an interest in meeting new people or forming connections beyond one's academic pursuits. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer based on the given information.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Szukałem drobnych) is the correct answer. The phrase ""poduszki z kanapy"" suggests that something has been taken from a couch or sofa, and the word ""drobi"" means small or insignificant.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Chłopak uciekł) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that she was sentenced to community service (Option A). The sentence of death (Option B) would be a much harsher punishment for a minor offense like disrupting a public gathering.

Explanation: The premise states that the tea was too hot for the sugar to dissolve, indicating that the tea has cooled down. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that he was called to war (Option A). The phrase ""weteran chorował"" suggests that he had a disease or illness related to his military service, rather than an injury sustained in battle."

Explanation: Given that the criminal has escaped from the police, it is more likely that the police are chasing after him rather than focusing on the victim."
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (Upset him) is the correct answer. The laptop not turning on could be due to various reasons such as a dead battery or a faulty charging port, but upsetting someone is unlikely to cause this issue. Therefore, option A is the better choice.

The phrase ""nie miała już miejsca w szafie"" suggests that there was no space left in the closet for the woman's clothes, implying that she had recently done laundry (pranie). Therefore, Option B is the most likely explanation for why the woman did not have any place to put her clothes in the closet."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (his wife left him) is the correct answer. The premise states that he has a broken heart, implying that something tragic or difficult has happened in his personal life, such as a divorce or separation from his partner.

This is a common symptom of obstructive sleep apnea, a condition where the airway collapses during sleep, causing pauses in breathing.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Zapytałem mojego przyjaciela, czy byłby zainteresowany pójściem) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A: Przyniosłam koce occurred. The reason for this is that opening windows (Option B) would not necessarily fix a malfunctioning air conditioner in a house. It is more plausible that something else caused the AC to break down, such as a mechanical failure or a power outage, which could be fixed by turning off the unit and unplugging it until repairs can be made.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chłopak ma bóle pleców,"" option A is more likely. The fact that his backpack was open suggests that he may have accidentally left it unzipped or undone, leading to the contents spilling out and causing discomfort or pain in his back."

Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (pszczoła ukąsiła ogrodnika) is more likely as a cause for the destruction of narcyzy in the garden. The idea that wiewiórki wykopały żarówki does not align with the given information as there is no indication of any rodents digging up fireworks in the passage. Therefore, pszczoła ukąsiła ogrodnika is the more plausible explanation for the destruction of narcyzy in the garden.
"Response:  Option B: Zapał wywołał płomień.  
Explanation: The premise states that I turned on the stove, implying that a spark or flame was produced when the burner was ignited. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation as it suggests that the spark from the match lit the gas on fire, causing a blaze to occur."

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A ( ich rodzici nie żyją) is more likely to be the cause of why the children were sent to an orphanage. The phrase ""wysłani do sierocińca"" suggests that the children were intentionally sent there, rather than being abandoned or left by their parents. Therefore, it is more likely that the children's parents are dead or no longer able to care for them, rather than simply being late in picking them up."
Response:  Based on the premise that a meteor has landed in the ocean, it is more likely that there will be a tsunami (Option A). When a large object like a meteor hits the water, it can create a massive wave known as a tsunami. The impact of the meteor would displace a large amount of water, causing the wave to grow in size and speed. Gradual flooding (Option B) is less likely to occur from a meteor landing in the ocean because the impact would cause immediate displacement of water.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the traveler will be affected by option A - ""Odwodniła się"". The phrase ""jadowity wąż"" suggests that the snake is venomous, and the traveler may have been bitten and therefore fallen unconscious or become disoriented.

"Response:

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Podłoga była nierówna) is more likely to be the cause of the table rocking back and forth. The unevenness of the floor can make the table wobble, especially if it's not properly secured or if there are any cracks or holes in the surface. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response: 
Option A: Jego syn wyznał prawdę.  
Explanation: The premise states that ojciec przyłapał syna na kłamstwie, implying that the son was caught lying. Therefore, option A, where the son confesses the truth, is more likely to occur."
"Response:  Option B: Wziął aspirynę. 
Explanation: The premise states that the person's head was pulsing with pain, indicating a possible migraine or severe headache. Aspirin is commonly used to treat headaches such as these, while syrup (without further context) may not be effective in relieving pain. Therefore, option B is more likely."

"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that ""Spalulo"" (Option A) occurred. The word ""spalulo"" means to burn or scorch something, which fits with the context of a pie looking at a sticky table. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."

"Response: 
Option A: Znajomi wyrazili sceptycyzm. 
Explanation: The passage states that ""Kobieta twierdziła, że widziała ducha."" (The woman claimed to have seen a ghost.) This implies that the woman's claim was not taken seriously or believed by her friends, who were skeptical of her assertion. Therefore, Option A is the more likely answer."

Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Balon się rozpłukał) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: Miał udar.  
Explanation: The premise states that the person lost their ability to speak, which suggests a neurological issue such as a stroke or brain injury (udar in Polish). This is more likely than Option B, which simply describes taking a deep breath."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (W cementie była pęknięcie) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman fell onto the sidewalk than Option B (Słyszała, jak ją wołano). The fact that she was in contact with concrete suggests that there may have been a crack or hole in the pavement that caused her to lose her balance and fall. Woofing sounds are not typically associated with this type of incident. Therefore, Option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - ""Ratownik wskoczył za nim"" - occurred. The reason for this is that a person cannot physically move an object as heavy as a cannonball using their own strength, especially in water.

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Moja infekcja się rozprzestrzeniła) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that the light changed to yellow because the driver pressed the brake pedal (Option A). This is a common cause of traffic lights changing color. On the other hand, honking the horn (Option B) is less likely to cause the light to change color.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Zamoczyłem pojemnik w ciepłej wodzie) caused the plastic to melt. This is because exposure to hot water can cause plastic to soften or melt, whereas direct heat from a stove or oven would be more likely to burn or deform the plastic. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why the plastic container melted.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Kierowca uderzył w słup telefoniczny) is a more likely cause than Option B (Kierowca przejechał na czerwonym). This is because the wording of the premise specifically mentions that the car was ""wgnieciony,"" which suggests that something heavy hit the car from above, rather than simply running over a red light."
Response:  Option B: Zdał egzamin.
"Response: 
Option A: Bał się nauczyć pływać.  
Explanation: The premise states that the young boy ""przylgnął"" to the edge of the pool, implying that he was unable to swim or struggled in the water. Therefore, option A is the most likely cause as it suggests that the boy was afraid to learn how to swim."

The premise states that the person applied their hand to their chest, which can cause a physical sensation of heart palpitations or racing.

"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pływak zanurzył się w basenie) is more likely. The word ""wysypiała"" in Polish means to float or surface, so it's more likely that the water floated onto the shore rather than the swimmer rising upwards."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Przypadkowo połknęliem nasienie) is more likely. The word ""Ugryzłem"" in Polish means ""I bit/ate"", and ""kawałek arbuza"" means ""a piece of apple"". So, it's more likely that the speaker accidentally bit their tongue or lip while eating an apple than breaking a tooth."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Jego kurtka była odzipnięta) is more likely as it provides a clear and specific reason for why the boy might have fallen over. The other option, Option B (Jego sznurki były rozwiązane), does not provide such a clear explanation. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
"Response: 
Option B: Had her ears pierced."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Wypiałem całą wodę) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that the program was censored because of vulgar language used in the show rather than a complicated plot. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

"Response:  Option B - Mój przyjaciel mnie bronił.  
Explanation: Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the person will defend or protect themselves from the ten people who are fighting with them rather than introducing them to someone new. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Wpompowałem powietrze do opony) will cause the tire to become inflated than Option B (Przeładunki biegów na rowerze). This is because the word ""opona"" specifically refers to the tire, indicating that the action of inflating it is intended. Additionally, the phrase ""mojego roweru"" suggests that the speaker owns the bike, further reinforcing the idea that they are referring to their own tire."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dziewczyna wyglądała blado,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""wyglądała blado"" suggests that the girl was pale or weak, which could be a sign of illness or fatigue. It's less likely that her father would touch her head in this scenario."

Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that he was zadłużony (Option A).

Ospy wietrzne (Wind sickness) is a common illness in Poland, especially during the winter months when the winds are strong. Therefore, it is plausible that the girl was unable to go to school because of this illness rather than enjoying mathematics."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Worek na śmieci był pełny"", option A is more likely. The word ""pełny"" suggests that the trash can was full, so it's unlikely that the speaker would have put the item in the recycling bin (option B). Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Odkurzyłem dywan,"" it is more likely that Option A (Mój współlokator rozlał puncha) is the correct answer. The word ""odkurzył"" in Polish means to spill or splash something, so it suggests that the speaker's roommate may have accidentally knocked over a drink or spilled something on the carpet."
"Response: 
Option B: Rzucił krzesło przez pokój."
Response: 🔥 Option A: Gałązka spłonęła. 🔥
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Gorąca woda zniknęła) is more likely. The fact that water has disappeared suggests that it may have evaporated or been absorbed by something else in the environment, rather than simply disappearing without a trace.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Złożyli na koszty czesnego) will have a greater impact than Option B (Zachęcali swoje dzieci do zabawy na zewnątrz). This is because paying for expensive extracurricular activities may be seen as a way to motivate children to study harder in order to earn the money needed to participate. On the other hand, simply encouraging children to play outside may not have the same motivational effect.
Response:  Option A - Buty się rozluźniły.
"Response:

Explanation: The man ate half of the pierogies, but he didn't freeze them. He preserved the recipe, meaning he wrote it down or memorized it so that he could make them again in the future."

"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Rozmawiałem z kolegą przy biurku) is more likely. The fact that ""moje drzwo"" are open suggests that the speaker is in their office, and therefore more likely to be having a conversation with a colleague nearby."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Usiadłem) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mężczyzna przypatrzył się muchzie,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - ""Mucha odleciała."" This is because when a man looks at a fly, it is likely to fly away in response to being observed."

Explanation: The phrase ""wiszący most"" in Polish can be translated to English as ""hanging bridge"". This implies that the traveler was walking across a suspension bridge, which could be quite an intimidating experience for someone who is not comfortable with heights. Therefore, option B - being in ecstasy - is more likely, as it suggests a sense of wonder or amazement at the scenery around them, rather than fear or anxiety."
"Response:  Option B: Założył się ze swoimi przyjaciółmi.  
Explanation: The premise states that ten people predicted their team's victory, indicating a high level of confidence in their prediction. Given this context, it is more likely that they would celebrate their victory together rather than simply watching the game from afar."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Chłopak nie mógł zasniać,"" Option A (Ustawiał budzik) is more likely. The word ""budzik"" means alarm clock in Polish, so it's likely that the boy couldn't fall asleep because he was waiting for his alarm clock to go off."
