Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Es came more people into the line) is the more likely cause for why the woman lost her place in the queue.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Mädchen kniffte sich die Nase,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""sabbert"" (meaning to make a mess or stain) is not commonly used in German to describe a baby's actions, but rather as an insult to refer to someone who makes a mess unintentionally. Therefore, it is unlikely that the baby would have intentionally made a mess with its windel."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the audience clapping to the music) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the girl brought the teacher an apple) is more likely. The fact that the girl wanted to thank her math teacher suggests that she has a positive relationship with him, so it's more likely that she would show her appreciation in a tangible way like bringing him a small gift rather than simply staying after class.
"Response:  Option B: They have marshmallows on the campfire. 
Explanation: The premise states that the young campers had fear, indicating a negative emotion. Option B mentions roasting marshmallows on the campfire, which is a fun and enjoyable activity for children. Therefore, it is more likely that option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (he has a head injury) is more likely. The man may have hit his head during an accident or fall, causing him to lose consciousness or experience confusion and disorientation.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Seemann wurde in Quarantäne gestellt,"" it is more likely that he was exposed to the disease (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (She rezedited it for herself) is more likely. The fact that she has memorized the code suggests that she has put in effort to commit it to memory, rather than simply forgetting to write it down.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Das Wasser löschte meinen Durst) is more likely. The premise states that ich schüttete das Wasser in das Glas, indicating that water was poured into a glass, and then it mentions that das Wasser löschte meinen Durst, which means that drinking the water quenched my thirst. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Er wanted to offer his friend support) is more likely. The man remained silent because he was thinking of how he could help or support his friend, rather than just reflecting on what his friend had said.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Unfall war meine Schuld,"" option A (Ich fühlte mich schuldig) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Die Kette war um einen Reifen gewickelt) is a more likely cause for the chain to break apart as it suggests that the chain was wrapped around a wheel, which can put additional stress on the chain causing it to break. Option B (Es gab eingebrochenes Glied in der Kette) does not provide any specific information about what caused the chain to break apart and could be due to various reasons such as wear and tear or damage from an external force. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.

Response:  Based on the premise, option B (She has gone to court) is more likely. The premise mentions that she decided to run for public office, which implies that there may have been an issue with her qualifications or eligibility to hold the office.

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann hatte Tränen in den Augen,"" option B is more likely. The man had tears in his eyes, indicating that he was crying or emotional, rather than having something in his eyes like dust or a shield."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ihr Gegner beschuldigte sie des Betrugs) is more likely.  
Explanation: The premise states that the player won five games in a row, which suggests they are performing well and gaining confidence. However, their opponent accuses them of cheating, indicating jealousy or resentment towards their success. It's less likely for an opponent to feel sorry for someone who is doing well without any apparent reason."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Er erwischte den Studenten beim Schummeln) is more likely. The phrase ""Der Lehrer zerriss die Prüfung"" implies that the teacher was surprised or caught off guard by the student's behavior, suggesting that he may have been cheating. This is supported by the fact that the word ""Schummeln"" specifically refers to cheating or dishonest behavior in a test or examination. Therefore, it is more likely that the teacher discovered the student cheating rather than his answers being incorrect."
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ich habe meine Stimme verloren) is more likely to be the correct answer. The phrase ""ich habe eine Pause gemacht"" suggests that the speaker has intentionally stopped speaking, while ""mir wurde die Luft aus"" means ""I ran out of breath."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker lost their voice rather than running out of breath."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I have placed it in the microwave) is a more likely cause for the food to be thawed. Microwaves can heat up and melt frozen food quickly, causing it to become soft or even liquid. On the other hand, covering food with plastic wrap may not provide adequate protection against melting or thawing, especially if the food is exposed to warm temperatures or direct sunlight. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause for the food to be thawed.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Er hatte Bauchkrämpfe) is the correct answer. The phrase ""tat so, als wäre er krank"" suggests that the employee was pretending to be sick, which aligns with the idea of having stomach cramps or other digestive issues. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the employee acted as if he were ill."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She landed in the pool) is more likely than option B (She jumped from the diving board). The premise states that she landed in the pool, indicating that she entered the water after landing, rather than jumping into it from above. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause.
Response:  Option A: It was the opening day of the film.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The people have isolated him) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She has written a letter) is more likely.
"Response:  Option A (The audience cheered in surprise)
Explanation: The premise states that the circus artist juggled while riding a unicycle, which is an impressive feat that would likely elicit gasps of amazement from the audience rather than applause. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich verlor meine Geduld,"" option A is the most likely cause: ""Mein Freund ließ mich warten."" Losing one's patience suggests that something or someone has caused frustration or annoyance, and it is more likely that a friend did not arrive on time than that they arrived punctually."
"Response: 
Option A: They developed atomic weapons.
Explanation: The premise suggests that the wars states wanted to end the war, but option A provides a more realistic explanation for how they might achieve this goal. Developing atomic weapons would give them an advantage in any future conflict and increase their chances of winning quickly and decisively, thus ending the war sooner. Option B, while possible, seems less likely given the context provided."
Response:  Option A: He became sleepy.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Das Bein des Sofas ist losgegangen) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman might have stumbled against the sofa than option B (Sie hat sich das Knie verletzt). This is because it is unlikely that the woman would injure her knee by simply bumping into the sofa with her leg. However, if the sofa's leg or base were loose or damaged, it could cause the woman to lose her balance and stumble. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Junge drückt den Ballon,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Der Ballon ist geplatzt,"" will occur. This is because when a child pushes a balloon, it is likely to burst or deflate rather than fly away."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (They are at the airport) is more likely. The fact that they have packed their bags suggests that they are preparing to leave for a trip or journey, which would be consistent with them being at an airport.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the saft ( Option B) has come out rather than the pfirsich being injured( option A). This is because biting into a peach would not cause any harm to the fruit itself but could result in juice or sap coming out.
"Response:  Option B: I had a sugar high.
Explanation: The premise ""Meine Hände wurden klebrig"" (My hands became sticky) suggests that there has been an excessive amount of sugar consumed, leading to a sugar high. This is more likely than option A, as eating a donut alone may not result in sticky hands."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the door opened) occurred. The sentence ""Ich habe die Tür geschoben"" implies that someone pushed or closed the door, which would cause it to open rather than close. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the products were made through child labor) is more likely. The text states that ""aktivisten"" (activists) are boycotting the products, indicating that there is a social or ethical issue with their production. Child labor is a common ethical concern in many industries, particularly in developing countries where labor laws may be lax or poorly enforced. Therefore, it is more likely that the activists are protesting against the use of child labor in the production of these products rather than any quality issues."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich bohrte ein Loch in die Wand,"" it is more likely that a mouse will come out of the hole than for dust to blow out of it. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (her sister was happy) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ich habe eine Schürze angezogen) is the correct answer. The reason for this is that if you have spilled wine on your shirt, it is more likely that you would change into a different shirt rather than putting on a schurra (a type of apron or bib). Therefore, option A is the more logical choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Kunde durchsuchte seine Brieftasche) is more likely because it implies that the customer was looking for something in their briefcase before they gave the money to the cashier.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He sent the crowd away) is more likely. The premise states that the street musician ""moved a lot of people,"" implying that he was able to attract a large audience. However, it also states that he ""sent the crowd away,"" suggesting that he may have had some level of control over their actions. It is unlikely that the crowd would simply give him money without any prompting or action from the musician himself. Therefore, option B is the most likely outcome."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The pilot flew through the storm) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Die Blätter wurden farbig) is more likely. The premise states that the tree loses its leaves, implying a change in their color or appearance rather than collecting them on the ground.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He has decided to play a trick on his sister) is more likely. The fact that he is described as being ""in a mischievous mood"" suggests that he may be inclined to engage in pranks or tricks, rather than simply playing a game of cards with his sister."
"Response:  Option B (His father held the car at a gas station).
Explanation: The premise states that the child complained about needing to go to the bathroom, indicating that it was not a convenient or comfortable situation for them. Option B suggests that the father stopped his car at a gas station, which would provide a relatively private and accessible location for the child to use the restroom. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A, where the father gave the child a drink of limonade, which does not address the child's immediate need for a restroom."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Der Fisch sprang aus dem Tank) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: She participated in a protest.
Explanation: The passage states that the woman's political views changed after she became involved in a protest, indicating that her participation in the protest had an impact on her beliefs. Therefore, option B is the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that you have used Option B: ""Ich habe Abfluhröhre hineingegossen."" (I have flushed something down the drain.) This is because the water in the sink may be blocked due to an object or debris being flushed down the drain rather than just the water flow from the faucet."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Passagiere stiegen aus dem Zug,"" option A (Der Zug kam am Bahnhof an) is the more likely cause. The passengers got off the train at the station, indicating that the train arrived at its destination. Option B (Der Zug pfiff) does not provide any information about the train's arrival or departure point."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Er hat einen Stempel auf den Umschlag gelegt) is correct. The man pressing the wet flap of the envelope would likely leave a stamp impression rather than simply closing the envelope.

Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she was fired from her position as bookkeeper due to mismanagement of company funds (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich schaute auf die Uhr"", option A is more likely. The act of looking at a clock implies that one wants to see the time, rather than hear it ticking. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: My wife and I held hands.
Explanation: The premise ""Meine Hand ist verkrampft"" (My hand is cramped) suggests that something happened to the speaker's hand, causing it to become cramped. Option B provides a plausible explanation for this situation by stating that the speaker's wife and he held hands, which could potentially lead to cramping in one or both of their hands. In contrast, option A does not provide any logical connection between writing an essay and cramping one's hand. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ich habe den Schraubenschraubersatz ersetzt) is the correct answer. The sentence ""Der Schraubenschraubenschraubenschraubenschraubenschraub"" suggests that something has been replaced or swapped out, which aligns with option A. Option B (Ich habe den Schraubenschlüssel gedreht) does not provide any context for why a replacement would be necessary."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - The couple signed a lease for an apartment.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She wanted to see the sunset) is more likely. The fact that she was sitting outside suggests that she was enjoying the outdoors and wanting to take in the natural beauty of the sunset. It's less likely that she would be thinking about a blizzard or a storm while watching the sunset.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Er could not swim) is more likely. The man wore a swimsuit in water, indicating that he was unable to swim.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that she made a spelling mistake (Option A). The backspace key is typically used to delete characters or words in a document, so if she had accidentally pressed it, she would have deleted part of the text rather than making a spelling mistake.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She has a bad grade) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Rasen war schlammig,"" option A is the more likely cause - it has rained overnight."
Response:  Based on the information provided, Option A (She overnighted in a hotel) is more likely as it provides a plausible explanation for why she overslept. It is unlikely that she forgot to set her alarm clock as there is no indication of any other factors that could have caused her to oversleep.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Er saß im Schatten) is more likely. The man has applied sunscreen to protect himself from the sun's rays while sitting in the shade, indicating that he is aware of the risk of sunburn and takes measures to prevent it. This suggests that he may have gone to a location with direct sunlight, rather than going to the beach.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Die Forscher widerrieten die Theorie) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The game went into overtime) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Ich schloss das Schloss) is correct. The phrase ""ich habe meine Kombination eingieben"" implies that the speaker has entered their combination correctly, which would allow them to unlock the door using the keycard. Therefore, option A is the most likely choice."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Menge wurde noch stärker,"" it is more likely that Option A (Der Vater reichte seinem Sohn etwas Geld) is correct. This is because the phrase ""die Menge wurde noch stärger"" suggests an increase or intensification of something, which aligns with the idea of giving money to someone as a way of showing strength or support. In contrast, Option B (Der Vater ergriff die Hand seines Sohnes) does not necessarily convey this same sense of intensity or increase in connection."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (I schaufelt den Schnee aus dem Weg) is more likely. The premise states that the snow blocked the approach, indicating that there was a significant amount of snow to be cleared in order for traffic to resume. Schaufeln (shoveling) is a common method used to clear snow from pathways or roads, making it the most plausible action taken by the speaker. Option A (I have formed the snow into a snowball) is less likely as it would not address the issue of blocking the approach.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The kayakers paddled with their oars) is more likely. The premise does not provide any information about waves or water conditions that could cause a kayak to capsize or be affected by waves. Therefore, it is more likely that the kayakers successfully reached the shore using their oars.
"Response:  Option B: She is against a wall.
Explanation: The phrase ""lost control over her bicycle"" implies that she was riding it when something unexpected happened, causing her to lose control. Since she crashed into a wall, option B is the most likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B is more likely. The premise mentions ""kühle Luft"" (cool air), indicating that the fan has been turned on, which would result in a cooling sensation. Water being sprinkled on one's skin is not directly related to the fan being turned on. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They were drenched) is more likely. The phrase ""kehrte zum Strand zurück"" implies that they returned to the beach after being out in the ocean, which suggests that they got wet while surfing or swimming. There is no mention of a shark sighting, so Option B (They saw a hai) is less likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The water is out of the tank) is more likely. The premise states that the drain has been turned off, which means that the water in the bathtub will not be able to flow out naturally. Therefore, it is more likely that the water will stay inside the bathtub rather than falling onto the floor.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He confessed his infidelity) is more likely.  
Explanation: The man's guilt over cheating on his wife suggests that he may want to make amends by being honest with her. Confessing his infidelity would allow him to take responsibility for his actions and potentially repair their relationship. Option A (Accusing her of unfaithfulness) does not align with this motivation as it would only serve to further damage their marriage."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (I waited until the ink was dry) is a more plausible explanation for why the tint on the poster is smudged than option B (I poured water onto the poster). This is because waiting for the ink to dry would allow the ink to set properly before handling or exposure to moisture, whereas pouring water onto the poster would likely cause the ink to run or blur immediately.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had a nightmare) is the correct answer. The fact that the child woke up screaming suggests that he may have been experiencing some kind of distress or discomfort during his sleep, which could be interpreted as an alarming dream or nightmare.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (sein Vater setze sich an den Tisch) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (I rief his name) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that ""Mein Freund drehte seinen Kopf in meine Richtung,"" which means ""My friend turned his head towards me."" Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker called out their friend's name rather than waving with their arms."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The citizens made an uprising) is more likely to occur as it suggests a more active and direct form of resistance against the government's oppression.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He cried for help) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (She wanted to learn how to paint) is a more likely cause for her traveling abroad than Option B (She wanted to get to know other cultures). The phrase ""ins Ausland"" suggests that she traveled to another country specifically for this purpose, implying that she had a specific goal or interest in mind. While learning about different cultures can certainly be an enriching experience, it's unlikely that someone would travel across the world solely for that reason without any particular objective in mind. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible explanation for why she traveled abroad."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (sein Kollege wurde befördert) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the man's jealousy - his colleague was promoted over him. This option aligns with the information provided in the premise, whereas Option B (sein Kollege worked bis spät) does not provide any specific reason for the man's jealousy.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (he had hallucinations) is the correct answer. The man's claim of having seen aliens suggests that he may have experienced some kind of psychological or neurological event, such as a hallucination, rather than actually encountering extraterrestrial life.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (he has used bleach) than option B (he has used shampoo). This is because using bleach can lighten or remove pigment from hair, resulting in a change of color to blonde. Using shampoo alone may not have this effect.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She felt an attack of inspiration) is more likely. The artist created new works, indicating a surge in creativity rather than criticism of previous work.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he was discharged from the military) is the correct answer. 
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (An earthquake shook the bookshelf) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option B (I have turned off the power switch) caused the lights to go out than option A (I have lit a light). This is because turning off the power switch would directly cause the loss of electricity to the house, whereas lighting a light would not necessarily affect the overall electrical supply.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wir fuhren mit der Achterbahn,"" option A (Es sah beängstigend aus) is more likely. The phrase ""fuhren mit der Achterbahn"" implies a sense of danger or fear, which aligns with Option A's description of looking beängstigend (intimidating)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I have butter in the pocket) is more likely to be the cause of the popcorn bag bursting. The presence of butter in the pocket could cause the bag to become too hot and prone to bursting.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (The weather forecast predicted strong winds) is more likely to be the cause of the power outage. The falling tree may have caused a branch or a limb to break and hit the electrical wires, leading to a short circuit and a loss of power.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He offended the audience) is more likely. The speaker's inappropriate comments are likely to have caused offense or discomfort among the audience members, rather than simply boring them.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (a drop of blood formed on my finger) is more likely to occur than Option A (a sweat bead fell from my face). This is because a small injury like a prick with a needle can cause bleeding, but it's less likely to produce sweat.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Fisch schwebt auf der Oberfläche des Tanks,"" option A (Es war hungrig) is the most likely cause. The fact that the fish is floating on the surface of the tank suggests that it may be seeking food or oxygen, rather than being dead."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Er had a cold) than Option B (He stopped smoking). The mention of a ""heiser"" voice suggests that there may be some obstruction or irritation to the throat or vocal cords, which could be caused by a cold or other respiratory illness rather than quitting smoking."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Der Aufzug steckt zwischen den Etagen fest) is a more plausible explanation for why the doors of the elevator opened at floor level rather than reaching their intended destination. This is because if the elevator got stuck between floors, it would not be able to reach its intended destination, hence the doors opening at floor level.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He has lied to his parents) is more likely. The fact that he ""schlug"" himself out of the house suggests that he may have been trying to avoid something or someone, possibly his parents' punishment for misbehaving. It is less likely that his parents would give him a house arrest without any explanation as to why."
Response:  Based on the given information, Option A (The toilet is overflushed) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the bathroom would be flooded. The other option, Option B (The warm water heater is broken), does not provide an obvious reason for the flooding in the bathroom.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Besitzer hat dem Welpen ein Halsband angelegt) is more likely. The premise states that the wolf cub remained with its owner, indicating that it was not just a brief encounter but rather a longer-term relationship where the owner had taken steps to keep the cub close. This suggests that the owner had put a collar or other identification device on the cub to help keep track of it and ensure its safety.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He stood under the extensive tree) is more likely. The premise states that he has captured his mirror image, implying a reflection in water or another reflective surface. Standing under an extended tree would provide such a surface for him to see himself reflected, whereas standing over a calm sea would not. Therefore, option A is the more plausible answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ich rief sie zurück) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Your dog has run away from home) is more likely to be the cause of the search through the neighborhood. This is because the loss or absence of a pet is a common reason for searching the surrounding area, especially if it's not uncommon for the dog to escape or wander off. On the other hand, Option B (Expensive jewelry was missing from your house) may indicate a more targeted and intentional act of theft or burglary, rather than a random event like a lost dog.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich saw my breath when I exhaled,"" option A (The weather was cool) is the more likely cause. The premise suggests that there was a visible sign of cold air, such as breathing out in misty form, which would be consistent with cooler temperatures. Option B (""My chest felt tense"") does not provide any information about the temperature or visibility of breath, making it less likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They wanted better working conditions) is more likely. The passage states that the employees founded a union to address their grievances, specifically mentioning ""better working conditions."" This suggests that they were dissatisfied with their current work environment and sought to improve it through collective action. While Option B mentions an increase in salaries, this is not explicitly stated as the motivation for forming the union."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (a warm duet) is more likely. The phrase ""Ich habe einen Apfelkuchen gebacken"" implies that something sweet and baked was produced in the kitchen, which would not produce a foul or unpleasant smell but rather a pleasant and inviting one."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (She removed her shoes) is more likely to be the correct answer. The premise states that the woman fought to go somewhere, which suggests that she may have been experiencing discomfort or difficulty while walking in her high heels. It is therefore more plausible that she would remove her shoes rather than continue wearing them.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Dampf stieg aus dem Wassertopf,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Das Wasser kochte,"" is the correct answer. The phrase ""Dampf stieg aus dem Wassertopf"" implies that steam was rising from a pot of water, which suggests that the water inside the pot was hot enough to produce steam. Therefore, option A is the most likely explanation for why steam was rising from the pot."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Alle meine Socken waren in der Wäscherei,"" it is more likely that Option A (Ich trug Sandalen) is correct because sandals are less likely to be washed than stiffels."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he lost the support of voters) is more likely. The argument of the politician was seen as absurd by many people, indicating that he may have lost their trust or support. This could lead to a decrease in his popularity and ultimately result in him losing future elections or facing other consequences.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The couple has run away) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Millionär wollte, dass das Building abgerissen wurde) is more likely. The sentence ""Das Gebäude war dem Millionär gewidmet"" implies that the building was dedicated to the millionaire, which could mean that he had a personal connection to it or that he wanted to preserve it for some reason. On the other hand, Option B (""Der Millionär hat die Mittel zum Bau beigesteuert"") does not provide any explicit indication of why the millionaire would want the building to be preserved. Therefore, Option A is more likely."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The passage states that the salesperson accused the girl of shoplifting, indicating that they saw her taking items without paying for them. This suggests that the salesperson witnessed the girl putting items into her handbag, which aligns with Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Soldaten wurden zum Kampfgeschickt) is more likely. The sentence implies that the country declared war on its neighboring region, indicating a military conflict. It does not suggest that soldiers were reunited with their families during this time.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Before the court building broke out an uproar) is more likely. The use of the word ""bestätigt"" (confirmed) in the premise suggests that the verdict has been upheld, leading to a negative reaction from those involved or affected by it. An uproar or protest is therefore more likely to occur before the courthouse than a couple expressing their love there."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She took the cookies from the glass) is more likely. The premise mentions that she ""had something burning"" which suggests that she may have accidentally knocked over a candle or other flammable object while reaching for the cookies, causing them to catch fire. It's less likely that she would simply leave the cookies in the oven unattended without realizing they were on fire."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Es regnete wie aus Eimern,"" option A (Der Sturm wurde schlimmer) is more likely. The phrase ""regnet wie aus Eimern"" suggests a heavy downpour of rain, which could make the storm worse. Option B (""Ich stürzte mich in den Raum"") does not fit with this premise as it implies a sudden movement into a room without any connection to the weather."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (the fire alarm went off) is more likely to be the cause of the building being evacuated.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Der Vater warf seinen Sohn aus dem Haus) is more likely. The father's anger towards his son's alcoholism may lead him to take drastic measures such as expelling him from the house. Option A (Der Vater kaufte seinem Sohn ein Bier) does not align with the father's angry reaction to his son's addiction.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Der Aufzug war defekt) is more likely as it provides a plausible reason for why the lawyer went upstairs instead of simply stating that she went home early without providing any explanation.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (sein Freund unterbrach ihn) is more likely. The man was annoyed by his friend, indicating that their interaction was disruptive or frustrating for the man. Therefore, it is more likely that the friend interrupted him rather than inviting him to lunch.

Response:  Based on the information provided, Option A (She was placed in a wheelchair after an accident) is the more likely cause for her to be in a wheelchair.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (The country was facing economic difficulties) is a more likely explanation for why the citizens hung their national flag outside their homes. Economic hardship can lead to feelings of patriotism and pride in one's nation, causing people to display symbols of their country's identity, such as the national flag. In contrast, celebrating independence may not necessarily result in increased displays of national symbolism.
Response:  Based on the premise, it is more likely that they disappointed their fans (Option A).
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I felt embarrassed) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He has forgotten to learn) is more likely. The premise states that the young man failed his history exam, indicating a lack of knowledge or understanding of the subject matter, rather than simply being disruptive in class. Therefore, it is more likely that he forgot to study or learned poorly, rather than simply being distracted during class.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (An earthquake struck the city) is more likely to be the cause of the building's collapse than Option B (The crime rate in the city increased). Earthquakes are known to cause buildings to collapse due to their powerful seismic forces, while an increase in crime rate may not directly lead to a building collapse. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Er flehte sie an, ihn zurückzunehmen) is more likely. The fact that she has broken up with him suggests that there may be some hope for their relationship, and his pleading with her to take him back could indicate a desire to salvage what they had.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Ihre Köpfe kollidierten) is more likely to occur because both children are reaching for the ball at the same time, increasing the chances of their heads colliding.
"Response:  Option A: In the trash can was a cardboard box. 
Explanation: The premise states that the bear searched through the garbage can, indicating that it was looking for something inside the can. Given this context, it is more likely that there was a cardboard box (Karton in German) inside the trash can rather than the lid being detached from the trash can."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It was cheap) is more likely to be the cause of why the boy sharpened his pencil.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She has lost her receipt) is more likely. The reason being that if she had lost her receipt, it would be difficult for her to prove that she purchased the item and therefore, the store may not be able to provide a return or refund.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Kratzer in meiner Haut war tief,"" it is more likely that Option B: It has left a scar behind. The phrase ""tief"" implies a deep wound or injury, which would likely result in scarring."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (he stared at the floor) is the correct answer. The passage states that he received strange looks from passangers in the train, implying that his behavior was noticeable and unusual. Staring at the floor would be a relatively subtle action compared to talking to oneself, which might attract more attention. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the man received strange looks from other passengers.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ameisen kroch bis zu den Krümeln) is more likely. The fact that the child left crumbs on the ground suggests that they were careless or distracted, making it more likely for ants to find them.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Die Schwester der Frau began to weep) is more likely. The fact that the woman offered her sister a handkerchief suggests that she saw something in her sister's expression that prompted her to offer comfort, which is consistent with the idea of the sister crying.
"Response:  Option A: His lips were torn. 
Explanation: The premise states that the man took a coin, which implies physical contact with his mouth. Therefore, option A, ""His lips were torn,"" is the most likely cause of the situation described in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They have anticipated the traffic around the theatre) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Frau blieb von der Arbeit weg,"" it is more likely that Option A (her boss praised her) is correct. The phrase ""bleib"" in German means ""remained"" or ""stayed away from work,"" implying that she was absent from work without permission or approval. Therefore, it is unlikely that her colleague covered for her absence, as there would be no need to do so if she had already been praised by her boss."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He supported their cause) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Er had stage fright) is more likely. The phrase ""Das Herz des Schauspielers flatterte vor seiner Aufführung"" suggests that the actor was nervous or anxious about performing, which is a common symptom of stage fright. It does not suggest that he has memorized his lines, which would be less likely to cause him anxiety."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ich habe eine Karte ausgebreitet) is more likely to be the correct effect. The phrase ""Ich habe eine Karte ausgebreitet"" suggests that the performer has laid out a card or cards in front of them, which could potentially be used for divination or fortune-telling. In contrast, ""Ich habe mein Geld gezählt"" does not have any obvious connection to the theme of being lost or finding one's way. Therefore, Option B is the more likely choice based on the information provided in the premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Es wurde gefressen) is more likely. The fruit was left in the sun to ripen, but it did not rot or wither away. Instead, something ate it.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Auto ist kaputt,"" Option A is more likely. The statement implies that the car has broken down completely, suggesting that the ignition system may have failed or been damaged. Overheating of the engine is less likely to result in a complete breakdown of the vehicle."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he remained in bed for several days (Option B). This is because a psychiatrist visit would typically be associated with a shorter absence from work or daily activities due to a mental health issue rather than a physical injury.
"Response: 
Option B: It was cold in the house.
Explanation: The fact that it was cold in the house suggests that the person may have started a fire to keep warm. This is a common reason for starting a fire in a chimney, especially during colder months. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided, Option A (She had a cramp in her side) is more likely. The phrase ""she stopped running"" suggests that she was engaged in physical activity at some point before stopping, and a cramp in her side is a common occurrence during exercise. Therefore, it is more plausible that she experienced a muscle cramp rather than receiving another breath."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (My neighbor invited me in) is more likely.
Response:  Option B: Ihr Mann gab ihr einen Abschiedkuss.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Der Student beantwortete die Frage richtig) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that she went to the farm (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option A (Ich habe ihm ein Geheimnis verraten) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Ich traf einen alten Freund"" suggests a casual encounter with someone from one's past, while the addition of ""ich habe ihm ein Geheimnis verraten"" implies that something significant or secretive was shared between the two friends. This information provides more context for why the friend might have been surprised by the revelation than Option B (""Ich habe ihn umarmt""), which simply states that they were happy to see each other without providing any additional detail."
"Response:  Option A (She has a fish).
Explanation: The premise states that the woman avoided going into the sea, implying that she did not want to swim or engage in any water-related activities. Therefore, option A is more likely, as it suggests that she caught a fish while still avoiding the sea."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (sein Regenschirm war zerbrochen) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the student came late to class. The other option, Option B (seIN Fahrrad wurde gestohlen), does not provide any obvious reason for why the student would be late.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the user clicked with the mouse) is more likely the cause of the cursor moving on the computer screen. Therefore, the answer is Option A.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Auf der Hauptstraße ereignete sich ein Unfall) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (the line has dried) than Option B (the towel is stained). The fact that the washing has been hung out to dry suggests that it has had time to air dry, making it less likely for the towel to be stained during this process. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option A: Das Sonnenlicht war hell. 
Explanation: The woman putting on her glasses suggests that she may need to see something clearly, such as bright sunlight. Therefore, option A is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann starrte den Nachthimmel an,"" option A (Er wünschte, es wäre Sommer) is the more likely cause. The man's gaze towards the night sky suggests that he is contemplating something, and wishing for summer implies a desire to escape the cold weather."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich fühlte micherschöpft,"" option B is more likely. The word ""erschöpft"" suggests that the speaker was exhausted or drained, which aligns with being awake all night rather than going to bed early."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann ging zum Friseur,"" option A (Er hat sich die Haare wachsen lassen) is the more likely cause. The man went to the barber, indicating that he wanted to get his hair cut or styled, rather than letting them grow longer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Der Junge mochte den neuen Klassenkameraden nicht) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich had Lust auf ein Glas Milch"" (I wanted to drink a glass of milk), option A is more likely. The phrase ""ich aß Kekse"" (I ate cookies) does not fit the context of wanting to drink milk. Option B ""Ich habe Brot gebacken"" (I baked bread) also does not fit the context as it does not relate to drinking milk."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Es began to rain,"" option A is more likely because turning on the headlights would be a logical response to the rain."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Ich habe in der Nähe des Eingangs geparkt) is more likely. The parked car was near the entrance of the building, indicating that the speaker had just arrived at or was approaching the building.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (the author had a writer's block) is the correct answer. The fact that the author missed the deadline suggests that she may have been experiencing difficulty in writing or a creative block, rather than simply editing her work.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ich wanted to speak with a supervisor) is more likely the cause of why the partner has been placed on leave. This suggests that there may be an issue or conflict that needs to be addressed by a higher authority figure within the organization.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Wind blies durch das offene Fenster,"" option B (Die Vorhänge zitterten) is more likely. The wind blowing through an open window would cause the curtains to tremble or sway, rather than the doorbell ringing."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (I have blown a fuse) is more likely than Option A (I have unplugged the lamp). This is because a blown fuse would prevent electricity from flowing to the entire house, rather than just one light fixture.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Gewichtheber knurrte"", option A (Er beugte seine Muskeln vor dem Spiegel) is more likely as it aligns with the context of a weightlifter flexing their muscles in front of a mirror."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He is confused) is more likely. The student may have tried to do mental math in his head but was unable to keep track of the calculations, resulting in confusion.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Vater switched the baby's diaper) is more likely to be the cause of the baby's sleeping. This is because a dirty or uncomfortable diaper can make a baby irritable and difficult to console, leading them to fall asleep unexpectedly.
"Response:  Option B: Der Junge ist durchnässt.  
Explanation: The premise states that the girl threw a water balloon at the boy, indicating that there was contact between the two. As a result, it is more likely that the boy will be wet rather than have a head injury."

Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ich war einsam) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe trainiert,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ich fühlte mich energisch,"" is the correct answer. The phrase ""haben trainiert"" implies physical exertion or effort, which could lead to feelings of energy or fatigue. Option B, ""Had fear,"" does not align with the given premise and seems unlikely."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that water has been absorbed by the sponge (Option A). The statement ""I pressed the wet sponge"" implies that the sponge was already wet, so it would not be able to release water onto a surface. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option B: Das Resort war auf einer Insel.  
Explanation: The fact that the resort was ""auf einer Insel"" (on an island) suggests that it was located in a remote or isolated area, which makes it less likely for the tourists to find alternative accommodations nearby. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."
"Response: 
Option B: She wanted to rebel."
"Response: 
Option B: I have called the police.
Explanation: The premise states that an unknown car has been parked in front of the speaker's house, which could be a potential threat or danger to their safety. Therefore, it is more likely that the speaker will call the police rather than becoming suspicious (Option A)."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (The evidence has him cornered) is more likely. The fact that the criminal has surrendered suggests that he has been caught off guard by the evidence and can no longer deny his guilt.
Response:  Option B: He started exercising regularly.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Mädchen trat aufs Eis,"" option A (She is skated off) is more likely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Frau hatte Ringe unter den Augen,"" option A is more likely. The fact that she was awake all night suggests that she may have been experiencing some discomfort or difficulty sleeping, which could be related to the rings under her eyes. It's less likely that she would bring her son into bed if she were feeling unwell or tired."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Der Vulkan brach aus) is more likely. The phrase ""vom Vulkan"" suggests that something came from the volcano, implying an eruption or outburst of some kind. This is a more plausible explanation for the presence of lava floss than the idea that the volcano was simply sleeping."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Frau zog ihre Schuhe an,"" option A is more likely. The fact that she put on her shoes suggests that she was preparing to leave or had already decided to leave the party, rather than knowing everyone there."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (She has let me through the toll booth) is correct. The wording of the premise suggests that the speaker has already paid for their toll, implying that they have passed through the toll booth successfully. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible interpretation than Option B (She held me at the toll booth).
"Response:  Option A: He sold his shares.
Explanation: According to the premise, the CEO went broke. This implies that he no longer owned any assets or had any money left. Selling one's stock would be a way for him to raise cash quickly but may not necessarily result in long-term financial security. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the CEO went bankrupt."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann ging zum Arzt,"" option A is more likely. The man went to the doctor, indicating that he was seeking medical attention, which suggests that he felt unwell or sick. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for why the man went to the doctor."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich verließ mein Schlafzimmer durch das Fenster,"" option A is more likely. The house standing in flames suggests a catastrophic event such as a fire, which could have caused the protagonist to escape through the window. Option B, the house being empty, does not provide any information that would suggest why the protagonist left their bedroom through the window."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He has long been doing push-ups) is more likely as a cause for his fingers to become narrow. This is because push-ups involve bending one's hands inward, which can lead to finger shortening over time. In contrast, washing one's hands with soap may not have any significant effect on finger width.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I have spat out the milk,"" it is more likely that option A (the milk tasted sour) is the correct answer. This is because spitting out food often occurs when it has an unpleasant taste or smell, such as being too sour or bitter."

Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option B (The car is trashed) will occur. The collision between a large truck and a small car will most likely result in significant damage to the smaller vehicle.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They have won) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Soda-Flasche zischte,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Ich habe die Flasche umgedreht,"" is the correct answer. The sound of the soda bottle hissing suggests that there has been a change in pressure inside the bottle, which could be caused by turning the bottle upside down or shaking it vigorously. Turning the bottle around is a more plausible explanation than removing the cap, as this would not create the same level of pressure change within the bottle."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Er ist durch ein offenes Fenster eingeschlichen) is more likely. The fact that the boy was excluded from his house suggests that he did not have permission to enter through a window or on the roof. Therefore, option A is the most plausible answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Tür klingelte,"" option A (Der Besucher klopfte an die Tür) is more likely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he has put his suit in the cleaning (Option A). The reason being, a person would typically keep their suits in a safe place such as a wardrobe or a storage room to avoid damaging them, rather than putting them in the laundry where they could get stained or damaged further. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
Response:  Option A: The Zahnpasta spritzed out of the tube.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Pazifisten organisierten einen Protest) is more likely to be the correct answer because it aligns with the tone of the passage, which emphasizes the growing number of civilian casualties and the need for action. The passage does not mention any parades held by pacifists, suggesting that this option is less relevant to the context.
"Response:  Option B: Das Band sah kindisch aus.
Explanation: The sentence ""Das Mädchen zog sich das Band aus den Haaren"" implies that the girl pulled out a band from her hair. This is unlikely to happen as adults or even older children would not pull bands out of their hair. Therefore, option B is the most likely answer."
Response:  Option B: He looked younger.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""aus dem Ei entstand ein Kükenbaby,"" option A (the egg has hatched) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Gefangene verhungerte,"" it is more likely that he is dead (Option A)."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ein kalter Zug kam durch das Fenster herein,"" option B (I zitterte) is more likely. The use of the word ""kalt"" suggests a sudden and intense coldness, which could cause shivering or trembling."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ihre Klassenkameraden respekteten Sie) is more likely. The premise mentions that the student received a stipend to attend college, which suggests that they were talented or accomplished something notable. It does not mention anything about their classmates respecting them, which could be an unrelated factor. Therefore, Option A is more likely.
Response:  Based on the information provided, option A (She lived next to him) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why she would be making fun of him. Option B (She was obsessed with him) does not provide any specific reason or context for why she would be making fun of him.
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (he had pity) is more likely. The phrase ""Der hungrige Landstreicher"" suggests that he was a homeless person who was struggling to survive, and therefore it is more likely that he stole food out of compassion rather than lacking money."
"Response: 
Option B: I felt lonely."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (I shook his hand) occurred. The premise does not provide any indication of a violent or aggressive act such as option B (I gave him an earful). Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe mich verkrampft,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""verkrampft"" means to get a cramp or spasm, usually in one's muscles. Therefore, it is unlikely that a frisbee would have shot itself onto someone's head without any explanation for why they got a cramp."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Mädchen biss sie themselves the nails,"" option A (she was concerned) is a more likely cause than option B (she was surprised). This is because biting one's own nails can be a sign of anxiety or stress, rather than surprise."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Ich habe den Termin im Kalender markiert) is the correct answer. The passage states that the speaker has turned to a new page in their calendar, indicating that they have marked a term or appointment for that day. This suggests that the speaker is planning ahead and scheduling events in their calendar, rather than simply starting a new month.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (He has fired his lawyer) will occur as a result of discovering that one's spouse had an affair. This choice reflects the character's immediate reaction to such news, which would be anger and frustration leading them to take drastic measures like firing their lawyer who may have been handling their divorce proceedings. In contrast, Option B (He has filed for divorce) might not necessarily follow immediately after learning about the infidelity; there could be other factors at play before making such a significant decision."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (Der Ball hat gesprung) is more likely to occur than Option B (Der Ball leuchtete). This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the ball was dropped, which implies a physical interaction with the ground, rather than an optical phenomenon like lighting up. Therefore, it is more plausible that the ball would bounce or spring away from its original position after being dropped, rather than emitting light without any apparent cause.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (She has deleted her answer) is more likely. The fact that she made a mistake in the exam suggests that she may have been anxious or under pressure, leading to an error in her response. Deleting her answer rather than simply making a mistake would be a more plausible explanation for this scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (sein Gegner erwischte den Pass) is more likely. The player has already tackled their opponent, indicating that they have gained control over them. It is less likely that their opponent would be able to catch a pass after being tackled, as they may be unable to react quickly enough or may be in an awkward position due to the tackle. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome based on the given premise.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe die Tomaten aus der Rebe gepflückt,"" option A is more likely. The tomatoes were ripe and ready to be picked from the vine."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He has his ex-girlfriend over for lunch) is more likely. This is because the man wants to be romantic, but inviting an ex-partner over for a meal may not necessarily be seen as romantic by them or others. Buying chocolate for someone could potentially be seen as a romantic gesture, depending on the context and relationship.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (I have dropped the thermometer) caused the mercury to rise. This is because dropping the thermometer could potentially cause the mercury to break or leak out of its container, leading to an increase in temperature readings. In contrast, option B (the weather became warmer) does not provide a direct explanation for why the mercury in the thermometer rose.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""A tornado came through the city,"" option A is the most likely answer. The roof of a building may be blown off by strong winds from a tornado, but ice on an autobahn would not occur due to a tornado."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that his grades have improved (Option A).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich fühlte mich wohl,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""ich knete auf den Boden"" means ""I kneeled on the ground,"" which suggests a physical action that could be related to feeling well or comfortable. Option B, ""Ich wickelte mich in eine Decke,"" means ""I wrapped myself in a blanket,"" which does not necessarily relate to how one feels physically or emotionally. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct answer based on the given premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe den Stein poliert,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Es wurde rutschig,"" occurred. This is because polishing a stone typically makes it smoother and less slippery, rather than glancing or shiny."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""I have sugar in my coffee,"" it is more likely that option A will occur - the coffee will taste strong. This is because adding sugar to coffee typically makes it taste sweeter, not stronger. Therefore, option B (the coffee tasting sweet) is less likely to happen based on this premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that he has torn the papers rather than cut them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (the nagel is in the wood) is correct. The phrase ""I have hit the nail with the hammer"" implies that the action of hitting the nail has caused it to penetrate into the wood, rather than the nail becoming rusted or damaged. Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Fisch hat die Leinegebissen,"" it is more likely that Option A (Der Fischer zog den Fisch rein) occurred. The phrase ""hat die Leinegebissen"" implies that the fish has bitten the line, indicating that it has been caught by the fisherman. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the fisherman pulled in the fish rather than throwing a new line."
Response:  Option A: She had a pickle.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mein Gesichtsausdruck erleuchtete,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""erleuchtete"" suggests a sudden or unexpected realization, which could be caused by good news rather than losing patience."

Explanation: The premise states that the speaker wiped their hands with a wet towel, indicating that their hands were already wet before they used the towel. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Option A: Der Stuhl wackelte unter ihm.  
Explanation: The man lost his balance on the stool because the stool was moving under him due to an external force such as a draft or uneven floor surface. This is a more plausible explanation than option B, as it does not require any additional assumptions or actions by the man."

"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich bat um Vergebung"" (I apologize), option A is more likely."
"Response: 
Option B: Er sprach unaufhörlich über sich selbst."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Ihre Wangen wurden rot) is more likely to occur as a result of the girl smiling. The sentence suggests that her face became red due to blushing, which is a common physical response to happiness or embarrassment. Option B (Ihre Grübchen waren sichtbar) does not provide any information about the girl's facial expression or emotional state, making it less likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It is over the mine) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (he ran into a puddle) is more likely than option B (he stepped on glass). Therefore, the answer is A.

This implies that they may have found evidence linking a specific individual to the crime, making it more likely that they have identified the killer.
"Response:  Option B: I asked for a ride share.
Explanation: The premise states that there was much traffic on the autobahn, indicating congestion and delays. Asking for a ride share would be a common solution to avoid being stuck in traffic, making option B more likely than option A."
"Response:  Option B: Many people were unemployed.
Explanation: The premise states that the economy of the country went backward, indicating a decline in economic activity. Unemployment is a common consequence of an economic downturn, making option B the more likely answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They wanted to cross the border) is more likely. The text states that the children were ""angepfiffen"" or ""had started,"" indicating a deliberate action. It also mentions that they were trying to get into the traffic flow, suggesting that they intended to cross the border. Therefore, option A is more likely than option B."
Response:  Option B: He made a sarcastic remark.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Auto hatte keinen Sprit mehr,"" it is more likely that Option A (Der Fahrer war auf der Straße gestrandet) is correct. The fact that the car had no fuel left suggests that the driver may have been stranded in a remote location with no access to gasoline."
"Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A: Das Baby wurde geboren (The baby was born). This is because the premise states that ""Die Frau ging in die Wehen"" (The woman went into labor), indicating that a birth is imminent or has already occurred."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He has taken off his hat) is more likely. The fact that it was windy outside does not necessarily mean that the man's hat flew away; he may have simply removed it himself."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She has received an invitation) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Stirn des Jungen war heiß,"" it is more likely that Option B (His mother has taken him to the park) is correct. This is because the heat on his forehead suggests that he may be outside or engaging in physical activity, which would make it more likely for him to be at a park rather than indoors where his mother might measure his temperature."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He has gel in his hair) is more likely. The man's actions are described as ""sprüh[ing] himself with Köln,"" which suggests that he applied a substance to his hair. The use of the word ""Gel"" in German also supports this interpretation, as it can refer to a type of hair gel or styling product. Therefore, option B is the more likely explanation for the man's behavior based on the given premise."
"Response:  Option B: I have taken a shovel.
Explanation: The premise states that there is no electricity in the house, implying that it is dark inside. Taking a shovel suggests that you are preparing to dig your way out of the house or find another means of escape, rather than simply looking for a flashlight."
Response:  Based on the given information, Option B: The mother brought twins into the world is the most likely cause for the family moving to a larger house. This is because having twins can increase the size of a family quickly and unexpectedly, leading to a need for more space. In contrast, Option A: The son has graduated from high school may not necessarily lead to a move to a larger house, as it could depend on various factors such as college plans or other personal circumstances. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause for the family's move.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has seen the finish line) is more likely. The marathon runner maintained a slow pace because she could see the finish line and wanted to conserve her energy for the final stretch of the race.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Die Maschine spuckte das Wechselgeld aus) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I have hugged him) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Er hat einen Schuldschein geschrieben) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Er hat sich die Nägel geschnitten) is the correct answer. The phrase ""Der Mann verflcht"" suggests that something unusual or unexpected has happened to him, and cutting one's nails is a relatively common and harmless action that could potentially result in someone being cursed or afflicted with bad luck. In contrast, getting oneself hit by a car (Option B) would be an unlikely and dramatic event that is less consistent with the context of the sentence."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (sein Bruder hatte einen Streit mit ihren Eltern) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She looked at the stars) is more likely. The girl wanted to learn about the sun system, so looking up at the stars would not provide her with that information. Instead, she would be more likely to go to a library or other educational resource to find books or online content about the solar system.
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (I have placed the poster over the door) is correct. The phrase ""an der Wand"" suggests that the poster is located near a wall or surface, rather than being suspended from above like with Option B's suggestion of using Klebeband to attach it. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation for how the poster came to be stuck to the wall."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Der Architekt hat die Pläne angepasst) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option A (His hand was shaking) is a more plausible explanation for why the man's löffel fell than Option B (He had cleaned his löffel). The fact that the man's hand was shaking suggests that he may have been nervous or clumsy, leading to an accidental drop of the löffel. In contrast, option B does not provide any logical explanation for why the löffel would fall, as there is no indication in the premise that the man had recently used it or needed to clean it. Therefore, Option A is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Der Vorstand löste die Firma auf) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I näherte mich dem Podium) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (He has attacked a fellow inmate) is more likely. This is because the man was released from prison due to his actions while inside, rather than any external factors such as his family paying his bail. It suggests that he may have been involved in some form of conflict or violence with another prisoner, leading to his release through disciplinary action.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (Ihr Haus ist in Flammen aufgegangen) is more likely to be the cause of the family losing their belongings. This is because a house fire can result in significant damage or loss of possessions, whereas selling one's house does not necessarily lead to the loss of personal belongings.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the aluminum can was crushed (Option B). When you step on an aluminum can, it will deform and potentially break, especially if it is not empty. The can may also leave a dent or indentation on the surface where it was stepped on. Recycling the can would require it to be collected and processed separately from other trash, so it is unlikely that it would have been recycled in this scenario.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She learned to use a computer) is more likely.
Response:  Option A: Ich hörte Music.
"Response: 
Option B: They held a charity auction."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the passengers screamed) is more likely. The steep drop of an roller coaster would be a thrilling experience that would cause excitement and fear in the passengers, leading to loud screams rather than just giggling or indifference.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich war wütend,"" option B is more likely. The sentence ""Ich schlug die Tür zu"" means ""I slammed the door shut,"" indicating a strong emotion such as anger. Option A does not convey this same level of intensity. Therefore, option B is the better choice based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He is frustrated) is more likely. The man wants to see the sunrise but he can't because of his location, this makes him feel frustrated.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (The paper was folded) is more likely. The sentence ""Ich hab das Papier gefaltet"" implies that the speaker has folded the paper, rather than having recycled it or having someone else fold it for them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Führer and other countries sent aid) is more likely. The nation has been through a natural disaster, which suggests that it needs external help to recover. It is unlikely that other countries would form an alliance without any prior conflict or reason for cooperation.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He is out of the pool) is more likely. The fact that his clothes are drenched suggests that he has been submerged in water for an extended period of time, which is consistent with him being out of the pool rather than falling into it.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (It should be returned to the library) is more likely. The student's urgency to read the book suggests that it belongs to a library or institution rather than a personal friend.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he was sentenced to death) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Sonnenlicht drang in den Raum"", option A is more likely. The sunlight entering the room suggests that the windows are open or the curtains are drawn aside, allowing natural light to enter. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the light is streaming into the room."
Response:  Option B: She is bald.
"Response: 
Option A: Er found the manuscript overwhelmingly convincing."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She noticed that her card was missing) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for why she would have kicked off her credit card account.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option B (They have married) is more likely. The man and woman in the scenario are already in a romantic relationship, having fallen in love at college, and have since decided to spend the rest of their lives together by getting married.
"Response:  Option B: I have composed my own song.
Explanation: The premise states that the music was too weak to hear, indicating that it may not have been audible enough for others to enjoy. Therefore, option B, ""I have composed my own song,"" is a more plausible explanation as it suggests that the speaker has created their own music rather than relying on someone else's work."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Haar des Jungen ragte hoch,"" option A (Das Mädchen hat es versaut) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""ragte hoch"" suggests that the boy's hair was standing up in an unusual way, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as excitement or nervousness, but it is unlikely to be caused by the girl pulling his hair. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (I have stepped on the beetle) is a more likely explanation for why the beetle was squashed than option A (I have sprayed insect repellent). This is because stepping on an object with one's foot can easily crush or kill it, whereas spraying something with insect repellent may not necessarily harm it directly.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich öffnete meine Augen"", option A is more likely. The act of opening one's eyes suggests that the person has woken up or become aware of their surroundings, making option A the correct answer."
"Response: 
Option B: I asked him to lend me the CD."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He earned under the minimum wage) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Er suchte sich einen Job) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The color is everywhere distributed) is more likely to occur than Option B (The color became green). This is because when you mix yellow and blue paint, you will get a shade of green, but it won't be everywhere distributed; instead, it will form a distinct layer or pattern."
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Mir sind die Gesprunsthemen ausegangen) is a more plausible explanation for why the conversation was changed. It suggests that the speaker simply forgot or lost track of the original topic, rather than assuming that someone else intentionally changed the subject. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I have him again at home) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that Option A (The opening scene of the play began) is correct. The fact that the curtain went up suggests that the play has started, and therefore the actors are now performing on stage.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Entführer drohte, die Geisel zu verletzen) is more likely.
Response:  Option B: Der Musiker schlug auf die Trommel.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (the child woke up screaming from an nightmare) is more likely. The fact that the parents were in the room suggests that something disturbing had happened to the child during sleep, such as a bad dream or nightmare, which could have caused them to wake up crying.
Response:  Based on the information provided, Option A (Sie wurde vorzeitigborn) is the most likely cause for the woman to communicate in sign language. The fact that she was born prematurely does not necessarily imply that she is deaf or hard of hearing, but rather that her brain developed earlier than usual, potentially leading to an advanced cognitive ability.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that the water was contaminated (Option A). The region experienced a drought, which suggests that there may have been an issue with the availability of clean drinking water. Contamination of the water supply would be a more significant problem than lost crops in this scenario.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Katze jagte den Vogel,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Der Vogel ist weggeflogen,"" is correct. The wording of the premise suggests that the cat chased the bird, implying that the bird was able to escape or flee from the cat's pursuit. Therefore, option A is a more plausible outcome than option B, ""Der Vogel hat einen Wurm gefangen."""
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She moved to a new city) is more likely. The reason being that changing schools within the same city or town is less common than moving to a completely new location.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The Angestellten streikten) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that Option B (the extremists have murdered him) is correct. The fact that the leader has been attacked by extremists suggests a violent act, and given the context of political instability and conflict, it is plausible that the extremists would resort to such drastic measures as assassination.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich ging barfuß am Strand,"" option B is more likely. The waves are more likely to be present at a beach than sand sticking to one's feet."
"Response:  Option B: I drank a glass of water.
Explanation: The premise states that it was cold when you woke up, indicating that you may have been feeling chilly or uncomfortable. Drinking a glass of water would be a common response to this feeling, as it can help to hydrate and warm the body. In contrast, putting on a jogging hose might not necessarily address the discomfort caused by the cold temperature. Therefore, option B is more likely to be the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Mutter schwieg ihrem Sohne,"" it is more likely that her son grinned than jammed. The word ""grin"" in English translates to ""lächeln"" in German, which means to smile or show a happy expression. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ein Loch in meiner Jeans,"" option A (Ich habe die Jeansangezapft) is more likely to be the correct answer because it provides a logical explanation for how the hole appeared in the jeans. The other option (Ich bin auf dem Bürgersteig gestolpert) does not provide any information about how the hole was created."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Junge trug eine Zahnspange,"" it is more likely that he has a hollow tooth (Option A). The reason for this is that a zahnspange (meaning ""tooth spang"" in German) is a device used to hold false teeth in place, so if the boy was wearing one, it is unlikely that his teeth would have been recently cleaned or whitened ( Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I am today with Halsschmerzen [sore throat] on woken up) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B is more likely. Other students may feel excluded or left out if they notice that a particular girl is whispering to herself at lunchtime, especially if she's doing so in a way that draws attention to herself. This could lead to feelings of isolation or disconnection from their peers, which would be detrimental to their social well-being. Therefore, option B is the most plausible outcome given the information provided in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Sie sprang wieder in die Luft) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - The post has delivered the letter. This is because the premise states that the letter was left in a mailbox, implying that it was sent through regular postal service rather than being accelerated or delayed in any way. Therefore, it is most likely that the letter arrived at its destination via standard mail delivery.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He has put his entire savings at stake) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (the winds became stronger) is a more plausible explanation for why the wildfire spread quickly. The passage does not provide any information to suggest that the brandstifters were arrested or detained, so this option is unlikely. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (His mother has bound the wound) is more likely. The reason for this is that the premise states that the child ""has itself scratched its knee,"" implying a level of self-awareness and ability to take care of oneself that would make it unlikely for his mother to send him to his room. Additionally, the phrase ""his mother has bound the wound"" suggests a sense of responsibility and concern for her child's well-being that a parent might exhibit in such a situation."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he has signed his will) is the correct answer. The fact that he survived a deadly disease suggests that he may have been aware of his mortality and taken steps to prepare for the end of his life, such as signing a will.
"Response:  Option B: I have burned my tongue.
Explanation: The premise states that you took a sip of hot coffee, implying that your tongue came into contact with the extremely hot liquid. This would result in burning sensations, making option B the most likely outcome."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Die Autorin vermied in ihren Geschichten Vorurteile) is more likely. The author was fired because they avoided making judgments or expressing opinions that could be considered controversial or offensive. This suggests that the author's writing style was neutral and did not take a stand on any particular issue, which may have been requested by the editor as part of their firing.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich fühlte mich erschöpft,"" Option A (Ich habe den ganzen Tag geschlafen) is the more likely cause. The phrase ""erschöpft"" suggests a state of exhaustion or fatigue, which would be consistent with having slept for an extended period of time. Studying can also make someone feel exhausted, but it is less likely to result in feeling completely drained as described in the premise."
"Response:  Based on the premise, option A (She identified the symptoms of the patient) is more likely the correct answer because it aligns with the context provided in the passage. The passage states that the doctor ""stell[e] die Diagnose,"" indicating that she made a diagnosis based on the symptoms presented by the patient. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for how the doctor arrived at her conclusion."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe mich gekratzt,"" option A (Es war schweißtreibend) is the most likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he lost control) is the correct answer. The phrase ""der Mann wurde dringend operiert"" suggests that the man was in a state of urgency or emergency, which could indicate that he experienced some kind of medical crisis that caused him to lose control. While Option B (he had a heart attack) is also possible, it does not provide as much evidence for why the man needed to be operated on immediately."
"Response:  Option B: He rubbed his arms.
Explanation: The premise states that the man's arm muscles are inflamed, indicating that he may have overused or strained them through physical activity. Rubbing one's arms can help to relieve tension and reduce inflammation, making option B a more plausible explanation for the man's condition than option A, which suggests that he simply bent his arms without providing any context or evidence to support this claim."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann hob seine Augenbrauen,"" option B is more likely. The man raised his eyebrows, indicating he was surprised."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (Ich glaubte, dass seine Absichten gut waren) is more likely as it suggests that the speaker believed their colleague's intentions were good, rather than assuming they knew better.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that he began to exercise or engage in other physical activities (Option A). This is because quitting smoking often leads to an increase in energy levels and a desire to be more active.
Response:  Based on the given premise, option A (Der Körper des Angreifers wurde leblos) is more likely to occur. The fact that the woman struck her attacker in the nose suggests a violent confrontation, which could result in the attacker's death or unconsciousness rather than bleeding.
"Response:  Option A: Der Mann hatte ein falsches Ziel.  
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Der Pfeil verfehlte das Ziel,"" it is more likely that the man had a wrong target than that he lost the game. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A (Er entdeckte Ratten im Keller).  
Rationale: The phrase ""der Hausbesitzer bat um einen Exterminator"" suggests that there is a problem with pests in the house, specifically rats. Additionally, the fact that the owner requested an exterminator implies that he has noticed signs of rat infestation, such as droppings or gnawing sounds, which are often associated with rats in the basement or crawlspace. Therefore, option A is more likely to be the correct cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Ich war zu müde, um irgendetwas vorzubereiten) is more likely.
"Response: 
Option A: She began to hide her diary.
Explanation: The fact that the girl caught her brother reading her diary suggests that she values her privacy and personal space. Therefore, it is more likely that she will take steps to protect her diary from being read again in the future. Option A reflects this by stating that she begins to hide her diary, indicating that she wants to keep it safe from prying eyes."
"Response:  Option B: She has quit her job.
Explanation: The premise states that the woman had not much money for rent, indicating that she may have been struggling financially. Quitting a job to save money or find a better-paying one could be a possible solution. Therefore, option B is more likely than option A."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Hand des Kindes zog sich schnell zurück,"" option A is the most likely cause. The phrase ""zog sich schnell zurück"" suggests that something was pulled back quickly, which could refer to a hand being withdrawn from contact with something hot. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (distributing a survey to customers) is more likely to increase customer satisfaction than option A (offering a discount to new customers). This is because surveys can provide valuable insights into customers' experiences and perceptions, while offering discounts may not necessarily address any underlying issues with customer satisfaction.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Holzboden wurde zerkratzt,"" option A is the more likely cause. The fact that the floor was scratched suggests that something heavy or hard was moved across it, which could have been a couch cushion thrown by a child. It is less likely that a stool would leave noticeable scratches on the floor."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe mein Gesicht geschützt,"" it is more likely that Option A (Mein Feind verspottete mich) is the correct answer. The phrase ""geschützt"" implies protection or defense, suggesting that the speaker took steps to protect themselves from something negative or harmful, such as ridicule or insults. Therefore, Option A is a more plausible explanation for why the speaker's face was protected."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The statue was struck by lightning) is more likely. The statement ""Die berühmte Statue brannte nieder"" implies that the statue caught fire and burned down, which could be caused by a lightning strike. It does not suggest that people came to worship the statue or any other reason why it might catch fire. Therefore, Option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened to the famous statue based on the given premise."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A will occur - The Früchte vergießen Samen. This is because the wording of the premise suggests that the fruit has been left unattended for a period of time, allowing seeds to germinate. Option B does not provide any context or explanation as to why fliegen (flies) would be present near the fruit.
"Response:  Option A: She showed with her toes.
Explanation: The phrase ""she showed with her toes"" suggests that the ballerina's injury was caused by her showing or displaying something with her feet, rather than an accident involving her knuckles. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the ballerina's injury."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He has learned to tie his shoelaces) is the more likely cause. The premise mentions that the child's laces were loosened, indicating that they were not tied properly in the first place. It is unlikely that the child would have run around a playground without proper footwear support if they had already mastered tying their shoelaces. Therefore, option A is the more plausible explanation for why the child was unable to keep up with the other children during recess.
Response:  Based on the information provided in the passage, it is more likely that Option A (Ich habe das Buch zurückgegeben) is the correct answer. The text states that the speaker was fascinated by the book, indicating that they found it interesting or enjoyable. Returning a book suggests that the speaker did not finish reading it, which aligns with their statement of being fascinated by it. Therefore, Option A is the most likely choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (His parents have influenced him) is more likely. The passage states that the man had similar beliefs as his parents, indicating that he was raised in a household with shared religious views. This suggests that his parents played a significant role in shaping his beliefs and values, rather than abandoning or rejecting them. Therefore, Option A is the more likely cause for why the man holds these beliefs.
Response:  Based on the given information, it is more likely that option A (There is no benzin left) is the reason for the car to slow down until it comes to a stop. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann aß das Eis in der Sonne,"" option B is more likely. The sun does not have the ability to melt or affect ice, so it is unlikely that the man actually ate ice in the sun. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Teppicht saw schmutzig aus) is more likely as it provides a logical explanation for why the artworks were hung up in the room. The other option does not provide any context or reason for why the artworks would be placed in the room. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Option B: My boss held a meeting.
Explanation: The sentence ""Ich bin früh von der Arbeit geggangen"" means ""I left work early"", which suggests that the speaker did not have any physical symptoms like headaches to indicate why they left work early. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause for the speaker leaving work early - their boss held a meeting."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Der Besitzer schenkte dem Welpen eine Leckerei) is more likely. The fact that the dog has made a mess suggests that it may have done so accidentally or out of excitement, rather than intentionally to annoy its owner. Therefore, the owner's reaction is more likely to be positive and rewarding, such as giving the dog a treat.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A is more likely. The sentence ""I apologized to my friend"" implies that there was a conflict or mistake in the past, and now the speaker is trying to make amends. This suggests that the friend has been offended or upset, and therefore Option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann stieg in der Menge hervor,"" option A (Er trug einen Rucksack) is more likely as it provides a practical explanation for why the man stood out in the crowd. The presence of a rucksack suggests that he may have been traveling or carrying belongings, making him more noticeable to observers. In contrast, option B (Er trug eine Neonweste) does not provide any obvious reason why the man would stand out in the crowd, and may simply be a random detail included in the premise for dramatic effect."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Zeuge hat unter Eid gelogen,"" it is more likely that he will be accused of perjury (Option B)."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She wanted to fit in) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option B (They were abschopped) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (the audience stood up) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich schaute in die Sonne,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Die Sonne hat mich geblendet,"" is correct. The act of looking directly at the sun can cause temporary blindness or discomfort due to its intense light. This effect is more plausible than option B, ""Die Sonne hat meine Haut gebräunt,"" as prolonged exposure to UV radiation from the sun can cause sunburn, but it may not occur immediately after looking directly at the sun."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich langweilte mich"" (I was bored), option A is more likely. The word ""schnauben"" means to yawn or snore, so it's unlikely that the speaker would be experiencing this effect while feeling bored. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
"Response:  Option B: Das Steak war roh.
Explanation: The premise states that the steak was difficult to cut, implying that it may have been tough or chewy. If the steak were raw, it would be more difficult to cut than if it were cooked through. Therefore, option B is the more likely cause of the difficulty in cutting the steak."
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (Sie received Unterhaltszahlungen) is correct. The phrase ""erklärte sich bankrott"" suggests that the woman declared herself bankrupt, which means she was unable to pay her debts. Therefore, it is unlikely that she had a large amount of debt (Option B). Instead, it is more probable that she received financial support from someone else, such as Unterhaltszahlungen (alimony payments), to help her cover her expenses."
"Response:  Option B: I decided to visit him.
Explanation: The premise states that ""the light in the room of my friend was on,"" indicating that someone or something was present in his home. Given this information, it is more likely that the speaker decided to visit their friend rather than wondering if he was outside (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe mir die Blume unter die Nase gelegt,"" it is more likely that option A, ""Die Blütenblätter sind von der Blume gefallen,"" occurred. This is because when someone puts a flower under their nose, the blossoms are likely to fall off due to gravity."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sie trafen einen Freund aus der Kindheit) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He has submitted the paper incomplete) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mein Auto ist kaputt,"" Option B (Ich habe einen Mechaniker angerufen) is more likely. This is because the phrase ""Mein Auto ist kaputt"" implies that the speaker's car has broken down and needs to be repaired, rather than simply being in a shopping center."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, it is more likely that option A (the letter was thrown away) caused the situation. The fact that the letter was thrown away suggests that its contents were not important or relevant enough to be kept, which could indicate that it was anonymous or unimportant in some other way. Option B (the letter was unreadable) does not provide any insight into why the letter was discarded, as it simply states that the letter was impossible to read without providing any context or explanation for why this might have been the case.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Vogel schlug mit den Flügeln"", it is more likely that option A, ""Sie hat Eier gelegt"" is correct. The premise suggests that the bird flapped its wings, which would not result in eggs being laid but rather in flight."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe auf der Auffahrt geparkt,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Die Garage war offen,"" is the correct cause. This is because if the garage was open, it would be possible to park on the driveway rather than being unable to find a parking space in the garage itself."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (the victim has raised their hands) is more likely. The fact that the criminal lowered his weapon suggests that he was preparing to shoot or attack the victim, so it makes sense that the victim would try to defend themselves by raising their hands in a non-threatening manner.
Response:  Option B (I had planned to attend my friend's wedding)
"Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Ich habe geträumt (I had a dream) than Ich habe das Time forgotten (I forgot time). This is because the statement ""Ich habe geträumt"" implies that the speaker's experience of time was altered or distorted during their dream, whereas ""Ich habe das Time forgotten"" suggests that the speaker genuinely lost track of time."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the drucker had no tine left) is more likely.
"Response:  Option B: The fans stormed onto the field. 
Explanation: Given that the national anthem was playing, it's more likely that the fans would be emotionally charged and eager to show their patriotism by storming onto the field rather than simply turning towards the flag."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ich habe es serviert) caused the dip to taste weak. This is because the act of serving the dip can affect its flavor, potentially making it less intense or richer than when it was first prepared. Option B (Ich habe Salz hineingetan), on the other hand, would not necessarily impact the flavor of the dip directly but could potentially make it more salty overall.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - The hand towel has absorbed the liquid. This is because the word ""auf"" in German means ""on,"" indicating that the hand towel was placed directly on top of the spill, rather than being pushed or scraped across it. Therefore, it is likely that the hand towel will absorb the liquid rather than pushing it aside or leaving a residue behind."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (She read the book again) is more likely. The premise states that she was in the middle of reading her book when it was interrupted, suggesting that she had already made progress into the story. Therefore, it's more likely that she would want to continue reading from where she left off rather than setting a bookmark or closing the book entirely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Der Mann schaute aus dem Fenster) is more likely. The man looking out of the window suggests that he was trying to observe what was happening outside during the turbulence, which is a common reaction when people are experiencing rough air travel.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Junge zappelte,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""zappelte"" suggests that the boy was moving around quickly or frantically, which could be interpreted as ignoring someone. Therefore, it is more likely that the girl ignored him rather than stabbing him."
"Response:  Option A (They have their leg amputated)
Explanation: The premise states that the doctors gave the patient a ""künstliches Glied,"" which translates to artificial limb in English. This implies that they have had one of their legs replaced with an artificial one, rather than having it amputated. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the given premise, option B (She pulled her arm away) is more likely to occur as it implies a reaction of resistance or discomfort towards the boy's action. Option A (She shrugged her shoulders) does not convey any specific emotion or reaction.
"Response: 
Option B: Ich wusste, dass ich right had.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker asked their friend for advice, implying that they were unsure of what to do. Option B better captures this uncertainty by stating that the speaker already knew they were right, which goes against the idea of seeking advice in the first place."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Junge trat in den Schlamm,"" option A is more likely. The word ""klebte"" (cleaved) suggests that the sludge stuck to his shoes, rather than hitting him in the face."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that schools were closed (Option A). The reason being that snowfall of several centimeters may not be sufficient enough to warrant people hiding underground for safety. While some people might choose to stay indoors due to inclement weather conditions, it's unlikely that everyone in the city would seek shelter beneath the ground. Therefore, option A is the most plausible choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (He dropped) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (Der Baum fiel auf das Dach) is a more plausible explanation for why the house was damaged than option B (Der Baum schattete den Hinterhof). This is because falling trees can potentially damage roofs or other structures of houses, but shading a backyard would not typically result in significant damage to the building itself. Therefore, option A is the better choice.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I swung the axe onto the wood) is more likely as it provides a clear explanation for how the wood split into two pieces. The other option does not provide any logical reasoning to explain why the wood would split in such a way. Therefore, Option B is the better answer choice.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (the couple announced their separation) is more likely to be the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (She liked him) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (I was confused) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (they wanted a fair decision) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Der Mann entladete die Lebensmittel in den Kühlschrank) occurred because the phrase ""went loose"" implies a sudden and unexpected movement or action, which could be interpreted as the man unloading the food from his cart into the refrigerator. Therefore, option A is the most plausible outcome based on the information provided."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (She has worked hard) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (his son inherited his wealth) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the given premise, option B is more likely. The phrase ""Rauch erhub sich aus den Flamen"" means smoke rose from the flames, indicating that there was still a fire burning. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Auto der Frau war in der Werkstatt,"" option B (Sie hatte einen Autounfall) is the more likely cause."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe den Wecker durchgeschlafen,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Ich habe das Frühstück verpasst,"" is correct. This is because waking up late implies that the person did not have time to make breakfast, as they overslept."
"Response:  Option B: His family took part in the press conference.
Explanation: The premise states that ""Die Persönlichkeit"" (the personality) stepped out of a limousine, indicating that this is a high-profile event where many people are present, including the person's family. Therefore, it is more likely that his family would take part in the press conference rather than the cameras focusing solely on him."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the woman stayed in the bathtub for an extended period of time (Option A). The reason being that if the water had been drained from the bathtub (Option B), she would have noticed it immediately and taken action to get out of the tub. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He has joined a fraternity) is more likely. The student's desire to meet other students on campus suggests that he may be looking for social connections or community, which could be fulfilled through joining a fraternity or sorority. Joining a fraternity can provide opportunities to meet new people, make friends, and feel a sense of belonging on campus. Therefore, Option A is more likely than Option B (He studied engineering).
"Response:  Option B: Ich habe das Wohnzimmer neu eingerichtet.
Explanation: The sentence ""Ich habe die Sofakissen hochgezogen"" suggests that something has been moved or rearranged in the living room. This could be due to a variety of reasons, but one possibility is that the speaker has simply decided to rearrange the furniture for no particular reason. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Junge ist weggelaufen) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (She was sentenced to death) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the tea has been dampened (Option A). When sugar is stirred into hot tea, it dissolves quickly and the tea becomes weak or dampened. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Veteran hinkte,"" it is more likely that he was injured in battle (Option B) rather than being drafted into war (Option A). The word ""hinkte"" specifically implies a physical disability or injury, which is more commonly associated with combat wounds than conscription."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (The police pursued the criminal) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Laptop wollte nicht an,"" option A is the most likely cause. The laptop did not want to turn on, indicating that there may be a technical issue or problem with the device itself rather than simply forgetting where it was left."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (She has folded her laundry) is a more likely cause than Option A (She has purchased an extensive wardrobe). The premise mentions that the woman's clothes have disappeared from the closet, implying that she has already had a full wardrobe beforehand. It is less likely for someone to buy a large number of new clothes without first removing their existing ones from the closet. Therefore, option B is a more plausible explanation for why there are no clothes in the closet.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (his wife has given birth) is the more likely cause of his distress.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (His job offer was withdrawn) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Er begrüßte das Publikum) is more likely. The text states that his voice was clear throughout the whole hall, indicating that he spoke audibly to greet the audience rather than just speaking into a microphone.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (The coin sank until it reached the bottom of the well) is more likely to occur than option B (The coin broke into two halves).
Response:  Based on the premise provided, option A (the ball went into the hole) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ich had a sneezing fit) is correct. The sentence mentions breathing in dust on the attic roof, which could be caused by a sneezing fit rather than nausea or dizziness associated with Option B (I have gastroenteritis).
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Kunde benutzte gefälschtes Geld) is more likely. The fact that the cashier called security suggests that there may have been suspicious activity involving the customer's money, such as using counterfeit bills. This is a common tactic used by thieves to avoid detection when making purchases.
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Der Müll hat die Küche stinken lassen) is more likely. The fact that the writer has ""rausgebraht"" (emptied) the trash suggests that it was full of waste, which could have caused an unpleasant odor in the kitchen. It's less likely that the writer would accidentally throw away their shopping list, as they are unlikely to put it in the same location as the trash."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Familie ging in den Zoo,"" it is more likely that Option A: Die Kinder bewunderten die Tiere is correct. The phrase ""ging in den Zoo"" implies a visit to the zoo for observation and appreciation of the animals, rather than hunting or harming them. Therefore, Option A is the more plausible choice."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that his lungs were blocked (Option B). The man's breathing was loud, indicating that there may have been an obstruction in his airway, such as a blockage in his lungs. This is a common symptom of respiratory problems like pneumonia or asthma. On the other hand, kidney failure ( Option A) would not typically cause a person to breathe loudly.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I asked my friend if he was interested in going) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (I have opened the windows) is more likely to be effective in cooling down a room than Option A (I have brought decks). This is because opening windows allows for natural ventilation, which can help to circulate air and lower the temperature in the room, whereas bringing decks does not provide any direct cooling effect.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sein Rucksack war offen) is more likely to be the cause of the young man's back pain. 
"Response: 
Option B: It was her birthday.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker has given a gift to their mother, implying that it's a special occasion. Option B suggests that it was indeed the mother's birthday, making it the more likely cause."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (A Biene sticht den Gärtner) is more likely as a cause for the destruction of the narcissus in the garden. The mention of a bee sting suggests that an insect may have been responsible for damaging or destroying the flowers, rather than small mammals like echidnas digging them up.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A - The flame has gone out - occurred. This is because striking a match creates a spark, but does not necessarily result in an immediate flame. It may take some time for the flame to ignite, especially if the match is damp or there is little fuel available. Therefore, it is possible that the flame did not immediately appear after striking the match, leading to Option A being the most likely outcome.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (They wanted to avoid going to court) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Ihre Eltern sind tot) is more likely to be the cause of why the children were sent to a orphanage. This is because the phrase ""in ein Waisenhaus geschickt"" implies that the children are no longer with their biological parents, suggesting that they have died or are otherwise unable to care for them. In contrast, Option B (Ihre Eltern haben sie verwöhnt) does not provide any indication as to why the children would be separated from their parents."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Es kam zu einem Tsunami) is more likely. 
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Sie geriet in Panik) is more likely. The premise states that the wanderer ""stößt"" upon a poisonous snake, implying sudden contact or surprise, which could cause panic. Dehydration may occur as a result of being bitten by a venomous snake, but it would not be the immediate reaction to such an encounter."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Ofen wurde heiß,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that something has happened to make the oven hot, rather than suggesting that food has been placed inside it. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe den Zitronenkeil gequetscht,"" it is more likely that Option A, ""Die Zitrone ist schimmelhaltig geworden,"" is correct. This is because when you squeeze a citrus fruit, it can cause the juice to come out, but it does not typically make the fruit moldy or spoiled. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation for what happened to the citrus fruit in this scenario."
"Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (The land colonized the new country) is more likely. The premise states that ""the country discovered new lands,"" implying that there was already a known territory that needed to be explored or expanded upon. This suggests that the existing country had the resources and capabilities to establish colonies in these newly discovered areas, rather than leaving their own land entirely."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Glas fiel vom Tisch,"" option A (Es zerbrach überall auf dem Boden) is more likely. The premise implies that the glass shattered upon impact with the ground, rather than landing in a specific location like the washing machine."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Tisch wackelte,"" it is more likely that the cause of the table shaking was Option B: The floor was uneven or slippery."
"Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (sein Sohn hat die Wahrheit gestanden) is true. The reason for this is that the phrase ""erwischt"" implies that the father caught his son in the act of lying, which suggests that the son was indeed being dishonest. Therefore, it is more probable that the son admitted to telling a lie rather than the father choosing to trust him without any evidence or motivation to do so."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Kopf des Mannes schlug vor Schmerz,"" it is more likely that he took aspirin (Option B) than hustensaft (Option A). This is because aspirin is a pain reliever, while hustensaft is a cough medicine with no analgesic properties."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Zug verlangsamte,"" option A is more likely. The sentence suggests that the train slowed down, indicating that it was approaching a station or preparing to stop. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the information provided, Option A (Psychische Erkrankungen waren in seiner Familiendiververt) is more likely to be the cause of his mental health issues. The fact that he had a therapy session suggests that he has been experiencing psychological problems for some time, and the mention of depression as a possible diagnosis implies that these problems are severe enough to require professional treatment. It is also possible that he may have inherited a predisposition to develop mental health disorders from his family members. In contrast, Option B (Bei ihm wurde eine Depression diagnostiziert.) does not provide any additional context or evidence to support this conclusion.
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (She has herself with the food) is a more plausible explanation for why she stopped breathing than Option A (She had eaten). This is because choking on one's own food is a common cause of asphyxiation, whereas swallowing food does not typically lead to this outcome.
Response:  Option B: She spoke with an accent.
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that the dog will eat the steak (Option A).
Response:  Option B: She became rich.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Die Glocke läutete) is more likely as it provides a clear reason for the students to leave their classroom. The other option, Option B (Der Lehrer gab ihm Hausaufgaben), does not provide a specific reason for the students to leave their classroom.
"Response:  Option B (Her friends were more likely to be supportive)
Explanation: The fact that the woman's friends were ""more likely to be supportive"" suggests that they believed her claim of seeing a ghost and were willing to listen to her experience without being skeptical or dismissive. This implies that they had a close relationship with her and trusted her enough to take her seriously. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (He would have been almost drowned in the ocean) is more likely. The man's loss of hearing could have resulted from exposure to loud noises while he was almost drowned in the ocean rather than any other cause mentioned in Option B (He would have been almost killed by an explosion).
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Kind ließ die Ballonschnur los,"" it is more likely that option B, ""Der Ballon stieg in die Luft,"" will occur. This is because when a ballon is released from an anchor or restraint, it will tend to rise into the air due to the buoyancy of gas inside it."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that Option A (he had a stroke) caused him to lose his ability to speak. Strokes can affect various parts of the brain, including those responsible for language processing and speech production, leading to difficulties with communication. In contrast, deep breathing may not directly impact one's ability to speak.
Response:  Based on the given information, Option A (a rip in the concrete) is a more plausible explanation for why the woman stumbled than Option B (hearing her name called). The fact that she stumbled on a gehweg suggests that there may have been an obstacle or unevenness in the surface of the path that caused her to lose her balance. A rip in the concrete could potentially create such an obstacle, but hearing one's name being called would not. Therefore, Option A is the more likely explanation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (Der Mann hat den Rettungsschwimmer durchnässt) is more likely. The man throwing a cannonball into the pool would create a splash that could potentially soak or drench the lifeguard nearby.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich habe Antibiotika genommen,"" it is more likely that Option A will occur - ""Meine Infection ist wieder gesund."" This is because antibiotics are designed to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, which can cause infections. Taking antibiotics can help to clear up an infection by reducing the number of infectious organisms in the body. Therefore, it is more likely that taking antibiotics will lead to a decrease in the severity of the infection rather than an increase in its spread."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Ampel wurde gelb,"" it is more likely that the driver pressed the brake (Option A). This is because when the traffic light turns yellow, drivers are expected to slow down or stop their vehicles to avoid running a red light."
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (I have tauchten the container in warm water) is more likely to be the cause of the plastic melting. This is because tapping a plastic container in warm water can cause it to soften and become pliable, leading to melting or deformation. On the other hand, placing a plastic container directly onto a hot oven may not provide enough time for the plastic to melt before it becomes too hot and begins to degrade. Therefore, option A is the more likely cause of the plastic melting.
Response:  Based on the given information, option A (The driver crashed into a telephone pole) is more likely than option B (The driver ran a red light). This is because there is no indication in the premise that the driver was speeding or otherwise reckless, which might have contributed to the accident if they were running a red light.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Junge studied the whole night,"" it is more likely that he has passed the examination (Option B). The premise implies that he dedicated a significant amount of time to studying, which suggests that he put in sufficient effort to perform well on the examination."
"Response:  Option B: The rescuer was on duty.
Explanation: Based on the premise ""Der junge Junge klammerte sich an den Rand des Teiches,"" it is more likely that the young boy clung to the edge of the pond because he needed help or rescue rather than being afraid to learn how to swim. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  Option A - Ich spürte meinen Herzschlag.
Explanation: The premise states that the speaker placed their hand on their chest, implying direct physical contact with the heart. Therefore, option A is more likely as it suggests feeling one's own heartbeat directly through touching the chest area."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (My office was overfilled) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Die Familie lud die Nachbarn zum Essen ein) is more likely. This is because the family wants to get to know their new neighbors better by inviting them over for a meal, which suggests they are interested in building a positive relationship with them.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Wasser spritzte aus dem Pool"", option A is more likely. The fact that water splashed out of the pool suggests that something or someone entered the pool, which is consistent with Option A."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that Option A (Ich habe versehentlich einen Samen geschluckt) is true. The reason for this is that biting into a piece of watermelon is a common activity during hot weather or outdoor activities, and it is unlikely to accidentally bite off one's own tooth while doing so. On the other hand, swallowing a seed from a fruit like watermelon is a more plausible mistake, especially if one is not paying close attention to what they are eating.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (His jacket was torn) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, Option A (She was distracted by noise) is a more plausible explanation for why she put her earplugs in wrong. It's unlikely that she would intentionally pierce her own ears with earplugs.

Response:  Based on the given information, option A (It contained vulgar language) is more likely to be the reason for censorship of the television show.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (The crew perished) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (He has solved the riddle) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Telefon klingelte,"" it is more likely that option A (Der Mann legte auf) occurred. This is because when someone's phone rings, they typically answer it rather than letting it ring and then taking the call."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Die Frau starrte mich an,"" option A is more likely. The woman's gaze suggests that she may be interested in or attracted to the speaker, rather than feeling uneasy around them."
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (They have photographed all exhibits) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann fing mit mir an zu streiten,"" option B (My friend has himself for me) is more likely. The man started arguing with you, indicating that he was already in a confrontational state of mind when your friend introduced him to you. It's unlikely that he would have been receptive to your friend's intervention at this point, making it more likely that your friend took on the role of mediator or advocate rather than introducing you directly to the man."
"Response:  Option B: I have changed the tire.
Explanation: The premise states that the tire was flat, so option B is the most likely answer as it involves changing the tire to fix the problem. Option A does not address the issue of a flat tire but rather inflating the tire, which would not solve the problem."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Das Mädchen sah blass aus,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""sah blass aus"" suggests that the girl looked pale or ill, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as lack of sleep, poor nutrition, or even an emotional shock. It's less likely that her father would physically touch her forehead to make her look bizarre."
Response:  Based on the information provided in the premise, it is more likely that option A (Ich habe einen Bleistift benutzt) is correct. The use of a bleistift would result in a mark on the paper, whereas signing one's name would not. Therefore, option A is the more likely explanation for why there is no tint on the paper.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (He had debts) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option A (Sie hatte Windpocken) is more likely. The sentence suggests that the girl was absent from school due to illness, specifically windpox, which is a common childhood illness characterized by fever and rash. This implies that she may have been too sick to attend school, rather than simply enjoying mathematics.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Müllsack war voll,"" it is more likely that option A (Ich habe es in den Müllcontainer gebracht) is correct. This is because the sentence implies that the bag was already full, so it would not make sense to put something else into it. Option B (Ich habe es in die Spüle geworfen) does not fit with this context as throwing something down the drain would not be a logical solution for dealing with a full trash bag."
Response:  Based on the premise provided, Option A (Mein Mitbewohner hat Punsch verschüttet) is the more likely cause for the situation described in the premise.
Response:  Based on the premise, Option B (Er warf einen Stuhl über den Raum) is more likely. The man's loss of control suggests a stronger reaction than simply turning off his computer. Warthrowing a chair across the room would be a more dramatic and unexpected action, making it a more plausible choice for how he might react in this situation.
Response:  Based on the premise, option A (the branch burned) is more likely.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann ist aus der Dusche gekommen,"" option A (the hot water was turned off) is the more likely cause for him to have come out of the shower. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: Das heiße Wasser war weg."
"Response:  Option B: They encouraged their children to play outside.
Explanation: The parents wanted their children to go to college but did not have enough money for tuition fees, so they encouraged them to play outside instead of spending too much time indoors playing video games or watching TV. This option is more likely because it aligns with the idea that parents want their children to be active and healthy, rather than relying solely on savings for education expenses."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann löste seine Schnürsenkel,"" option A is more likely. The fact that he loosened his laces suggests that he may have intentionally undone them, which could lead to him being able to slip out of his shoes more easily."
Response:  Based on the given premise, it is more likely that option A (Er hat die Reste gekühlt) is true. The man did not save the recipe, he only refrigerated the leftovers.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Mein Knöchel war geschwollen,"" option A is more likely. The phrase ""Ich habe Eis drauf"" means ""I put ice on it,"" which would be a common remedy for reducing swelling. Option B, ""Ich habe Lotion draufgerieben,"" means ""I rubbed lotion on it,"" which may not have any direct effect on reducing swelling."
Response:  Based on the given premise, Option B (Ich habe das Gespräch im Flur gehört) is more likely. The fact that the protagonist's office door was open suggests that someone other than their colleague could have overheard the conversation in the hallway.
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Ich musst anstehen,"" it is more likely that Option A (Ich setzte mich) is correct. The verb ""musst"" implies a sense of obligation or necessity, which suggests that the speaker had to sit down rather than choosing to do so."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann schlug auf die Fliege"", it is more likely that the fly will buzz away (Option A)."
"Response:  Based on the premise ""Der Mann hat ein Testament geschrieben,"" it is more likely that Option A (Er war im Sterben) is true. The fact that he wrote a will suggests that he was in his final stages of life and wanted to make arrangements for after his death. It does not necessarily imply that he was married or had any other personal relationships."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (he accelerated his pace) is more likely.
Response:  Based on the given information, option B (I have found a solution) is more likely. The speaker has already considered the problem carefully and come up with a solution, indicating that they are proactive and resourceful in finding solutions to problems.
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He felt himself in ecstasy) is more likely. The idea of a person feeling themselves in ecstasy while walking on a shaky bridge suggests that they are experiencing an intense emotional state, rather than simply being scared or frightened.
"Response: 
Option B: He has made a bet with his friends.
Explanation: The man saw the victory of the team beforehand, which suggests that he had inside information or was confident about the outcome of the game. It's more likely that he placed a bet with his friends based on this knowledge rather than simply watching the game with them."
Response:  Based on the premise, option B (He counted sheep) is more likely. The premise mentions that the boy couldn't fall asleep, implying that he was trying to relax or calm down before sleeping. Counting sheep is a common technique used by many people when they have trouble falling asleep, so it is more likely that this is what the boy was doing in this scenario.
