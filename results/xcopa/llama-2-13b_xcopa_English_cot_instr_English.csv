Therefore, calling her back (option A) would be the most appropriate response as it shows that I value our relationship and am interested in what she has to say.  
On the other hand, meeting her for dinner (option B) might not be the best choice since we don't know what she wants to discuss or if there's an emergency. It could also come across as insensitive if I assume she just wants to hang out without considering her needs first. So option A is the better choice here."

"Response: 
If his argument was considered absurd, it means that people didn't take him seriously or found his reasoning flawed. This could lead to a loss of support among voters (option A). However, option B states that he was accused of corruption, but there's no direct connection between an absurd argument and corruption. Therefore, option A is the better choice."
Response:  If everyone disapproved of their engagement, it means they didn't have society's approval or support for their relationship.

It's much more likely that the elevator malfunctioned and caused the building to be evacuated.

Response:  If he failed his history exam, it means that he didn't do well on the test.

"Response: 
If crime rates rose, would that make buildings collapse? No! So option B can be eliminated as a possible cause of the building collapse.

Correct answer: Option A"

Therefore, option B - She got a second wind - is the most likely cause.

Response:  If she avoided going into the lake because it looked contaminated (option B), then we would expect her to have seen something that suggested the water was unsafe for some reason. However, there is no information about what she saw or why she thought the water was contaminated. On the other hand, if she avoided going into the lake because she wanted to catch a fish (option A), then we wouldn't necessarily expect to see any specific signs of contamination. Therefore, option A is more plausible based on the given premise.
Response:  If his bike were stolen, he would probably be upset and angry, not just wet. So option B is less likely. Option A is more plausible because an umbrella can break easily in strong wind or rain, leaving him soaked. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Response:  If you were invited to a birthday party, it means that someone wanted you there. So, option A (I was lonely) doesn't make sense because if you were feeling lonely, you wouldn't have been invited in the first place.

Response:  If the truck collided with the car, then it must have been moving at some speed. Therefore, option A (the truck sped up) is less likely because if the truck was already moving fast when it hit the car, it would not make sense to say that it sped up further after the collision.

So, the most likely effect is that the boy will climb up to the roof.
"Response:

Therefore, option A (pacifists staged a protest) is less likely.  
The correct answer is Option B: Pacifists held a parade."
"Response: 
The girl pulled the ribbon from her hair, so she no longer has it in her hair. Therefore option A (she tied the ribbon) cannot be true because there is no ribbon to tie.

"Response: 
The child burped. That means he drank something that caused gas to build up in his stomach. 
If he had taken a swig of soda (option A), it would have been flat and not fizzy. Therefore, option A is unlikely.

If I turned the page on the calendar, it means that there are no more days left in the current month. Therefore, option B is correct - it was the beginning of a new month."

This would make sense if he wanted to avoid costly legal battles or if he believed that reconciliation with his wife was still possible.

Therefore, option B - filing for divorce - is more likely.

Therefore, option B (They found the weapon at the crime scene) is less likely than option A (They discovered the identity of the murderer).
"Response:  If there was a lot of traffic on the highway, it means that driving on the highway itself would be difficult or impossible due to congestion. Therefore, taking a detour (option A) might not be possible either because all roads are congested or because there are no alternative routes available.

If he had a date, he would have dressed up for her, not sprayed himself with cologne. 
So option A is less likely. 
The correct answer is Option B: He put gel in his hair."
Response:  If there was no electricity, it means we are without power.  Therefore, looking for a flashlight would not be effective because it requires batteries to work.  On the other hand, picking up a shovel could help us dig our way out of this situation! So Option B is the better choice here.
"Response: 
The family moved into a bigger house because they needed more space for their growing family. 
Therefore, option B - The mother gave birth to twins - is the correct answer.  "
Response:  If she was keeping at a slow pace, it means that she wasn't running as fast as possible. Therefore, option A makes sense because she would want to conserve her energy for the rest of the race. Option B doesn't make sense in this context since there is no indication that she saw the finish line yet. So, the correct answer is option A.
"Response:  If the boy kicked the vending machine, it would be logical to assume that he wanted something from it, like a snack or drink. Therefore, option B - the bag of chips was stuck - is more likely than option A - the machine spit out the change.  
Explanation:  When you kick a vending machine, it usually doesn't dispense change; instead, it might get stuck or not work properly. So, option B makes more sense in this scenario."
"Response: 
My friend just lost his beloved pet. He might be feeling sad or upset. In this situation, it would not be appropriate to roll my eyes at him. Instead of that, I should offer some support and comfort. So, the correct answer is option B - I gave him a hug."
Response:  If his credit card was declined, it means he doesn't have enough money in his account to cover the purchase. So if he pays with cash, that would be a lie because he doesn't actually have the money to pay for it. Therefore, option B (paying with cash) is less likely than option A (writing an IOU).
"Response: 
If he was cursing, it means something made him angry or upset. 
What could make someone angry or upset? 
Maybe something hurt them physically! 
So, option B makes more sense - he stubbed his toe.  "
Response:  We know that the man feels proud of his brother.  If his brother got into an argument with their parents, it might make the man feel embarrassed or disappointed instead of proud. Therefore, option B is a better fit for the given premise.

"Response:  If the poster was stuck to the wall, then it must have been attached with something.  Therefore, option B (I put tape on the back of the poster) is a better explanation for why the poster fell down than option A (I positioned the poster above the door).  
So, the correct answer is option B."
"Response: 
The client approved the plan, so it means that they liked what the architect had designed. 
If the architect then constructs the building according to those plans (option A), there would be no need to make any changes or adjustments. 
On the other hand, if the architect were to adjust the plans (option B), it suggests that something was not quite right with the original design, and therefore, changes needed to be made before construction could begin.  
Given this reasoning, option B - ""the architect adjusted the plans"" - is a more logical choice than option A."
"Response: 
If the man's hand was shaking, he would have difficulty holding onto the spoon, causing it to drop. Therefore, option A (His hand was shaking) is a more plausible explanation for why the man dropped his spoon than option B (He licked the spoon)."
"Response: 
If the CEO resigned, it means he was not doing a good job or had some personal reasons that led him to leave. 
In this case, option B is more likely because the board of directors would want to find someone who can do a better job than the previous CEO.  
Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  If you arrived late to the lecture, it means that the lecture has already started. So, option A (taking a seat in the back row) is more likely because you would want to find a seat as quickly and quietly as possible without disrupting the speaker or other attendees. Option B (approaching the podium) is less likely because it would be more disruptive and might draw attention away from the speaker. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
Response:  If he had enough money for bail, it would be option A. But if he didn't have enough money, then we are left with option B - attacking another inmate. Therefore, option B is more likely.
Response:  If they had a fire in their house, wouldn't they have mentioned it?  It seems like something significant that would be included in the premise. So option B is less likely. Option A makes more sense because if they sold their house, they might not have anything left to lose. Therefore, we should choose option A as the correct answer.
Response:  If I stomped on an aluminum can, it would get crushed (Option B). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The girl joined the debate team. Why did she join? To learn how to communicate effectively! Therefore, option B (She learned communication skills) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
The premise states that my mood improved. 
So, it must be option B - doing the dishes! 
That's right! Doing the dishes can improve your mood because you feel productive and accomplished after completing a task. Listening to music may not have the same effect."
"Response: 
The charity wanted to raise money. 
They didn't have any money to start with. 
So they had to spend money to hold an auction. 
That means they would lose money!  
Therefore, option B (holding an auction) is less likely. 
Option A (feeding the homeless) makes more sense because it doesn't cost anything. 
It's free! "
Response:  If we imagine ourselves in this situation, what would be our natural response to such a thrilling experience? We would most probably SCREAM! Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
If I was ""furious,"" it means my emotions were high. 
High emotions often lead to impulsive actions. 
Impulsive actions can be physical like slamming a door or checking something quickly without much thought (like the mailbox). 
Given that we are looking for an action that is more likely to happen when someone is furious, option B - slamming the door - makes more sense than option A - checking the mailbox.  
Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: Slammed the door."
Response:  If he wants to watch the sunrise, it means that he needs to face east. So, option A (travel north) doesn't make sense because if he goes north, he will not be facing east. Option B (get up early) makes more sense because getting up early will allow him to see the sunrise. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.
"Response:  If I folded the paper, it means that I manipulated it physically in some way.  Since we are talking about a physical object here (the paper), option B - ""The paper creased"" - seems like a much more plausible outcome than option A - ""I recycled the paper.""  
Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
If there was a natural disaster in our country, we would need help from other nations to recover. 
Therefore, option B - Leaders of other countries sent emergency relief - is more likely than option A - Leaders of other countries formed an alliance.  
This question tests your ability to make logical deductions based on given information."

"Response: 
If the curtains were closed, opening them would not allow sunlight to enter the room. Therefore, option A cannot be the correct answer.

"Response: 
If I pulled her hair, it would be Option A - her wig came off.  "
Response:  If the editor reworded a sentence, it means he didn't find the original sentence clear or effective enough. Therefore, option B (He deemed the sentence unclear) is more plausible than option A (He found the manuscript compelling). So, the correct answer is B.
"Response: 
If she canceled her credit card account, it means that she no longer wanted to use the card. 
So, option B (She realized the card was expired) doesn't make sense because if the card was expired, she would still have the opportunity to renew or replace it. 
On the other hand, option A (She realized the card was missing) makes more sense because if she canceled her credit card account, it's possible that she misplaced or lost the physical card.  
Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why she canceled her credit card account."
"Response: 
If they fell in love, then they probably got married first before attending college together.  
Therefore, option B (They got married) is more likely than option A (They attended college)."
"Response: 
If the music was too faint to hear, then it means that the volume was not enough. Therefore, option A (I turned up the volume) is a better choice than option B (I composed my own song)."
"Response: 
The boy's hair was sticking up. 
So, someone must have done something to his hair. 
According to the premise, that someone is a girl. 
Therefore, option B is incorrect because pulling is not what girls do with boys' hair. 
Option A is correct; girls ruffle boys' hair.  
Conclusion: Option A - The girl ruffled it."
"Response: 
If the bug was alive, it would have moved or reacted to being squashed. Since there is no reaction, we can infer that the bug is dead. Therefore, option B (I stepped on the bug) is the correct answer."

If you open your eyes, it means they were closed before. So, option A - ""I woke up"" - makes more sense than option B - ""I relaxed."" Therefore, answer A is correct."
"Response: 
If my neighbor's music was blaring, then he probably wouldn't lend me his CD. 
So option B (borrowing the CD) is less likely than option A (asking to turn it down).  
Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  If he had a low-paying job or earned below minimum wage (option B), it would be difficult for him to save money. Therefore, option A - that he was frugal with his earnings - is more plausible.
"Response: 
If he graduated, it means he finished his studies. So, option B (he took up a hobby) is less likely because graduating doesn't necessarily mean someone will start doing something new like a hobby. Option A (looking for a job) makes more sense since most people who graduate are looking to enter the workforce or advance their careers. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  If we mix yellow paint with blue paint, what color will we get? That's right - green! So option B is the correct answer.  
"Response: 
If the conversation became tense, it means that there was a disagreement or difference in opinion. 
This implies that we had something to talk about before the conversation became tense. 
Therefore, option A (I ran out of things to talk about) is less likely. 
The correct answer is option B (the conversation became tense)."
"Response: 
My brother was just discharged from the hospital after a long illness or injury. He must be feeling weak and vulnerable. In this situation, it would not make sense for me to give him the cold shoulder. Instead, I should welcome him back home with open arms and offer my support and care. Therefore, option A (I welcomed him back home) is the most appropriate choice."
"Response: 
If the curtain on the stage went up, it means that something new has started or been revealed. 
In this case, option A makes sense because the opening scene of a play would be what comes next after the curtain goes up. 
So, the correct answer is Option A: The opening scene of the play began."
"Response: 
If the kidnapper threatened to hurt the hostage (option A), then it would be logical that the hostage submitted to the kidnapper's demands out of fear for their own safety. 
On the other hand, if the kidnapper left the hostage alone (option B), then it would not make sense for the hostage to submit to the kidnapper's demands since there was no direct threat or coercion involved. Therefore, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the hostage submitted to the kidnapper's mandates."
Response:  If a boom reverberated across the stage, it means that something loud happened.  Since we know that the musician was not playing an instrument at that moment (otherwise, we would have heard the sound of the instrument), it must be that he did something else to create the noise.  Therefore, option B - The musician pounded the drum - is the correct answer.
"Response:  If the child had a nightmare, they would be screaming.  So option A is less likely.  Option B makes more sense because the child might have seen something or someone under the bed that frightened them.

"Response: 
If she was born premature (option A), it would be less likely that she would have been able to learn sign language as a primary means of communication. 
On the other hand, if she was born deaf (option B), it would be much more likely that she would rely on sign language for communication. 
Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  If there was a drought, then it means that there wasn't enough rain or moisture for some time.  This would have an impact on the plants and crops growing in the area.  
Of course!  That makes sense.  So what do you think happened to the crops during this drought?  Did they survive or did they perish?  Answer:  Based on the information provided, it is more likely that the crops perished due to lack of water.  Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response: 
If the cat chased the bird, it means that the bird was in danger of being eaten by the cat. Therefore, option A (the bird flew away) is more likely than option B (the bird caught a worm).  
So, the correct answer is Option A: The bird flew away."
Response:  If she switched schools, it means she didn't graduate yet.  Summer vacation doesn't make sense in this scenario because school would still be in session. Therefore, option B (she moved to a new town) is more plausible than option A (school let out for the summer).
"Response: 
If the owner refused to raise employees' wages, it means that he/she wants to maximize profits at the expense of workers' well-being. 
Now, if the owner appoints a new manager (option A), this might not necessarily address the issue of low wages. In fact, the new manager could be even stricter or less willing to listen to employees' demands. Therefore, option A is unlikely to have a positive impact on the situation. 
On the other hand, going on strike (option B) would directly challenge the owner's decision and put pressure on him/her to reconsider their stance. By withholding their labor, employees are taking a proactive approach to advocate for their rights. So, option B is more likely to produce the desired outcome - higher wages - than option A.  
Therefore, the correct answer is option B: The employees went on strike."
"Response: 
If the extremists assassinated the leader, it would be a drastic move that could have unintended consequences for them. 
On the other hand, if the extremists influenced the leader, they might achieve their goals without resorting to violence.  
Given the premise, option B (the extremists assassinated the leader) seems less likely than option A (the extremists influenced the leader)."
Response:  If I was walking barefoot on the beach, then sand would stick to my feet (Option A). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.  
Response:  If you were cold, drinking a glass of water would not make sense because it might even make you feel colder! So that option can be eliminated right away. On the other hand, putting on sweatpants makes perfect sense since they are warm and cozy. Therefore, Option A - Putting on sweatpants - is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The mother hushed her son, so she probably told him to be quiet or stop doing something. This implies that her son was making noise or causing a disturbance. Based on this information, option B (Her son whined) is more likely than option A (Her son smirked). Therefore, the correct answer is B."
Response:  If a hole ripped in your jeans, you wouldn't zip them up because they are damaged. Therefore, option A is incorrect. And if you didn't trip on the pavement, then how did the hole rip in your jeans? So, option B must be true!
"Response: 
The boy had braces to make his teeth straighter. 
So, it's more likely that his teeth became straight (Option B).  
Therefore, Option B is correct!"
Response:  If you went to the gym yesterday, it's more likely that your muscles would be sore today rather than your throat. Therefore, option A (I woke up today with sore muscles) is the correct answer.

"Response: 
If the post office delivered the letter, then it must have been sent to the correct address. 
So, option A is more likely."

"Response: 
If the arsonists were caught, it would have been reported in the news or mentioned somewhere. 
Since we don't see any such information, option B is unlikely. 
So, let's go with option A - the winds becoming stronger.  "
Response:  If the child skinned his knee, he would need medical attention. Therefore, option B (His mother put a bandage on the wound) is more likely than option A (His mother sent him to his room).  
Response:  If he had a deadly illness and survived it, then that means he didn't die from it. Therefore, option A (he signed his will) cannot be true because if he died, there would be no need to sign a will. Option B (receiving an organ transplant) must be true since receiving an organ transplant can save one's life when they are very sick or dying. So, the correct answer is option B.
Response:  If you took a sip of scalding coffee, it would be more likely that your tongue got burned than that you bit your tongue. Therefore, option B (burnt my tongue) is more likely.
"Response: 
The editor fired the writer, so it must have been something significant that led to this decision. 
Missing a deadline might be a reason, but it doesn't seem like enough to warrant being fired. 
On the other hand, avoiding bias in one's reporting could be seen as a positive trait for a journalist, so it's unlikely that would lead to being let go. 
Therefore, option B (the writer missed an important deadline) is the most plausible explanation for why the editor fired the writer."
"Response: 
If you were studying all day, wouldn't you feel energized instead of exhausted? 
So option B can be eliminated as a possible cause. 
Therefore, option A - sleeping all day - is the most likely explanation for feeling exhausted afterward."
"Response: 
The physician diagnosed the patient. 
Therefore, option A is correct.  
Explanation:  When a doctor diagnoses a patient, they identify the underlying condition or disease that is causing the patient's symptoms. In this case, the physician has identified the patient's symptoms, so option A is the best answer. Option B is incorrect because it states that the physician prescribed pills to the patient, but there is no information in the premise about the physician prescribing any medication."
"Response: 
If you scratch your skin, it means that there must be some discomfort or irritation. 
So, option B - ""It felt itchy"" - makes more sense as the cause of scratching than option A - ""It was sweaty.""  
Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
"Response: 
If he had a heart attack, wouldn't that have been mentioned in the premise? 
It seems unlikely that he would need emergency surgery for a heart attack. 
Therefore, option A - losing his temper - is more plausible."
"Response: 
The premise states that the man's arm muscles bulged. This implies he has strong arms. Therefore, option A - He flexed his arms - is a better choice than option B - He rubbed his arms.  
So, the correct answer is (A) He flexed his arms."
"Response: 
The man has just been told that he will have to work for a long time before he can retire. 
This means that he will not be able to enjoy his golden years as soon as he had hoped. 
Therefore, option B - He felt discouraged - is the most likely choice."
"Response: 
If we assume that my colleague's intentions are good (option A), then it follows that he made an honest mistake. In this case, there may be a number of causes for his error, such as inattention or lack of knowledge. However, if we assume that my colleague knows better (option B), then his action can be attributed to carelessness or negligence. Therefore, option A is the most plausible explanation."
"Response: 
If he stopped smoking, it means that he must have been motivated to improve his health. 
Therefore, option A - ""He began exercising more"" - is a more logical choice than option B - ""He started waking up earlier.""  
Exercise is a common way to improve one's health, especially after quitting smoking. Waking up earlier may also be beneficial for some people, but it doesn't directly relate to improving one's health like exercise does. So, option A is the better answer."
"Response: 
If the woman punched the attacker in the nose, it's likely that he would start to bleed rather than become lifeless. Therefore, option B is a better choice."
"Response: 
The premise states that the dart missed the bull's eye. This implies that the man did not hit his target. Therefore, option A - ""the man's aim was off"" - is a better explanation than option B - ""the man was losing the game."" So, answer A."
Response:  If there were rats in the basement, it would be very unlikely for the owner to keep an ant farm in his bedroom. Therefore, option B (he kept an ant farm in his room) is less likely than option A (he discovered rats in the basement). So, the correct answer is option A.
"Response:  If you were too tired to prepare anything, would your guest still be there? Unlikely! So option A can be eliminated as a possible cause. Therefore, option B - ""My houseguest overstayed her welcome"" - is the most likely reason for going out to dinner."
Response:  If she started hiding the diary, it would mean that she wants to keep writing in it but doesn't want her brother to read it anymore. So, option A is more likely.
Response:  If she was short on money for rent, quitting her job would not help her situation. In fact, it might make things worse! Therefore, option B (She quit her job) is less likely. Option A (She worked overtime) is more likely because working extra hours could potentially earn her more money to pay her rent.
"Response: 
If the child had patted the puppy's head, his hand would not have recoiled so quickly. Therefore, option B is less likely to be true compared to option A. So, the correct answer is option A - he touched the hot stove."
"Response: 
If they want to gauge customer satisfaction, it makes sense that they would distribute a survey. 
Therefore, option B (distributed a survey) is more likely than option A (offered a discount).  "
Response:  If the boy threw the cushions off the couch, that would have happened before he damaged the floor. So it can't be the cause of the scratches. Therefore, option B - the boy dragged a chair across the floor - is the correct answer.
Response:  If someone is taunting you, they are probably not physically attacking you yet. So option A is less likely. Option B is more likely because if an enemy is cocking their fist, it means they are getting ready to punch or hit you. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
If people had come to venerate the statue, they would have been careful not to damage it. 
So option B is less likely than option A. 
Therefore, option A - the statue being struck by lightning - is a more plausible explanation for its burning down."

"Response: 
If she tore a ligament, it means that there was some kind of trauma or injury. 
Twisting her ankle would be a more likely cause of this injury than pointing her toes. 
Therefore, option B (twisted her ankle) is the correct answer."
Response:  If his shoelaces came undone, he would not be able to run around on the playground because he would trip or fall. Therefore, option A (he learned how to tie them) is a much more plausible explanation than option B (he ran around on the playground).
"Response: 
If you were enthralled with a book, would you return it or lose track of time? 
It seems like losing track of time is a more likely outcome than returning the book. 
Therefore, option B (lost track of time) is the better choice."
Response:  If his parents had disowned him, he would not have been able to hold similar beliefs as them. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Option A is correct because if his parents influenced him, it is likely that he would share their beliefs.
Response:  If the car gradually slowed down to a stop, it means that something happened over time.  This suggests that the driver may have fallen asleep because they were driving for an extended period without realizing it.

If you left work early because of a headache, it means that you were not feeling well enough to continue working. This implies that your health was affected in some way, which suggests option A (headache) as the correct answer."
"Response: 
If the puppy soiled the carpet, it probably made a mistake. 
In this case, option B is more appropriate because giving the puppy a treat would be a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  
Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: The owner gave the puppy a treat."
"Response: 
If we assume that my apology was sincere (which is not specified in the premise), then it's more likely that my friend would forgive me rather than become infuriated. Therefore, option A is a better choice.  

This type of question tests your ability to make logical deductions based on the information provided. It also requires you to consider the context and potential outcomes of different scenarios."
"Response: 
The man stood out in the crowd. 
He must have done something to stand out.

She wanted to blend in."
"Response:  If they were caught living here illegally, it follows that their presence was not authorized or legal. Therefore, option B - Deportation - is a much likelier outcome than Option A - Employment.  

This type of question assesses your ability to draw logical conclusions based on given information and make predictions about future events. It also tests your understanding of cause-and-effect relationships and your capacity for critical thinking."
"Response: 
If the public speaker cracked a joke, it means they said something funny. 
And if they said something funny, it's likely that people would laugh. 
So option A - ""The audience laughed"" - is the correct answer.  "
"Response: 
If you look directly at the sun without any protection, it would be very bright and could potentially cause damage to your eyes or even temporary blindness (option A). On the other hand, if you were to look at the sun with no protection for an extended period of time, it might not have a significant impact on your skin (option B). Therefore, option A is the most likely outcome."
"Response: 
If you were feeling bored, it's unlikely that you would snort. Snorting is a sudden, forceful expulsion of air through your nose, often accompanied by a loud noise. It's not something you do when you're feeling bored; it's usually associated with laughter or amusement. Therefore, option A (I snorted) is less likely than option B (I yawned). So, the correct answer is B."
Response:  If the steak was raw (option B), it would be soft and not hard to cut. Therefore, option B is less likely the correct answer. On the other hand, if the knife was dull (option A), it would also be difficult to cut the steak. So, option A is a better fit for the premise.
"Response: 
If she had received alimony payments, it would have been mentioned in the premise. 
Therefore, option A is unlikely. 
On the other hand, if she acquired massive debt, it could be a reason for declaring bankruptcy. 
So, option B is more plausible.  
Conclusion: Option B - She acquired massive debt."
"Response: 
If the lights are on, it means someone is home. So option A is incorrect because there's no need to wonder whether or not he's out. Option B makes more sense since we know for sure that he's home. Therefore, the correct answer is option B - decide to pay him a visit."
Response:  If I put the flower under my nose, then it's more likely that I would pick up its scent rather than have the petals come off. So option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The woman felt nostalgic, so she must have been thinking about something from her past. 
What might that be? 
Perhaps it was a happy memory of her childhood or a special event. 
In that case, running into a childhood friend (option A) would make sense as a way to relive those memories. 
On the other hand, yelling at her children (option B) doesn't fit with the idea of nostalgia or reliving happy memories. 
So, option A is the more likely choice."
Response:  If he procrastinated, it means that he waited until the last minute to do the work. Therefore, option B (he submitted the paper incomplete) is more likely than option A (he submitted the paper early).
Response:  If my car broke down, it means that I can no longer use it to go anywhere. Therefore, going to the mall (option A) is not possible because I have no transportation. The only option left is calling a mechanic (option B). So, the most likely effect based on the premise is option B - I called a mechanic.
"Response: 
If it was anonymous, then there would be no reason to discard it. 
So option A is less likely. 
On the other hand, if it was illegible, then it wouldn't make sense to keep it either. 
Therefore, option B is more plausible.  
Conclusion: The correct answer is Option B - It was illegible."
"Response: 
The bird flapped its wings. 
This means it moved them downward. 
So option A (laid eggs) doesn't make sense because birds don't lay eggs with their wings.  
That leaves us with option B (ascended upwards). 
It's much more likely that a bird would fly upwards after flapping its wings than do something completely unrelated like laying eggs."
Response:  If the garage was open, then it wasn't full. So option A is less likely than option B. Therefore, option B (The garage was full) is the correct answer.
"Response: 
If the criminal aims the gun at his victim, it means he wants to shoot him. 
So, option A (the criminal putting down the gun) is less likely than option B (the victim putting his hands up). 
Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  If you look forward to something, it means that you anticipate a positive experience or outcome.  In this case, attending an uncle's funeral would not be considered a positive experience. Therefore, option B (attending a friend's wedding) is more likely.
"Response: 
If you were nauseous, wouldn't that have been your first clue that time had passed? 
So option B is less likely. 
Therefore, option A - daydreaming - is a better fit for the premise."
"Response:  If there were no paper, we would not have a physical copy of the document to examine. Therefore, option B is incorrect. 
The only remaining option is option A - the printer was low on ink. This is the most likely cause because if there isn't enough ink, the printing will be faint or blurry, making it difficult to read."
"Response: 
If the stadium played the national anthem, it means that there was a formal event happening, like a sports game or a concert. 
In this case, option A is more likely because when people hear the national anthem, they usually stand up out of respect for their country.  
So, option A - ""The fans turned to the flag"" - is the correct answer."
Response:  If the dip tasted bland, then it probably needed some seasoning. Option B states that I put salt in it. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
If the paper towel absorbed the liquid, there would be no sticky residue. 
Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  If she had to stop reading because someone interrupted her, it means that she didn't finish what she was doing. Therefore, option B (reread the book) makes more sense than option A (bookmarked her page).  
So, the correct answer is B - She reread the book."
Response:  If there was turbulence, it would be safer to fasten your seatbelt. So option A is a better choice than option B.
"Response: 
The boy flinched because he was startled or scared of something. 
If it were Option A, the girl would have ignored him, but instead she poked him. 
Therefore, option B is the correct answer.  2019-05-30 14:46:07 UTC"
"Response:  If they gave the patient an artificial limb, that means she didn't have a real one anymore. Therefore, option A - ""They amputated her leg"" - is the correct answer."
"Response: 
If the boy pinched the girl's elbow, it means he touched her without her consent. This could be considered a form of physical harassment or assault. In this case, option B (She jerked her arm away from him) is more likely because she would want to distance herself from his unwanted touching. Option A (She shrugged her shoulders at him) does not convey that same sense of discomfort or resistance."
"Response: 
If you ask someone for advice, it means that you value their opinion. 
Therefore, option A is correct.  
So, if your friend gave you advice, it's because they had valuable insights or expertise in the matter at hand. 
In this case, it's unlikely that you already knew everything there is to know about the subject and didn't need any advice. 
Hence, option B is less likely."
Response:  If the boy stepped in mud, it's more likely that the mud would stick to his shoes rather than hitting him in the face. Therefore, option A is a better choice.
Response:  If schools shut down, that means people don't have to go outside. That reduces the need for hiding underground. So option A (Schools shut down) is more likely than option B (People hid underground).
"Response: 
If his shift ended, he would go home, right? So Option A makes sense here.  "
"Response:  If a tree fell onto the roof, it would be very unlikely that the damage to the house would be limited to just one area. It would probably cause significant structural damage throughout the entire house. Therefore, option A is less plausible than option B. Option B is more likely because the damage could have been caused by the tree's roots or branches growing too close to the foundation of the house.  

Conclusion:  Based on the given information, option B - ""The tree shaded the backyard"" - is the most likely cause of the damage to the house."
"Response: 
If we assume that the wood split in half, it means that there was a force applied to the wood that caused it to break apart. 
Now, if we look at option A, ""I stacked the wood in the fireplace,"" this action does not involve any force being applied to the wood, so it is unlikely that this action caused the wood to split in half. 
On the other hand, option B, ""I swung the axe down to the wood,"" involves applying a significant amount of force to the wood with an axe, which could potentially cause the wood to split in half. Therefore, based on the premise, option B is a more likely cause for the wood splitting in half than option A."
Response:  If the couple had just gotten married, it would be unlikely for them to announce their separation so soon after the wedding. Therefore, option A (The couple announced that they were separating) is less likely. On the other hand, if the couple had been trying to conceive for some time without success, receiving congratulations from their families might be bittersweet for them. In this case, option B (The couple announced that they were having a baby) is more plausible. So, the correct answer is option B.
"Response: 
If she liked him, she would have sent him a Valentine's Day card. But if she kissed him, she might not need to send a card because their lips are already speaking volumes! Therefore, option B (She kissed him) is less likely than option A (She likes him)."
"Response: 
My friend made a statement, so it must be true. 
Therefore, option B is correct - I agreed with him."
"Response: 
If they were trying to find a compromise, it would suggest that they have different preferences or opinions. 
In this case, they might be looking for a middle ground that works for both parties.  
Therefore, option A (They wanted to find a compromise) is more plausible than option B (They wanted to make a fair decision).  
So, the correct answer is A."
"Response:  If the timer went off in the kitchen, it means that something was cooking or baking.  Since we are considering two options here, let's look at each option separately.  
Option A: Unloading groceries from the fridge doesn't make sense because there is no connection between the timer going off and unloading groceries. Therefore, this option can be eliminated as less likely to happen next.  
Option B: Taking the pizza out of the oven makes much more sense since the timer going off could indicate that the pizza is done baking. So, Option B is a more likely outcome than Option A."
"Response: 
If she set an ambitious goal, it means that she wanted to achieve something big. 
And if she slacked off, then she wouldn't have achieved her goal. 
So option A doesn't make sense here. 
On the other hand, if she worked hard, then she would have been more likely to achieve her goal. 
Therefore, option B makes more sense.  
Conclusion:  Option B is correct."
"Response: 
If the son inherited his father's fortune, he would not have gotten into legal trouble. Therefore, option B is less likely. Option A is more plausible because if the son inherited a large amount of money, it could lead to legal troubles or other negative consequences for him. So, the correct answer is option A."
"Response: 
If the woman stomped on the flames, it would extinguish them (Option A). Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.  "
Response:  If her car was in the shop, it means she couldn't drive it. So option A (her driver's license was revoked) doesn't make sense because that wouldn't prevent her from driving another car. Option B (she got in a car accident) is therefore more likely.
Response:  If I slept through my alarm, it means that I overslept and woke up later than I intended to. Therefore, option B (I missed breakfast) is more likely.
"Response: 
The public figure got out of the limousine. 
This means he was inside it before. 
So, option B is correct!  "
"Response:  If the woman lingers in the bathtub, then she must be enjoying herself. Therefore, it is more likely that the bathwater will become lukewarm (Option A).  
So, the correct answer is Option A: The bathwater became lukewarm."
"Response: 
The college student wants to meet other students on campus. 
Joining a fraternity would give him an opportunity to do so. 
Therefore, option A (joining a fraternity) is the correct answer.  "
"Response: 
If you were looking for loose change, why would you lift up the couch cushions? 
That doesn't make sense. 
So, option B - rearranging the living room - makes much more sense!"
"Response: 
The wasp flew toward the boy. 
This implies that the wasp had some intention or purpose in flying toward the boy. 
It could be to sting him or to communicate with him. 
Since we don't know the intentions of the wasp, it's better not to run away (Option A).  
Therefore, option B - picking a flower - is more appropriate because it shows curiosity rather than fear."
Response:  If she was found guilty of a misdemeanor, it means that her crime wasn't very serious. Therefore, option A (community service) is more likely than option B (death row).
Response:  If we stir sugar into hot tea, then what happens to the sugar?  It melts! So the correct answer is option B: The sugar dissolves.  
Response:  If he was drafted for the war, it means that he went through training before being sent to fight. This would have been a long process, during which his injury could have occurred. Therefore, option A (he was drafted for the war) is less likely than option B (he was injured in battle). So, the correct answer is option B.
Response:  If the criminal ran away from the police, it means that they are not with the victim anymore. So, option A (the police attended to the victim) is less likely. Option B (the police chased the criminal) is more likely because if someone runs away from the police, they need to be caught!  
"Response: 
If the laptop wouldn't turn on, then we can conclude that there was a power issue. 
So option B - charging - makes more sense as the cause than option A - dropping. 
Therefore, the correct answer is option B."
Response:  If she ran out of space in her closet, it means that she already had a lot of clothes. Therefore, option A (She acquired an extensive wardrobe) is more plausible than option B (She folded her laundry).
"Response:  If his wife gave birth, it would be a happy occasion for both of them.  It doesn't fit with ""the man was heartbroken."" Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response: 
The man got a degree to qualify for the job he wanted. 
If he already has the degree, it means that he is now qualified for the job. 
Therefore, option A (He became qualified for the job he wanted) is the correct answer.  "
Response:  If he was speaking to the audience, it would be option A. But if he was using a microphone, that would mean his voice was amplified, so we should choose option B. Therefore, the correct answer is option B - He spoke into the microphone.
Response:  If the coin sunk to the bottom, it would be hard to break in half. Therefore, option B (the coin broke in half) is more likely.
Response:  If the ball went into the hole, then it would no longer be in front of the player. Therefore, option B (the ball retreated back to the player) is more likely.  
"Response: 
If I breathed in the dust in the attic, it means that some of the dust entered my lungs. 
When something enters your lungs, it can cause an allergic reaction or irritation, leading to a cough or a sneeze. 
So, option B (I sneezed) is more likely than option A (I hiccuped).  
Therefore, the correct answer is option B - I sneezed."
"Response: 
If the customer had used counterfeit money, wouldn't he have been arrested or detained right away instead of being summoned to the office? It seems unlikely that the store would call security for something as serious as counterfeiting without taking immediate action. Therefore, option A is less likely.  
On the other hand, if the customer left his headlights on, it could be a minor issue that doesn't require calling security. However, it's possible that the store has strict policies about disruptive behavior or distractions, in which case calling security might make sense. So, option B is more plausible."
Response:  If you took the garbage out, it means that you put something in the garbage can.  What could have been thrown away to make the kitchen smell bad?  Food waste or spoiled food would be a good guess. Therefore, option A is more likely the correct cause.
Response:  If we assume that the family went to the zoo, it's unlikely that the children would be chasing the animals because zoos are designed for people to observe animals in a safe environment. Therefore, option A (the children admired the animals) is more likely than option B (the children chased the animals).
Response:  If his breathing was loud, it means he has a lot of mucus in his respiratory tract, which indicates that his lungs are congested. Therefore, option B is more likely.
"Response:  If I have an extra ticket, it means that I am not using it myself. So, option B makes sense because I would ask someone else if they are interested in going instead of asking for directions. Therefore, the most likely effect is option B - ""I asked my friend if he was interested in going."""
Response:  If the air conditioner broke, it means that the room was too hot before.  Opening the window would make the room even hotter! So option B (opened the windows) is less likely to happen compared to option A (brought out blankets).  
Response:  If his backpack were heavy, wouldn't he feel tired in his arms as well?  So option B doesn't make sense here. Therefore, option A is correct!
"Response: 
If it were Option A, we would expect to hear that ""I baked her a cake"" as part of the main clause, not as a separate sentence. So, let's eliminate Option A.  
The correct answer is Option B: It was her birthday."
Response:  If a bee had stung the gardener, it would not have caused the destruction of the daffodils. Therefore, option A is less likely. On the other hand, squirrels digging up the bulbs could definitely destroy the daffodils. So, option B is more likely.
"Response: 
If I struck the match, then there must have been some fuel present to support combustion. 
So it's more likely that the match produced a flame rather than the flame fading out. 
Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
"Response:  If they didn't want to debate in court, that would mean they were avoiding litigation costs and attorney fees.  That doesn't seem like a strong enough reason for them to settle. So option A is less likely.  
On the other hand, if they wanted to repair their personal relationship, it makes sense because they might have been estranged or had a falling out before the dispute arose. In this case, resolving the dispute could be a way of mending fences and restoring their relationship. Therefore, option B is more plausible."
Response:  If their parents died, they wouldn't be able to send them away. So option A is less likely. Option B makes more sense because if their parents spoiled them, they might have decided to send them away for better discipline and upbringing. Therefore, option B is a more plausible reason why the children were sent to an orphanage.
"Response: 
A meteorite landing in the ocean would cause a huge splash and create massive waves that could potentially trigger a tsunami. Therefore, option A (tsunami) is more likely than option B (hail)."
Response:  If she encountered a poisonous snake, it would be reasonable to assume that she might become frightened or panicked (option B). However, if she became dehydrated (option A), it would not necessarily follow from the premise that she encountered a poisonous snake. Therefore, option B is the better choice.
"Response: 
If the oven became hot, then it must have been turned on. 
Therefore, option A is the correct answer.  "
"Response: 
If we squeeze a lemon, it will release juice from inside. So option B is correct - the lemon squirted."
"Response: 
If a country discovers new land, it would be eager to explore and utilize this newly found resource. Therefore, option B - The country colonized the land - is more likely than option A - The country abandoned the land.  
This answer choice is correct because discovering new land often leads to exploration and settlement rather than abandonment."
Response:  If the glass toppled off the table, it would be most likely that it fell onto the floor because tables don't have laundry on them! So option A is the correct answer.
Response:  If the floor were slippery, wouldn't we expect the table to slide or move around instead of just wobbling? So Option B is less likely. Therefore, Option A - the floor being uneven - is a better explanation for why the table wobbled.
"Response: 
If the father caught his son lying, it means that he was not telling the truth earlier. So, in this case, option B - ""The father trusted his son"" - is less likely to happen because if the father had trusted him, he wouldn't have been caught lying. Therefore, option A - ""His son confessed the truth"" - is a more likely outcome."
"Response: 
Cough syrup is for a cough, so it won't help his headache. 
Aspirin will reduce inflammation and relieve pain, so option B is correct!"
Response:  If the train was running behind schedule, it would not be slowing down as it approaches the station. Therefore, option B (It was running behind schedule) is less likely to be true compared to option A (It was approaching the station). So, the correct answer is Option A: It was approaching the station.
"Response: 
If mental illness runs in the man's family, it could be a contributing factor to his depression. However, being that he sought therapy suggests that he may have been dealing with other issues as well. Therefore, option A (mental illness running in the family) is not necessarily the most likely cause of the man's depression. Option B (being diagnosed with depression) is a more direct cause and fits better with the information provided. So, the correct answer is option B."
Response:  If she was eating something and then suddenly clutches her throat, it's more likely that she choked on whatever she was eating rather than simply swallowing it. Therefore, option B (She choked on her food) is a better fit for this scenario.
Response:  If she has a sore throat, it would be difficult for her to speak clearly or make sounds properly. Therefore, option A (her voice sounded raspy) is more likely than option B (she spoke with an accent).
Response:  If the dog wants to get that tasty steak, it would have to do something to get it. Option B doesn't make sense because there's no reason for the dog to lay down when what it really wants is food! So option A makes much more sense - the dog will drool in anticipation of getting that yummy steak.  
"Response: 
If the woman's business succeeded, it means she made a profit. 
Profit usually leads to wealth. 
Therefore, option B (She became wealthy) is more likely than option A (She fired her employees).  "
Response:  If the students exited the classroom, it means that either the bell rang or the teacher assigned homework. However, we know that if the bell rang, the students would not have been assigned homework. Therefore, option B (the teacher assigned homework) is the most likely cause of the students exiting the classroom.
"Response: 
If someone claims they see a ghost, it's unlikely that their acquaintances will express skepticism because seeing a ghost is not something common or rational. Instead, they are more likely to relate to her experience. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  If he lost his hearing, it means that something caused him to lose his ability to hear.  Option B suggests that he was nearly killed in an explosion, but we don't know if being near an explosion would necessarily cause someone to lose their hearing.  On the other hand, option A suggests that he nearly drowned in the ocean, which could potentially cause hearing loss due to water pressure or other factors. Therefore, based on the premise, option A is a more plausible explanation for why the man lost his hearing.
Response:  If the child let go of the balloon string, then there is no longer any force holding it down. Therefore, option B is more likely - the balloon will rise into the air.
"Response: 
If he had a stroke, it would be very unlikely that he could still breathe normally. Therefore, option A is less likely. On the other hand, if he took a deep breath, it would not affect his ability to speak. So, option B is also less likely. Based on the information provided, there is no clear answer. We need more details or context to determine the most likely cause of the man's inability to speak."
Response:  If she heard her name being called, wouldn't she have stopped to listen instead of continuing walking? Therefore option B is less likely. Option A is more plausible because it could be easy for someone to trip over cracks without noticing them until after they fall. So the correct answer is option A - there was a crack in the cement.
Response:  If the man did a cannonball into the pool, he would have gone underwater.  And if he went underwater, then he would have gotten wet.  Therefore, option B (The man soaked the lifeguard) is more likely than option A (The lifeguard jumped in after him).
Response:  If I took antibiotics, then my infection should have cleared up, right? So option A is the correct answer.
"Response:  If the traffic light turned yellow, it means that the light will soon turn red.  So, option A (the driver pushed the brake) makes more sense than option B (the driver honked his horn).  
Therefore, the correct answer is option A."
"Response:  If we start with a plastic container that has melted, it means that heat was applied to the container.  Since Option B involves placing the container on a hot stove, this option is more likely the correct cause of the melting.  
Therefore, the answer is Option B - I placed the container on the hot stove."
Response:  If the driver ran a red light, wouldn't he have been going pretty fast? And if he was going that fast, how could he possibly get dented from hitting a telephone pole? That doesn't make sense. Therefore, option B (the driver ran a red light) is less likely than option A (the driver hit a telephone pole).  
Response:  If he studied all night, it means that he prepared for the exam well. So, option B (He passed the exam) is more likely to happen than option A (He skipped the exam).
"Response: 
The fact that the boy is clinging to the edge of the pool suggests he may be afraid of water or learning how to swim. Therefore, option A (he fears learning to swim) is a better explanation for his behavior than option B (the lifeguard is on duty)."
"Response: 
If I put my hand to my chest, then I would feel my heartbeat. 
Therefore, option A is correct.  "
Response:  If there is a building under construction next door, it will be noisy (Option B). Therefore, option B is more likely than option A.
Response:  To get to know someone better, it helps to spend time with them in a relaxed setting where you can talk and share experiences.  Dinner at home would be a great way to do this! Therefore, option A (the family inviting the neighbors over for dinner) is the most effective choice.
"Response:  If water splashed up from the pool, then something must have disturbed the water surface.  Since the two options are a diver and someone floating, it is more likely that option A is correct - the swimmer dove into the pool.  
Therefore, answer A is the correct choice."
"Response: 
If I bit into a slice of watermelon, then it's likely that some juice from the watermelon entered my mouth as well. 
So, option B (chipped tooth) is less likely because watermelon juice wouldn't cause me to chip my tooth. 
On the other hand, option A (swallowing a seed) is more likely since seeds are present in watermelon and it's easy to accidentally swallow one while eating. 
Therefore, the correct answer is Option A - I accidentally swallowed a seed."
Response:  If his jacket was zipped, he wouldn't have fallen. So option A is incorrect. Therefore, option B must be correct - his shoelaces were untied!
"Response: 
If she had been distracted by noise, would she have put earplugs in? No, that doesn't make sense. If there were loud noises around, putting in earplugs wouldn't help much. It's more likely that... (pause)...she got her ears pierced! Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
Response:  If I refilled my water bottle, then there must have been some water already inside of it before I refilled it. So, option A (I drank all the water in it) cannot be true because if I had drunk all the water in it, there would not have been any left to refill! Therefore, option B (I kept it in the fridge) is the correct answer.
"Response: 
If the TV show was censored, it must have contained something that needed to be censored. 
That ""something"" could be either vulgar language or a complicated plot. 
However, we know that the TV show was censored for a specific reason, so let's consider what might be more likely to require censorship.  
Of the two options, Option A (vulgar language) seems more plausible than Option B (a complicated plot). 
Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
Response:  If the ship wrecked, then it means that the ship sank or crashed into something. This implies that the crew might have drowned. Therefore, option A is more likely.  
"Response: 
If he was stumped, it means that he didn't solve the riddle yet. 
Therefore, option B is more appropriate.  "
"Response: 
If the phone rang, it means someone was calling him. 
So, he would pick up the phone to answer it. 
Therefore, option B is correct.  
The most likely outcome based on the premise is that the man picked up the phone."
"Response: 
If the woman was staring at you, it's unlikely that you would feel comfortable hugging her without knowing why she was staring or what her intentions are. Therefore, option B (I felt uncomfortable) is a more likely outcome than option A (I hugged her)."
Response:  If they left the museum, it means that they have already seen all the exhibits. Therefore, option B (They viewed all the exhibits) is not a valid choice because we know that they have already done so. Option A (They took pictures of the exhibits) is the only remaining possibility since taking pictures after viewing something implies that you have already seen it. So, the correct answer is option A - They took pictures of the exhibits.
"Response: 
If my friend introduced me to the man, it means they are familiar with him. 
In that case, why would my friend stand up for me instead of introducing us? 
Therefore, option A is less likely. 
On the other hand, if my friend stood up for me, it means they know me well enough to defend me against someone who is being rude or aggressive towards me. 
This makes option B more likely.  
So, the correct answer is option B: My friend stood up for me."
Response:  If the tire was flat, it means there wasn't enough air in it to support the weight of the rider and the bike. So, if we want to fix the problem, adding more air to the tire would be a better solution than switching gears. Therefore, option A (I pumped air into the tire) is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The girl looked pale, so it must mean she was feeling unwell or sick. 
Her father would be concerned about her health, so he would feel her forehead to check for fever. 
Therefore, option B is more likely."
Response:  If the pen ran out of ink, then we can't use it to sign our name. So option B is not possible. Therefore, option A - using a pencil - is the most likely outcome.
Response:  If he was in debt, it would be less likely that he would start a business because starting a business requires capital, and if he doesn't have enough money to pay off his existing debts, how can he afford to invest in a new venture? Therefore, option B (He started a business) is less likely than option A (He was in debt).
Response:  If she had chicken pox, wouldn't she be in bed resting instead of staying at home to learn math? Therefore, option B is a better fit for this scenario - she enjoyed learning math.
"Response: 
If the trash bag was full, then taking it to the dumpster would be a reasonable thing to do. Therefore, option A is the most likely effect."
Response:  If my roommate spilled punch, that would leave a stain or discoloration on the carpet. But if my dog shed hair, it might create a thin layer of fur on top of the carpet. So option B is more likely.
"Response: 
The man lost his temper, so he probably did something impulsive. 
Throwing a chair across the room is an impulsive action that requires physical strength and anger. 
On the other hand, turning off the computer doesn't require much effort or anger. 
Therefore, option B (He threw a chair across the room) is more likely than option A (He turned off his computer)."
"Response: 
If the girl threw a twig into the campfire, it would add fuel to the fire, making it bigger and brighter. Therefore, option A (the twig burned) is the correct answer."
"Response: 
If there were no hot water, he wouldn't have taken a shower in the first place. So option A can be eliminated as it doesn't make sense. Therefore, option B is the most likely cause - he couldn't find a towel after taking a shower."
"Response:  If the parents want their kids to go to college, they will probably encourage them to study hard and get good grades in high school so that they can be accepted into a good university.  Therefore, option A (setting aside a savings fund) makes more sense than option B (encouraging playing outside).  
So, the correct answer is A."
"Response: 
The man unlaced his shoes. This means he undid the laces that held them tight. So, what happens to the shoes now? They become loose! Therefore, option A - the shoes loosened - is the correct answer."
Response:  If he ate half of the entree, then there are no leftovers to be refrigerated. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is correct because if he ate half of the entree, it means that he enjoyed the food so much that he wants to save the recipe for future use or reference.
Response:  If my ankle is swollen, then putting ice on it would be a better option than rubbing lotion on it because ice reduces inflammation. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.
Response:  If my office door was open, then it's more likely that I would have been talking to my colleague at my desk (option A). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.  
Response:  If you had to wait in line, it means that you were waiting for something or someone before being able to take your seat. Therefore, option A (I took a seat) doesn't make sense because you would have already taken your seat if you were waiting in line. Option B (I skimmed a magazine) makes more sense since you might do something while waiting in line like reading a magazine. So, the correct answer is option B.
Response:  If the man swatted at the fly, it would be most likely that the fly...buzzed away! Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"Response: 
If he were dying, it would be unlikely that he could write a will. 
Therefore, option A is less likely. 
On the other hand, if he were a widower, it is possible that he has assets to distribute and wants to make sure they go to his desired beneficiaries after his death. Therefore, option B is more likely."
"Response:  If the runner senses a competitor gaining on him, it means he wants to win the race. Therefore, option B - He sped up his pace - is the most logical choice because it aligns with his desire to win.  
So, the correct answer is Option B."
Response:  If we assume that the person thought carefully about the problem, it's more likely that they came up with a solution (option B). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"Response: 
The traveler walks on a shaky suspension bridge. This implies that he may feel insecure or afraid of falling. Therefore, option A (he felt terrified) is more plausible than option B (he felt ecstatic)."
"Response: 
If he anticipated their victory, it means that he expected them to win. 
So, option B makes more sense because if he expects them to win, then he must have placed a bet on them.  
Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: He made a bet with his friends."
"Response: 
If he can't sleep, it means that he is awake. 
So setting an alarm clock won't help him to sleep. 
On the other hand, counting sheep might make him drowsy. 
Therefore, option B (counted sheep) is a more plausible effect."
