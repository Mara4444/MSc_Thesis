Therefore, if she had initially had x vacuum cleaners, she would have sold 3x/4 vacuum cleaners in the green house and 2x vacuum cleaners in the red house. Since she still has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (3x/4) = 5

Solving for x, we get:

"Response: 

解釋:  This is a classic problem of solving for the remaining distance in a journey. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mary walked for 1 hour and covered 4 miles (4 x 0.62 = 2.52 miles per hour).
2. She then walked for another 1 hour and covered 2 miles (2 x 0.62 = 1.24 miles per hour).
3. To find her average speed over the entire journey, we need to add up all the distances she covered and divide by the total time taken:

Distance = 2.52 + 1.24 = 3.76 miles
Time = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

Average Speed = Distance / Time = 3.76 / 2 = 1.88 miles per hour

So, if Mary wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to cover the remaining distance of:

Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Covered Distance = 12 - 3.76 = 8.24 miles

Therefore, Mary needs to walk at a speed of approximately 9.76 miles per hour (8.24 miles / 0.82 hours) to reach her destination within the given time frame."

解釋:  This is a classic brain teaser that requires you to use your understanding of numbers and proportions to solve the problem. The clues given in the question are:

* ""米什卡买了 3 条短裤"" (Mishka bought 3 shorts)
* ""3 条长裤"" (3 long pants)
* ""3 双鞋"" (3 pairs of shoes)
* ""短裤每条 16.50 美元"" (Shorts cost $16.50 each)
* ""长裤每条 22.50 美元"" (Long pants cost $22.50 each)
* ""鞋子每双 42 美元"" (Shoes cost $42 per pair)

To find out how much Mishka spent on all these clothes, we need to multiply the number of items she bought by their respective prices. So, for the shorts, it's 3 x $16.50 = $49.50; for the long pants, it's 3 x $22.50 = $67.50; and for the shoes, it's 3 x $42 = $126. Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $242."

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice creams Xiangxia buys each day and then calculate the total cost over 60 days. Since there are 15 ice creams in each box and each ice cream costs $4.00, Xiangxia buys 15 x 60 = 900 ice creams in total over 60 days. Therefore, the total cost of ice cream for Xiangxia is 900 x $4.00 = $3,600."

解釋:  This is a classic brain teaser that requires you to think creatively and consider the problem from different angles. The answer is not straightforward because it's not about how much money Lao Erde makes per week, but rather how he can sell all 252 eggs every day.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. Sell them directly to customers: If Lao Erde sells each egg for $2, he will make $2 x 252 = $504 per week.
2. Sell them to wholesalers: Lao Erde could also sell his eggs to wholesalers who will then resell them to retail stores or restaurants. Let's assume he gets $1.80 per egg (which is a common price range for wholesale eggs). If he sells 252 eggs per day, he will make $1.80 x 252 = $439 per week.
3. Use them for other purposes: Lao Erde could use some of his eggs for personal consumption or as gifts, which would reduce the number of eggs available for sale. Alternatively, he could hatch chicks and raise new birds to increase his flock, which would require additional resources such as feed and housing.

In summary, while the question seems simple at first glance, there are actually several factors to consider when calculating how much money Lao Erde makes per week from his egg-laying business."

根據問題, bridge's maximum weight limit is 5,000 pounds. The truck's empty weight is 3,755 pounds, and the driver's weight is unknown. To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the truck's empty weight from the bridge's maximum weight limit. This gives us a total weight of 5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 pounds available for loading boxes. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 1,245 / 15 = 83 boxes. Therefore, the answer is 83 boxes."

1. 从覆盆子树丛中计算出的 120 颗覆盆子中，取出 6 簇覆盆子（每簇 20 颗），得到 6 x 20 = 120 颗覆盆子。
2. 从整个覆盆子树丛中找到散落着的 67 颗覆盆子。

解釋:  This is a classic lateral thinking puzzle. The information given in the problem statement does not directly reveal the age of Jake. To solve this puzzle, we need to use our reasoning skills and think creatively.
The problem states that Emily has four children named Emily, Jack, Corey, and James. We know that Emily is older than Jack by five years, and Jack is younger than Corey by two years. Therefore, Jack must be aged between 8 and 10 years old (inclusive).
Now, let's consider James. According to the problem statement, James is 10 years old, which means he is one year older than Corey. However, if James is one year older than Corey, then James must be aged 11 years old (not 10 years old).
Therefore, the ages of the four siblings are:
Emily - 30 years old (given)
Jack - 8-10 years old (from the problem statement)
Corey - 7-9 years old (from the problem statement)
James - 11 years old (from the problem statement)"

解釋:  This is a classic brain teaser that requires you to use your knowledge of percentages and ratios to solve the problem. The question states that Lee completed the 400 meters hurdle race in 38 seconds before Jerry changed his diet habits, which resulted in an improvement of 10%. To find out how many seconds Jerry would need to complete the same race after making these changes, we can use the following calculation:

New time = (Original time x Percentage improvement) / 100

In this case, the original time was 38 seconds, and the percentage improvement was 10%. So, if we plug these values into the formula above, we get:

New time = (38 x 10)/100 = 38 + 3.8 = 41.8 seconds

Therefore, the answer is 41.8 seconds."

Wave's portion = (1 - 4/5) x 1,000 = 200 pieces
Mother's portion = 3/5 x 1,000 = 600 pieces
Total number of pieces left = 200 + 600 = 800 pieces

根據問題, 玛舍勒和毕翠克丝吃了多少个水果卷。

From the problem statement, we know that 玛舍勒 and 毕翠克丝 are competing to see who can eat down the most fruit rolls. Let's assume that they both start with an equal number of fruit rolls (let's call it x).

After 玛舍勒 eats a fruit roll, she has x - 1 left. Similarly, after 毕翠克丝 eats a fruit roll, she has x - 2 left. Since there are 24 fruit rolls long and 14 fruit rolls wide for each of them, we can calculate their progress as follows:

玛舍勒: x - 1 = 24x / 14
毕翠克丝: x - 2 = 24x / 14

Now, let's find the average number of fruit rolls they have eaten by dividing the total number of fruit rolls they have eaten by the number of times they have eaten them:

average = (24x / 14) + (24x / 14) = 56x / 28

Since 玛舍勒 and 毕翠克丝 did not finish all the fruit rolls, the answer is 0."

解釋:  This is a classic problem of profit maximization. The seller has 10 pieces of 2x4 wood that cost $10 each and 5 pieces of 4x4 wood that cost $16 each. To find the maximum profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost.
The total revenue = Number of pieces x Price per piece
= 10 x $10 + 5 x $16
= $100 + $80
= $180

The total cost = Number of pieces x Cost per piece
= 10 x $10 + 5 x $16
= $100 + $80
= $180

Since the total revenue is equal to the total cost, the seller will not make any profit if they sell all the wood at the given prices. Therefore, the answer is ""none""."

1. The price of watermelon is three times the price of chili peppers. So, if the price of chili peppers is $x, then the price of watermelon is $3x.
2. The price of oranges is less than the price of watermelons by $5. So, if the price of watermelons is $x, then the price of oranges is $x - $5.
3. Di Long wants to buy 4 watermelons, 20 chili peppers, and 10 oranges. So, the total cost of these items is:

Total cost = 4(3x) + 20x - 10($x - $5)
= 12x + 10x - 50
= 22x

Therefore, Di Long will have to pay $22 for all these fruits."

Each animal has a different requirement for bananas per month: monkeys need 200 bananas, gorillas need 400 bananas, and lemurs need 100 bananas. To find out how many bananas the manager needs to buy, we can multiply each animal's requirement by the number of months between purchases (i.e., 2). So, the total number of bananas needed is:

Monkeys x 2 = 400 bananas
Gorillas x 2 = 800 bananas
Lemurs x 2 = 200 bananas
Total = 1,400 bananas

Therefore, the manager needs to buy 1,400 bananas every two months to feed all the animals in the zoo."

If she handles them herself, her available time for freelance work will decrease by 3 hours per week, resulting in a loss of $35 per hour. The cost of hiring an accountant is $90. To determine how much money she will gain by hiring an accountant, we need to subtract the cost from the potential benefit.

解釋:  This is a classic brain teaser that requires you to think creatively and use units of measurement correctly. The problem states that Pan Jia walks 20 miles per day, except on weekends when he walks 10 miles. To find out how many miles Pan Jia walks in a week, we need to convert the daily distance from miles to kilometers (since the problem doesn't specify the unit of measurement for the weekly total). There are 1.60934 kilometers in a mile, so Pan Jia walks approximately 32.02 kilometers per day (20 miles x 1.60934 km/mile). On weekends, he walks 10 miles, which is equivalent to approximately 16.09 kilometers (10 miles x 1.60934 km/mile). Therefore, Pan Jia walks a total of approximately 48.11 kilometers in a week (32.02 km/day + 16.09 km/weekend)."

* 抵押贷款：500美元 x 12 = 6000美元/year
Total monthly repayment amount for all debts = 3600 + 2400 + 6000 = 11000美元/month
Therefore, if Jesse wants to pay off her debts by 50% more than the minimum payment each month, she will need to pay an additional 5500美元/month (11000 - 5500 = 5500)."

解釋:  According to the problem, Juan and Carlos sell each batch of lemonade for $0.50 per cup. They need to use $3 worth of lemons and $2 worth of sugar to make one batch. Since they can produce 20 cups from one batch, they will need to buy $60 worth of lemons ($3 x 20) and $40 worth of sugar ($2 x 20). Therefore, their total cost is $100. The profit they made is $25, which means they sold each cup of lemonade for more than it cost them to make it."

解釋:  This is a classic brain teaser that requires logical thinking and calculation skills. The problem states that Lawrence made $10 per hour as a math tutor and worked for either 5 or 8 hours in each of the two weeks. To find out how much he earned in total, we need to calculate his earnings for both weeks separately and then add them up. However, the problem does not provide any information about the number of days in each week, so we cannot directly use this formula to solve it. Instead, we need to use our reasoning skills to deduce the number of days in each week based on the given information. For example, if Lawrence worked 5 hours in the first week and 8 hours in the second week, then there must be 2 days in the first week and 4 days in the second week (since 5 + 8 = 13). Therefore, Lawrence earned $10 x 2 = $20 in the first week and $10 x 4 = $40 in the second week, for a total of $60."

根據問題, 珍比马克大 2 岁，意思是珍的actual age 是馬克的real age加2個years。而根據問題，馬克比讓的一半岁数大 5 岁，意思是馬克的real age是讓的age+5個years。因此，珍的actual age可以使用以下公式：

珍的 actual age = 馬克的 real age + (馬克的 age + 5) / 2

substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

珍的 actual age = 30 + (25 + 5) / 2
= 30 + 30 / 2
= 45 years old

Therefore, the answer is 45 years old."

根據問題，我们知道：
1. 每支队伍有 4 名队员。
2. 每位队员跑 400 米或绕着标准赛道跑一圈。
3. 第一位選手用 60 秒跑完 400 米的賽段，然後後面每位選手都比前一位選手快 3 秒。

因此，我們可以使用時間平均法來計算兩支队伍之間的差異。假設第一支队的每位队员跑完 400 米的賽段需要 x 秒，那麼第二支队的每位队员跑完 400 米的賽段需要：
x + (60 - 55) = 60 + 3 = 63 秒

因此，第二支队比第一支队更快，所以第二支队輸了 x - 63 秒。

答案：沒有。"

誤解：本题是一道非常簡單的推理题，但是因為提示中没有明确指出，禁止使用秸秆的地方是哪里，所以我們可以繼續進行推理。

 Solution: Since the problem doesn't specify which area of the store is not allowed to use twigs, we can assume that all areas are available for distribution. Therefore, the number of mice in each cage must be equal to the total number of mice divided by the number of cages.

Let's say there are x mice in total. If there are y cages, then the number of mice in each cage is x/y.

Since there are 160 twigs in total and each mouse gets 6 twigs, the total number of twigs is 160x.

Now, let's calculate the number of mice in each cage:

Number of mice in each cage = Total number of mice / Number of cages
= x/y

So, if there are 160 twigs in total and 3 cages with 6 mice each, then there must be 160/3 = 53 mice in each cage."

The problem states that John picked 3 hours of cherries, but it doesn't say how many minutes are in an hour. Therefore, we can't directly convert the time into number of cherries picked. Instead, we need to find out how many cherries John can pick in one minute, which is given as 2 cherries per minute. So, if John picked 3 hours of cherries, he picked 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour) x 2 cherries/minute = 120 cherries."

解釋:  This is a classic brain teaser that requires you to use logical reasoning and simple math to solve it. The problem states that Mark edits 1,000 sentences for two different publishers, and the publisher beta pays him twice as much as the publisher alpha pays him. To find out how much Mark earns per week, we need to multiply the number of sentences he edits by the price each publisher pays him. Since publisher alpha pays $5 per sentence, Mark earns $5 x 1,000 = $5,000 per week from publisher alpha. Similarly, since publisher beta pays twice as much as publisher alpha, Mark earns $5,000 x 2 = $10,000 per week from publisher beta. Therefore, Mark earns a total of $15,000 per week."

解釋:  This is a classic brain teaser that requires you to think creatively and use units correctly. The problem states that Balder fills 5 buckets of water in the morning and 6 buckets in the evening, but it doesn't specify how much water each bucket holds. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the total amount of water Balder fills per day by multiplying the number of buckets he fills by the volume of each bucket. Instead, we need to convert the volume of each bucket from ""buckets"" to ""cubic meters"" or some other unit of measurement that can be used to solve the problem. For example, if we assume that one bucket of water has a volume of 1 cubic meter (which is a reasonable assumption), then Balder fills 5 x 1 = 5 cubic meters of water in the morning and 6 x 1 = 6 cubic meters of water in the evening, for a total of 11 cubic meters of water filled per day."
